    <h2>  The concept of bracelets and watches </h2><p>  Let's start with a general description of why the devices described in this article are intended.  So, we all saw in some spy movie that the heroes had a clock that was able to receive calls, take pictures of something on the camera, and make various measurements of <span>biometric data.</span>  Today is all a reality!  In the nearest electronics store you can buy a gadget that can replace you with a smartphone that fits on your wrist. </p><p>  Of course, due to the small dimensions of the accessory, you should not expect that it will have the same functionality as can be seen with a 4-inch phone - the device is equipped with either a compact display that shows the time, or there is no screen on it at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for bracelets, the smart bracelet for Android is needed primarily as a for health application (designed to lead a healthy lifestyle).  At least the device‚Äôs functions include taking measurements of parameters such as the number of steps taken, calories burned, heart rate, sleep phase, and more.  All this, accordingly, synchronizes with your mobile phone and becomes available in graphical form.  In the future, the owner of the device can use his smart bracelet for Android, for example, to adjust his sports activities - the correct preparation of training programs, changing the length of the distance for running, swimming, and more. </p>

    <h2>  Functions </h2><p>  In general, talking about what such gadgets can do, you should add a few more options.  In particular, this is a measurement of the phases of sleep, the preparation of the correct program, according to which the user should sleep ‚Äúto the maximum‚Äù and feel better.  Another example is the creation of a full-fledged sports program of exercises and loads for the body.  In this case, the bracelet becomes your personal fitness trainer who knows best your body condition after passing the next set of exercises. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are many other opportunities aimed at a healthy lifestyle.  All of them are available in different models of devices, and this, in turn, is determined by the price category of the gadget.  There are simpler sports bracelets for Android that have the most important features (for example, the Xiaomi Mi Band for $ 15-20);  and there are more expensive (for example, Nike Fuelband SE for 120-150 dollars) devices that combine more features. </p><h2>  Synchronization </h2><p>  The main feature of most bracelets is the synchronization with the owner‚Äôs mobile phone or tablet.  A connection is made using the Bluetooth module built into the bracelet itself.  The ability to synchronize a smart bracelet for ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù or iOS allows, firstly, in a convenient way to read the received data according to the results of a daily training;  and, secondly, it expands the functionality.  For example, the Garmin Vivosmart model not only reads information about physical activity, but also signals when an incoming call arrives on the phone with which the bracelet is paired.  This option is convenient when your smartphone is in the ‚ÄúSilent‚Äù mode, but you would not want to miss an important call.  Bracelets, like smart watches on Android, allow you not to worry about it. </p>

    <h2>  Protection </h2><p>  Since the devices described in the article should always be on the hands of the owner, the question arises of their sufficient security to withstand daily tests that could harm the electronics.  For example, this applies to moisture and dust.  Firstly, the user of a watch or bracelet can wet his device when washing his hands or in the shower;  secondly, during physical exertion there is a risk of dripping sweat into the gadget's body.  To prevent damage to the device, manufacturers produce them in a suitably protected case, insulated on all sides with a rubber coating.  Due to this, almost every smart bracelet for fitness does not allow dust and moisture to pass through. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And the users themselves, making an accessory for sports, pay attention to the level of protection of the desired model.  If you want to buy a gadget that will not be afraid of contact with water, you should look for IP67 class in the technical specifications.  It means that the watch can be temporarily immersed in water, and also do not let dust and sand pass. </p>

    <h2>  Style </h2><p>  Since we are talking about accessories that are designed for daily use on the arm, an important issue when choosing a particular gadget is style.  Again, here it is necessary to proceed from the ratio of price and class of the device, as well as its type - is it just a sports fitness bracelet that can be equipped with a dark silicone strap;  or are we talking about a more expensive watch or an executive smart bracelet for Android.  In this case, the buyer‚Äôs goal is based on the choice - does he want the device to be exclusively practical;  or he needs a stylish gadget. </p><p>  For themselves, everyone should decide on this issue independently.  Again: manufacturers give the opportunity to do with a minimal set (for example, the FitBit Charge model belongs to such category of devices in which there is ‚Äúnothing superfluous‚Äù);  or, as in the case of Huawei TalkBone B2, it is important for the buyer that the accessory looks more elegant. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Finally, we must not forget about such a characteristic of any mobile gadget as autonomy.  She is responsible for the duration of the device without additional charge.  In particular, if we are talking about a smart bracelet (Oregon, Sony, Nike or Jawbone - regardless of model and manufacturer), a significant factor is how much it will work on its tiny battery.  And here there is already a direct relationship between the endurance of the device and its functions.  If your device has a screen (such as Samsung Gear Fit), it makes no sense to say that it will work longer than 4-5 days on a single charge.  Another thing is the less well-known Misfit Flash model, which does not work on a familiar battery, but on one-time batteries.  With them, the device is able to "live" up to 6 months!  True, there is no screen on it, the maximum is only light indicators on the diodes. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2>
      <br>

    <p>  In fact, in terms of their technical parameters, most bracelets are no different.  They can measure approximately the same parameters - the number of steps, the rhythm of the pulse, make an analytical calculation of some physical exercises, based on the number of waved hands.  It is clear that bracelets cannot go beyond this framework because of their structural features. </p><p>  Another thing is that all this data is processed in different ways, depending on the algorithms of the manufacturer.  Here, software plays a considerable role, but it differs, and at the same time it is quite significant.  Because this or that bracelet can give you different information, based on the same data. </p><p>  Here, again, you should pay attention to the class of the device to which the smart bracelet belongs.  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù 4.2, 4.4 or 5 - like the type of operating system as a whole - doesn‚Äôt play much difference.  All calculation algorithms and options are laid down by the manufacturer initially.  That is, given the purpose of the device, we can say that the Xiaomi Mi Band is just a ‚Äústep counter,‚Äù calories, a sleep analyzer;  while Jawbone UP24 is also an assistant in the preparation of your menu, with many other functions.  For runners, for example, this information may seem useless;  but adherents to a healthy diet, it can really come in handy. </p><p>  Another example is a speaker mounted on a smart bracelet.  In particular, this is the <span>Sony Smartband</span> model - it also has a microphone, so you can talk on this bracelet while synchronizing with the phone. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  About how widgets that they are equipped with affect the prices of smart bracelets, we already mentioned a little.  With this, everything is simple: the more features the device has, the more expensive it will cost the buyer in the end. </p><p>  Xiaomi Mi Band products can be called the cheapest - they are affordable and will cost about 1200 rubles.  The functionality that they have is minimal - tracking the steps, sleep and calories burned based on the calculations.  Next are gadgets such as Jawbone UP2 and Belsis - their functionality is not very different, and the price is at the level of 3 thousand rubles.  Behind them is the Sony Smartband for 3500 with the ability to receive alerts from a smartphone.  On cheaper models, it is also there, but is available in a much more truncated form. </p><p>  Next come the more expensive Jawbone UP24 for 6 thousand rubles, which investigate more parameters, on the basis of which they make an analysis of how the user feels (including - evaluating his mood).  Behind them are the models Jawbone UP3 and Striiv (the first for 13 thousand, the second has not yet been on sale).  These devices are something like laptop computers, since there is an option to install additional programs, work with social networks and so on. </p>

    <h2>  OS compatibility </h2><p>  When choosing a bracelet, it is important to pay attention to the operating system with which it is compatible.  This determines which device you will read data from using the bracelet - which OS your smartphone or tablet is running on.  Most manufacturers try to make their products universal, offering users synchronization with both Android and iOS.  However, there is, for example, the Sony Smartband SVR10 mentioned above, a smart bracelet for Android.  Prices for gadgets that work with any one operating system do not differ from universal devices, so keep this in mind when choosing. </p><h2>  Mount </h2><p>  Another nuance to which you should pay attention is fastening.  Most models use a <span>silicone strap,</span> as it is more practical for sports.  However, there are steel mounts. </p><h2>  Updates </h2><p>  Another important factor is updates.  Whatever errors were made by the device manufacturer, with the release of regular updates, they will be eliminated.  Read information about how often software is updated on your bracelet. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Another universal, but worthwhile advice is to pay attention to the reviews that characterize this or that smart bracelet.  As elsewhere, information about any device published by people who have experience working with it allows you to better navigate the advantages and disadvantages that it has.  Due to this, you will make a more informed choice and, as a result, you will not regret your purchase. </p><h2>  Where could I buy </h2><p>  The last paragraph of our article, devoted to both a review of smart bracelets and recommendations for their choice, is information about where to buy this device.  On the one hand, you can go to the nearest electronics supermarket and choose your own model right there.  So you will learn more about each device, hold it in your hands. </p><p>  On the other hand, there is an alternative option - to purchase the device on the Internet, for example - in an online store (including overseas).  This will provide an opportunity to save a little on purchase and, in addition, provide a wider selection of models (since not all devices are available in Russia).  The most common options for buying such devices online are eBay, Amazon, Aliexpress and others.  By ordering them here, you can save 10 to 40 percent of the cost.  The main thing is to pay attention to the reviews of sellers, so as not to run into scammers offering low-quality goods. </p>
