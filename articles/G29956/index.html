  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The development and culture of the kingdom of Greece</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Kingdom of Greece is an ancient country with a rich history and amazing beauty of nature.  The ancient civilization of Greece laid the foundation for the development of modern Europe.  Tourists are attracted by attractions that are more than two thousand years old.  The country's coast is famous for resorts with a pleasant climate. </p><h2>  Kingdom History </h2><p>  For the first time, the territory of Greece was inhabited until the third millennium BC.  This is reported by archaeological finds.  The territory of Ancient Greece differed from modern and occupied a large territory. </p><p>  The heyday of civilization came in the VI-IV centuries.  BC.  During this period, famous philosophers and scientists appeared.  Hippocrates, Socrates, Aristotle, Pythagoras - an incomplete list of famous Greeks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theconversation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient Greece" class="if uuid-2541177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/2541177.jpg"></div><p>  Greece was repeatedly attacked by other states, including Ancient Rome.  Under the oppression of the Roman Empire, the Greeks lived for almost 400 years.  In 1821, having conducted a war of liberation, Greece defended its independence. </p><p>  In 1833, the country proclaimed itself a monarchy.  The Kingdom of Greece survived several wars with other countries and a civil war.  As a result of the internal coup in 1974, the kingdom received the status of a republic. </p><h2>  Alternative kingdom story </h2><p>  It is believed that the kingdom of Greece had a different past.  An alternative story tells that Athens was burned down by barbarians in the 10th century or the Slavs slaughtered the inhabitants, but there is no direct evidence for this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 4th century BC, Athens was inhabited by Avar-Slavs.  Greeks as a nation have disappeared, there is no evidence of the existence of schools, libraries in the kingdom of Greece.  An alternative to classical history is not supported by documents, but the abundance of Slavic names for rivers and mountains indirectly indicates the validity of the alternative version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discovergreece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Attractions" class="if uuid-2541169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/2541169.jpg"></div><p>  In the XV century, archaeological excavations were carried out in Athens, and the Greeks themselves did not even know about the existence of the Olympic Palace.  German scientists have suggested that for 400 years, ruins existed in the kingdom of Greece.  In the XVIII century, a city plan was first drawn up.  Since then, the study of Greece began, possibly with a slight distortion in time. </p><h2>  Climate of the country </h2><p>  Greece is located on the Balkan Peninsula and is washed by the Mediterranean, Ionian and Aegean Seas.  1/5 of the country is located on the islands.  The largest and most famous island is Crete. </p><p>  The climate of the country is Mediterranean temperate.  Warm, wet winters and dry, hot summers have a comfortable rest.  Summer heat is easily tolerated thanks to the warm, damp wind from the sea. </p><p>  Holidays on the peninsula include skiing snow resorts and hot beaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flag of greece </h2><p>  The 1921 revolution led to independence and the appearance of the flag of the kingdom of Greece.  The flag shows 9 stripes of white and blue.  In the corner of the canvas there is a white cross. </p><div class="photo" data-original="greece10best.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag of greece" class="if uuid-2541172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/2541172.jpg"></div><p>  There are 3 versions of why 9 stripes are applied to the flag: </p><ul><li>  official version: 9 pages - 9 geographical areas of the country; </li><li>  9 syllables in the main slogan of the liberation war for independence - "freedom or death" in Greek; </li><li>  9 letters in the word "freedom" in Greek. </li></ul><p>  The blue color of the flag symbolizes the color of the sea, which plays an important role in the life of the Greeks.  White color is a symbol of sea foam.  The white cross recalls the Greek Orthodox Church and the struggle against the invaders. </p><p>  The Greeks are sensitive to the symbol of the state and are ready to defend the flag at the cost of their own lives.  A damaged flag must not be thrown into the trash, in which case the symbol is burned.  It is unacceptable for the flag to touch the ground, while raising it, the anthem of the state should sound. </p><h2>  Coat of arms of Greece </h2><p>  After the war of liberation in the kingdom of Greece, the coat of arms became a symbol of freedom.  The coat of arms depicts a shield with a white cross.  Around the shield is a laurel wreath.  The emblem symbolizes military prowess, glory and victory over the invaders.  The cross recalls the difficult mission of Greece during the revolution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coat of arms of Greece" class="if uuid-2541176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/2541176.jpg"></div><p>  The blue color on the symbol of the state speaks of a clear sky, seas washing the country, mercy and hope.  White color is a symbol of justice, purity of thoughts, faith and beauty. </p><h2>  Greek culture </h2><p>  The culture of the kingdom of Greece has influenced the development of other countries.  The receivers of cultural heritage were Ancient Rome and Byzantium.  It was in Greece that the science of mathematics and astronomy was born, the greatest philosophers of ancient times lived in this country. </p><p>  The ancient gods described in myths and legends are still revered by the people living in the country.  An unofficial symbol is an olive tree, it was presented to the people by the goddess Athena.  Olive tree oil is used in cooking, before it was used for household needs.  The Greeks are very sensitive to olive trees, it takes decades to grow it. </p><p>  The inhabitants of the country did not deify the rulers, the Gods lived nearby, but not among people.  In the kingdom of Greece there was no monarchy in its classical manifestation.  This quality distinguished the state from others.  Greece was the first to introduce the concept of a city-policy, which laid the foundation for democracy in the world. </p><h2>  Kingdom features </h2><p>  At all times, in the kingdom or republic of Greece, the Orthodox religion comes first.  You can‚Äôt neglect her, in this case no one will talk to you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.protothema.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of greece" class="if uuid-2541171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/2541171.jpg"></div><p>  The Greeks are hospitable, if you came to visit a house, then you won‚Äôt leave without a cup of coffee.  Russian-speaking Greeks, immigrants from Georgia and Central Asia, will surely feed dinner and discuss the latest news. </p><p>  Greeks love to drink coffee at home and in coffee houses.  A leisurely pastime over a cup of coffee they like.  In the same institution go for years, there are cases when 2-3 generations do not change their traditions.  A long lunch break allows you to enjoy the current day and do business in the evening. </p>
