Many people wonder where to go to Karelia and what to see there.  There is no single answer to this question.  <span>After all, Karelia is an amazing place with marvelous waterfalls, lakes and forests.</span>  <span>Whatever direction you choose, amazing landscapes, clean air and crystal water are waiting for you everywhere.</span>  <span>Recently, however, many tourists have preferred Popov's doorstep in Karelia.</span>  <span>Why?</span>  <span>You will learn more in this article.</span> </p><h2>  Sights of Karelia </h2><p>  Karelia is very rich in sights.  Each city or region of this region has at least 2-3 amazing places, which in popularity can compete with the Red Square of Moscow.  However, the Popov threshold is an exception to the rule, and here you will not find any man-made attractions.  It is in itself a tourist pearl of Karelia. </p><p>  Although there are a couple of local natural attractions in the Popovy threshold - these are Segozero and the Segezha River.  Segozero contains more than 15 species of fish, fishing on which is allowed all year round. </p><p>  Despite its small size (the village consists of 8 streets) Popov threshold has long been famous for its marvelous landscapes, forest, as well as a river and lake, teeming with animals.  People come here not only to enjoy the sights and enjoy measured relaxation in nature, but also for fishing and hunting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ticrk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Segezha" class="if uuid-3086688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3086688.jpg"></div><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  Due to the proximity of the White, Barents and Baltic seas, the climate in Karelia is temperate - in winter the temperature does not drop below -17 ¬∞ C, and in summer it does not rise above +20 ¬∞ C.  But at the same time, the weather at Popovy Threshold is very changeable: a sunny day can change dramatically with rain and vice versa.  Precipitation in Karelia is a very common occurrence, all due to the proximity of the seas and high humidity.  The winds in Karelia are moderate, not stronger - 3-5 m / s.  However, despite the fact that Karelia is located in the north, its weather is significantly different from other northern regions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gotonature.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Segezha lake" class="if uuid-3086745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3086745.jpg"></div><h2>  Local services and activities </h2><p>  The village of Popov threshold is a favorite place of avid fishermen and hunters.

The main birds and animals hunted here are: </p><ul><li>  capercaillie; </li><li>  goose </li><li>  moose </li><li>  Bear </li><li>  hazel grouse; </li><li>  a duck. </li></ul><p>  Fishing enthusiasts are given the opportunity to go fishing in Segozero, which is very rich in the following types of fish: </p><ul><li>  goby; </li><li>  ruff; </li><li>  bream; </li><li>  burbot; </li><li>  salmon; </li><li>  perch; </li><li>  roach; </li><li>  whitefish; </li><li>  trout; </li><li>  pike; </li><li>  vendace </li></ul><p>  In addition to the Perekat Guest House at Popovy Sill, you can go to the Segozero recreation center, located on the lake of the same name.

There are several such places in the Popovy threshold, for example: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Guest house "Perekat". </li><li>  The recreation center "Rusich". </li><li>  The recreation center "Segozero". </li><li>  Guest house "Popov threshold". </li></ul><p>  Each guest house or recreation center has on its territory barbecue areas, a rental point for fishing and hunting equipment, a bathhouse or a sauna.  A huntsman is also available at an additional cost. </p><p>  Those who prefer a secluded holiday, can stay on the lake, setting up a tent camp. </p><p>  Not all guest houses and recreation centers of Popov threshold offer food, so it is more advisable to purchase food and cook food yourself.  Moreover, each guest house and recreation center offers its guests comfortable houses or rooms with their own kitchen, which has all the necessary utensils and appliances for cooking.  In addition, all rooms and guest houses are equipped with individual bathrooms, fireplaces, TVs and other pleasant little things (bedding, towels, bathrobes and slippers). </p><div class="photo" data-original="odin-moy-den.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lawn by the forest" class="if uuid-3087053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3087053.jpg"></div><h2>  What to bring from Popov threshold </h2><p>  Do not think that you can bring souvenirs only from large resort cities.  Karelia is also very rich in craftsmen whose creations are very popular among tourists.  Old-timers of Karelia and experienced tourists are advised to bring the following souvenirs from this amazing region: </p><ul><li>  Products from Karelian birch: dishes, figurines, caskets. </li><li>  Textiles with local embroidery: towels, bedding, tablecloths, napkins. </li><li>  Food: dried and smoked fish, jam and jam, honey, mushrooms and berries. </li><li>  Interior items: paintings or wall clocks. </li><li>  Magnets for the refrigerator. </li></ul><p>  You can buy the above souvenirs both in specialized stores and in markets at local craftsmen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alem-tour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karelian souvenirs" class="if uuid-3086620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3086620.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourist guide </h2><p>  You can get <span>to the village</span> from anywhere in Russia.  First by train to Segezha district, then from Segezha by bus.  For those who are used to traveling in their car, it is better to use a navigator or a guide (map). </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="63.4088259" data-lng="34.01293439999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/5/5/5/14555.png"></div><p>  Although getting to the Popov threshold is not as easy as it seems at first glance, the rest spent in this amazing place will be remembered for a long time.
