Despite the fact that in fact the concubines were slaves, they were treated with dignity.  There were many women in the Sultan‚Äôs harem, but there were also darlings ‚Äî those who were lucky enough to give birth to the sultan‚Äôs sons.  They were especially respected and respected.  Sultan's Harem <strong> </strong>  divided into three groups.  In the first there were already elderly concubines, in the other two - very young.  All women studied flirting and literacy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eunuchs in the harem of the sultan of suleiman" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15247/208341.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The third group consisted of the most beautiful and expensive concubines, who gave their society not only to the Sultans, but also to the princes.  When the girls got into the palace, they were given a new name (usually Persian), which was supposed to reflect their essence.  Here are some examples: Nerginelek ("angel"), Nazluddamal ("yoke"), Cheshmir ("girl with beautiful eyes"), Nergidezada ("similar to daffodil"), Majamal ("moon-faced"). </p><p>  Until the 15th century, in the Ottoman Empire, it was customary to have legal wives in addition to the harem, usually foreign princesses.  Marriage was necessary to strengthen power and support from other states.  <span>The Ottoman Empire</span> grew and gained strength, there was no longer any need to seek support, so the family continued to be a concubine.  The harem of the sultan replaced and supplanted a legal marriage.  Concubines possessed their rights and privileges.  <span>The women of the Sultan</span> never needed anything, they could leave their master if desired after nine years of stay. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who left the palace were given home, a dowry was issued.  These women were called palace and had respect in society, they were given diamonds, fabrics, gold watches, everything that is necessary for home improvement, and regular benefits were also paid.  However, most of the girls did not want to leave the sultan's harem, even if they did not become favorites and did not receive the attention of the master, they became servants and raised younger girls. </p><p>  <strong>Suleiman's love for Roksolana ‚Äì Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska</strong> </p>

    <p>  Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent was a worthy ruler, warrior, legislator and tyrant.  This man was diversified, he was fond of music, wrote poetry, knew several languages, loved jewelry and blacksmithing.  Under his rule, the Ottoman Empire reached its greatest heights.  The character of the ruler was contradictory: severity, cruelty and ruthlessness combined with sentimentality.  At 26, Suleiman began to rule the Ottoman Empire. </p><p>  During this period, the numerous harem of the Turkish Sultan was replenished with a concubine from Western Ukraine.  The beautiful girl was called Roksolana, she was distinguished by a cheerful disposition, so she was given the name Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska, which means "funny."  The beauty immediately won the attention of the Sultan.  At that time, Mahidevran was the beloved woman, who, jealous, scratched her new concubine's face, tore her dress and patted her hair.  When Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska was invited to the sultan's bedchamber, she refused to go in this form to the ruler.  Upon learning of what had happened, Suleiman became angry with Mahidevran and made Roksolana his beloved woman. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There was a rule in the harem stating that a concubine could have only one child from the Sultan.  Suleiman was so in love with Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska that he gave her five children and refused to meet with other women.  In addition, another traditional rule was violated - he married, so this was the first legal marriage of the Sultan and the concubine in the history of the Ottoman Empire.  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska was the most significant person in the palace 25 years and had unlimited power over her husband.  She died before her lover. </p><p>  Suleiman's last love </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkish Sultan's Harem" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15247/208333.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <p>  After the death of Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska, the ruler flashed feelings for only one concubine, Gulfem.  The girl was 17 years old when she got into the harem of the Sultan.  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska and Gyulphem were completely different.  The last love of the Sultan was a calm woman, despite her unprecedented beauty, attracted Suleiman in her kindness and gentle nature.  He spent all nights only with Gulf, while the rest of the concubines were insanely jealous, but could not do anything about it. </p><p>  This sweet and calm woman decided to build a mosque.  Not wanting publicity, she did not say anything about this to the Sultan.  She gave all her salary to the construction.  Once the money ran out, the girl did not want to ask her lover for help, because it was below her dignity.  She took the funds from another concubine, who agreed to give her salary for several nights with the Sultan.  Suleiman was surprised to see the other in his chambers, he only wanted to share the bed with Gulf.  When her beloved referred to the disease for several nights, and another concubine came to replace her, Suleiman was angry.  An insidious rival told the overlord that nights with him were sold for salaries.  The eunuchs in the harem of Sultan Suleiman received an order to whip G√ºlfem with ten blows of rods, but she died of such a shame even before punishment.  When the ruler found out the true reason for the act of his beloved, he grieved for a long time and regretted that he had not talked to her before <span>sentencing.</span>  The mosque was completed by order of Suleiman.  A school was erected nearby.  G√ºlfem was buried in the garden of this small culie. </p>
