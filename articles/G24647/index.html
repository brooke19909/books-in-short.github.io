The bet on the development of the country as a tourist region for many years yielded an incredible result: the All Inclusive system, the level of the tourism industry, the number of hotels ready to receive guests, beyond competition.  If you calculate the number of services per ruble of investment on vacation, it is unlikely that any other country will be able to win the rivalry. </p><p>  This raises a problem of a different plan: how to navigate this wealth of offers and choose your own, the only suitable option from the whole variety?  Of course, you can re-read about all the hotels and conditions, but for this whole human life will not be enough.  In this case, a competent travel agent or rating system for assessing tourism services comes to the rescue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turkey hotels zena resort hotel" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/707422.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Brief description of 5 * hotels </h2><p>  Hotels in Turkey have European certification, and their status is determined by the number of stars.  But even in the same price range, five-star hotels have a rather large amplitude of assessment. </p><p>  For example, the Zena Resort Hotel 5 * hotel has a fairly reasonable price, compared with other hotels of this class.  This is due to the fact that the beach is across the road, the year of construction is 2004, the building is not new.  At the same time, the complex holds a consistently high, irreducible rating (8.5 out of 10 points).  This value for money will be an excellent choice for those who go on vacation with children. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fans of hotels with a large territory and a wide range of services designed for different categories of vacationers should look at establishments with the extension of HV (holiday village).  These hotels do not include Zena Resort Hotel <span>5 (Kemer) 5 *.</span>  HV <strong>is</strong> a club hotel, often with low-rise buildings such as bungalows, with a vast territory.  For the price, this type of vacation is more expensive than the usual "five".  You have to pay for a fairly wide range of services. </p><p>  The most expensive will be a vacation in hotels of the Luxory level.  Places of the famous hotel chains Amara, Vogu, Best, etc. usually have this category. Increased respectability, exclusivity and the ultra all-inclusive system are brief characteristics of this type of vacation, which Turkey is also famous for. </p><p>  Hotels Zena Resort Hotel, <span>Ring Beach</span> Hotel, Sentido Palmet Beach Resort - high-quality "five" of the same price range, which combine the level of service and the optimal cost of services.  Choosing such hotels, the tourist gets a great opportunity to get a decent quality vacation at a reasonable price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zena resort hotel 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/707433.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kemer - the greenest resort in Turkey </h2><p>  There are well-known resorts on the <span>Antalya coast</span> : Alanya, Antalya, Belek, Kemer, Side, Fethiye.  Each of them has its own merits.  Antalya is suitable for connoisseurs of proximity to urban centers.  In Alanya, reasonable prices.  Belek offers wide sandy beaches and expensive service.  Side is a young democratic resort.  Fethiye is the most remote of all, respectability is combined with the lack of fuss and crowded, you can even find wild beaches with a natural landscape. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Kemer is chosen because of its picturesque nature and the combination of a mild Mediterranean climate and the richness of coniferous forests, which creates a special climatic therapeutic effect that has a beneficial effect on human health. </p><p>  Kemer is a resort center on the Mediterranean coast.  Nearby are villages, in the past - ordinary fishing villages.  Each of them has its own characteristic features.  Camyuva, where the Zena Resort Hotel is located, <strong>is</strong> a place for a relaxing family vacation.  Many inexpensive hotels are located here, unlike, for example, the fashionable village of Tekirova.  But they are not of special interest as shopping centers, cultural and sightseeing life.  Therefore, the main emphasis has been placed on the development of hotel infrastructure, since they limit the space of the recreation area.  Unlike, say, Italy or Spain, where the approach to choosing a particular complex is completely different.  There, the hotel is only a place where you can conveniently spend the night.  In these countries, proximity to historical and cultural centers is more appreciated. </p><h2>  Location <strong> </strong></h2><p>  In the village of Camyuva, six kilometers from Kemer, is located Zena <strong> </strong>  Resort Hotel Kemer is a well-known rating hotel, opened in 2004 and during all this time has won fame as a hospitable hotel with high quality service. </p><p>  The international airport of Antalya, where tourists from all over the world fly to rest, is located a little further than fifty kilometers from the hotel, so a group transfer will deliver guests to their place of residence within an hour.  If you use the services of an individual transfer, then the road to the hotel will not take half an hour. </p><p>  The beach is across the road, fifty meters from the hotel.  The area is seventeen thousand square meters, the park area is an excellent place to relax.  The convenient location of the complex is rightfully appreciated by many of its guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zena resort hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/707423.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Recommendations for holidays in Turkey </h2><p>  If you want to get a good impression of the rest, try to follow the simple rules and standards of etiquette of the country: </p><ul><li>  Before the trip, get acquainted with the traditions and cultural customs of Turkey. </li><li>  Particular attention should be paid to standards of behavior and a dress code when visiting Muslim mosques. </li><li>  It does not hurt to include sports risks, water and extreme types of recreation in the insurance for the period of the trip.

If the proposed option for some reason did not suit you, do not rush to make a complaint.  Quietly explain the reason for your disagreement.  As a rule, motivated requests are accepted, and the relocation takes place without any surcharges. </li><li>  In case of health problems and the decision to be treated independently, notify the insurer about the problem.  The situation will be taken under control. </li><li>  In the first days of your stay at the resort, exercise caution and try to protect yourself and especially children from exposure to sunlight to avoid getting burns.  Be sure to use sunscreen (cream, glasses), especially during sea voyages and with prolonged exposure to water. </li></ul><p>  Compliance with these simple recommendations will make your stay enjoyable and prevent potential problems. </p>
