    <h2>  What is attractive about holidays in Vityazevo with children? </h2><p>  To begin with, the village of Vityazevo is very conveniently located.  Holidays with children (parents are well aware of this) always tire of long journeys and flights.  From <span>Anapa Airport</span> you can take a bus to the village in twenty minutes.  In a matter of hours, you can get here on the highway by car. </p><p>  Tourists are attracted by this quiet place with sandy beaches.  Children of any age are happy to build sand castles and palaces here, prepare funny cakes and bury each other in soft and warm sand.  These classes are quite suitable for parents: the child is busy with the game, communicates with peers, and parents calmly take sun baths at this time. </p>

    <p>  In this sense, it is difficult for mothers and fathers to find a more peaceful place than the village of Vityazevo.  Rest with children here is fully consistent with the dream of a family vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I must say that no one will have problems with living here.  In the village you can choose a comfortable hotel, guest house, villa or housing in the private sector.  Guests choose options according to their desires and financial capabilities.  Vityazevo hotels for families with children are equipped with everything necessary for kids.  There is special furniture and utensils, swimming pools and playgrounds, in some of them you can use the services of a nanny. </p><p>  But there is one advantage that differs from other resorts in the village of Vityazevo.  Rest with children here is not connected with a long and tiring journey from the place of residence to the beach.  You can go to the sea from anywhere in the village in a few minutes. </p>

    <p>  When planning a vacation with children, all parents must take into account the quality of water and the coastal zone.  And on this indicator, many are satisfied with Vityazevo.  Holidays with children suggest that the water and the beach should be as clean as possible, such as in this resort village.  It is important that the coastal line here is quite shallow - the first two to three meters at the edge are convenient for swimming even for the smallest travelers. </p><p>  The village has a modern water park.  We think that there is no need to comment on this item. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Many compare the water temperature in the sea near the village in the summer with fresh milk.  You can swim here from May to October.  The bottom is smooth and even, so you can not worry about the safety of children.  The beaches are well equipped: for children there are many slides and water attractions, and for adults you can choose something more extreme.  It depends on your preference: diving or flying a hang glider, a light-engine plane or parachuting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vityazevo vacation with children cheap" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1404746.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can visit two excellent parks with dizzying and at the same time safe rides.  We are sure that your children will enjoy this walk. </p><h2>  Waterpark "Olympia" </h2><p>  This is a unique and one of a kind on the Black Sea coast of our country theme park of water attractions.  The Greek theme chosen by the creators of the park immerses visitors in the world of myths and legends, introduces the heroes of ancient Hellas, transfers them to the world of unforgettable emotions and exciting adventures during the time of the first Olympic champions and gods of Greece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Here you can meet Hercules and Athena, relive his exciting adventures with Odysseus, go through the ‚ÄúMinotaur Labyrinth‚Äù. </p>
