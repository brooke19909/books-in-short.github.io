    <p>  In the article you can find simple patterns of <span>hats from fleece,</span> the manufacture of which does not take much time. </p><h2>  Using fleece for sewing hats </h2><p>  Fleece fabric has a definite advantage over other materials.  This is one hundred percent polyester, which undergoes a special treatment that saves the product from the appearance of spools.  Caring for it is quite simple, the material does not crease, is well erased and dries quickly.  Pleasant to the touch, does not cause irritation when in contact with the body. </p><p>  The fleece hat is warm, it is elastic and fits snugly to the head.  A large selection of colors gives many options in order to make the right product. </p><h2>  How to sew a hat yourself? </h2><p>  The fabric is made by special technology, it has threads that on the inside make the material softer.  The finished product is so practical that you can hide it in your pocket if necessary.  The pattern of men's hats made of fleece is easy to use.  There are several steps you need to go through. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Preparation of all necessary materials and tools. </li><li>  Measurement and calculation. </li><li>  The construction of the pattern. </li><li>  Parts collection, fitting and fitting. </li></ul><h2>  What materials are needed for sewing a <span>fleece hat?</span> </h2><p>  To sew a headdress, you need fabric, a meter tape, tailor's chalk, scissors, threads to match the fabric. </p><p>  Before it comes to the assembly of parts, the pattern must be done on paper.  To do this, in fact, you need the paper itself and a simple pencil.  The product is sewn on a sewing machine, if one is not available, then work can be done with a small manual seam.  Due to the fact that the fabric has a slight fluffiness, the seam will be invisible. </p><p>  For convenience, when stitching parts, they can first be chopped together with pins, because pins are also useful. </p><h2>  <span>Four-</span> piece fleece <span>cap</span> pattern </h2><p>  After preparing all the materials you need to measure the girth of the head.  We divide this value by 4 and get the size of the width of one wedge.  After that, you should find out the depth of the headgear.  For this, a meter tape measures the distance from the forehead, through the crown and to the back of the head.  The result is divided into two.  This is one wedge, such pieces need 4 pieces. </p><p>  For example: head circumference 50 cm, divide this value by 4 (number of wedges).  50: 4 = 25 - the width of the wedge. </p><p>  The measure from the forehead to the crown was 46 cm, we divide it by 2 (front and back of the head).  46: 2 = 23 - the height of the cap. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fleece cap patterns" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/1873938.jpg" width="600"></div>

Segments from the base to the top should be rounded.  According to the same principle, a cap with earflaps is made of fleece.  The pattern is distinguished by the presence of a few additional details, but the basis is the same. </p><h2>  Sewing technology hats made of fleece </h2><p>  A fleece hat can go with or without a lining, depending on the season.  The fabric does not shoot and does not crumble, so the inner edges can be left as is.  If the cap is unlined, then for a neat appearance it is still better to process the seams on the overlock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of men's hats made of fleece" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/1873940.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sewing caps with earflaps from fleece </h2><p>  When sewing caps with earflaps, you need to make a lining.  For beauty, you can choose a fleece in two colors.  Such models, allowing you to close the forehead, occipital part and ears, are often used in the cold season.  You can sew an earflaps with ties or without them. </p><p>  In this case, wedges are built, as in the previous model, taking into account their own standards.  Do not forget that the pattern should be transferred to the fabric with a margin of 0.5 cm for seams. You can find ready-made patterns of hats from fleece in sewing magazines.  For the earflaps, you still need to carve out a visor (two parts of the same size). </p><p>  Connect the wedges for the lining, but leave a small open seam (6-7 cm), through which the finished product can be turned out.  There should also be 4 parts that are sewn to the bottom of the cap (2 front, 2 lining), which will protect the ears. </p><p>  Stitch the visor parts together, cut off excess allowances and turn them off.  Connect the elements that will cover the ears and also turn them on the front side. </p><p>  The main parts are ready, now they need to be assembled into one product.  Fold the lining of the cap and the cap itself face to face, so that all the seams will be visible.  Insert a visor between the underlay and the main part and fix its raw edge with pins between the main parts.  On the sides of the visor, in the same way, put in the parts that will cover the ears and fix with pins. </p><p>  Now that all the necessary components are assembled, you need to stitch them and lining in a circle with one seam.  It turns out that the visor and side parts will remain inside the two stitched parts.  Now it is necessary to find in the lining the non-sewn area (6-7 cm) and through it to turn out the entire product is visible. </p><p>  Sew the open area manually with a blind seam, using threads to match the fabric.  You can find other patterns of hats from fleece, when the visor and "ears" are cut out in one piece.  When sewing, this one part will need to be inserted between the main and lining fabric.  The algorithm is the same: stitch all the parts together and twist through the open seam. </p><h2>  Sewing a sports cap made of fleece </h2><p>  There is an even simpler version of the header.  The pattern of a sports cap made of fleece can be of two parts or one if these two are cut together.  If the part is one, then there will be only one seam - at the back.  If two, then there will be two seams - on the sides.  Patterns need to be made 6-7 cm longer so that this piece of fabric is tucked inward and thus insulate part of the cap in the ear area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fleece sports cap pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1874853.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Whichever option is chosen, first of all, you need to sew up the darts at the top of the product, and then sew the parts.  You can say the hat is almost ready.  It remains to process the internal seams and tuck the edging.  You can sew a decorative patch on the side. </p><p>  If there is an overlock for stretch fabrics, then it will be much easier and faster to work, because in one seam a line is immediately laid and the edge is processed. </p>
