It is included today in the top five in the market.  The abbreviation is deciphered as follows: "All-Russian Insurance Company."  It provides universal services to citizens and legal entities. </p><h2>  VSK: life insurance rules </h2><p>  Life insurance is a classic type of service, which includes far from one variety.  This category can be understood as: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sravni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VSK voluntary insurance rules" class="if uuid-3175671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3175671.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Survival insurance.  Money is paid when clients survive to a certain age or until the expiration of the contract. </li><li>  Mixed type.  It covers two risks, namely death and survival to a specific time period. </li><li>  Child insurance provides payments to adulthood or to any particular event.  As a rule, it includes financial protection from certain accidents. </li><li>  Urgent insurance.  This is the simplest and, at the same time, cheapest form that does not include an accumulation element. </li></ol><p>  Subjects of the insurance contract: insurer, policyholder, insured person or several, as well as the beneficiary or several. </p><p>  Policyholder Rights: </p><ul><li>  the contract can be terminated early; </li><li>  its conditions can be changed by agreement with the insurer; </li><li>  the policyholder is also entitled to receive a duplicate of the agreement (insurance policy) if loss occurs; </li><li>  You can replace the beneficiary with the written consent of the insured person. </li></ul><p>  Policyholder Responsibilities: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  insurance premiums must be paid; </li><li>  documents confirming the payment of the insurance premium must be kept; </li><li>  in any way possible to objectively record the fact of the appeal, to notify the insurer within 50 calendar days of the occurrence of the insured event (death, temporary disability or disability of the insured person); </li><li>  inform the insurer in writing of significant changes in circumstances that could significantly affect the increase in insurance risk. </li></ul><p>  Rights of the insurer: </p><ul><li>  refuse insurance payment if events occurred as a result of activities associated with increased risk; </li><li>  upon notification of circumstances leading to an increase in insurance risk, demand a change in the terms of the insurance contract or payment of an additional insurance premium. </li></ul><p>  Obligations of the insurer: </p><ul><li>  the insurance policy must be issued within the prescribed period; </li><li>  insurance payment must be made within 20 business days from the date of receipt of all necessary documents. </li></ul><p>  Obligations of the insured person: </p><ul><li>  notification of the insurer within 50 (fifty) calendar days of temporary disability or disability, as well as the provision as soon as possible of all necessary information and supporting documents; </li><li>  strict observance of the rules of life insurance in VSK. </li></ul><p>  Personal insurance is either compulsory or voluntary.  Unlike the first type, the second form is carried out solely on the basis of an agreement between the client and the organization.  The most popular in our country are those varieties of services that are characterized by a savings option: it implies child protection, mixed life insurance, the acquisition of a policy for a wedding or other important event in life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How much does VSK cost life insurance? </h2><p>  According to VSK insurance rules, the premium may directly depend on many different factors: </p><ol><li>  The age of the person for whom the service is drawn up (at the time of drawing up the contract) </li><li>  The working conditions of the citizen on whom the policy is drawn up. </li><li>  The health status of the client.  Often, when applying for a policy, a person who takes part in insurance must undergo a medical examination. </li><li>  The presence of dependents or children. </li><li>  The level of cash security for the person to whom the insurance is issued. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="lowcostcarinsuranceprice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casco insurance policy" class="if uuid-3175666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3175666.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the cost of the policy may depend on the type of insurance, as well as on the contributions that the client will be willing to pay monthly or annually.  What else can you learn from the insurance rules of CJSC VSK? </p><h2>  Life insurance terms </h2><p>  Important requirements and rules of the contract of such insurance include: </p><ol><li>  Information about the person to whom the agreement is drawn up. </li><li>  Information about the nature of probable insurance events (for example, harm to health, surviving to a certain age). </li><li>  Amount of the amount provided.  We are talking about the amount that insurers pay in the event of an incident. </li><li>  Contract time. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.coverfox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance rules" class="if uuid-3175674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3175674.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, other conditions are often included in a document.  For example, information about the beneficiary upon the occurrence of an insurance situation (children, spouse, parents), as well as cases that are not recognized as subject to monetary compensation (for example, suicide).  Next, we discuss Casco insurance rules at VSK. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Why is it profitable to insure your car with CASCO in VSK? </h2><p>  Thanks to the vast experience of this enterprise, car owners of foreign cars and vehicles of Russian production today prefer this particular company.  Such popularity is explained by the activities of the enterprise, which is based on such principles: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestcarinsurance.com.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vsk insurance rules" class="if uuid-3175662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3175662.jpg"></div><ol><li>  The highest class of reliability.  In this case, there is an A ++ score. </li><li>  Expedited procedures for obtaining insurance claims (up to five days). </li><li>  Availability of the possibility of obtaining policies for traveling abroad through the online service. </li><li>  An automatic call processing system makes it possible to more quickly serve a large number of different customers. </li><li>  The ability to use the services of an tow truck an unlimited number of times during the period of the policy. </li><li>  Payment of hull in installments. </li><li>  No additional certificates are required if the damage to the car is not more than 5% of the insurance amount. </li><li>  The settlement of the case can be carried out at any office of the company, regardless of where the contract was concluded. </li><li>  Strict adherence to the rules of voluntary insurance in VSK. </li></ol><h2>  Types of insurance </h2><p>  This organization offers its customers the following services: </p><ol><li>  Provision of health and accident insurance. </li><li>  Health insurance </li><li>  Protection of land, air, and rail vehicles. </li><li>  Cargo insurance and agricultural support. </li><li>  Protection of property of legal entities. </li><li>  Property insurance for citizens. </li><li>  Protection of civil liability of vehicle owners. </li></ol><h2>  Combined Insurance </h2><p>  The insurance market in our country only reaches the level of development when the emphasis in the choice of the program is on its individuality.  And this transition became possible due to the popularization of combined insurance products.  In Western countries, it is in high demand among corporate clients.  Experts say that the same situation will soon arise in Russia. </p><p>  Consider the rules of combined insurance VSK. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.irishtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vsk life insurance rules" class="if uuid-3175673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3175673.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of combined insurance </h2><p>  In international insurance law, the complex type of such services is called Comprehensive Insurance.  The essence of this product is to combine various options within one policy: </p><ol><li>  Several types of insurance (personal, property and so on). </li><li>  Different risk groups. </li><li>  Levels of protection at various stages of application of the insured item. </li></ol><p>  The most successful examples are the CASCO and CARGO programs.  In the first case, the monetary coverage extends to the car itself, the passengers in it, the driver, as well as to the interests of third parties.  As a result, comprehensive motor vehicle insurance may include: </p><ol><li>  Protection against breakage. </li><li>  Passenger accident insurance. </li><li>  Car driver liability policy. </li><li>  Insurance of auxiliary equipment (for example, electronics). </li></ol><p>  Under certain clauses, clients may provide for various threats from which the transport will be insured.  For example, the machine itself can be protected from minor damage, from fires, accidents or even theft.  Electronics in the cabin, respectively, from its abduction or breakdown as a result of an accident. </p><h2>  CARGO Features </h2><p>  The second example is CARGO, which provides comprehensive cargo insurance.  It already includes not types of insurance, but takes into account the stages of the subject of the service, which it passes as part of the movement to the recipient.  This takes into account: </p><ol><li>  Risk at the stage of loading and unloading. </li><li>  The threat of product spoilage along the road (on which it is transported). </li><li>  Risk factor during storage of goods at a transshipment point. </li><li>  The CARGO coverage also extends to the installation stages of transported equipment. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneycrashers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VSK combined insurance rules" class="if uuid-3175664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3175664.jpg"></div><h2>  Principles of Combined Agreement </h2><p>  The aim of the development of this product is comprehensive insurance of property, liability, cargo or vehicles.  Thus, all relevant risks are combined into one agreement on three principles: legality, individualization and wholesale prices.  In short, such an agreement is easier to draw up, it works better to protect the interests of the client and is much cheaper. </p><p>  We reviewed the basic rules of VSK insurance. </p>
