  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tax accounting registers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to the Russian Tax Code, the calculation and payment of taxes are mandatory for each organization or enterprise registered in the territory of the Federation.  The correct determination of the amount of necessary budgetary payments is impossible without regular and continuous recording and processing of numerical data obtained during the implementation of a particular economic and financial operation.  For the convenience of this process, special tax accounting registers are used. </p><p>  These are the forms of documents established by legislative acts in which the necessary calculations are carried out: </p><p>  - formed the amount of income and expenses; </p><p>  - the list of expenses to be deducted for tax purposes in this reporting period is determined; </p><p>  - the numerical value of expenses that will be allocated to the following periods is fixed; </p><p>  - reserves are created; </p><p>  - the amount of debt to the budget is displayed. </p><p>  The tax accounting registers for income tax are formed in the form of forms of books or magazines fixed by the regulations, as well as on electronic media. </p><p>  <strong>Tax Analysis</strong> </p><p>  Analytical tax accounting registers are grouped forms that contain information and systematization of digital accounting data for a specific <span>tax period</span> without using accounting accounts.  They are used to accumulate and systematize information and reflect it in the calculation of the <span>tax base</span> recorded in <span>primary documents,</span> as well as in the results of the analysis of tax accounting. </p><p>  The twenty-fifth chapter of the Tax Code of Russia presents tax accounting standards.  On their basis, the Ministry of Taxes and Levies in an information message in December 2001 proposed to use the main registers for determining the amounts of contributions to the budget. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The list of tax registers</strong> </p><p>  Currently, <span>tax control</span> authorities have fixed the following tax accounting registers: </p><ol><li>  settlement register reflecting the formation of an amount showing the monetary value of the accounting object; </li><li>  Settlement register showing depreciation of intangible assets; </li><li>  settlement register of the cost of materials or raw materials written off by the LIFO method; </li><li>  Settlement register, reflecting the cost of written-off materials or raw materials in a certain reporting period; </li><li>  Settlement register showing the value of goods written off for the tax period; </li><li>  Settlement register showing reserves of bad and doubtful debts for a given period of the report; </li><li>  settlement register of expenses incurred, reflecting the amount of amounts for voluntary insurance of employees for the current period; </li><li>  settlement register of expenses deducted for repairs in the current reporting period; </li><li>  Settlement register of expenses planned for repair work, taken into account in the present and future reporting periods; </li></ol><p>  10. Settlement register reflecting the available reserves of expenses in case of free warranty repair; </p><p>  11. Settlement register of the recalculated coefficient of reserves for expenses in case of warranty repair; </p><p>  12. the accounting register, compiled according to the inventory at the date of the report and showing the amount of receivable bad debts; </p><p>  13. <span>accounts</span> register of <span>accounts payable,</span> compiled according to the inventory at the date of the report; </p><p>  14. an accounting register fixing insurance amounts on the basis of employees' voluntary insurance contracts; </p><p>  15. accounting register of expenses of the enterprise for insurance of employees; </p><p>  16. the accounting register of operations on non-operating expenses of the <span>assignment of claims,</span> referred to future periods. </p><p>  In addition to the recommended accounting documents provided here, the organization may develop additional tax accounting registers.  They can be expanded, divided or otherwise transformed, based on the individual characteristics of the economic and financial activities of the organization or enterprise. </p>
