Novosibirsk metro is also the easternmost in Russia.  Its construction and operation sometimes take place in extreme climatic conditions.  <span>The sharply continental climate of</span> Siberia is characterized by a very large temperature difference.  It is very hot here in summer, and in winter the thermometer column often drops to a forty-degree mark.  And the Novosibirsk metro in severe frost is a good refuge from it.  These are the Siberian realities.  But the subway was not built at all in order to hide in tunnels and at stations from extreme temperatures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novosibirsk metro" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/280157.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Novosibirsk metro, its engineering and architectural features</strong> </p><p>  In Novosibirsk, the largest industrial and scientific center beyond the Urals, the construction of the subway has been brewing for a long time.  The public transport traditional for the city could not cope with the growing passenger flow already in the seventies of the last century.  A significant part of the Novosibirsk metro was built in the difficult economic conditions of the crisis of the 90s.  Quite often, architects, designers and builders were forced to save on everything they could.  To date, the metro scheme of Novosibirsk consists of only two operating lines - Leninsky and Dzerzhinsky.  Only thirteen stations are currently operating on both. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novosibirsk metro scheme" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/281117.jpg" width="600"></div>  In architectural terms, the mentioned lines are resolved rather modestly.  However, it cannot be said that this is so bad.  There is no ostentatious metropolitan luxury, but Siberian architects and designers tried to achieve expressiveness within the framework of minimalism.  Partly it was possible.  Novosibirsk metro stations are distinguished by their own style.  It is characterized by wide open architectural volumes and the absence of all that is superfluous.  Functionalism dominates in them.  Marble and granite of soft colors were used as finishing material.  By type, all the <span>stations of the Novosibirsk</span> metro are shallow.  The bridge over the Ob looks very good.  By the way, this is the longest metro bridge in the world, its total length with coastal overpasses significantly exceeds two kilometers.  It allowed to connect densely populated areas of the left bank with the central part of the city.  Reliable transport communication allows you to rationally plan the development of the village on both banks of the great Siberian river.  While on the left bank there are only two stations. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novosibirsk metro station" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/280154.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Metro of Novosibirsk.</strong>  <strong>Development prospects</strong> </p><p>  In the foreseeable future, the city will receive two more stations on the Dzerzhinsky line (they are already under construction) and one on Leninsky, in the left-bank part.  It is interesting to note that, according to the master plan for the development of Novosibirsk, approved by the USSR Council of Ministers in 1981, the city should have 53 metro stations on five lines.  But today this project seems completely impracticable.  Negotiations are underway with interested parties and necessary adjustments are being made.  The process of discussing the new <span>scheme for the development of the</span> Novosibirsk <span>metro has</span> dragged on for quite a while, and has not yet led to any concrete results. </p>
