    <h2>  What is the new resort region of Marsa Alam </h2><p>  Egypt is famous as a winter destination for budget travelers.  But still this part of Africa is not the Dominican Republic and not Thailand.  In winter, the traditional <span>resorts of Egypt</span> (in Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh) are windy and far from hot.  But there are places that are not inferior in climate to real tropical countries.  Marsa Alam is located almost in the very south of Egypt, on the same latitude with Luxor.  And this means that even in January, tourists can count on +25 degrees in the shade and the warm, warm sea.  From the west, the resort is covered by mountains from the cold desert winds.  In addition, from Mars Alam closer to get to the historical <span>sights of Egypt.</span>  Here you can choose from the <span>Karnak Temple, the</span> Valley of the Kings, and the Abu Simbel complex.  And in the north of Al Quseir you can visit the Farran Mosque and the fortress, built in the sixteenth century by Sultan Selim.  And in Marsa Alam itself, you can also have some fun.  The local coral reefs are able to compete in beauty with Ras Mohammed.  In addition, near Mars Alam (more precisely, a hundred kilometers from the Hilton Nubian Resort 5 *, Marsa Alam) there is a dolphin nursery where you can swim in company with these wonderful and friendly mammals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hilton Marsa Alam Nubian Resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1099623.jpg" width="600"></div>

The houses are built in the Nubian style, which is reflected in the name of the Hilton Nubian Resort 5 * (Marsa Alam).  This hotel appeared relatively recently - in the summer of two thousand and eleven.  So you should not count on tall shady trees.  Huge, one hundred forty-five thousand square meters, the hotel is surrounded by greenery - but so far it is mainly lawns, flowering shrubs and young palm trees.  The reception is located in a separate one-story building.  Given the vast territory, new arrivals to their bungalows are taken by electric car.  A ‚Äútrain‚Äù runs around the hotel with an interval of five minutes, where lazy or tired tourists can get to the beach or to the restaurant.  To get to the Hilton Marsa Alam Nubian Resort 5 * in Egypt, it is not necessary to fly to Hurghada.  Marsa Alam has its own new airport, which accepts international flights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Hilton Marsa Alam Nubian Resort 5:" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1099628.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Hilton Marsa Alam Nubian Resort 5 * reviews are called the hotel "conditionally front page".  This means that the beach is located across the road.
