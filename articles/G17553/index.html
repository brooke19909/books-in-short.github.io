Its recreational opportunities are determined by the mild Mediterranean sanatorium climate of Fugla Bay.  For vacationers on the compact cozy Fugla Peninsula (of the same name with the bay), the most modern hotel infrastructure has been created, comfortable terraces leading to the beach coast have been planned.  This is a four star first line hotel with a decent reputation.  "Turkey, Alanya, Hotel Lonisera" - these words adorn <span>the brochures of</span> many domestic and European tour operators.  This hotel complex is really preferred by many frugal Europeans (especially pragmatic Germans) sophisticated in a comfortable stay, and it is affordable for vacationers from the former CIS countries. </p><p>  The Turkish subtropics, where the hotel is located, are ideal for relaxation.  The rich history of the country is also interesting for vacationers, and the production of souvenirs for tourists is a major business, significant for the country's economy. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The local hotel and resort business has a harmoniously built logistics.  Indeed, unlike the evolutionary development of European resorts, the state of Turkey developed its tourism industry meaningfully and plannedly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alanya - "Lonisera."  The distance between them is 20 kilometers.  Antalya Airport is 98 kilometers from the hotel.  Around the hotel complex - an impressive retail and restaurant infrastructure.  Nearby are the ancient attractions of Asia Minor, as the Country of the Star and the Crescent was once called: Alanya Arkeoloji Muzesi, Damlatas Caves, Ornek Sinemalari. </p><p>  While staying at the hotel, you can travel using three modes of transport: the most economical - Dolmush minibuses (price 1.5 lira), an ordinary taxi, or by renting a car. </p><h2>  Recreational potential </h2><p>  Hotel "Lonisera" (Turkey) uses man-made recreational facilities for recreation of its guests, and not only the unique natural opportunities of the Mediterranean.  Perhaps that is why its comfortable sandy beach is quite extensive and almost never crowded.  Many of the guests prefer to relax by the pool (and there are 10 of them here).  The area occupied by this hotel complex is quite extensive - 90 thousand m <sup>2</sup> .  It has a well-groomed <span>orchard</span> with terraces, an amphitheater, a small zoo, shops, restaurants and bars.  He is in great demand among couples.  It is quiet, spacious.  The staff is polite and attentive.  Abundant and tasty food for vacationers on the all inclusive system.  A boring animation program, ample opportunities for outdoor activities and sports.  This is the Lonicera Hotel.  Turkey, being a rather popular resort, of course, is rich in hotels of various classes, but this complex is special. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Regular investment </h2><p>  It is important that this recreational potential does not exist in a static form, but develops creatively.  Fixed assets are being built (until recently, the hotel complex was located in three buildings, and there were fewer pools).  <span>Capital investments are</span> regularly and planned <span>,</span> in particular, regular customers of the hotel (and there are many of them) note the quality and creative nature of the capital repairs that took place in 2012.  Such intense investment activity is supported by the state of Turkey with soft loans.  The Lonicera World Hotel demonstrates a creative design approach in the design of its interiors: each of the four buildings inside is decorated in a certain style: Egyptian, Greek, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The four-star Lonisera is a hotel in Turkey, modeled on traditional European resorts with its balanced hotel infrastructure.  For vacationers, of course, what beach the hotel provides them is of no small importance.  "Lonisser" in this regard is adequate to the needs of its guests.  On the sandy strip, those who wish will always find free places to relax.  Towels, umbrellas and sunbeds are provided free of charge.  The sea is pleasantly surprising: it is warm, calm, and the water is transparent to such an extent that the bottom is visible even at a depth of 6 meters.  Adult swimmers, upon reaching buoys, often see aquatic turtles.  On the beach you will be offered to ride a jet ski (cost - $ 45), a paraglider ($ 45) or a banana ($ 25). </p><p>  Those who want to learn water skiing and receive a certificate are paid $ 200, listen to water lectures and receive appropriate practice (with instructors).  It is also recommended that people with experience in this type of outdoor activity participate in diving dives ($ 45).  Coaches working with Lonicera will not let the newcomers go (the hotel in Turkey receives from them a percentage of the diving fee of its guests, and it does not need problems).  ‚ÄúDummies‚Äù will be taught, a certificate will be issued for 2 lira, but they will not be allowed to dive deeper than 5 m. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Those who wish can, with the help of the administration and infrastructure of the hotel, organize a quality outdoor activity.  In addition to particularly popular places - pools, which we have already talked about - the hotel complex has other interesting sports infrastructure.  Vacationers have the opportunity to improve and maintain their physical fitness in the fitness center and gymnasium.  Game sports are popular that contribute to the acquaintance and communication of people: tennis (3 courts), basketball, volleyball, beach volleyball.  Lonisera 4 (Turkey) offers its guests high-quality therapeutic procedures that restore strength: massage, Turkish bath, sauna. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The situation is typical for any Turkish hotel.  The hotel has its own ‚Äútravel manager‚Äù who recommends using the services of only one tour operator, usually not the cheapest one.  Motivation: vacationer medical insurance does not apply if he independently chooses another agency. </p><p>  However, this is cunning, since the health insurance in Turkey is really legitimate in this case too.  It‚Äôs just that the tour operator shares the percentage of profit with the hotel, hence this scarecrow. </p><p>  Vacationers who want to get the maximum pleasant experience from excursions are advised to consider several alternative options from different agencies. </p><p>  Interestingly, tourists from different tour operators often find themselves in the same transport, going on an excursion.  In the conversation, it turns out that someone paid half the money. </p><p>  During the tour, buses usually stop at certain stores so that tourists can purchase the goods and souvenirs they need.  Be critical of this.  Such a store - in share with the hotel, transfers him a percentage of the proceeds.  And the prices in them are not always the lowest.  As a rule, visiting the local market, you can find the same products, only their cost is 20% less. </p>

    <h2>  In Turkey - Haggle </h2><p>  The Turkish market should be a bargain.  This is a national tradition.  So, you went to the seller (the sellers are all as one - men) and inquired about the value of the item you liked.  He looks at the clouds and calls you a truly cloudy price that has nothing to do with reality.  Next - the word is yours.  An important point!  You should only voice your price when you are exactly buying a product.  ‚ÄúJust like that‚Äù is not allowed, it is against the rules and Turkish culture.  Do not buy - it is better to remain silent. </p><p>  Suppose you decide to buy.  Then call the price half as much as your opponent voiced.  He allegedly takes a break, runs to "confer" with his manager.  That is, it depicts a stormy contractual and thought process.  Its result is a confidential message from the seller that the manager (solely out of respect for you) agreed to sell the goods, only asks to increase the payment by 15%.  You add 5-7% to your amount.  Seller agrees.  Both you and he are satisfied.  This is Turkish trade. </p><h2>  Business opportunities </h2><p>  If desired, vacationing businessmen can always, without interrupting their holidays, take part in the business events of their company.  Firstly, thanks to free Wi-Fi, Internet banking is available to them around the clock, which means the ability to carry out banking operations.  Moreover, this function is carried out as quickly as if the place of stay of the business person were his native city, and not Turkey, Alanya.  The Lonisera Hotel also provides the opportunity to carry out a full-length international conference simultaneously to a whole group of businessmen using a modern conference system. </p>

    <h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  The hotel has a reputation as a good place for families and children.  Firstly, the presence of two children's pools is a completely safe place for active children's games.  In addition, the children's animation program of the hotel complex (which is noted by many vacationers) is really good. </p><p>  It is felt that the administration of Lonisera (Turkey) takes care of a full-fledged children's vacation.  Mom‚Äôs reviews - and this, you must agree, the most important thing - are positive, they recommend this hotel on social networks.  The playground is equipped with an awning, which protects the children from the overly active southern sun.  In the hotel, ice cream, fruit and juices are available in abundance to small customers.  Sports fields are not empty.  The cinema is open for children‚Äôs movies after dinner on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  On the beach, children are given complete freedom in the construction <span>of sand castles.</span> </p><p>  Little young naturalists like the mini zoo with pets: dwarf pigs, goats, sheep, ponies.  In the evening, children can take their souls to attractions: carousels, trampolines, electric cars - entertainment for every taste.  At 21-00 a disco begins, special for young citizens. </p><p>  Children leaving home remember the hospitable Lonicera Word (Turkey) and wish to visit it again. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The fact that the hotel complex we are considering has already "made a name for itself" in the resort business is eloquently evidenced by its advertising with various tour operators.  After reading in the booklet: ‚ÄúTurkey, Alanya, the Lonicera World Hotel, you should know that this is it. </p><p>  The hotel is developing steadily in the four-star segment of the resort business.  ‚ÄúWhy not five stars?‚Äù  - you ask.  This question, of course, is interesting ... According to experts, the quality of rest does not directly depend on the "stardom" of a hotel.  For example, according to non-individual reviews, the Lonisera hotel confidently gives odds to many of its five-star brothers in terms of the overall level of tourist services. </p><p>  By the way, in Asia and Africa, many hotels receive one or another number of ‚Äústars‚Äù depending on the size of the fee paid to the budget.  So, unconditionally following the criterion (*****), you may run into a "acquired reputation." </p><p>  Therefore, if you want to get a quality rest, and at the same time you are not too embarrassed by the differences in the size of the hall or the bathroom, then the Lonisera hotel is for you.  You will get five-star pleasure for the price of services that is typical for a four-star hotel.  Have a nice rest! </p>
