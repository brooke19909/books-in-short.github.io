If you think about it, in the modern world flags and emblems play a very, very significant role, since they combine the characteristics of the country, its spirit and basic features. </p><p>  This applies even more to the national emblem.  Particular attention is paid to the study of such science as heraldry.  We will turn to her. </p><h2>  What kind of science is this </h2><p>  Despite the intricate name, the essence of science is quite simple.  Heraldry studies the meaning of the symbols and colors used to create the coat of arms.  This kind of knowledge may seem useless at first glance, but you should not make <span>hasty conclusions.</span> </p>

    <p>  Heraldry originated during the Crusades and over time absorbed many traditions of chivalry, reflected the life and culture of feudal Europe. </p><p>  The coat of arms can tell a lot about its owner: strengths and weaknesses, the motto, his <span>life credo</span> and even social status.  All that is needed in order to understand all this is just to turn to the knowledge accumulated over many centuries of study. </p><h2>  Coat of arms and his master </h2><p>  Before proceeding to a more specific consideration of certain symbols, we determine to whom the coat of arms may belong.  In the understanding of modern man, this word is associated primarily with the state.  In Russia, for example, a double-headed eagle acts as such. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, as heraldry says, the meaning of symbols and colors can be important not only for a country, but also for a city, a specific territory, or even a specific genus.  By the way, it was the latter option that was previously the most common. </p><h2>  Color significance </h2><p>  It is easy to guess that the smallest, seemingly insignificant detail is important in the execution of the coat of arms, without which the meaning of the heraldic symbol will change radically.  Heraldry considers the meaning of symbols and colors both in aggregate and separately from each other.  It can be assumed that only the very first images that began to be placed on flags and armor were random in nature.  However, in the Middle Ages, when a fascination with the mystical features of certain phenomena and creatures was widespread, in an era when people tried to discern the hidden meaning and some kind of divine revelation in the world around them, they began to attach special importance to symbols and colors. </p>

    <p>  The importance of colors in heraldry is especially great, since it is precisely on them that attention is primarily paid.  In addition, the color further characterizes the owner of the coat of arms.  Heraldry uses seven colors: two metals and five enamels.  Initially, only four colors were used, but over time, the palette expanded by <span>mixing colors.</span>  Fur - ermine and squirrel are considered a separate type of heraldic color. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, let‚Äôs look at the basic meaning of colors in heraldry. </p><h2>  Gold </h2><p>  Most often, of course, gold is used in the arms.  In addition to the usual evidence of luxury and wealth, this color carries other information. </p><p>  The use of gold in the coat of arms initially testified to belonging to a very rich family, if not royal. </p><p>  Heraldry interprets the meaning of symbols and colors very clearly, so attention is paid to every detail.  Thus, the presence of gold elements in the coat of arms often testified to the presence of a solar component, which was considered a sign of elevation, majesty of the genus or territory. </p><h2>  Silver </h2><p>  If in the previous case there was an obvious reference to sunlight, then the soft silver tint represents the night light in the coat of arms.  In addition, this color speaks of the purity of the genus, its high origin and special trust from higher ones.  Silver has always spoken of being chosen. </p><h2>  Scarlet </h2><p>  Representatives of militant clans loved scarlet emblems and shields.  It was the shades of red that spoke of the courage, steadfastness and power of the bearers.  This <span>color is fiery,</span> powerful.  By the way, in the Slavic culture, there was even a custom of scarlet shields before a battle by sprinkling their own blood.  This not only frightened the enemies, but also provided powerful protection for the wearer. </p><p>  The Spartans were guided by approximately the same principle, choosing the shade of their clothes. </p><h2>  Blue </h2><p>  The predominance of blue in symbolism spoke of the commitment of carriers to the eternal ideals of beauty. </p>

    <p>  The azure shade on the shields and emblems was supposed to indicate clarity of judgment, impeccability and elitism. </p><h2>  Black </h2><p>  This color of shields speaks not only of mourning, but also of thoughtfulness, judiciousness, and nobleness of the wearer.  As a rule, this color is applied perpendicular lines over the entire surface.  Shields in heraldry are studied especially closely. </p><h2>  Why decorated shields </h2><p>  The tradition of placing various decals on the shield dates back to the time of the Crusades.  In the heat of battle, it was extremely difficult to distinguish your brothers in arms from the enemy, because the knightly armor looked about the same, and the battle formations constantly changed during the battle.  Even banners and banners could not always serve as distinctive signs.  That is why the noble knights began to place various symbolic images on the shields that distinguished their personal valor and served as <span>an identification mark</span> on the battlefield. </p>

    <p>  Very often on shields and emblems depict animals whose distinctive features were to tell others about the character of the knight.  Among the animals that are most often found on heraldic symbols, it is worth noting the lion, leopard, eagle.  The importance of animals in heraldry usually comes down to the identification of the volitional and heroic qualities of a knight who adorned his regalia with them. </p><h2>  Animals on the shield </h2><p>  So, for example, a lion in heraldry is traditionally considered a symbol of courage, courage and generosity.  An alternative to a lion is often a leopard.  Most often, the lion is depicted on the coat of arms or shield alone, however, sometimes you can see the image of several animals.  Such lions are considered lion cubs. </p>

    <p>  The eagle is also a very common heraldic symbol, it can even be said that after the lion's dominant position in numbers, the eagle occupies a second, no less confident place. </p><h2>  Heraldic flora </h2><p>  Plants in heraldry are no less important than animal images.  The use of various plants in heraldry has a long history.  The most common image among plants is the rose symbol.  The Queen of Flowers often takes pride of place on the arms of various noble families.  According to the laws of heraldry, only members of the royal family can afford to decorate their coat of arms with a wreath or garland of roses.  Another popular plant symbol is lily.  It symbolizes purity, holiness, purity. </p>

    <p>  Figures of <span>fantastic animals,</span> as a rule, were borrowed from folklore or mythology. </p><p>  Among such images, griffins, a phoenix bird, mermaids, famous basilisks, of course, Pegasus are most often found on the arms.
