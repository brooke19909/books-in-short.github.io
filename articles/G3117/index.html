If you explain it briefly and readily, then luck is a positive resolution of life situations.  Some people have luck in the workplace, others smile with happiness in their personal lives, still others win the lottery, and there are the luckiest people who are constantly doing well, as if their luck was chronic.  Even if something starts badly, then suddenly it goes into a happy ending.  The names of such minions of fate can often be seen on the pages of newspapers or on television. </p><p>  The luckiest person in the world is Croatian music teacher Franin Selak.  During his life, he repeatedly fell into terrible situations, but he always managed to get out of the water dry.  A series of his troubles began in 1962. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the luckiest person in the world" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14511/317401.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Series of troubles </h2><p>  <span>The railway accident</span> was the first of many accidents.  For unknown reasons, the train went off the rails, in which Selak was traveling to Dubrovnik.  The entire train collapsed into the ice river.  Everyone died, only a teacher from Croatia could survive, escaping with just a slight fright and slight scratches. </p><p>  A year later, Frein was in a plane crash.  He flew by plane to the city of Rijeka.  Suddenly, the plane door opened and Selak fell out.  As a result, 19 people died.  The Croat himself, again having escaped with fright, bruises and scratches, fell into a <span>haystack</span> and survived. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And again, <span>the luckiest man in the world</span> three years later experienced a severe shock.  The bus in which he rode off the road.  As a result, many died.  And our lucky again, in a state of shock, received only minor damage. </p><h2>  Another incident </h2><p>  The next event occurred in 1970, when Selak was driving in his own car.  Suddenly, the car caught fire.  In seconds, the Croat managed to get out of a burning car.  A moment later, it exploded.  Frein was not hurt at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the luckiest people" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14511/317402.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  Subsequent emergency occurred three years later.  An old <span>fuel pump</span> injected gasoline directly onto a running engine.  A fire has occurred.  This time, Frein Selak was left without hair - and nothing more. </p><p>  Then, for the whole 22 years, the luckiest man in the world lived quietly.  Until one day he was hit by a bus in his own hometown.  Doctors during the examination revealed the absence of any wounds whatsoever.  Just a shock. </p><h2>  Last accident </h2><p>  A year later, Selak went to travel in his car.  After turning on a road in the mountains, a Croat suddenly saw a truck rushing right at him.  He jumped out of the car, which stopped over a cliff, and hovered on a tree.  It was from there that he watched his car fly into the abyss.  The result is a slight shock. </p><h2>  Fortune </h2><p>  Fortunately, fortune did not turn away from the music teacher.  He was lucky in the lottery to win a huge amount of money. </p><p>  What happened next in the life of a Croat?  Different sources give different information.  According to some reports, he distributed all the money won to his relatives, so as not to tempt fate anymore.  The ego had plans to build a small chapel.  Another source says that the luckiest person in the world bought a house, a car and married a woman younger than him by 20 years.  Frein Selak also considered his previous four marriages to be disasters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the luckiest people on earth" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/319213.jpg" width="600"></div>
