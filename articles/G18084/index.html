And at the carnival, you can prepare a cat costume with your own hands for a boy.  This outfit can be created in many ways.  It all depends on the skills of the needlewoman, the time allotted for the preparation, and the availability of materials at hand.  In order to make a cat costume with your own hands for a boy, you need to clarify which fairy tale this character is from. </p><h2>  Puss in Boots </h2><p>  You can make such a cat costume with your own hands for a boy from the things in the house.  Pants can be worn ordinary, a bright mother's blouse will come up to them, on which they put on a belt or belt.  Cuffs and a large round collar can be sewn or cut out of paper. </p>

    <p>  Without high boots, boots can not be called finished cat costume.  With his own hands for the boy from thick paper bells are made, which are worn on the upper part of the shafts of any boots.  They have the shape of a truncated cone. </p><p>  Someone will decide that a cat costume for a boy has already been made.  A photo of a boy dressed as a cat in boots allows one to doubt this: where is the <span>wide-brimmed hat</span> with a feather and a sword? </p><p>  If you look carefully at the mezzanines, it is quite possible that the much-needed headdress was lying there.  Otherwise, the hat can be glued from cardboard.  And a feather, if this is also not in the house, can be easily cut out of paper, painted and cut into ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù at the edges.  You can also search for a sword among the boy‚Äôs toys or make it yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is best to make up the child‚Äôs face ‚Äúunder the cat‚Äù by drawing a nose and a mustache on it. </p><h2>  The simplest cat outfit </h2><p>  No matter how easy it is to choose the attributes for the outfit of a cat in boots, this may take a whole day.  But what if you need to get together in just a couple of hours?  Is it possible to assemble a New Year's cat costume with your own hands for a boy in such a short time? </p>

    <p>  Can!  Any outfit suitable in color will fit: brown, yellow, white, black.  The tail is done or not done, it depends on the availability of time and desire.  But ears need to be built. </p><p>  They are made from a hair band to which cardboard triangles are attached.  You can sheathe them with a fleecy fabric or paste over with velvet paper. </p><p>  If the rim is not at home, but you don‚Äôt want to buy it or if it‚Äôs not possible, you can do without it.  Simply, a strip should be cut out of paper, which should be glued in such a way as to produce a ring with a diameter equal to the head circumference.  This ring should be worn on the head so that it passes through the forehead. </p><p>  Now the front triangles are glued just over the forehead.  Such ears look no worse than those made of hair bands. </p><h2>  Simple cat half mask </h2><p>  Sometimes you want to make a cat costume with your own hands for a boy more fundamentally.  Then, instead of ears, you can make your child a simple half mask of thick paper.  To do this, it is enough to transfer this sample to cardboard and cut it out.  Having painted the craft, you need to make holes on the sides, into which to insert a string, elastic or ribbons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  First, from plasticine or clay, a template depicting a cat's face is stuck onto a glass cutting board or other surface.  Then a regular newspaper is cut into pieces of one or two centimeters in arbitrary shape.  The first layer of paper scraps is wetted with plain water and laid on a template.  All subsequent cover with glue or paste. </p><p>  When the thickness of the papier-m√¢ch√© becomes equal to two millimeters, the work can be stopped.  Now you should wait until the craft dries.  The last stage of work on the product is its coloring.  Any paint, from watercolors and gouache to oil, will do.  At the very end of the work, the mask can be varnished. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And you should definitely make holes on the sides into which you need to insert the ties. </p><h2>  Leopold the cat costume </h2><p>  This is a very cute cartoon character, extremely loved by children.  The outfit of Leopold's cat is also easy to make.  A craftswoman familiar with sewing can easily cope with the task. </p>

    <h2>  Sewing a jumpsuit </h2><p>  First you should sweep (bait) the details of the back and front. </p><ol><li>  For this purpose, the front part is placed face down on the front part of the back part so that the blue and green edges coincide. </li><li>  Seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù fasten parts along the blue and green lines. </li><li>  The same thing is done with two other parts of the back and front. </li><li>  The resulting halves-trousers are folded together, not twisting on the face, and wrap them together along the front line. </li><li>  Now you need to sweep the shoulder seams of the back with the front. </li></ol><p>  Trying out is done without turning the product over.  If necessary, you can make a correction directly on the figure, removing the unnecessary seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù.  But you need to be very careful so as not to stab the child. </p><p>  When the product is fitted to the thread on the figure, you can sew all the seams on the machine and sweep the sleeves at the side seams.  Without turning the parts, they are attached to the main part of the product so that the deeper recess of the sleeve is in front.  After trying on and adjusting the overalls, you can also sew these <span>seams with a machine seam.</span> </p><p>  After fitting, if corrections are not required, the basting is removed, and all edges of the parts are sketched on a typewriter or manually if there is no such function. </p><p>  From the bottom of the legs and sleeves they make a hem so that you can insert an elastic band or drawstring lace.  A zipper is inserted into the dorsal suture, and the collar is treated with an <span>oblique trim.</span> </p><p>  The tail is truncated, twisted and inserted inside a thick wire.  After that, he is sewn to the suit. </p><p>  <span>The overlay on the chest is</span> first treated with a cut or oblique trim, then it is attached to the jumpsuit in front.  Attach the part from above with threads matching in color to the overlay. </p><p>  Mittens and mask are prepared separately.  You can also sew boots.  But ordinary shoes are quite suitable. </p>
