    <h2>  Overview </h2><p>  One of the great places to relax in the Middle Kingdom is a tropical island and at the same time the Hainan province.  This is a favorite place for those who prefer to swim, sunbathe and be treated in the healing springs, which are quite a lot.  I must say that for Russians, especially residents of Siberia and the Far East, Hainan has long been a beaten track. </p><p>  The island is located in southern China.  It is often called paradise.  Once it was part of Eurasia.  Today, the Hainan is separated from China by the strait.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island is about thirty-four thousand square meters.  kilometers.  There are many extinct volcanoes on it, after the eruption of which formed thermal springs with healing properties.  This makes vacation on the island not only enjoyable, but also beneficial to health.  Hainan, according to many, is "eastern Hawaii."  There is everything that is characteristic of this tropical resort - coconut and banana palms, a turquoise sea, warm water, white sand on the beaches, a huge number of beautiful coral reefs, etc. The Russians chose the southern part of the island for relaxation.  There are several small resorts, for example, Dadonghai, Yalongwan and, of course, Sanya.  The number of hotels and large hotel complexes in this part of the island is constantly increasing.  They are able to satisfy any, even the most demanding tourist, choosing for himself the direction of Sanya.  Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 * (China) is one of them.  It is about him that will be discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2137147.jpg"></div>

This corner of the island is interesting for its not only natural, but also historical monuments.  Right in the lobby of the Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 * hotel there is a tour office where you can buy interesting tours with a Russian-speaking guide.  Some of our compatriots in their reviews write that excursions here are much more expensive than in other offices working nearby.  Russians recommend going to Monkey Island with a group, as it is far away.  But in many other interesting places you can get on your own by public transport.  A free bus runs to the thermal springs from the 4 * hotels adjacent to Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 * hotels.  At the reception you can get his schedule.

    <p>  As for the hotel itself, here the opinions of our countrymen are somewhat different.  Some really liked its location, while others thought it was uncomfortable.  Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 * is located on a hill, so there are many steps on its territory.  This circumstance is not entirely suitable for older tourists, as well as for those who are going to relax with young children.  The Russians were somewhat annoyed by the distance from the center.  On the other hand, this location provides a quiet and relaxing holiday away from noisy establishments. </p><p>  Some Russians note poor hotel management.  Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel 4 * was originally built only for local residents.  And today, judging by the reviews, the numbers of certain categories of foreigners are not populated.  For example, to the great regret of the Russians, only tourists from mainland China are accepted into two-story luxury apartments. </p><p>  As for the filling of numbers, there are no complaints about this issue.  The beds have very comfortable orthopedic mattresses.  As our compatriots say, it‚Äôs very disappointing that only Chinese channels are shown on TV.  Tourists note that there is enough furniture in the rooms: things can be safely placed both in the wardrobe and in large nightstands.  As for the bathrooms, our compatriots rated them quite high: the plumbing works fine, there is everything - soap, shampoo, etc. Unlike other Chinese hotels, Yuhuayuan Seaview Hotel even provides toothbrushes. </p><p>  But many people left negative reviews about the food: the trays are practically not updated, and the local cuisine prevails in the menu.  Therefore, choosing hotels in China, you need to consider that this approach is a feature of many local hotels. </p>
