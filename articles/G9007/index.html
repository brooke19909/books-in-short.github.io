But do not throw away stylish clothes because of such a ‚Äútrifle‚Äù!  After all, you can always sew shorts from old jeans, especially since no tailor skills are needed for this.  Well, perhaps the ability to hold scissors in hands, use a centimeter and a thread with a needle.  By the way, having shown your imagination, you can give yourself a cool summer new thing for free, as well as your spouse, children, other family members who still have denim pants, God knows how many years ago.  The main thing is to put on the ass and fasten in a belt!  Let's get started.

    <ol><li>  Put on your pants and take a closer look, figure out how long the old jeans shorts you want to make.  You can build very short - mini, almost completely bare legs.  A very winning option for those who have long, slender, beautiful shapes.  You can stay at the classic length - to the middle of the hips, slightly above the knees.  For women of mature age, full of the most successful option is when the shorts from old jeans will cover their knees.  In this case, they will be close to the bridges. </li><li>  The length is chosen, mark it directly with your usual chalk.  Now <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself jeans shorts" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/111815.jpg" width="230"></div>  Think about how you want to finish the legs.  Will you ‚Äúcut‚Äù the edges, hem the hem or leave them torn (it‚Äôs cooler and your old jeans shorts will become youthful).  If to hem - twist the edges twice, inward.  Each turn should be at least 2 cm. If you restrict yourself to a ‚Äútear‚Äù, you should also make a margin of 3-3.5 cm. Take these calculations into account when you cut off your legs to sew jeans shorts with your own hands. </li><li>  Another nuance.  It applies to everyone, but is especially relevant for ladies with large buttocks: because of them, clothes slightly rise from behind.  Therefore, the legs should not be cut off smoothly, but as if in a semicircle, behind with some allowance. </li><li>  Cut off?  Let's finish.  The edges were cut, tucked up, stitched?  Sew on them a strip of lace or embroidery stitches.  If the lace is tight, pick it up a little, and let it, like a frill, protrude beyond the edges of the legs.  It will turn out gently and originally.  Also trim your pockets.  If the shorts are tight-fitting, a belt is not needed - open the straps for it, and sew a lace strip along the belt line.  This design is especially beautiful on a dark shade of indigo.  You will get a cute, stylish, elegant thing. </li><li>  Have you decided to limit yourself to a fringe with the ‚Äúrvanka‚Äù effect?  And this is not a problem.  Cut off the legs with blunt scissors.  Of course, you‚Äôll torment, but you should also ‚Äúgrind‚Äù the edges well, it will be easier to dissolve the threads from the fabric for fringe.  To increase the effect, rub the rest of the legs with sandpaper - you will get a vintage fabric aging, which is now very, very fashionable.  An additional finish for such shorts will be various metal rivets.  And you can make small horizontal cuts on the shorts, pull in narrow colored ribbons (such as those that tied candy boxes).  It will be very original, almost exclusive. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Creative workshop</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crafts" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/111817.jpg" width="300"></div><strong></strong>

    <p>  If you look, old jeans are an inexhaustible source in order to craft various crafts with your own hands.  Engaged in needlework, do you like knitting?  In this case, from them you can sew a cover-bucket for knitting needles and tangles with threads.  Do you need a practical bag for going to the beach or shopping?  Again, it is sewn from jeans.  Moreover, old jeans are suitable for altering them in a skirt, trim old, scratched shoes or sandals with material, and much, much more.  Imagine, invent and bring your ideas to life, make yourself and the world around you more beautiful! </p>
