    <h2>  Family of the future mathematician </h2><p>  <span>Therefore, at first, the family in which Joseph Louis Lagrange was born was quite wealthy.</span>  <span>But the father of the family was inept, and yet very persistent businessman.</span>  <span>Therefore, they soon stood on the brink of ruin.</span>  <span>In the future, Lagrange expresses a very interesting opinion about this life circumstance that befell his family.</span>  <span>He believes that if his family continued to live a rich and prosperous life, then perhaps Lagrange would never have a chance to connect his fate with mathematics.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>In 1759, thanks to a proposal by Euler, Lagrange took up the post of foreign member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences.</span>  <span>Euler showed a little trick here: after all, he really wanted Lagrange to live as close to him as possible, and thus the young scientist could move to Berlin.</span> </p><h2>  Work and overwork </h2><p>  <span>Lagrange was not only engaged in research in mathematics, mechanics, and astronomy.</span>  <span>He also created the scientific community, which later became the <span>Royal Academy of</span> Sciences of Turin.</span>  <span>But at the price that Joseph Louis Lagrange developed a huge number of theories in exact fields and at that time became the greatest mathematician and astronomer in the world, there were bouts of depression.</span> </p><p>  <span>The beginning to remind myself of constant overwork.</span>  <span>Doctors in 1761 declared: they are not going to be responsible for the health of Lagrange unless he dies his research ardor and stabilizes the work schedule.</span>  <span>The mathematician did not show willfulness and obeyed the recommendations of doctors.</span>  <span>His health has stabilized.</span>  <span>But depression did not leave him until the end of his life.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Astronomy Research </h2><p>  <span>In 1762, an interesting competition was announced by the Paris Academy of Sciences.</span>  <span>To participate in it was necessary to provide work on the movement of the moon.</span>  <span>And here Lagrange manifests himself as an astronomer researcher.</span>  <span>In 1763, he sends his work on the liberation of the moon for consideration by the commission.</span>  <span>And the article itself arrives at the Academy shortly before the arrival of Lagrange himself.</span>  <span>The fact is that mathematics had to travel to London, during which he became seriously ill and was forced to stop in Paris.</span> </p><p>  <span>But here Lagrange also found great benefits: after all, in Paris, he managed to meet another great scientist - D'Alembert.</span>  <span>In the French capital, Lagrange receives an award for his research on the libration of the moon.</span>  <span>And another prize is awarded to the scientist - two years later he was awarded for research on two moons of Jupiter.</span> </p><h2>  High post </h2><p>  <span>In 1766, Lagrange returned to Berlin and received an offer to become president of the Academy of Sciences and head of its physics and mathematics department.</span>  <span>Many Berlin scholars have very welcomed Lagrange into their society.</span>  <span>He managed to establish strong friendships with mathematicians Lambert, Johann Bernoulli.</span>  <span>But in this society there were also ill-wishers.</span>  <span>One of them was Castiglion, who was three dozen years older than Lagrange.</span>  <span>But after a while, their relationship improved.</span>  <span>Lagrange married a cousin of Castiglion named Vittoria.</span>  <span>However, their marriage was childless and unhappy.</span>  <span>Often a sick wife died in 1783.</span> </p><h2>  The main book of the scientist </h2><p>  <span>In total, the scientist spent more than twenty years in Berlin.</span>  <span>The most productive work is considered the "Analytical Mechanics" of Lagrange.</span>  <span>This study was written at the time of his maturity.</span>  <span>There are only a few great scientists whose heritage would have included such a fundamental work.</span>  <span>"Analytical mechanics" is comparable to the "Beginnings" of Newton, as well as with the "Pendulum Clock" Huygens.</span>  <span>It also formulated the famous ‚ÄúLagrange Principle‚Äù, the more complete name of which is the ‚ÄúD'Alembert-Lagrange Principle‚Äù.</span>  <span>It belongs to the field of general equations of dynamics.</span> </p><h2>  Transfer to Paris.  Sunset of life </h2><p>  <span>In 1787, Lagrange moved to Paris.</span>  <span>He was completely satisfied with the work in Berlin, but this had to be done for the reason that the position of foreigners after the death of Frederick II in the city was gradually deteriorating.</span>  <span>A royal audience was held in honor of Lagrange in Paris, and the mathematician even got an apartment in the Louvre.</span>  <span>But at the same time, he begins a serious bout of depression.</span>  <span>In 1792, the scientist married a second time, and now the union was happy.</span> </p><p>  <span>At the end of his life, the scientist has published many more works.</span>  <span>The last work he planned to undertake was the revision of Analytical Mechanics.</span>  <span>But the scientist failed to do this.</span>  <span>On April 10, 1813, Joseph Louis Lagrange died.</span>  <span>His quotes, especially one of the last, characterize his whole life: "I did my job ... I never hated anyone and did no harm to anyone."</span>  <span>The death of the scientist, like life, was calm - he left with a sense of accomplishment.</span> </p>
