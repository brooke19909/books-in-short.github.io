    <h2>  Who will be given a loan without a certificate? </h2><p>  Not everyone will be able to get a cash loan without an income statement.  If you have earlier outstanding debts, bad credit history or other negative factors, the manager will definitely see this.  In this case, you will most likely be refused.  Loans without collateral and without income statement are considered high-risk.  Therefore, if you do not have a very good reputation, you will not see money. </p><p>  To try to get a loan, you must meet the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  Be a citizen of the country in which you intend to receive money. </li><li>  Have the right age.  In each financial institution, this indicator may vary.  The lower limit can be set within 18-24 years.  Upper - 60‚Äì70 years. </li><li>  Be permanently registered in the region where the branch of the selected bank is located. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Electronic loan </h2><p>  If you do not want to fool your head by collecting various certificates and confirmations, you need to think about where you can get the money in the simplest way. </p><p>  The easiest way to get a cash loan without income statement is on the Internet.  Often you don‚Äôt even have to get up from a sofa or an armchair.  This is extremely convenient.  The decision to issue such a cash loan without collateral and without income statement is taken literally in 15-20 minutes.  But this is far from the only advantage of online loans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Electronic credit can be issued in almost any currency, and sometimes in cryptocurrency.  Money can be credited to a bank card, electronic wallet or mobile phone.  But the most important thing is to get a loan without income statements in this way is most real. </p><p>  Here are a few organizations where this can be done: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúQuick money‚Äù, ‚ÄúLoan in cash to paycheck‚Äù - from 1 to 25 thousand for up to 16 days. </li><li>  Kredito24, "Loan" - you can not give back a whole month.  Possible amount - up to 30 thousand Russian rubles. </li><li>  iZaimo, iZaimo - issued for a period of 2 months to a year.  The maximum amount is 50 thousand rubles, the minimum is five thousand. </li></ul><p>  The only drawback of such loans is the very high interest rates.  There is nothing surprising.  You do not want (or cannot) confirm your income.  Therefore, the bank is thus insured against non-refund. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan without collateral without income statement" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2012103.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  MFI </h2><p>  If you need a not too large amount, it is easiest to contact a microfinance organization.  Reliable banks practically do not issue mini-loans in the amount of 1 to 15 thousand.  Earnings of the bank for them will be so meager that you should not get involved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Therefore, if you want to get a quick cash loan without a certificate of income, you have a direct road to the MFI.  Most likely, they will not ask unnecessary questions there.  They are not interested in either your bad credit history or the source of income.  For such firms, the main thing is that you sign a document confirming your consent to pay considerable interest.  MFIs often provide loans even to officially unemployed people. </p><p>  Interest rates here are very large and can reach 3% per day.  And the loan term, on the contrary, is small and is no more than a month.  Conditions, of course, are so-so.  But if you need money immediately, this can be a good way out. </p><h2>  Express loan </h2><p>  Such a loan without a passport income certificate is easy to obtain.  In this case, we can talk about amounts in the range from 5 to 50 thousand rubles.  Banks most often give out such loans most of all, including without documents confirming the level of income.  More often than not, a customer simply receives a credit card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apply for a loan without income statements" class="if" height="469" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2012105.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In this case, practically any client who does not have gross violations in the credit history can apply for a quick cash loan without an income statement.  Moreover, if you apply with a similar request to the bank where you have already issued a loan earlier, the percentage may be slightly reduced.  Banks love to demonstrate their loyalty to regular customers.  In various financial institutions, the interest rate on such loans can vary from 28 to 50%.  And the decision to issue money will be made in two hours. </p><h2>  Credit "Standard" </h2><p>  Amounts from 50 to 300 thousand rubles fall under this concept.  Today it is one of the most popular banking products.  Most often, for a standard loan, you will still be asked to prepare a complete set of documents.  But it could be otherwise. </p><p>  Here are the banks that issue a loan without income statement: </p><ul><li>  Mail Bank - asks you for 29.5% per annum and agrees to issue an amount of up to 1 million rubles for a maximum of 5 years. </li><li>  City Bank - the rate is up to 25%, the maximum possible amount is 1 000 000 Russian rubles for a period of 60 months. </li><li>  Renaissance Credit - will offer to overpay 27.7% per year and issue no more than half a million for up to 60 months.  At the same time, you will be asked to confirm that at the last place of work you worked for at least 3 months. </li></ul><h2>  Large loan amount </h2><p>  In the main part of banking institutions, it is almost impossible to obtain a loan in the amount of from half a million to 1.5 million rubles without a guarantee of their solvency.  In addition, about 75% of institutions will ask you to provide an additional guarantor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quick cash loan without income statement" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2012108.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Although it is difficult to find a financial institution where they will give out such an amount and not ask how much you earn, it is still possible.  For example, you can try your luck at Sberbank.  Especially if you are their regular customers and get a salary or pension there. </p><p>  If you still manage to find a bank that agrees to issue such a loan, the interest rate may make you happy.  It can be from 17 to 25%. </p><h2>  Large loan </h2><p>  It‚Äôs almost impossible to get a cash loan of more than 1.5 million rubles without collateral and a salary certificate.  No bank will give out such a large amount without making sure that you are at least theoretically able to return it.  This is an extremely big risk for a bank. </p><p>  In such a case, a statement of income can be replaced only by a very large pledge or two or three reliable guarantors.  How large should the pledge be?  Calculate yourself: the size of the proposed loan can be no more than 75% of the value of the collateral. </p><p>  The decision to grant such a loan can be made for quite some time.  Most often, approval takes from 5-6 days to 2-3 weeks.  During this time, the bank will check all your ins and outs and verify the liquidity of the property offered as collateral. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which banks issue loans without income statement" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2012109.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get a loan without income statement? </h2><p>  There are several situations that contribute to the early adoption of a decision on the issuance of a loan without confirmation of financial well-being: </p><ul><li>  "Salary" client.  This is a category of borrowers who receive wages in the same bank where they applied for a loan.  For such clients, the manager may offer more favorable conditions or not ask about the level and source of your income. </li><li>  The customer has an ideal credit history.  The bank carries out a scoring procedure and analyzes previous requests for money.  Based on the information received, a positive decision can be made regardless of whether you have 2-PIT or not. </li><li>  Writing a certificate in the form developed by the bank.  If you do not want to confirm the income officially, the financial institution may offer you to bring a certificate in free spelling or fill out a special form developed by the bank.  The director, accountant or any person with access to the press of the enterprise will be able to ‚Äúdraw‚Äù the required salary for you. </li><li>  A document confirming your solvency can be a certificate of a deposit in a bank, documents for a car no older than 7 years old, the presence of any real estate and more.  Each bank has a list of such confirmations.  Some even require a diploma of higher education. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you are sufficiently aware of where to get a cash loan without a certificate of income and if necessary you can do it.  The main thing in this situation is to read the contract very carefully.  This is especially true for footnotes written in small print.  It is there that most often hidden pitfalls of any loan. </p>
