    <h2>  Earning </h2><p>  Special attention also requires earnings in our organization today.  It would seem, where, where, and in a private pension fund there should be no problems with him.  But in practice this is not at all true.  What do employees of the organization say about this? </p><p>  Frankly speaking, in terms of earnings, NPF KIT Finance receives not the best reviews from its employees.  The situation here is exactly the same as in most firms: there are delays, and debts, and fraud.  Initially, you are promised one salary, but in practice, after signing the contract, another.  Less than originally intended. </p><p>  All this pushes away from work in NPF KIT Finance.  In any case, you can precisely guarantee the safety of your retirement savings.  It pleases many.  Just hope that at NPF KIT Finance you can earn big money without any problems, it‚Äôs not worth it.

Often, he repels job seekers.  So what can employees and job seekers in this field say about NPF KIT Finance?  The reviews here are mixed.  In the same way as in most other cases. </p><p>  What is it about?  The fact that the work schedule is very busy for applicants.  It is difficult to cope with the load, constantly leaving for part-time jobs, replacements and overtime.  Although initially you are promised a shift schedule, moreover flexible. </p><p>  But visitors in this area are more satisfied.  Our today's organization operates all working day, which allows everyone to contact KIT Finance to receive certain services.  So for today's job seekers, our organization does not offer the best schedule, but for customers, it‚Äôs the best. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  CJSC KIT Finance (NPF) receives reviews from its customers for many indicators.  For example, for recruited staff.  Nobody wants to contact a prestigious company, but at the same time communicate with boors and people who are not versed in their work. </p><p>  In this sense, opinions were divided.  Many claim that you can‚Äôt count on a respectful attitude from the staff of NPF KIT Finance.  Others claim the opposite.  But what to believe is incomprehensible.  Of course, there is some truth in the first statements, and in the second.  It all depends on the people as a whole.  In some regions, KIT Finance does not have the best employees.  But no one is safe from this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jsc kit finance npf reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259804.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main drawback emphasized by the participants is lack of education.  For such a phenomenon, NPF KIT Finance does not earn the best customer reviews.  That is, getting a detailed, detailed consultation on the services of the corporation is unlikely to succeed.  There are so far few well-versed personnel.  And this upsets some. </p><h2>  Recoil </h2><p>  Turning to <span>non-state pension funds,</span> I would like to get some kind of return from them.  This is a normal occurrence.  For example, return on investment.  NPF "KIT finance" customer reviews for this is not the best.  Yes, someone says that the return will be wonderful.  But is it really so? </p><p>  Now the situation demonstrates only that inflation will ‚Äúeat up‚Äù all your profits.  More precisely, it turns out that way.  No one is safe from the crisis.  It has an impact on all matters related to finance.  Therefore, when contacting KIT Finance, keep in mind that a lot of money will not work here.  In principle, in the same way as in any other non-state pension fund.  No need to be surprised. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kit finance npf employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259808.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Although initially you will be lured here by the mountains of gold "and a huge profit from investments. A certain trick, deception, for which KIT Finance (NPF) does not earn the best reviews. Keep in mind that the main task of any organization is to lure customers. How is it will happen - this is another question. So do not be surprised if your expectations regarding income in the corporation are not met. Be prepared for this. </p><h2>  The trust </h2><p>  Recently, the so-called reliability rating has played a huge role.  It shows how faithful the organization is.  Is it possible to trust her or is it better to look for another corporation for investments? </p><p>  NPF KIT Finance has a relatively high reliability rating.  If you look at the statistics, you can see that our organization today is recognized as the best.  More precisely, it is at the very top of the rating of all non-state pension funds in Russia.  In other words, you can trust her. </p><p>  To be more precise, in the rating of NPF "KIT Finance" is approximately 3-6th places.  Not so bad if you think about it.

    <h2>  Surprises </h2><p>  What else do you pay attention to?  Any company that manages finances has some negative aspects.  And KIT Finance also has them.  Occasionally, you may notice how some participants talk about the illegal use of investments by company management.  Someone assures that all this is slander.  But just why then sometimes customers can‚Äôt get their money back? </p><p>  It can be said that sometimes KIT Finance can indeed illegally use money.  To prove this is almost impossible.  And they try to hide similar surprises.  Not the best trick for ranking.  After such troubles, I don‚Äôt really want to trust NPF KIT Finance.  Customer reviews nonetheless remain at a high level.  Many say that fraud news is simply the work of competitors.  This possibility cannot be ruled out. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, what conclusions can be drawn from all this?  NPF KIT Finance receives mixed reviews.  And it‚Äôs impossible to say for sure whether to become a member of the organization.  It just won't work.  Everyone decides for himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf kit finance rating and reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259810.jpg"></div>
