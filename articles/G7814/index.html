How to distinguish a restored iPhone from a new one</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Apple phones have been the most popular phones for ten years, despite the high cost.  In an effort to buy the coveted iPhone cheaper than its market value, their fans go to different tricks.  The most popular way is to purchase refurbished phones.  Let's find out what is the peculiarity of such devices, how to distinguish them from new ones, and whether it is worth buying at all. </p><h2>  What is a restored iPhone and how is it different from the new </h2><p>  A similar name is given to a smartphone that has already been repaired and again went on sale at a discount.  As a rule, such devices, because of their lower price, are sold in poor countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dealnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restored iPhone: Pros and Cons" class="if uuid-2928589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928589.jpg"></div><p>  A similar procedure is practiced by all major manufacturers of such devices: Samsung, ASUS, Apple and others. </p><p>  Usually, devices returned to the manufacturer for some reason fall under restoration.  In order not to incur losses, such a smartphone is sent to the factory, where it is carefully checked and, if there are malfunctions, put in order.  Then it goes on sale again, with an official guarantee. </p><p>  Such an apparatus cannot be recognized by eye.  It is completely identical only to the one that came off the assembly line in appearance, stuffing, software and configuration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to distinguish a reconditioned device from a used one </h2><p>  Quite often, out of ignorance, the restored iPhone is correlated with a used device.  However, this is not quite true. </p><ul><li>  The restored iPhone is actually new.  Therefore, it does not and cannot have traces of use or activation.  It is pasted with factory protective films and is fully equipped. </li><li>  When repairing at the factory, defective iPhone parts are always replaced with new ones.  If you open such a device inside, you will not see traces of soldering, gluing or other repairs. </li><li>  Such a smartphone is covered by the manufacturer‚Äôs warranty, which lasts 1 year.  Therefore, if the restored iPhone does not work, it can be returned for repair to an official service center or replaced within the statutory 14 days. </li></ul><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  There are two types of smartphones of this kind: </p><ul><li>  Manufacturer refurbished. </li><li>  Seller refurbished. </li></ul><h2>  Manufacturer refurbished </h2><p>  Translated from English, this phrase means "restored at the factory."  That is, devices of this category were repaired by specialists who assembled them.  So, everything was done at the highest level, in accordance with Apple standards.  All new parts that are replaced instead of faulty ones are original, not Chinese copies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dealnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to distinguish a restored iPhone from a new one" class="if uuid-2928607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928607.jpg"></div><p>  Any manufacturer refurbished phone is almost no different from a new one.  And if nevertheless the restored iPhone is broken again - it can be replaced under the Apple warranty, repaired or refunded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite their excellent characteristics, such devices are sold at a lower price.  Moreover, on the same official sites and stores where new ones are.  However, the manufacturer officially confirms that the phone has undergone the repair process and this is indicated in the accompanying papers for the device. </p><h2>  How to distinguish from a new refurbished iPhone manufacturer refurbished </h2><p>  Although the appearance of both the new and the refurbished smartphone is indistinguishable from each other, Apple Corporation is trying to be honest with customers in this matter.  Therefore, she introduced a special marking that helps to recognize the manufacturer refurbished smartphone. </p><p>  How to check whether the restored iPhone or not?  The manufacturer provides several simple and affordable ways to do this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="drfone.wondershare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it worth taking an officially restored iPhone" class="if uuid-2928563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928563.jpg"></div><ul><li>  First method.  How to distinguish a restored iPhone from a new one?  Pay attention to the design of his box.  The repaired devices, regardless of the model, are placed in white packaging with a gray inscription on the front.  There are no other images there. <div class="photo" data-original="itiran.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restored iPhone: Pros and Cons" class="if uuid-2928628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928628.jpg"></div></li><li>  In addition to the design, each such box has a number of identification marks.  Next to the description of the device and its serial number should be the letters RFB, which means refurbished (restored).  Also on the packaging itself in a narrow oval frame is written Apple Certified Pre-Owned.  This means that Apple officially confirms that this unit was under repair. <div class="photo" data-original="www.macrumors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Refurbished iPhone not working" class="if uuid-2928574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928574.jpg"></div></li><li>  If for some reason there is no box at the time of check, you need to pay attention to the serial number of the device that is in doubt.  In officially restored, it always starts with the letter F.  For comparison, for new Apple smartphones, serial numbers begin with the letter M (for sale in stores) or with the letter P (custom-made models). </li></ul><h2>  Is it worth buying </h2><p>  Is it worth taking an officially restored iPhone?  Of course, yes.  Indeed, despite the repair, in fact this is a new device, the first user of which becomes its buyer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="viralbiases.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Refurbished iPhone: How to Distinguish" class="if uuid-2928662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928662.jpg"></div><p>  Even if it has already been activated before the repair, it is reflashed at the factory, and a different serial number is assigned. </p><p>  In addition, the device costs less than a new one, while still under official warranty.  Therefore, the probability of its breakdown is the same as that of not restored. </p><p>  The main problem when buying such a smartphone is a reliable seller.  Otherwise, this phone can be an excellent budget option for all fans of Apple products, with the same level of quality and service. </p><h2>  IPhone seller refurbished </h2><p>  This type of repair translated from English means "repaired by the seller."  That is, the manufacturing plant has nothing to do with the restoration of such devices.  This means that it does not give guarantees, so the quality of such a repair is akin to a big lottery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.i-rite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to buy a refurbished iPhone" class="if uuid-2928619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928619.jpg"></div><p>  In fairness, it is important to note that sometimes domestic masters can perfectly restore an iPhone, and it will serve faithfully for a long time.  However, such a case is an exception, not a rule. </p><p>  The main disadvantage of this restoration is the quality of the parts.  Since the original ones are not cheap, masters acquire Chinese counterparts, which often quickly fail or interact poorly with the device itself. </p><h2>  The main methods of such recovery </h2><p>  To fix such an apparatus, repairmen use different methods.  Many of them border fraud.  Often they try to pass off a seller refurbished iPhone as an Apple restored or just used, but not repaired.  For this purpose, go to the following tricks. </p><ul><li>  Collect one iPhone from parts of other devices of the same brand. </li><li>  Repair breakdowns, but do not replace faulty parts. </li><li>  They sell a smartphone with a box and documentation from another device.  Or complete it with Chinese headphones and charging. </li><li>  There are cases when, together with the original packaging and papers, they sell a Chinese fake of good quality, which only specialists can distinguish by eye. </li><li>  It is very rare, but it happens that as a seller refurbished they sell a real manufacturer refurbished in excellent condition, but with an expired warranty. </li></ul><h2>  Difference between seller refurbished and manufacturer refurbished </h2><p>  Although both types of recovery are aimed at tidying up the substandard apparatus, and then selling it again, it is achieved in various ways.  Therefore, you should be aware of their main differences. </p><ul><li>  Seller refurbished does not have an Apple warranty. </li><li>  It can be activated or blocked. </li><li>  Such an iPhone, as a rule, has traces of use. <div class="photo" data-original="www.cultofmac.com" data-author=": Warren R.M. Stuart/Flickr CC, "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the difference between a restored iPhone" class="if uuid-2928616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928616.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  It is noteworthy that all these obvious shortcomings of seller refurbished may not affect its price.  It often costs the same as a refurbished factory, for which unscrupulous sellers are desperately trying to give it out. </p><h2>  How to distinguish seller refurbished from manufacturer refurbished </h2><p>  If the iPhone that was being repaired by domestic masters cannot be confused with a new smartphone, then it can simply not be distinguished from a restored one at the factory.  However, to be careful, it is not difficult to find out which device came into your hands.  True, the above methods of how to check whether the restored iPhone or not (marking the box and the serial number of the device) will not particularly help here.  Indeed, on the seller refurbished smartphone and its packaging absolutely any data can be indicated.  But their veracity is very doubtful. </p><p>  The following are effective ways to help determine if a restored iPhone (and whether it was done in a factory or in the basement around the corner). </p><ul><li>  The first thing that seller refurbished always gives out is its appearance.  Pay attention to the presence on it of scratches, scuffs, chips.  While in the manufacturer refurbished they can not be.  In addition, both new and refurbished at the factory are always covered with protective films.  But the artisanal one does not have them or they are not like that. </li><li>  IMEI - this is another weak link in the "victims" of domestic repair.  You should not be lazy and compare it with what is indicated in the device‚Äôs menu, on the box, on the back cover of the phone (up to the sixth model for iPhones, it was located there), as well as on the carriage for a SIM card. </li><li>  IMEI can also be used for another way to check the smartphone.  There is a whole list of sites where by entering this code, you can find out data about the device.  Moreover, not only its color and characteristics, but also whether it was lost or repaired under an official guarantee.  Its term should also be indicated there. <div class="photo" data-original="iphoneimei.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restored iPhone: Pros" class="if uuid-2927626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2927626.jpg"></div></li><li>  It will not be superfluous to check the similarity of all "serial".  Including what is inside the USB-connector for charging (for original smartphones from Apple it is always indicated this way).  In the phone‚Äôs menu, the serial number, like IMEI, the name of the model, etc. are located at the following address: ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù <em>‚Üí</em> ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAbout this device‚Äù. </li><li>  Another property that only a new iPhone or restored at the factory possesses is inactivity.  At the same time, if the device was already in use or assembled from several others, it was already registered on the official Apple website.  Otherwise, it could not be used.  Check it out is very simple.  From the "About this device" section, the <span>serial number of the</span> device is recognized.  Next, you need to go to the official Apple website in the "Checking the right to service and support" section.  In the indicated field ‚Äúserial‚Äù is entered (note that it never contains the letter ‚Äúo‚Äù, only zero) and a verification code.  If the phone is new or officially restored, the following message ‚ÄúMust activate iPhone‚Äù should appear.  In other cases, the system will display warranty information.  By the way, if the purchased phone is not an iPhone at all, but a Chinese fake, when you enter the serial number, the system will not find it and will offer to check it again. </li></ul><p>  Do not forget that all these methods, how to check whether the restored iPhone or not, help to distinguish only devices of the seller refurbished category.  Those that underwent factory repairs have a special marking. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Having figured out how to check whether the restored iPhone or not, it is worth considering the pros and cons of buying a variety of seller refurbished. </p><p>  Such devices have the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  No manufacturer warranty. </li><li>  Due to the poor quality of parts, such smartphones can work poorly or break quickly. </li><li>  The phone may be stolen, and this is fraught with problems with law enforcement or blocking the device‚Äôs operating system. <div class="photo" data-original="www.rte.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is iPhone Restored" class="if uuid-2928667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928667.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  As for the advantages of acquiring such an iPhone, it‚Äôs only its lower cost that falls into this category. </p><h2>  Should I buy seller refurbished </h2><p>  Having considered the pros and cons of the restored iPhone seller refurbished (more precisely, just one plus), we can definitely advise everyone and everyone not to buy such a device.  After all, it is not just used (although smartphones in excellent condition are often found among such equipment), but a device of dubious origin, as well as quality.  Therefore, if you purchase a restored iPhone, then only after factory repair, and nothing else. </p><h2>  Where are officially refurbished phones sold </h2><p>  Due to the lower cost (compared to new ones), manufacturer refurbished iPhones are very much in demand.  Therefore, they are sold not only in specialized company stores, but practically by all large networks of household appliances, as well as through Internet resources.  Even on the official website of Apple there is a section of restored equipment where you can order not only an iPhone, but also other products of the company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Refurbished iPhone: Cons" class="if uuid-2928640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/2928640.jpg"></div><p>  Where to buy a refurbished refurbished iPhone manufacturer to be sure of its quality? </p><p>  First of all, it‚Äôs worth looking in stores or on sites that officially work with Apple.  Moreover, when buying, you need to ask questions and ask to show documents confirming the existence of such trade relations.  The ideal option is when you have the opportunity to personally inspect the device and its documentation when buying.  And also conduct mandatory testing of –Ü–Ü and serial number of the phone. </p><p>  If the device is purchased by hand, it is important to be doubly careful.  In this case, all warranty documents, instructions and boxes must be available, and the numbers on them must match.  If there is nothing one or the data on the device and the accompanying papers differ, it is better to refuse to purchase goods from this seller.  After all, an iPhone is too expensive a pleasure to spend on it and get an inoperative device at the exit. </p>
