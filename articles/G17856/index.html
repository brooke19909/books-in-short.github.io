It is believed that this place is great for tourists who prefer outdoor activities.  Expensive hotels in this area are adjacent to budget ones, and any vacationer can easily choose suitable accommodation here.  Tourists who prefer comfort can book rooms at the five-star Sea Life Family Resort Hotel.  Many vacationers consider it one of the best recreation centers in Konyaalti and Antalya. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  According to the information provided to customers on the websites of tour operators, this hotel is located in Konyaalti on the first coastline.  But, as some tourists note in their reviews on specialized Internet sites, this is not entirely true.  Vacationers have a good opinion about this hotel, mainly because of the quality service and comfortable rooms.  The location of this hotel, many tourists consider, unfortunately, somewhat unfortunate. </p><p>  This complex was built really on the first coastline.  However, in order to get to the beach, its guests have to cross a very busy highway leading to Kemer.  Drivers in Turkey do not care too much about pedestrians and are often reckless.  Therefore, hotel guests have to overcome the road (including at traffic lights) almost by running.  With young children, this, of course, may not be particularly convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea Life Family Resort Hotel" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2032946.jpg" width="518"></div>

From Antalya Airport, a tour operator shuttle bus to this hotel can be reached very quickly.  Usually the journey takes no more than 20 minutes.  The flight Moscow - Antalya itself is also not particularly long.  So too much on the way to the resort vacationers booked rooms in this complex do not get tired. </p><h2>  General Description Sea Life Family Resort Hotel </h2><p>  They accept guests at this hotel in two multi-story buildings of Mediterranean construction.  It belongs to the Sea Life Family Resort Hotel (Turkey) type of city.  That is, he has almost no own territory.  The check-in time for check-in here is 15 hours.

However, reconstructions and repairs hereafter were carried out relatively frequently.  Therefore, the decoration of the rooms here, judging by the reviews of vacationers, is neat and beautiful, and the furniture in the rooms is new. </p><p>  This hotel operates exclusively on an all-inclusive basis.

For children over the age of one year, a separate bed can only be provided for a fee of 70% of the cost of living.  For adults, extra beds are not available in this hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Smoking is not allowed in the hotel rooms.

    <h2>  What is a beach? </h2><p>  The road to the sea from the Sea Life Family Resort Hotel 5 *, as already mentioned, is not too convenient.  However, the beach of this hotel itself has earned good reviews from vacationers.  It is quite large in size, and there are a lot of sunbeds.  There are never any crowds on the beach of the hotel.  The only thing is that on weekends you can sometimes see locals here.  This beach is positioned by tour operators as belonging to the hotel.  However, in fact, the coastline along the entire length in Konyaalti is the property of the city.  Therefore, local residents can relax here completely freely.  Previously, this beach really belonged to Sea Life Family Resort Hotel 5 *.  But a few years ago, the city administration banned hotels in any way restricting residents from visiting the coastline. </p>

    <p>  Sun loungers on the beach are new and comfortable.  Hotel guests can use them for free.  The beach of the hotel has earned very good reviews for a sufficient number of ballot boxes.  Tourists do not need to collect garbage in bags in order to throw it somewhere. </p><p>  Near the <span>Sea Life Family Resort Hotel the beach is very clean, which made a pleasant impression on holidaymakers.</span>  There is no rubbish here, since it is promptly cleaned by her hotel staff.  The sea in this place is also quite clean, warm and calm.  The beach of the hotel is covered with sand mixed with pebbles.  Therefore, you can walk along the coast here barefoot.  The only caveat - in the heat of the pebbles on the hotel beach can be very hot.  In this case, dispensing with shales on the shore will be difficult.  Such shoes can be brought with you from Russia.  But it‚Äôs better to just buy shale in one of the local shops.  There are shops selling beach accessories in many places of the resort, including near the beach and on site. </p><p>  There are no boulders when entering the sea and on the beach near the hotel.  Therefore, swimming here is very comfortable.  The depth in this place of the coastline does not start too far from the coast, which is not very convenient for vacationers with kids, but those tourists who like to swim like this feature of the sea coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea Life Family Resort Hotel Service" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2032933.jpg" width="505"></div>
