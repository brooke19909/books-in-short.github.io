They cause delight and joy.  They bring a little bit of magic and a festive mood.  Usually a ball is hung on a forest beauty, but there are a lot of interesting ideas on how to decorate a room with them. </p><h2>  Balls are different: yellow, white, red </h2><p>  Ball ornaments are very diverse.  A creative person will find many uses and original combinations for such a luxurious accessory. </p><p>  Glass and unbreakable balls decorate the festive spruce.  They are selected according to the color gamut from 2-3 species, or hairy branches hang with colorful balls. </p><p>  Decorations of balls for the New Year can be used for various corners of the room: windows, doors, shelves, vases, chandeliers. </p><p>  They are purchased in a store or made with one‚Äôs own hands, using an old nondescript ball as a basis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldmarket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do it yourself" class="if uuid-3103379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3103379.jpg"></div><p>  Creating an original Christmas tree decoration is very simple.  We take an old ball, doused with glue, sprinkled with sparkles, beads.  With white nail polish, or acrylic paint, you can write the name of the person, the symbol of the year, the figure for next year.  Thus, a Christmas souvenir is created from such a ball, which is not a shame to give to friends. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Decorations for furniture </h2><p>  Making jewelry from balls with your own hands is very simple.  They easily decorate the shelf in the sideboard, on the chest of drawers or other furniture.  There are several interesting options: </p><ol><li>  On a snow-white, or any other elegant napkin, lay out several balls, the same in color, scale or style.  They can be arranged randomly or fixed in a jar.  Nearby arrange beads, coniferous branches, or a candle with a candlestick. </li><li>  Put balls of the same color in a deep vase, sprinkle with sparkles, tinsel. </li><li>  On a glass dish, place coniferous branches, cones, green and red balls.  You can add a figure of Santa Claus or Snowman. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="birdsnestgiftsandantiques.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new Year decoration" class="if uuid-3103377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3103377.jpg"></div><h2>  The chandelier will sparkle </h2><p>  Ball decorations are an excellent decoration for a chandelier or other lighting fixtures.  To do this, several large bright balls of the corresponding color scheme are attached to the base of the chandelier.  You can attach small bows or silver ribbons to the rope on which the toys are held.  It looks very beautiful and spectacular.  In each room, under the chandelier, they have the proper amount of decoration.  Somewhere it will be beneficial to look at one large ball, and somewhere several small ones.  For each room, the selection of jewelry is individual. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wall decor </h2><p>  Christmas decorations from balls look beautiful both on the Christmas tree and on other parts of the living room.  From multi-colored or two-color balls, create Christmas garlands that hang along the wall.  For these purposes, use a long ribbon on which, through a loop of thread, toys are strung.  It is better to choose balls from unbreakable material.  Cones, hanging snowflakes, tinsel, rain are added to this composition.  By this principle, windows are decorated.  On top of it is attached a ribbon with which Christmas balls hang on long ribbons, cones, bows, paper angels, snowflakes, lanterns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hometalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorations on the window." class="if uuid-3103395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3103395.jpg"></div><h2>  New Year's still life </h2><p>  Original decorations from balls are obtained in the form of New Year's paintings.  Some cardboard for a Christmas background is inserted into a large photo frame.  You can glue a thick sheet with a velvet cloth or cotton wool, sprinkle with sequins and beads.  Small balls on beautiful ribbons are attached to the top of the picture.  An original painting for a festive celebration will perfectly decorate the room. </p><h2>  Dress up a branch </h2><p>  One of the options for Christmas decoration from balls is decorating a bare tree branch.  It turns out simple and creative.  A thick, bare branch is placed in a simple large jar.  Its base is firmly fixed so that it does not stagger.  On a branch have transparent or silver balls.  You can stick a little cotton wool, symbolizing the fallen snow.  Such a composition with dignity will decorate the New Year's table or bedside table in one of the rooms. </p><h2>  Christmas wreath </h2><p>  Amazing decoration with balls for the New Year is obtained in the form of a mistletoe wreath.  Multi-colored balls are fixed to a strong wooden circle (they successfully use unnecessary hoops) or a cut out template from cardboard using adhesive tape.  If you use hot-melt glue, then Christmas balls will hold better and longer.  When the decoration is done, a wide bow is attached to the top of the wreath.  It turns out very beautiful and original. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cutoutandkeep.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="balls wreath" class="if uuid-3103562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3103562.jpg"></div><h2>  Staircase for the royal nobility </h2><p>  Living in a two-story private house, the owners can originally decorate the railing and stairs with the help of New Year's balls.  The process is very simple: a long ribbon of ball is attached to the base of the railing.  Thus, the staircase acquires a magical royal charm.  Together with the balls, you can hang foil stars, small gift boxes and serpentine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imagenesmi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas decor" class="if uuid-3103393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3103393.jpg"></div><h2>  For the original photo </h2><p>  Ball decorations can come in handy for decorating a festive photo zone.  Taking pictures for the New Year is a good old tradition, and for a successful photo shoot, posing near the Christmas tree may seem insufficient.  You can lay out a pile of gift boxes in a certain place, place New Year's balls (unbreakable!) In a chaotic order on top.  Better if the toys are large.  A big bear planted side by side and a blinking garland will complement the New Year's atmosphere and the photo shoot will be successful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="barrango.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="balloons" class="if uuid-3103384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3103384.jpg"></div><p>  Ball decorations are quite diverse.  Having put imagination and a modicum of effort, everyone is able to create an amazing masterpiece and part of the decor that will fill the house with the wonderful atmosphere of the New Year. </p>
