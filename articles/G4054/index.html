    <p>  The construction of the residential complex "Three <span>Oranges" (St. Petersburg)</span> is carried out in the territory owned by the developer, so buying an apartment here will be a profitable investment.  Such an acquisition excludes the presence of third parties and intermediaries of the transaction, guaranteeing the transparency of its conclusion.  Surely you are interested in the deadline for the delivery of LCD Three Oranges.  The last, third building will be commissioned in the 4th quarter of 2017. </p><h2>  Construction Features </h2><p>  "Normann" is a construction company that uses unique technologies in its projects, allowing to provide all residents with the most comfortable living conditions.  A rational and reliable heating distribution system made it possible to completely get rid of risers and pipes that spoil the appearance of the apartments.  With its help, it is possible to fully and efficiently control heat consumption, saving on costs.  The designed mechanical ventilation system made it possible to abandon the use of <span>ventilation units</span> in apartments.  Due to this, it was possible to expand the interior space of the apartments, to offer customers a variety of planning solutions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The development area has developed a rather difficult ecological situation, causing a number of concerns among potential residents.  But it is compensated by park areas, landscaping of the residential complex "Three Oranges". </p>

    <p>  <span>All apartments are fully finished and ready for use: all that remains is to bring furniture.</span>  <span>Residents of already commissioned apartments emphasize that all the work has been carried out efficiently, there is no need for their completion: the walls are glued with modern wallpaper, a <span>laminate</span> is lying on the <span>floor, and a</span> stretch canvas lies <span>on the ceiling</span> .</span>  <span>High-quality double-glazed windows provide excellent heat and sound insulation properties, removing the noise of a busy highway.</span> </p><h2>  The cost of apartments </h2><p>  At the moment, you can buy an apartment on favorable terms.  The cost of a studio of 26 square meters starts from 2.1 million rubles, but a spacious three-room apartment for a large and friendly family can be purchased for 6.8 million rubles. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you want to live in an ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Petersburg, but are not ready to put up with the lack of all the necessary infrastructure for a comfortable life, pay attention to the Three Oranges residential complex.  The project is definitely worthy of attention.  This is the best combination of a high degree of comfort and isolation from city noise and fuss. </p>
