    <p>  In the 17th century, Vyatka was the patrimony of Patriarch Filaret.  And a century later, the village is known as a large shopping center, which regularly hosts fairs.  In the 19th century, the village of Vyatskoye in the Yaroslavl Region also gained fame as a major center for growing cucumbers and their subsequent harvesting.  Local ambassador vegetables are sold at local fairs and transported to other regions, in particular to Arkhangelsk.  Wealthy merchants and craftsmen / craftsmen of various specialties lived in the village, once the Vyatka was considered the center of the Old Believers, and then the center of revolutionary propaganda. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The subsequent history of the village is typical of the Russian province - the peasant militia against the Soviet regime in 1917-1922, the suppression of the uprising and the creation of the collective farm, as well as its liquidation in connection with bankruptcy. </p><h2>  Open-air museum </h2>

However, one should not think that the village was preserved in some mystical way or was specially preserved.  In 2007, the reconstruction of Vyatsky began in order to turn it into a tourist center by the Yaroslavl Investment and Financial Company Limited Liability Company.  Impressive work has really been done to date.  The central streets delight with restored facades of ancient buildings and clean sidewalks.  The village has ancient churches and chapels, holy springs, as well as many museums.  Organized tours are organized here, but many tourists prefer to go to Vyatka on their own.  Tickets to all museums can be bought at the entrance, there are signs and signs on the streets for independent sightseeing.
