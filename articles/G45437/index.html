These oriental markets are a separate attraction of this country.  Tourists often come to Turkish markets not only for shopping, but also to enjoy the unique atmosphere and gain experience.  One of the most beloved in Russia and the most visited tourist regions of Turkey is Antalya. </p><h2>  Overview of Antalya Markets </h2><p>  Antalya is one of the <span>largest cities in Turkey</span> and the largest on the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean Sea.  This is a beautiful picturesque corner where tourists always have something to do.  Beach holidays and architectural sights, oriental sweets and Turkish ice cream, boat trips and hammams - all that Antalya gives its guests cannot be listed.  Local markets are a separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãtourism.  A feature of Antalya markets in Turkey is their nomadic way of life.  We can say that the same market operates once a week in different areas of the city.  Nevertheless, everyone has their own charm. </p>

    <p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAntalya International Airport, there is a duty-free market where you can buy everything, including electronic equipment.  The name of the market speaks for itself.  Sellers accept any currency here, but purchases can only be made upon presentation of a passport. </p><p>  Not far from the exhibition complex Sabanchi is the market of organic products.  Here you can buy organic local vegetables and fruits.  This market operates during the harvest season: summer and autumn. </p><p>  How to get to the markets of Antalya from different areas of the city, it is better to check with the hotel staff.  Regular buses (otogars) and minibuses (dolmushi) regularly run between the districts.  Private taxi service is available.  It is expensive, but bargaining is possible with local taxi drivers.  Often at hotels they offer special shopping tours. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  If you look at the reviews of tourists about the markets of Antalya, it can be noted that each of them has its fans.  Some tourists are attracted by the lowest prices, while others purposefully go for authentic Turkish products.  There are also those who prefer to buy quality fakes of famous brands in Turkey.  In any case, in this state you can buy the same things that you liked in Russian stores, but at much lower prices.  Well, of course, this country remains the center of wholesale trade for entrepreneurs from Russia.  You can buy goods for sale in almost any market.  All tourists note the special atmosphere of the eastern bazaar, an incredible amount and variety of goods. </p>

    <p>  Of the negative impressions, the excessive importunity of local sellers leads.  It affects the difference between European and Eastern mentalities.  Experienced tourists are also advised to be careful with money when calculating a purchase, as they can be trivialized. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  When planning to visit the markets of Antalya, you need to remember a number of simple tips and rules: </p><ul><li>  Bargaining is necessary, and not only to reduce prices, but also so as not to offend the seller. </li><li>  To expedite the bidding process, experienced buyers are advised to carry a notebook with a pen. </li><li>  Prices in the recreation area are designed for foreign tourists, so the initial figure indicated on the price tag is never real.  In areas remote from the center you can buy everything at bargain prices, but it may be difficult to understand with traders if there is no knowledge of Turkish. </li><li>  You need to carefully monitor money and things (this is still a market). </li><li>  To buy the freshest products and not get tired of the heat, it is better to go to the market early in the morning, and if you are interested in the lowest prices, then it is better - in the evening. </li><li>  It must be remembered that meat is not sold in the food markets of Turkey, if you need this product, you must visit a special store. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Experienced tourists especially recommend trying fresh and natural local cheeses, which lovers of this product will appreciate.  The choice is very large, prices vary depending on the variety, sold by weight.  Before buying, you must definitely try the product, because the taste of Antalya cheeses is very different from the usual one for Russians. </li><li>  Remember that there are a lot of fakes on the market (not always high-quality), so you need to be careful. </li><li>  Prices and assortment in the markets are constantly changing, so getting reliable information about them in advance is problematic. </li><li>  Sellers accept lira as payment, will not refuse to take dollars and euros, but at a very unfavorable rate.  Therefore, it is better not to be too lazy and change money in the bank. </li><li>  In any market, you can buy a special volumetric bag on wheels for a small fee, which is very convenient. </li><li>  It should be remembered that prices in the tourist area are always higher than in other areas of the country.  Therefore, if there was a desire to buy a small wholesale, then it is better to do it in Istanbul in special centers.  Although in any market of Antalya you can organize any batch of goods. </li></ul><p>  If you set a goal - to visit all the markets of sunny Antalya during your vacation, then you can forget about the other types of recreation.  But at least once to visit the eastern bazaar is a must.  And even if you come here with sightseeing purposes, leaving the Turkish market empty-handed does not work. </p>
