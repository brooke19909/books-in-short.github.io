But if you don‚Äôt want to see the same accessory on yourself as half a city already wears, then you can make a beautiful decoration for yourself. </p><p>  Let's figure out how to make a rose from fabric.  To do this, you should stock up on the following materials: ribbons, needles, threads, scissors, a pin and a candle.  Getting down.  To get started, select the ribbons from which the petals will be made.  To do this, it is best to give preference to silk, whose width is five to seven centimeters.  A meter tape is enough for one rose.  If you want to know how to make a rose out of fabric, then you should consider that in this case, you can use a couple of shades in addition to the main color.  To do this, stock up on a few narrower ribbons.  The tape does not have to be silk, do not be afraid to use synthetics.  Translucent materials in this case look very attractive.  A ribbon of complementary colors is enough for twenty centimeters. </p><p>  Now you can proceed directly to how to make a rose out of fabric.  From ribbons of complementary colors, it is necessary to cut several petals with rounded edges.  The entire main tape must be cut into pieces-blanks, which should be three parts of different sizes.  Next, you should prepare a workplace at which it will be convenient for you to process the material using a candle flame.  Keep away any flammable materials.  You should be able to use just one candle-pill. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's make roses from fabric with our own hands.  It is worth taking a petal, which you need to hold over the fire, so that the flame only slightly touches the place of cut, so the fabric will be protected from sprinkling.  After that, you need to hold the whole petal over the flame, a little higher than the first time, so it will take a more natural form, similar to the natural one.  It is worth processing all the petals in a similar way.  Do not be very upset that the edge will darken slightly, this can become a decoration of the finished product. </p><p>  When all the petals are processed, then you can proceed to the next step.  Putting the rose together.  In order to determine how your product will look in its finished form, you must first assemble it on a pin, so you can avoid assembly errors.  When you decide on in what order the flower will be collected, it will be possible to collect all the petals on the thread.  Now you can determine how to make a rose from a fabric with varying degrees of pomp.  If you want the flower to turn out a bit disheveled, you can sew the petals, applying them to each other with the front side so as to form a small stalk at the base.  If you intend to make a neat flower, then you should lay the petals on top of each other, stitching them with small stitches through the thread in tone.  Do not forget that the smallest details should be placed in the central part of the flower.  You can sew <span>a beautiful</span> bead or other decorative element in the center of the <span>flower</span> .  On the back of the finished brooch, you can sew a pin. </p><p>  I hope you understand how to make roses from fabric, now it remains only to decide for what purposes you will use them.  As mentioned earlier, they can serve as an accessory for clothes, shoes or in the interior.  The use of this product is entirely up to your imagination.  Do not limit yourself in choosing colors.  You can make different roses for different purposes.  And you can give them to your friends on March 8 or another holiday. </p>
