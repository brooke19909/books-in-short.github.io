    <p>  Most of the hotel rooms are located in two-story bungalows.  Some of them are new and beautiful, apparently, after a fresh repair, but they come across completely old.  This is someone as lucky.  Most likely, not all apartments in the complex have been repaired, and until the process is complete, guests can expect such surprises.  Having discovered such apartments, tourists seek to replace them with a more acceptable option.  As a rule, receptionists quickly resolve the issue. </p><p>  The new rooms have a good design and are equipped with everything necessary.  Some apartments have no balconies.  As for cleaning, it is carried out every day.  Towels and bedding are similarly changed.  By the way, in the renovated rooms are beautiful new linen.  So, if you become the owner of the keys to a good room, then a wonderful vacation is guaranteed. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  What is the situation with food at Club Hotel letoonia 5 * (Turkey, Fethiye)?

The restaurant's waiters work quite promptly.  But sometimes you still have to wait until the staff clean the dishes after eating.  Since the hotel is very large, there are always a lot of people in the restaurant and quite noisy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="letoonia club hotel 5 turkey fethiye" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1984632.jpg" width="600"></div>

For example, traditional <span>Turkish</span> gozleme <span>cakes</span> . </p><p>  In addition to the main restaurant, Club Hotel letoonia 5 * also has a la carte establishments.

Of course, some tourists leave comments regarding the taste of dishes, but this is a very individual opinion. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Tours at Club Hotel letoonia 5 * (Turkey, Fethiye) are popular among tourists due to the beautiful beaches.  Since the hotel is located on a peninsula, it is surrounded on three sides by beaches, so there is a choice where to go at the moment to swim and sunbathe.  It is unlikely that any other hotel complex can boast such an extensive and well-equipped coast.  Some beaches are pebbly, while others are sandy.  The most crowded and noisy of them is Dolphin.

    <p>  All other beaches are no less comfortable, in addition, they have fewer people.  In general, it is worth noting that on the long coast there is always a lot of space and plenty of free sunbeds, which means that there is no need to take places in advance.  In addition, the hotel has well-equipped relaxation areas with hammocks and sun loungers around the pools and in the shade of trees.  Despite the large number of tourists, there is no sense of crowding because of the significant size of the complex. </p><p>  A wonderful clean coast is the pride of the hotel.  It is very good to relax here.  However, if you come with very young children or elderly people, then you should ask for a bungalow that is not too far from the coast, otherwise you will have to walk a lot on the stairs due to the mountainous terrain. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  By purchasing tours to Club Hotel letoonia 5 * (Turkey, Fethiye), everyone hopes to have a great rest on the beautiful coast.  The hotel is really located in an incredibly picturesque place, since the mountainous peninsula is covered with forests, and the warm sea laps around.

    <p>  The hotel has a number of advantages and disadvantages that you should know when acquiring permits in order to avoid unpleasant surprises.  The complex is suitable for picky tourists who are not afraid of some shortcomings. </p><p>  The hotel has wonderful children's animation and a nice mini club.  Kids are awarded for participating in daytime contests, and this happens during an evening disco on the amphitheater stage.  Therefore, in competitions, children are incredibly trying to get the coveted reward.  In general, children's events are commendable. </p><p>  Entertainment programs are also available for adults.  Daytime activities are rather mediocre and monotonous.  But in the evenings, animators arrange all kinds of show programs.  Unfortunately, professional artists are not invited here.  All animation is done on their own by the guys from the team.  Of course, they try very hard, but their numbers could be alternated with the performances of invited artists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club hotel letoonia 5" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1984631.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Representatives of various countries have a rest in the hotel.  About half of the guests are residents of the post-Soviet space, and the second half are Europeans.  On the beach you can take kayaks and catamarans for skiing, and there is also the opportunity to learn the basics of windsurfing, since a very good instructor works here.  In general, rest at the hotel cannot be boring, despite its remoteness from the city.  If you want to get to Fethiye, you can use boats that take you to the city.  A large company is easier to order a taxi. </p><h2>  Tours and attractions </h2><p>  Fethiye is a very ancient city, as evidenced by some of its attractions.  The most famous ancient structures that have survived to this day are the Lycian tombs.  These pompous rock-cut gates to another world always impress travelers. </p><p>  Eight kilometers from the city is another interesting place - an abandoned village.  In the eighteenth century there was a Greek village, but later the Greeks were resettled and given the village for Muslims from Macedonia.  But they did not take root here and went closer to the sea.  Since then, the village has been completely empty, despite the fact that it has 3,500 houses.  The old basilica of the nineteenth century has been preserved here.  Some tourists believe that the village of Kayakey makes a rather terrible impression. </p><p>  Experienced travelers recommend not limited to visiting the ancient ruins, but certainly see the twelve islands.  To do this, you will have to rent a boat or take a boat trip.  Such a trip will allow you to admire the magnificent nature, as well as enjoy swimming in the stunning bays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club hotel letoonia 5 reviews" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1984661.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All islands, and there are twelve, have completely different sizes.  Their beaches are covered with sand and pebbles.  There are absolutely no people here, so swimming in clear water is just heavenly pleasure. </p><p>  The very first island on the way is Knight's.  In ancient times, the Rhodes knights used it for defensive purposes.  Now there are only a few hotels and villas on it. </p><p>  Very interesting for tourists Red Island.  It got its unusual name due to an interesting optical effect.  In the rays of sunset, the coastal sand and pebble strip acquires a reddish hue.  There are no structures on the island except the old lighthouse.  Its east coast is sheltered from the winds, and therefore is the best place for swimming. </p><p>  To the north-west of the Red Island is Deliktash, which consists of several nearby islets.  Diving enthusiasts love these places, saying that they are much more beautiful underwater. </p><p>  Another cluster of islands is Yassija.  Four sections of land are so close to each other that you can swim from one to another.  Between the two of them the distance is only twelve meters.  The main beauties of this group of islands are the natural pool on the largest of them, and the sand spit that goes into the sea. </p><p>  But on about.  Since the time of the Ottomans, Zeytin has been operating a small factory producing olive oil.  The island is currently privately owned. </p><p>  On about.  Tersane at one time lived the Greeks, but after their deportation the village remained empty.  Once upon a time, local convenient bays were used to repair ships.  One of them is so small that it seems like a lake on an island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club hotel letoonia 5 turkey fethiye photo" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1984634.jpg" width="600"></div>

From Fethiye, ships depart daily here.  The valley got its beautiful name thanks to the numerous colonies of tiger butterflies that live here.  However, almost all species of these wonderful and beautiful insects live in the region now.  Walking through the valley, it is worth getting to the picturesque waterfall. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Letonia in Fethiye is an amazingly beautiful place that lovers of nature and good beaches will appreciate.  The hotel complex can be recommended to tourists with children who wish to relax from the bustle of big cities.  Despite the shortcomings, the hotel is good for relaxing uninhabited tourists. </p>
