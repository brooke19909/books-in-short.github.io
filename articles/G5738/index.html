Photos and reviews of those tourists who have already been there have helped us to maintain objectivity in the description of this recreation area. </p><p>  This article is by no means an advertising project.  We will not be silent about the shortcomings.  Let's say right away: the recreation center in the summer functions as a children's recreation camp.  That is, during the holidays, from June 1 to August 31, Strelnikova is closed.  But all the remaining time of the year, including during school holidays, the recreation center accepts everyone. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.24785079999999" data-lng="73.01824250000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/2/6/2/11262.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The address of <span>the recreation center</span> .  Strelnikova (Omsk) is quite simple.  This is the village of Blackburn.  The village is 54.3 kilometers from the regional center.  Therefore, many residents of Omsk and choose it for a weekend break.  But here you can spend a whole vacation.  The recreation center is located outside the village, in the coniferous forest.  The magnificent Irtysh River flows 500 meters away.  Tourists claim that they did not have to think long about how to get to Strelnikov recreation center in Omsk in their car.  This is not a big problem. </p><p>  You need to move along the Krasnoyarsk highway to the village of Bolshekulachye, and then it remains to overcome only 16 kilometers along a road of lesser importance, but also in good condition.  In Chernoluchye should go through the entire village.  Strelnikova is located on its western outskirts.  Nearby are other recreation centers: "Rainbow" and "Irtysh." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you buy a tour to the base of them.  Strelnikov in Omsk, you can arrange a transfer to the regional center and back.  The address of the office where the sale of tickets is carried out: st.  Scherbaneva, d 20, office 204. Buses and minibuses go to the village of Chernoluchye.  The first flight from Omsk (bus station) leaves at 7:30.  The last of the Black Rays leaves at 19:45. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center Strelnikova, territory" class="if uuid-2946871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2946871.jpg"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The recreation center Strelnikova (Omsk region) is located in a wonderful place.  It seems that you have been transported from the city far, far.  The coniferous forest rustles everywhere with branches.  In this regard, a lot of squirrels live on the territory of the recreation center.  They are lured, almost tame, and let people close to them.  Tourists also mention that the Irtysh flows nearby.  Since ordinary people can settle in Strelnikova in any season except summer, you should not even think about a beach holiday.  But wandering along the banks of a beautiful river is still nice. </p><p>  The territory of the recreation center is small.  It can be seen that it was built as a pioneer camp in the middle of the twentieth century.  Reconstruction of this place is in full swing.  Old, dull barracks are demolished and houses and cottages nice to the eye are being erected.  But something from the Soviet past, no, no, and it comes into view.  Tourists believe that a dull gray concrete fence has long been replaced.  It does not fit well with charming forest terrain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.omsktour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Strelnikova, recreation center in Omsk, photo" class="if uuid-2946809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2946809.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms: budget vacation </h2><p>  As we have already mentioned, Strelnikov recreation center has been undergoing reconstruction for several years now.  Old buildings are being destroyed, and new ones are being built in their place.  But as greetings from the past, buildings number 1 and 2 have survived. They contain rooms of the "economy" category.  Moreover, in the first building rooms are designed for 2 people, and in the second room are equipped with three and four beds.  Facilities are located on the floor. </p><p>  What do tourists say about the economy room furniture?  She is very simple, if not Spartan.  But in addition to beds, bedside tables and a wardrobe, the room has a refrigerator, TV and even an electric kettle.  True, the wiring here is old.  So when you make tea, the TV will turn off for a while.  But the bathrooms on the floor are clean.  The cost of living in economy rooms starts from 780 rubles per person per day.  This price includes breakfast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turbaza.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center Strelnikova, economy rooms" class="if uuid-2946870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2946870.jpg"></div><h2>  Standard and Superior rooms </h2><p>  There are also completely new, beautiful buildings on the territory of the recreation center Strelnikova, pleasing the eye with fresh whitewash.  There are rooms of a category higher.  Residents of standards do not complain about poor wiring and miserable bedside tables.  The furniture here is as new as the facades of buildings.  Standards are located in buildings number 3 and 5. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What do guests who pay 1010 rubles per night get?  The whole range of services that is available in the rooms of the category "economy".  But the toilet and handwash are in the room, and the showers are on the floor.  What complaints do tourists have about standards?  Since these rooms are accepted by schoolchildren in the summer, the rooms have only two single beds.  For spouses, this can be a problem. </p><p>  The new building number 3 has improved standards.  They are called junior suites here.  These rooms are more spacious.  In addition to two single beds, they also have a folding sofa.  In the bathroom of the junior suites there is also a shower.  You will have to pay 1290 rubles per person for such a pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strelnikova.biletomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center Strelnikovo, Omsk region" class="if uuid-2946821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2946821.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  In buildings No. 5, 7, as well as in the cottage, there are rooms designed for those who want to live longer at the Strelnikov recreation center.  This apartment can accommodate two, four and six people.  All of them consist of a bedroom and a living room, have their own bathroom.  However, tourists leave feedback that the administration does not quite correctly understand the meaning of the word apartments.  There is no kitchen with utensils in the rooms.  The only cooking aid is a microwave. </p><p>  But the apartments are very spacious.  Quadruple consists of a hall, a living room and two bedrooms.  Especially pleases guests with a room for six people.  A big company will have something to do here.  After all, it has its own banquet room and a billiard room.  Breakfast is included in the room rate.  If desired, meals can also be served in the cottage.  It costs a double apartment 2,800 rubles a day. </p><h2>  Studio </h2><p>  On the territory of the recreation center Strelnikova there is still a small pretty house.  This building number 9, and it accommodates a total of 2 double rooms.  Tourists claim that this is exactly the studio that fully meets the concept of "apartment".  In addition to the bedroom (wide bed) with a seating area, there is also an equipped kitchenette with a set of dishes.  True, there is no stove, but food can be prepared in the microwave.  In addition, a brazier is attached to each studio.  Guests of other rooms must pay extra to fry themselves a barbecue or prepare dishes on the grill.  The guests of the studio are free to use the barbecue.  For VIP guests, who paid 1900 rubles ‚Äúfrom the nose‚Äù, other privileges are also provided.  In particular, they can visit the Finnish sauna of the recreation center for free for three hours.  But in the room for guests of the studio there are conditions for spa treatments.  After all, the shower capsule in the bathroom has a jacuzzi function. </p><h2>  Log houses </h2><p>  Among the forest on the territory of the recreation center Strelnikova (Omsk) there are three wooden one-story houses.  Each of them is made in an individual design.  Two log houses are designed for 2-4 guests, and the third is designed for a company or family of 4-6 people.  In these houses a cozy home atmosphere reigns.  Fellings are completely new, from them the smell of fresh pine trunks has not yet disappeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center Strelnikova, log houses" class="if uuid-2946873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2946873.jpg"></div><p>  All houses consist of a living room and bedroom.  In the log house number 3 there are two rooms for sleeping.  These rooms are also real apartments.  In the log cabins there is a kitchen with a microwave and the necessary set of dishes, a refrigerator, an electric kettle.  The houses are equipped with their own bathroom.  True, the jacuzzi, as in the studio, is not in them.  Such numbers cost 1,500 rubles per person. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  At the Strelnikov recreation center, in some rooms breakfast is already included in the price.  If you buy a ticket, you can pay for three meals a day.  When you arrive for a few days, it is better to camp at the recreation center.  After all, there is a forest around, but there is no cafe in the village.  But if you arrived on a weekend, and you have a full trunk of food, you can just pay for the barbecue and gazebo to arrange a wonderful picnic. </p><p>  Some vacationers came to the base, ordering just an overnight stay.  But in the local dining room they cook deliciously, so there was a temptation to eat there.  No problem!  You can pay as a complex three meals a day (650 rubles), as well as individual meals.  The recreation center accepts orders for banquet services.  Tourists say that the only drawback in terms of food is a small dining room.  He cannot accommodate everyone at once, so he has to wait in line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.omsktour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Strelnikova, recreation center" class="if uuid-2946807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2946807.jpg"></div><h2>  Leisure infrastructure </h2><p>  At the recreation center, you can spend a good day off, or even a vacation.  The beautiful forest and the Irtysh river only contribute to healing.  To enhance the effect of the beneficial effects of nature on the body, you need to go in for sports.  At the reception for a small fee you can rent skis, roller skates, sledges, bicycles, Nordic walking poles and much more. </p><p>  On the territory of the recreation center there are: tennis court, volleyball and basketball courts, soccer field, fitness room, room for playing billiards.  Especially popular is the outdoor pool with thermal (+30 degrees) iodine-bromine water.  The medical building deserves special attention.  Indeed, in the summer, the recreation center operates as a children's recreation camp.  In other seasons, guests can undergo massage, inhalation, stay in a salt room or steam room in a cedar barrel, and so on.  There is also a sauna with a swimming pool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turbaza.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center Strelnikova, pool" class="if uuid-2946880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2946880.jpg"></div><h2>  Stocks </h2><p>  For some, the price list of a recreation center may seem overpriced.  But the administration often makes concessions to customers and occasionally announces stocks.  So, pensioners and students are entitled to a discount.  A birthday man or a couple of newlyweds may very well count on a 10 percent discount.  And children under 6 years of age generally live at the recreation center for free. </p><p>  The prices here are very flexible.  They also depend on the days of the week, since on weekends and holidays it is more expensive to live at the recreation center than on weekdays.  The longer you are at the base, the cheaper your day of stay.  You can get a discount card "piggy bank".  With it, each subsequent rest will be cheaper.  Already now you can book a tour for the New Year in the recreation center Strelnikova (Omsk).  The price includes accommodation from December 31 to January 2, two meals a day, a festive banquet and a show program </p><h2>  Recreation center Strelnikova: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists in general were satisfied with their stay at the base.  Very good reviews on nutrition, its quality and serving sizes.  Tourists say pretty well about the rooms, especially those that are in new buildings and houses.  Without exception, everyone liked the medical base of this sanatorium and especially the thermal pool. </p><p>  But at the same time there are a number of shortcomings.  For example, from Soviet times, there are rusted children's rides here that are simply unsafe.  They had to be dismantled for a long time.  For children there is very little entertainment.  There is a small playground and a games room.  But the use of the latter, alas, is paid. </p>
