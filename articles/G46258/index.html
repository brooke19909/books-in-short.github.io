This is Asus.  Probably, she does not need an additional introduction, since each of us at least once in my life heard about the company's technology.  The novelty was a continuation of the Zenfone 2 lineup. It stands out from its competitors due to the price and one characteristic feature that was made in the name of the device.  This is a laser focusing system for the camera lens.  It works instantly.  This is undoubtedly the advantage of the device. </p><h2>  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB.  Specifications </h2>

    <p>  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB, reviews of which quickly circled the entire Internet, is equipped with a five-inch screen that has an <span>IPS matrix.</span>  This liquid crystal design produces a picture in good quality, with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels.  The density of pixels per inch is 294 pieces.

Although the manufacturer himself did not give absolutely any comments on this issue.  You can adjust the screen settings using software that is already installed on the future smartphone of the buyer.  This is the Splendid program.

    <p>  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB, reviews of which we give at the end of this article, has, in general, a good color rendering.  However, ‚Äúparasite colors‚Äù are still present.  The brightness level is quite high if we talk about its maximum level.  There is a special anti-reflective coating, and together these elements work real miracles.  You will not notice a noticeable difference when working both indoors and in sunlight.  The image is clearly visible both there and there.  And the text remains very, very readable.  In complete darkness there will also be no problems.  The screen does not dazzle at a minimum brightness level. </p><p>  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB, a review of which is presented in this article, has a fairly good margin of contrast.  It perfectly shows itself at all levels of brightness.  Today, the results that the model demonstrates in the course of multiple tests are good, falling into the category of "above average".  The function of automatically adjusting the screen brightness works quickly.  She accurately selects the optimal value. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB, the review of which we are producing today, has good viewing angles.  Although this feature is almost typical for IPS matrices.  Additional tests showed that the smartphone can process ten touches at the same time.  Good result.  In general, I was pleased with the ability to calibrate the color rendering, which is factory in nature.  The display is commendable, the engineers worked hard. </p><h2>  Stuffing and performance </h2>

    <p>  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB, the characteristics of which we examined at the beginning of the article, comes to the market with a budget solution.  Which, in principle, corresponds to the class of the device.  Here you can find a quad-core processor family ‚ÄúKyualkom Snapdragon 410‚Äù.  It is the brainchild of ‚ÄúCortex-A53‚Äù.  It has a maximum clock speed of 1.2 gigahertz.  The role of the graphics accelerator is played by the Adreno 306 device. </p><p>  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB, the price of which is now from 10 to 13 thousand rubles, has a RAM capacity of two gigabytes.  It allows you to work in multi-tasking mode without hangs, to launch and use even ‚Äúheavy‚Äù toys.  In this regard, no complaints arise.  By the way, all this can be done in everyday mode.  However, a little more than a gigabyte of ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù is available for use - about 1.2.  In synthetic tests, the novelty scored a sufficient number of points. </p><h2>  Continued about performance.

    <p>  Sometimes it is thought that some fan that could cool the device would not hurt.  The fact is that with prolonged use of demanding games and applications, the device starts to get very hot.  By the way, do not forget to buy a case for the Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB to protect your device from damage. </p><p>  So, earlier we found out that in synthetic tests the smartphone shows good results.  It is also noticeable in games.  Of course, in <span>Mortal Combat X,</span> as a relatively new application, Zenfon will slow down.  But in Dead Trigger 2 and the like, you can ‚Äúfly‚Äù at the minimum (and sometimes medium) settings without any problems.  Needless to say, the ordinary use of the device for its intended purpose.  Still, this is not a gaming phone, although it can be used in this area, but a budget model designed to solve workers and some kind of entertainment tasks.  By using the internet, of course. </p><h2>  OS and software smoothness </h2><p>  I would like to note how smoothly the system interface works.  No jerks, no freezes when scrolling heavily or viewing pages in browsers - absolutely nothing of the kind.  If we give an intensive load to the smartphone, then it will heat up.  Not so much that it will burn your hands, but still we will definitely feel it.  The most heat-sensitive Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB is black.  Although other models will heat up, of course. </p><p>  The device is running an operating system of the Android family version 5.0.  As a shell, a proprietary interface called Asus ZenUI is used.  It was also applied to other devices in the series.  There is no point in writing about it in this article, because by its volume it can compete even with an article about the analysis of the Windows 10 Mobile OS.  Of course, initially in the phone you can find a huge number of applications of the company.  All have varying degrees of utility.  Some will be completely unused, while, for example, Dr.  Safety (antivirus) will be a great help. </p><h2>  Photographic features </h2><p>  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB (red, black, white) is equipped with a front and main camera.  The resolution of the latter is thirteen megapixels.  Next to it is a LED flash.  There is also a laser focusing module, which is a distinctive feature of the model.  The resolution of the front camera is five megapixels.  Earlier we said that the cameras are quite good.  But let's repeat. </p><p>  The program interface for shooting has standard functionality and a set of solutions.  We are offered a choice of a fairly large number of shooting modes.  This is an automatic scene detection, by the way, which allows you to make a series consisting of several pictures to create animations in GIF format.  You can adjust the exposure levels, ISO and color effect.  There are white balance modes.  Stabilization is turned on and off when shooting video and taking photos. </p><p>  In automatic mode, the camera works simply with a bang.  There are small obstacles, but they do not create obstacles in order to enjoy the results.  The situation is worse with macro photography.  In this case, automatic focusing is less likely to occur, which leads to unexpected delays and blurry photos.  However, such excesses do not occur so often to talk about really serious flaws. </p><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  The subject of our review today is carried out in a standard form factor, which we are so accustomed to.  This, of course, is a candy bar.  It is complemented by a touch screen.  The design is standard, one might say, traditional for Asus devices, namely for the Zenfone line of devices.  Judging by the reviews, the vast majority of buyers like this design.  And if someone expressed sympathy for the appearance of older devices, then Zenfone Laser 2 certainly he will like. </p><p>  Once again, we recall that the dimensions of the smartphone in all three planes are as follows: in height - 143.7 mm, in width - 71.5 mm, and in thickness - 10.5 mm.  The mass of the device is 140 grams.  Among his competitors, he can not stand out in this parameter.  Not very large, but not the most compact. </p><p>  Designers and engineers decided to make the back cover of matte plastic.  It was covered with a layer of soft-touch.  The lid is quite pleasant to the touch.  She does not slip, which creates a feeling of confidence.  But what I didn‚Äôt like was the soiled.  The lid does not collect dirt and fingerprints instantly, but very, very quickly.  It‚Äôs quite difficult to clean it.  But the screen is protected by fourth-generation Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> . </p><p>  The downside is the lack of <span>oleophobic coating.</span>  Fingerprints on the glass will collect quickly.  You can wipe it off, but the constant sticking will at first very strongly enrage the buyer, that's for sure.  In the upper part of the front side you can find a set of sensors, an indicator and a front camera.  On the reverse side is the speaker, the main camera and the LED flash next to it. </p><h2>  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KG 8GB.  Reviews </h2><p>  The opinion about the device was compiled on the basis of reviews from several sources at once, so it will reflect the general essence.  So, among the positive qualities, one can single out a fairly high-quality screen of the device and its cover with protective glass.  Reliability is automatically enhanced.  The following is software.  Fast, nimble, together with powerful hardware - the very thing for solving everyday and not only tasks.  Do not ignore the LTE module.  Pleasant design, good assembly - these are perhaps the main positive features of the device. </p><p>  Now about the shortcomings.  Yes, the model is equipped with a fairly decent hardware.  Yes, it provides good performance for a budget phone.  But with very intensive use, when the device is already very hot, the hardware stuffing ceases to cope with the tasks assigned to it.  The device starts to ‚Äúdull‚Äù, ‚Äújerks‚Äù become visible in the interface.  Over time, the speakers wear out, wheezing appears.  The LTE module does not work without flaw.
