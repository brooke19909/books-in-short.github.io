True, a beautiful, original candlestick is not cheap, but ordinary people will not surprise anyone.  Therefore, the ideal solution for those who want to add a little cosiness to their nest is to create a candlestick with their own hands.

Yes, and you can create absolutely any candlestick for any holiday: February 14, Halloween or Christmas, wedding or birthday.

For this craft you will need any glass containers.  You can create a candlestick from a bottle of champagne - most often they expand downward, or from under the wine.  The color of the glass also does not matter.  Match the shape and color of the bottle to the interior of your room. </p><p>  Let's take a closer look at how you can create a candlestick from a bottle with your own hands.  To create it, prepare: </p><ul><li>  glass bottle; </li><li>  glass balls for decor; </li><li>  burner fluid (alcohol); </li><li>  dense, thick wick (on the neck of the bottle); </li><li>  holder for the wick. </li></ul><p>  We suggest that you take glass balls, which are often used for decoration, but you can decorate the bottle by filling with elements suitable for your room interior.  You can fill it with stones, shells, various twigs.  The main thing is that the decor elements are heavier than the fluid for the burner and keep at the bottom. </p><p>  Let's start creating a candlestick from a bottle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chilliregina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bottle candles and burner fluids" class="if uuid-3044827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3044827.jpg"></div><h2>  Bottle conversion </h2><p>  Rinse the glass bottle thoroughly, remove the label from it, and remove any glue.  Dry it.  Then pour decorative balls into it, they should fill the bottle 1/3. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then, using a watering can (install it inside the neck of the bottle), pour in the candle liquid.  If desired, you can add essential oil to it.  For a light, delicate smell on the bottle, 15 drops are enough.  The more drops, the richer the aroma.  But don't overdo it. </p><p>  For the wick you will need a metal holder.  To do this, you can use any cylinder or ring, suitable in size.  To keep it tightly in the bottle, wrap it with white tape. </p><p>  Place the holder in the neck of the glass bottle.  Insert the wick into it and lower it to the balls.  Cut it, leaving 1 cm after the holder. </p><p>  Your candlestick is ready, it differs from the usual ones, however, this attracts the eyes.  Find for him the perfect place in the room, this decor looks perfect in any room - in the bathroom, living room, bedroom and kitchen.  Your guests will appreciate your work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hikendip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gold candle holders" class="if uuid-3044831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3044831.jpg"></div><h2>  Plastic bottle candle holder </h2><p>  There is another interesting way to create a simple festive candlestick.  You can create a candlestick from a plastic bottle with your own hands, the materials for this bright decor will definitely be found at the novice craftswomen at hand.  What do we need: </p><ul><li>  plastic bottle; </li><li>  stationery knife; </li><li>  acrylic paint; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  acetone; </li><li>  various decor elements: ribbons, beads, sparkles. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabhow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interesting candlestick from a bottle" class="if uuid-3044820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3044820.jpg"></div><p>  Cut off the top of the bottle for easy handling.  Remove the cap and the adjacent ring.  Then gently cut the neck and 3-4 cm down.  Use a candle or lighter to scorch the edges, but do not overdo it. </p><p>  With hot glue, draw several ornate loop patterns on the bottle.  Treat the cut with acetone.  After drying, cover the neck of the bottle with a thick layer of paint. </p><p>  Mask the neck of the bottle with tape, wrapping it and tying a small bow.  Further, the product is decorated according to your desire with the help of sequins, beads, various rubs.  You can decorate the bottle with various artificial branches covered with sequins, bows, pearls, small figures. </p><p>  Glue any decor on the glue gun.  The candlestick is ready.  All that remains for you is to install a suitable candle and light it, and your room will be filled with warmth and comfort. </p><h2>  New year idea </h2><p>  Candles or a live fire create a pleasant, cozy, warm atmosphere in the house, this is what you need in the cold winter and on New Year's holidays.  The festive decor of the house will be complemented by a candlestick decorated on the theme of the holiday. </p><p>  To do this, you will need glass bottles of any shape and size, which, as a rule, either accumulate or are thrown out as unnecessary.  For the manufacture of such snowy New Year's candles, you will need a minimum of material and, in general, half an hour of time.  Let's try together to create a great candlestick from simple and affordable materials. </p><p>  To create a candlestick you will need: </p><ul><li>  Glass bottle; </li><li>  white acrylic paint; </li><li>  coarse salt; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  acetone; </li><li>  brush. </li></ul><h2>  New Year's Transfiguration </h2><p>  Before decorating the bottle, it must be prepared.  Remove labels from it, remove glue, rinse thoroughly from the inside, getting rid of the rest of the drink and smell.  Allow the water to drain from the bottle.  Place it with its neck down.  Then wipe dry and treat with acetone.  Let it dry. </p><p>  Next, use a brush to coat the bottle with white paint.  If necessary, in two layers.  The coating should be tight, without streaks.  The bottle can also be painted inside, but in this case it will take several days until the paint is completely dry. </p><p>  When the paint layer dries, apply glue with a brush in those places that you want to decorate with "snow".  Cover the desk with newspaper and sprinkle salt.  Gently roll the bottle.  The salt will remain in the places covered with glue. </p><p>  Allow the glue to set and dry. </p><p>  That's all, from the bottles you can collect a pleasant composition by decorating the neck of the bottle with candles or various holiday twigs.  For composition, use bottles of different sizes, matching shiny decorative twigs, Christmas balls and beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homesthetics.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter bottle decor" class="if uuid-3044849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3044849.jpg"></div><p>  They can be painted in any color, add sparkle or pearls. </p><p>  Here are such interesting, festive candle holders from bottles you can get.
