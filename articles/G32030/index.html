But, unfortunately, not everyone has the opportunity to purchase it.  Therefore, in our country, many young couples are considering the option of purchasing housing on credit.  When registering an apartment for a mortgage, many banks force their customers to insure their living space against loss or damage.  At the same time, not only real estate is insured, but also the health and life of the owner of the apartment.  It is often almost impossible to refuse this, because otherwise the bank will simply refuse to provide a loan. </p><p>  Here, the majority of people have a question: "Is insurance of a mortgage apartment mandatory or not?"  The answer is clear: required.  The thing is that, according to Russian law, any property that is purchased in a mortgage must be insured.  Therefore, every citizen who wants to register a home on a mortgage must have a detailed understanding of real estate insurance.  Let's try to understand this issue in more detail. </p><h2>  Can I refuse insurance services when applying for a mortgage? </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2055678.jpg"></div>  Before you take out insurance, you need to understand what insurance mortgage apartment gives in general.  According to the current legislation, only mortgaged property, i.e. a house or apartment, can be insured when registering a mortgage.  But many banks, in order to reduce their own risks, force their customers to purchase additional insurance services, among which the most common are life and health insurance of the borrower, as well as legal transparency of the purchase / sale transaction.  In case of refusal to purchase additional insurance services, financial institutions, in most cases, increase the interest <span>rate on the mortgage.</span>  Thus, it is impossible to refuse insurance services.

    <p>  For example, with property insurance, the cost of insurance can range from 0.3 to 1% of the value of real estate.  This also takes into account the condition of the apartment, the age of the house, as well as the presence of security systems. </p><p>  The cost of <span>title insurance</span> can range from 0.1 to 0.6 percent of the value of real estate.  If everything is in order with the legal purity of housing, then you can count on the lowest percentage. </p><p>  If, in addition to the living space, the borrower also wants to insure himself, then the services of the insurer will cost from 0.7 to 1.5%.  At the same time, the state of health of the insured and the type of his activity affect the size of insurance premiums. </p><p>  The most economical option is a comprehensive policy that includes all the services discussed earlier.  Its value can vary from 1 to 1.5 percent of the value of the apartment. </p><p>  Today, the opportunity is available to know exactly how much mortgage insurance will cost.  The calculator implemented on the sites of most insurance companies will help you with this.  With it, you can determine the exact amount of insurance premiums. </p><h2>  Mortgage Insurance Process </h2><p>  So, how to insure an apartment?  This question is asked by many people who plan to get a mortgage. </p><p>  The procedure for issuing an insurance policy occurs in the following sequence: </p><ol><li>  Find an IC offering the most favorable conditions. </li><li>  Carefully study the insurance contract.  This will help to avoid various pitfalls and the presence of hidden services that are illegal by the insurance company. </li><li>  Familiarize yourself with the insured events covered by the policy, as well as the amount of cash compensation and the timing of their payments. </li><li>  Submit a standard application to the insurance company. </li><li>  Make an insurance premium of a specified amount and within the time period specified by the contract. </li></ol><p>  The insurance contract is drawn up in triplicate: the first remains with the insurer, the second you take, and the third you give to the bank. </p><h2>  Where to insure property when applying for a mortgage? </h2>
