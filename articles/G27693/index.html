  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Series of speakers and their characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The series of dynamics and their compilation are the main technique in statistics, allowing to characterize the changes that a certain phenomenon has.  They are a chronological, temporary or dynamic sequence of indicators that shows the level of development. </p><p>  Mandatory elements that have a series of dynamics are the time and <span>value of the indicator that</span> is being investigated.  The last component can be represented as a row level.  Depending on this, the following types of series of dynamics are distinguished. </p><p>  If the study focuses on the time indicator, then they are divided into interval and instant series.  If the data was taken for certain periods of time, then this is an interval series.  An example is the volume of products produced per month or year, the number of hours worked, etc. </p><p>  In the case when each individual level of the series shows the significance of the phenomenon at a particular moment, the series of dynamics are called moment ones.  As an example, you can use the indicator of the number of people at the beginning of the year or the number of materials per specific number. </p><p>  These two types of series of dynamics have one more difference.  The interval series contains more real information, that is, general results of work for a certain period of time.  The moment series characterizes the phenomenon only at some point in time, that is, it is not a generalizing indicator. </p><p>  Also, the series of dynamics are distinguished depending on the form of presentation.  It distinguishes between a series of average, absolute and <span>relative values.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Depending on the time intervals and the distances between the measurement dates, it is possible to distinguish complete and incomplete series having a certain chronology. <br>  When time intervals or measurement dates have equal intervals and follow each other, they represent a complete series.  For example, measuring a specific indicator for a specific day of each month and analyzing them.  These rows are called equidistant. </p><p>  When the intervals are not respected and have different intervals, then these series of dynamics are considered incomplete. </p><p>  To compile the series of dynamics requires the collection of statistical data.  Information is taken on a specific territory, facility and other factors.  They must be comparable and identical. </p><p>  Rows containing numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãshould be ordered by time.  The analysis cannot be considered complete if some levels are missing.  If some information cannot be obtained, then they are replaced by conditional indicators of the series of dynamics. </p><p>  In order to conduct an analysis, it is necessary to describe the nature of the changes and calculate the average indicators.  To do this, use the following data: </p><ol><li>  The growth rate of the phenomenon. </li><li>  <span>The absolute increase.</span> </li><li>  <span>Growth rates.</span> </li><li>  The absolute value that is inherent in one percent increase. </li></ol><p>  If the analysis is carried out at a certain point in time, then basic indicators are given.  If each subsequent indicator is associated with the previous one, then we are talking about indicators of a chain nature. </p><p>  The average indicators that are used in compiling the series of dynamics are divided into the following types: </p><ol><li>  The average level of the row.  This is a value that is common to all indicators of the series for some period or at some point in time. </li><li>  The average <span>growth rate of the</span> indicator. </li><li>  Average absolute increase. </li><li>  The average growth rate. </li></ol><p>  If we consider a number of dynamics from a theoretical point of view, then in this case it consists of the following components: random <span>fluctuations, seasonal</span> or cyclical fluctuations and development trends or trends that characterize the decrease and increase in its levels. </p><p>  The series of dynamics allow us to study the nature of the development of all phenomena that occur in the economic and social life of society. </p>
