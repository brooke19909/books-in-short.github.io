Today there are Inter-American, African, Asian banks.  They are united by goals and activities.  In this article, we will examine in detail the existing international development banks. </p><h2>  Destination </h2><p>  International development banks were formed for a number of reasons: </p><p>  1) increasing the role of countries in the world community; </p><p>  2) the need to address issues that are not always taken into account by the IMF; </p><p>  3) attraction of external financing resources in order to provide a loan; </p><p>  4) support for cooperation and economic integration of countries; </p><p>  5) the interest of the IDB members (mainly non-regional) in stimulating exports. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="international development banks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/881658.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Differences and Generalities </h2><p>  International development banks have a differentiated level of social, cultural, economic development of countries.  But they pursue similar goals: stimulating the comprehensive growth of regions.  Much attention is paid to poverty reduction in Asia and Africa. </p><p>  About a third of the members of credit institutions are developed countries.  They own most of the capital, they influence the activities of organizations.  Any decision made by international <span>regional development banks</span> (MDBs, ADBs, AfDBs) may be blocked by the United States, Japan, Nigeria. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The votes of the participants are distributed depending on the capital contributed.  Although, according to the Charter, the majority should belong to regional members, their share has now decreased to a minimum (approximately 50.02%) due to an increase in the number of developed countries in the composition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="commercial development bank" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/881656.jpg" width="600"></div>
