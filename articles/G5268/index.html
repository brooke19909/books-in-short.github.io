    <h2>  Program for hours Q50 </h2><p>  In order for parents to set up a smart watch and receive information about the child‚Äôs whereabouts, they need a special SeTracker program that can be installed on your smartphone for free.  It performs the following main functions: </p><ul><li>  voice messaging between smartphone and watch; </li><li>  a card with a child‚Äôs location sensor (information about the level of charge of a smart watch is also displayed here); </li><li>  viewing information on the number of steps taken; </li><li>  a record of the route of movement, which can be displayed both statically and in dynamics; </li><li>  all device operation settings; </li><li>  setting the zone in which the child is allowed (when he leaves her, the parents will receive an appropriate notification); </li><li>  the ability to send virtual hearts to the child as an encouragement; </li><li>  an event log that saves all actions performed with the watch; </li><li>  setting an alarm or reminders to be displayed on the watch; </li><li>  the ability to search for watches through an <span>audio signal</span> if they are lost. </li></ul>

However, in terms of functionality, they cannot be compared with a device such as a Q50 watch.  The manual contains information about many functions that are not available on the phone.  So, the disadvantages of a smartphone and the advantages of watches can be represented as follows. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td align="center">  <em>Phone or smartphone</em> </td><td align="center">  <em>Smart watch with tracker</em> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><ul><li>  children strive to follow fashion with modern smartphones, which, in turn, attract the attention of robbers; </li><li>  due to games and other additional programs, the phone can quickly be discharged at the most inopportune moment; </li><li>  Using the Internet and other functions, the child can be distracted in the lessons; </li><li>  the possibility of calls from strangers (including fraudsters) is not ruled out; </li><li>  high risk of losing an expensive gadget. </li></ul></td><td valign="top"><ul><li>  in order to contact parents in an emergency, just press one button; </li><li>  about all actions of the child that go beyond the established rules, notifications are sent to parents; </li><li>  outgoing and incoming calls are allowed only for those contacts that are entered in the phone book; </li><li>  when the charge drops to a critical level, parents receive an SMS reminder about the need to connect the battery to a power source; </li><li>  the child cannot independently turn off the Q50 GPS watch; </li><li>  the watch is firmly attached to the hand, and therefore they will not interfere with active games and will not be lost. </li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  How to recognize a fake </h2><p>  Children's smart watches Q50 is a popular product that is becoming more and more popular every day.  In this regard, more and more low-quality fakes appear on the market.  In order not to fall for the tricks of fraudsters and buy really high-quality goods, you should know the following: </p><ul><li>  fake watches may not work in Russia and other CIS countries, as they are ‚Äúflashed‚Äù exclusively for operation in China; </li><li>  unlicensed copies have the same ID, but for real watches it is individual; </li><li>  real children's watches with the Q50 tracker have a bright display, the clarity of the image on which does not depend on viewing angles; </li><li>  in the original version of the watch there is always an option to select the Russian language, while the fake has only a Chinese interface; </li><li>  externally, you can distinguish an original from a fake by color (on a fake gadget, different elements may differ in shade); </li><li>  if smart watches have distortions and backlashes, then most likely they are fake; </li><li>  high-quality sound without interference provides only the original version of the smart watch; </li><li>  a fake watch does not always trigger a sensor for removing the device from the hand (sometimes it is completely absent); </li><li>  fake watches that have not passed through relevant studies are characterized by an increased level of radiation; </li><li>  a poor-quality battery can explode, which leads not only to damage to the device, but also to personal injury. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How not to buy a fake </h2><p>  A Q50 watch phone is a useful and essential device for today's children.  Nevertheless, only the original device can perform all functions at full strength.  To reduce the risk of acquiring a fake, follow these guidelines: </p><ul><li>  when it comes to a stationary outlet, give preference to proven places with a good reputation; </li><li>  if one of your friends has already made such a purchase, carefully inspect the gadget - if it does not show signs of counterfeiting, ask for advice on the place of purchase; </li><li>  study as many reviews as possible in the video format in order to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the original product looks; </li><li>  When ordering goods on the Internet, give preference only to proven resources (even if the cost of goods is higher); </li><li>  do not trust sellers who offer you such a product for less than 3000 rubles; </li><li>  require that upon purchase you are provided with a full package of documents, namely: <ul><li>  certificate of quality; </li><li>  certificate of receipt by the seller of accreditation and its entry in the appropriate register; </li><li>  warranty card for a period of not less than 12 months; </li><li>  instructions for the goods in Russian; </li><li>  a sales receipt with all the necessary details and a seal. </li></ul></li></ul><h2>  Common Parent Questions </h2><p>  It is not surprising that parents have certain concerns about any gadgets that their child interacts with.  So, some questions arise in connection with the use of <span>Smart Baby Watch Q50</span> : </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Question</em> </td><td>  <em>Answer</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Is there a risk of the watch signal disappearing? </td><td>  Signal loss is possible only if there is no cellular communication in the place where the child is.  In any case, parents receive an SMS notification with the coordinates of the place where the signal disappeared. </td></tr><tr><td>  Is it possible to observe the history of movements? </td><td>  The beacon on the map shows the movement of the child in real time.  It is also possible to view the story. </td></tr><tr><td>  Will the child know that they are in control? </td><td>  A smart watch can be presented to a child as a fashion accessory and emergency contact with parents.  Nevertheless, the level of technical literacy of modern children contributes to the fact that the child can guess about the additional functions of the device. </td></tr><tr><td>  How long does the battery last? </td><td>  Depending on the intensity of use of the device, the battery lasts from 1 to 3 days. </td></tr><tr><td>  What is the complete set of goods? </td><td>  In addition to the watch itself, the company box also has a charger and instructions in different languages. </td></tr><tr><td>  How does the secret call function work? </td><td>  In order to use this function, you need to enter your phone number in the appropriate program.  Thus, without the knowledge of the child, a forced call will be made from the clock to the parents' phone.  Answering the call, you will hear everything that happens.  In turn, the child will not hear you. </td></tr><tr><td>  What is the <span><span>SOS</span></span> button for? </td><td>  In an emergency, when the child is difficult to navigate, it will be enough to press just one button to contact the parents.  You can attach 3 numbers to this function.  Without calling one of them, the watch immediately diverts the call to another.  This will happen until one of the parents answers the call. </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Quite popular is a gadget like the Q50 - a children's watch.

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the mass of positive characteristics, you should not neglect the disadvantages of such a device as a children's <span>watch with GPS</span> Q50.  User comments contain the following information: </p><ul><li>  there are many fakes on the market, which are difficult to distinguish at first glance from the original; </li><li>  the silicone of which the strap is made quickly gets dirty; </li><li>  the plug of the connector for the charger is not attached firmly; </li><li>  symbols printed on the keys are quickly erased; </li><li>  when the device is not on the street, but indoors, the location may not be accurate; </li><li>  the battery is loose; </li><li>  in order to insert a SIM card into the watch, they need to be untwisted (it‚Äôs good that a mini-screwdriver is included); </li><li>  you can charge the clock only from a computer (an adapter for the mains is not provided); </li><li>  in the notebook you can enter no more than 10 contacts; </li><li>  poor hearing during phone calls. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In today's world, a <span>kids watch with GPS</span> Q50 is a must have.  Modern children quickly get used to independence and do not tolerate interference in their personal space.  As for the mobile phone or smartphone, it is not always convenient to carry with you (especially active children).  In this situation, smart children's watches with a tracker will come to the rescue.  For parents, the <span>Smart Baby Watch Q50</span> is a way to always be aware of the location of their child, and for children it is a stylish and useful accessory. </p>
