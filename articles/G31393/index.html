    <p>  The village is located off the coast of the bay with the same name in the Sea of ​​Japan, on the Difficult Peninsula.  Such a unique location and incomparable natural conditions make the rest in Nakhodka of the Primorsky Territory truly unforgettable.  Geographically, this is the southernmost city in the eastern part of Russia, located at a distance of 171 km southeast of Vladivostok. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territorial unit was founded in 1864, and initially it was a hydrographic post.  The port city of Nakhodka (Primorsky Territory) became in connection with the transfer of the seaport from Vladivostok.  They opened these sea gates in 1947, and in 1950 the village received city status. </p><p>  The settlement is cut off from the sea by a huge industrial zone.  The economy specializes in the port transport complex.  In the seaport "Nakhodka" ship repair, cargo handling, fishing and fish processing are carried out.  In 2007, it was reoriented to transshipment of coal in an open way, which negatively affected the ecology of the city. </p><h2>  Where did the name come from </h2>

    <p>  The name of the city is directly related to the name of the bay of the same name located nearby.  Nakhodka harbor (Primorsky Territory) was opened in 1859 by Russian sailors.  According to legend, the sailor of the America corvette exclaimed: “This is a find!” When he saw an unknown bay.  In the magazine of the navigator of the corvette "America" ​​on July 18, 1859, a corresponding entry was made about the discovery of the bay, not previously indicated on the map, and about assigning it the name "Nakhodka harbor". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  City History </h2>

    <p>  In general, according to the official version, the history of the city begins in July 1859.  For a long time, historians carefully studied the Primorsky Territory.  The city of Nakhodka, as was proved, was opened as a bay long before 1859, and the port was founded by the first settlers who went here in search of a better life. </p><p>  According to the official version, the village in the bay as a hydrographic post appeared in 1864.  From 1907 to the 1940th settlement, which was located on the banks of the Kamenka River, was called American (after the name of the corvette).  After the revolution, it was increasingly called the Nakhodka, but for ideological reasons. </p><p>  In 1939, a decision was made to transfer the trading and fishing ports of Vladivostok to Nakhodka Bay.  This was the impetus for a <span>radical change</span> in the history of the village.  The village began to develop actively, roads were built that connected it with the rest of the world.  Foreign ships began to arrive in Nakhodka.  One of the first was the Danish ship Greta Mersk in 1947.  Construction was also carried out using forced labor.  Many of the "Stalin" in the city were built by Japanese prisoners of war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Nakhodka (Primorsky Krai can be proud of it) received the status of a city in 1950.  The territorial unit was visited by up to 150 thousand tourists and 40 foreign delegations annually.  When borders were opened in 1992, everything changed.  Tourists rushed to Vladivostok.  City dealers began to make money on used cars that were imported from Japan.  Industry has fallen into disrepair. </p><p>  But the city did not disappear from the map of Russia.  Its further development is already associated with petrochemical production. </p><h2>  Features of the local climate </h2>

    <p>  If some city in Russia is also able to surprise an experienced traveler, it’s Nakhodka.  The Primorsky Territory, whose recreation facilities are never deserted, is always glad to guests.  However, tourists should take into account some local features.  The fact is that this territory is located in the zone of temperate <span>monsoon climate.</span>  In winter, cold air masses are carried from the mainland to the sea, resulting in a cloudy and frosty weather.  The amount of precipitation is small.  From the north and north-west, winds blow at a speed of up to 10 m / s.  They contribute to a significant decrease in temperature.  In terms of winter weather severity, Nakhodka is located in the 5th frost resistance zone.  The depth of soil freezing according to the standard is 142 cm. Spring is cool, long with prevailing winds of the south and south-east direction.  Wind speed up to 7 m / s.  The summer monsoon is from June to August.  Until mid-July, air masses move from <span>the Sea of ​​Okhotsk.</span>  Cool cloudy weather with fogs sets.  Drizzle rain.  From the second half of summer (mid-July) the weather is sunny and warm.  Relative humidity in July is over 90%.  In August, typhoons are a frequent occurrence - tropical cyclones, as a result of which the monthly rainfall falls within 1-2 days. </p><p>  Under the influence of ebbs and flows, river flow and winds, autonomous water circulation forms in the bays of Nakhodka.  The <span>cold course</span> has no significant effect on these water areas.  The water temperature in August reaches 24 degrees Celsius.

    <p>  The atmospheric air of the city is deteriorated mainly by the exhaust gases of automobiles, emissions of urban boiler houses not equipped with a filtration system, and coal dust.  Due to the increase in transshipment of coal in the port, not only the atmosphere of the city, but also the sea area is heavily polluted with coal particles. </p><p>  To date, the village has almost been on the verge of environmental disaster.  A poor sanitary situation has developed in the private sector, where a centralized garbage collection has not been organized, which led to the formation of natural dumps.  Since 2006, a specially designated landfill for household waste has been in operation. </p><p>  A difficult environmental situation is also in Nakhodka Bay.  Its waters are polluted by wastewater discharges, oil products, ship drains.  Even before 2006, almost a third of the city’s effluents merged untreated into the waters of Nakhodka Bay.  Later, this discharge was partially blocked.  The river bed of the Kamenka was cleaned.  The concentration of heavy metals in the waters of Nakhodka Bay is especially high.  Environmental crisis has a detrimental effect on marine fauna. </p><h2>  Why is it worth going to Nakhodka? </h2><p>  The resort and beach city of Nakhodka (Primorsky Territory), a photo of which can be found in almost every guide to Russia, is considered a vacation spot of local importance. </p><p>  The main feature of this region are warm beaches and beautiful surrounding landscapes.  In the warm months of the year, and this is summer and the beginning of autumn, the temperature of the water in the sea reaches 25 degrees.  You can bask in the sun from mid-June to early October. </p><p>  In addition to spending time on the beaches, you can conquer the most picturesque hills, the Livadia Ridge, which is famous for Smolny waterfalls throughout Primorye. </p><p>  The city itself is special, it doesn’t have a single area due to the terrain features, houses are located closer to the coast and on the slopes of hills.  The main part of Nakhodka stretches along the coast for 20 km. </p><p>  Nakhodkinsky Prospekt, 10 km long, is, in fact, the only street in the city, it connects the northern part of the village with the southern quarters.  This is the main place of rest and walks of the city residents.  On the avenue there are city museums and parks, the main monuments: the Friendship Stone - a gift from the twin city of Maizuru, the Victory Memorial, the twin gift from Tsuguru - the Japanese rock garden, and the monument to the dead sailors “The Sorrowful Mother”, past which the river Kamenka, beloved by the townspeople, flows. </p><p>  Nakhodka differs from other Far Eastern cities by solid Stalinist, rather than panel houses, clean streets, beautiful and high hills.  One of the most beautiful is Sister Hill, which is a symbol of the city. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2>
