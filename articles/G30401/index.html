This is necessary in the first place so that people who watch videos do not complain about poor sound quality.  Today on the market there are many models from different manufacturers at different prices, which only complicates the choice.  That is why we decided to help a little, and in this review we will focus on the five best microphones for bloggers in different price categories. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  Before moving on to the point, I would like to make a small digression and briefly talk about what a high-quality microphone should be in general.  Firstly, it must be highly sensitive.  Secondly, it is desirable that the microphone has a wide frequency range.  Well, and thirdly, it is worth deciding on the type, because the price will depend on this.  These 3 parameters will help to choose a microphone.  For a blogger, this is a very important device, so the question is very relevant. </p><p>  What is high sensitivity for?  In order to be able to record sound at a distance.  The higher the sensitivity, the farther you can place a microphone from a person.  The same applies to the frequency range - the higher it is, the cleaner and more natural the voice will be recorded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.desktop-documentaries.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="varieties of microphones" class="if uuid-2254670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254670.jpg"></div><p>  Now for the type of microphone and directionality.  In general, there are several types of devices, but if you choose a microphone for a blogger, then it‚Äôs worth stopping at two - dynamic and condenser. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Dynamic microphones</span> are inexpensive, have good sensitivity and record sound quality.  Condenser, on the contrary, are expensive, need additional power, but they allow you to get a more lively and rich sound. </p><p>  Actually, based on these parameters, we selected 5 of the highest quality and, if I may say so, the best microphones for the blogger.  The price of the selected models is different: there are budget options, but there are more expensive ones, so everyone can look after something they like.  Now to the point. </p><h2>  Asus cerberus </h2><p>  Microphones rating for bloggers opens with a <span>gaming headset</span> with an Asus Cerberus microphone.  Let no one be confused by the fact that Cerberus are headphones.  In terms of sound recording quality, this headset can compete with good eyelets, but it is quite inexpensive.  Cerberus will be an excellent and inexpensive solution for those who primarily shoot game content and spend streams. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The first thing worth mentioning right away is that the headphones have two microphones at once.  One of them is removable, and the second is on the remote control on the cable.  Unfortunately, two microphones cannot work at the same time; when a removable plug-in is connected, the built-in microphone mutes automatically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.willwork4games.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones with microphone Asus Cerberus" class="if uuid-2254674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254674.jpg"></div><p>  Now let's get acquainted with the characteristics.  The sensitivity of both microphones is at around 40 dB, which is quite good.  But the frequency range is a bit upsetting: 50 Hz - 10 kHz.  In practice, this means that the voice will be recorded clearly, but the final result will be worse than that of the loops in the same price range. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The last thing worth mentioning is the directionality of the microphones.  The built-in has an omnidirectional type and will record all extraneous sounds.  The external microphone is cardioid, which is much better, since it will only capture the voice of the speaker. </p><h2>  Price and reviews </h2><p>  According to user reviews, the main drawbacks of Cerberus are associated only with the headset design itself, while there are no complaints about both microphones, on the contrary, they are praised for their good voice quality and high sensitivity.  If we talk about the price, then at the moment you can buy these headphones with a microphone (for a blogger) for 2-3 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Audio-Technica ATR3350 </h2><p>  Second place in the ranking is the lapel microphone for the blogger Audio-Technica ATR3350.  This model is considered a high-end loop and one of the best microphones for beginners.  It costs quite acceptable, and the sound is recorded very, very worthy. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The ATR3350 is an omnidirectional condenser lavalier microphone.  Unlike other capacitor sound recorders, this model does not need additional phantom power, because it works from the built-in power supply with batteries.  Also a plus is the presence of wind protection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fotocart.com.bd" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lavalier microphone Audio-Technica ATR3350" class="if uuid-2254688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254688.jpg"></div><p>  Now a few numbers.  The microphone for the blogger ATR3350 has a high level of sensitivity - 54dB, which allows you to record at a distance of up to 1 meter.  However, do not forget that the microphone is omnidirectional type, which means it will pick up extraneous sounds.  The frequency range is at a fairly good level: 50 Hz - 18 kHz.  It falls short of the standard 20-22 kHz, but again, given the price, this can be forgiven. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another interesting feature of the microphone is a very long cable (6 meters!) And a built-in power supply that runs on a single LR44 battery, or, as it is also called, ‚Äútablet‚Äù.  The battery life is about 8 hours, after which the battery will have to be replaced. </p><h2>  Price and user reviews </h2><p>  According to user reviews, Audio-Technica ATR3350 is a very good and inexpensive microphone that provides high quality recording.  Among the main disadvantages, one can note only a short battery life and the absence of any indication on the power supply, which is why you can simply forget to turn on the device.  If we talk about the price, the microphone for bloggers from Audio-Technica can be bought for 1800-3000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samson go mic </h2><div class="photo" data-original="brooksreview.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone samson go mic" class="if uuid-2254693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254693.jpg"></div><p>  Next to the blogger‚Äôs microphones list is the miniature and portable Samson Go Mic.  Despite its small size, this model will pleasantly surprise you with the high quality of the recorded sound, as well as its characteristics.  Go Mic can be safely considered one of the best models in the middle price segment. </p><h2>  Microphone specifications </h2><p>  Go Mic is a condenser microphone that works with a USB cable connected to a computer.  The frequency range here is the same as the previous model - 20 Hz - 18 kHz, but the sensitivity is slightly less - 47 dB.  Nevertheless, Samson records a very good and clear sound, even at a distance from the user. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brooksreview.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone samson go mic" class="if uuid-2254694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254694.jpg"></div><p>  It is certainly worth noting a small switch, which is located on the microphone.  With it, you can change the type of directivity when recording.  Thus, from an omnidirectional device, Go Mic can be made cardioid (narrowly focused), which is undoubtedly a big plus. </p><p>  And of course, one cannot fail to mention the incredibly convenient microphone stand.  It allows you to install Go Mic on the surface of the table, mount it on a laptop or monitor, and also install it on a <span>microphone stand</span> or holder. </p><h2>  Reviews and cost </h2><p>  As user reviews show, this model has practically no drawbacks, except that sometimes defective copies and fakes are found that quickly fail.  Fortunately, these are rare cases, and you should not be afraid.  The rest of the Samson Go Mic can be safely called the best microphone for beginner bloggers.  As for the price, you can buy a model for 3900-4500 rubles. </p><h2>  Samson meteor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="musicappblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samson meteor" class="if uuid-2254700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254700.jpg"></div><p>  Fourth place ranking - a wireless microphone for bloggers Samson Meteor.  This model costs almost twice as much as Go Mic, but in fairness it should be noted that Meteor fully justifies this money.  Some even use this microphone to record professional voice acting. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The Samson Meteor Cardioid Condenser Microphone has a frequency range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz, which is standard.  Unfortunately, there is no information on sensitivity even on the official website, but most likely this indicator is in the region of 50-60 dB.  As for the sound that the microphone records, it is output in 16 bits with a frequency of 44/48 kHz, which, in fact, is a studio quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="musicappblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samson Meteor microphone" class="if uuid-2254701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254701.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the microphone is considered to be ‚Äúwireless‚Äù, it still works through connecting a USB cable to the computer.  This is a necessary measure, since Meteor has no other power source.  It is also worth noting the presence of a button on the case, which allows you to completely turn off the sound reception.  And of course, you can‚Äôt but mention the case itself - it is made of high-quality chromed metal, which will ensure durability. </p><h2>  Price and reviews </h2><p>  User reviews about this model show that the microphone is practically devoid of flaws, with the exception of too high sensitivity.  However, this problem can be fixed very quickly, you just need to move the microphone away and lower the sensitivity in the recording settings.  You can buy Samson Meteor today for 6400-6600 rubles. </p><h2>  Blue yeti </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Yeti Microphone" class="if uuid-2254707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254707.jpg"></div><p>  Well, the first place in the ranking of microphones for the blogger is he - Blue Yeti.  This model is not the first year has been very popular among many users, including top bloggers.  Yeti is equipped with so many features and capabilities that make the recorded sound incredibly clear and realistic. </p><h2>  Microphone specifications </h2><p>  Blue Yeti is a condenser microphone that can be omnidirectional, bidirectional (figure eight) and cardioid.  There is a separate selector for switching modes.  In addition, Yeti allows you to record voice in stereo, which is not so common.  The frequency range here is standard (20 Hz - 20 kHz), but with the help of an amplifier it is possible to adjust the device to 15 Hz - 22 kHz.  Sensitivity is amazing - 100 dB!  Yeti can be safely put away from the speaker, and the sound will still be recorded very high quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue yeti" class="if uuid-2254708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2254708.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, as many as 3 cardioid capsules are responsible for the recording, which cannot but rejoice.  The microphone is connected via a USB cable and does not require any additional programs or drivers.  Well, the last thing to mention is the controls on the case, with which you can adjust the microphone gain, its volume, sensitivity, etc. </p><p>  One can safely say that Blue Yeti is the best microphone for a blogger in its price category. </p><h2>  Cost and user reviews </h2><p>  As reviews of Blue Yeti show, this model has only 2 minor minuses.  The first is not a very convenient stand.  The second is a slightly overpriced one.  The price of a microphone today is 11,800-13,000 rubles, which is not so small, but the Yeti is definitely worth the money. </p>
