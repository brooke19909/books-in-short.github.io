Well, there‚Äôs nothing here - an exotic South Coast with subtropical vegetation, picturesque mountains with beautiful caves, rocky shores of the Black Sea, endless expanses of steppes, gorgeous sandy beaches of the West Coast of Crimea, crystal clear waters of the <span>Tarkhankut Peninsula.</span>  Perhaps his whole life is not enough to visit all corners of this paradise on earth. </p><h2>  General beaches </h2><p>  Crimea, as you know, washes not only the Black, but also the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  Twenty kilometers from the city of Kerch on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, washing the peninsula, there are unique picturesque beaches that are so magnificent that they are called General's. </p><p>  The beauty is that these places are little known to tourists and to this day remain wild.  Today, General's <span>beaches (Crimea)</span> are considered the best beaches on the peninsula. </p>

    <p>  What are they?  As you know, in these places exclusively steppe terrain prevails, characterized by uniformity and stone blockages encountered.  Among these rocky shores there are cozy coves with sandy beaches that are incredibly beautiful.  The entire coast in these places is cut with steep cliffs and stone blockages, and among these rocky shores are dozens of such beaches.  The sea here is very clean and shallow, warms up well and has a soft shallow bottom.  If you want to relax in a wild place, enjoying the warm sea and solitude, we advise you to visit these unusual General's beaches (Crimea). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  Where did this name come from?  There is an answer!  This area belongs to a natural park called "Karalar".  In the postwar period, a military training ground and an airfield were founded on the territory of the Karalar Reserve.  The armed forces of the Soviet Union were based here, conducted exercises and tests of new types of weapons.  In this regard, the area was inaccessible to the population and carefully guarded.  Only military men of high ranks ‚Äî generals and marshals ‚Äî could visit these picturesque bays.  Therefore, they called these places - General's beaches (Crimea). </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  This area belongs to a natural park called "Karalar".  Of course, it is unrealistic to get here by public transport, but for motorists it is quite possible. </p><p>  There are two roads from Kerch to <span>General's beaches</span> (Crimea): one through the villages of Oktyabrskoye and Bagerovo, through the steppe, and the other through Voikovo to the village of Kurortnoye, and further along the sea.  The last road is more picturesque, but it is mostly unpaved and, to put it mildly, not very good.  Get from Kerch by car for at least an hour, although the distance is small. </p>

    <p>  From Cape Kazantip, the journey to the places of a thousand bays will take about two and a half hours.  Having left on the Kerch highway, it will be necessary to turn left onto Novonikolayevka, then through the villages of Stantsionnoye, Novootradnoye, Zolotoe and straight to General's beaches.  The distance is about eighty kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camping with a tent </h2><p>  As mentioned above, these places are deserted and wild.  There are no settlements here, and no one is renting housing.  However, from April-May on the General's beaches you can see the tent camps.  Fans of wild vacations have chosen these places, because there is simply expanse. </p><p>  In spring, the Karalar Reserve blooms.  Endless fields of poppies and tulips attract tourists, because the sight is simply mesmerizing.  Everyone who once visited these places in the spring again seeks to visit the beaches of General. </p>

    <p>  Crimea is a vacation for every taste.  Those who still decide to go on vacation to these places with a tent can be given one piece of advice - you need to take everything you need from A to Z with you, because there is no civilization.  Even in the nearest villages there are no elementary benefits.  Drinking water is not an exception, it also needs to be taken with you, because there are no springs and wells here.  In summer, you definitely need to take an awning from the sun with you, and the more, the better, since there are not enough trees in these parts, but somehow you need to escape from the heat. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful places on the <span>Crimean peninsula</span> is called by tourists the beaches of General (Crimea).  The photos posted in the article prove this to us. </p><p>  All reviews are inclined to believe that it is better to visit these places in April ‚Äì May, since besides the beaches themselves, the steppe pleases the eye with a riot of colors.  Each of the bays, according to tourists, is unique and inimitable. </p>

    <p>  Many people find snakes, lizards, various insects in the reserve, therefore they recommend being careful. </p><p>  Positive feedback on walks on General's beaches is left by cyclists who, gathering in groups, conquer these places and enjoy the beauty of nature. </p><p>  Fishing enthusiasts recommend fishing spots and boast of a catch, so fishermen can safely go for prey. </p><p>  Knowledgeable tourists in their reviews recommend being wary of the sea, it is not deep, warm, but because of the winds there can be big waves that imperceptibly carry bathers to the rocks. </p><p>  Lack of drinking water, poor roads, a lot of snakes, a lot of locusts - these are perhaps the most common reported shortcomings of General's beaches.  But to lovers of this nature, they seem like a trifle, and from year to year this place of a thousand bays is becoming more and more famous. </p>
