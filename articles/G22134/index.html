    <h2>  About the Bank: History </h2><p>  OJSC "Bank Growth" bears the history of two banks that, as a result of the merger, formed a new credit organization of the same name.  Initially, there was a bank "Kazan", operating on the market since 1994.  It was then that the first contribution was opened in it and a department for servicing individuals was created.  At the time of opening, the charter capital of the partnership amounted to only 100 thousand rubles, and on the day of accession it was fixed at around 1.675 billion rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the years, the bank has transformed into a joint stock company, continuously developed, increased its assets, expanded the network of branches and representative offices throughout the country.  And in June 2013, he assumed the role of the ‚Äúadoptive parent‚Äù, joining the joint-stock bank Rost, which at that time had a registered capital of 2.375 billion rubles and more than 30 billion rubles of assets.  This event has become very significant in the financial life of the country - a really powerful, large and stable credit organization with a wide branch network and impressive financial indicators was formed. </p><h2>  Bank today </h2><p>  The credit institution OJSC Bank Growth operates on the basis of a General License of the Bank of Russia throughout the country with a head office in Moscow.  Its distinctive feature is a reasonable conservative strategy related to working only in the real sector of the economy, and the main source of income was and remains lending to enterprises in this sector, as well as the service sector.  Thanks to the recent merger of capital and assets, the bank has expanded its financing and lending capabilities.  According to the statement of the credit organization itself, its main value is the interests and needs of customers, and all relations are built based on long-term cooperation.  A significant advantage and its pride is reliability, proven over the years. </p><p>  The main beneficiary of the bank at the moment is Yelena Vlasova (back in 2012 she acquired the bulk of the shares of Kazan), which owns about 50.5% of the shares.  The remaining substantial part is in the hands of the other four shareholders - Anatoly Zolotykh and Valentina Aleksashina (approximately 16.6% each), Elena Tarasova and Elena Kossova (about 8% each).  The president of the bank is Artyom Henkin, and the chairman of the board of directors is Vsevolod Morozov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  ‚ÄúRost Bank‚Äù maintains correspondent relations with large Russian (‚ÄúRosbank‚Äù, ‚ÄúUralsib‚Äù) and foreign (Commerzbank, Dautsche Bank, VTB Bank, etc.) credit organizations.  He is a member of the Association of Russian Banks, the Moscow International Currency Organization, and participates in the <span>trading on the foreign exchange</span> market of MICEX Stock Exchange and Moscow Exchange OJSC. </p>

    <h2>  Bank positions and ratings </h2><p>  Today, OJSC Rost Bank is in the TOP-100 of the largest credit organizations in Russia.  This is a very important confirmation of reliability and proof of the bank's ability to meet the needs of its customers in financial and credit services.  The organization‚Äôs entry into this list is determined by a number of principles of its daily work: </p><ul><li>  fairly conservative investment and credit policies; </li><li>  work mainly with the real sector of the economy; </li><li>  combination of individual approach with innovations in customer service; </li><li>  availability of bank products and services; </li><li>  openness for partners and customers; </li><li>  competent risk assessment. </li></ul><p>  Today we can observe an adequate loan portfolio with good quality indicators, which, thanks to these strategic principles, has formed Bank Rost over the years of its existence.  The credit rating assigned to it by the Expert RA agency in 2014 was upgraded to A + (very high) with a developing outlook.  According to Standard &amp; Poor's, the bank received a long-term credit rating of ‚ÄúB-‚Äù and a short-term ‚ÄúC‚Äù with a stable outlook.  Both agencies spoke positively about the quality of the organization's loan portfolio, evaluating it quite high.  This gives reason to believe that the organization is sustainable and you can trust it with your money.  Many make deposits or arrange loans at branches of KO "Rost <span>Bank".</span>  <span>Expert reviews</span> predict a stable and systematic development and strengthening of the organization's position in the financial services market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is interesting that the bank has its honorable positions in the regions.  So, a branch of the organization ‚ÄúBank Rost‚Äù (Rostov-on-Don) won first place in the competition held by the Guarantee Fund of the Rostov Region.  It took place in August 2013 and was associated with the provision of guarantees by the fund for <span>loans to small and medium-sized businesses.</span>  Interest rates, conditions and reliability of the organizations themselves were evaluated.  As a result of the victory, an agreement was signed in the amount of 20 million rubles, which was received by Bank Rost (Rostov-on-Don) for lending to the real sector. </p><h2>  Bank services </h2>

    <p>  Like most credit organizations, the bank offers its customers a full range of standard financial services.  It accepts Bank Growth deposits and deposits, grants loans to private and corporate clients, medium and small businesses, provides cash management and depository services, provides guarantees, works with letters of credit, conducts salary and other projects.  Their complete list is quite wide.  Some of them operate throughout our vast country, some specific services are provided only by Rost Bank-Moscow (for example, those related to interbank lending). </p><p>  The most interesting to the vast majority of the population are the conditions of deposits and the possibility of lending.  It is on them that we will dwell in more detail. </p><h2>  Deposits: types and conditions </h2><p>  Simplicity and convenience are important criteria of all products that Bank Grow offers.  Contributions are a vivid confirmation of this.  In a credit institution, there are two main types of investments for private clients.  These are the tariffs "Free GROWTH" and "Maximum GROWTH".  Let us consider in more detail the conditions of each of them. </p><h2>  Free </h2><p>  The first is a kind of wallet with "dripping" interest on it.  What does it mean?  This deposit is opened on demand, and withdrawal does not affect the size of the interest rate.  You can top up your account, as well as withdraw money, at any time.  Moreover, the minimum balance is fixed (10 thousand rubles), and the interest is high enough for a deposit with such conditions.  The maximum amount for this tariff is 30 million rubles or a million dollars (which practically does not limit the capabilities of customers).  The term of the deposit is from three months to a year with the possibility of prolonging the contract.  Percentage - the value is relative and is set depending on the period and amount of the down payment (maximum 9.2%). </p><h2>  Maximum </h2><p>  If you do not plan to withdraw money during the term of the deposit, then it will be more profitable to use the "Maximum GROWTH" deposit.  At this rate, the bank offers the best interest rates with their capitalization.  In addition, favorable conditions for early termination of the contract are provided.  Like the previous one, this contribution can also be replenished during the validity period.  As for interest, they reach 10.5% in rubles and 4.5% in foreign currency.  There are also significant differences in the amounts and terms.  So, the minimum contribution is lower and amounts to 3 thousand rubles, and the deposit term is extended from a month to three years. </p><p>  The bank‚Äôs website has a convenient calculator on which everyone can calculate the percentage of the deposit, depending on the planned amount and term.  In addition, individual and priority services are provided for bank depositors.  The first is provided when investing in the amount of 4.5 million rubles and includes special conditions for banking services, personal manager, VIP offices and so on.  The second - with a deposit of more than 1.5 million rubles.  In both cases, the client receives many very pleasant privileges. </p>

    <h2>  Loans: cash </h2><p>  Bank Growth gives private clients loans in a very large amount - up to two million rubles.  The reasons for arranging loans here are formed by the employees of the organization and can be expressed in four words: </p><ul><li>  honestly - without hidden fees; </li><li>  profitable - very low interest rates; </li><li>  quickly - the decision on the application is made within two days; </li><li>  simple - the package of documents is minimized (only a passport is required). </li></ul><p>  What conditions can potential bank borrowers expect?  As mentioned above, the maximum loan amount is two million rubles, the minimum is 30 thousand.  This money can be borrowed for up to five years (or paid for six months).  In this case, early repayment is possible without any restrictions.  The most interesting thing is the percentage.  It can be set at a rate of 17%, which is lower than that of similar products in many other banks.  Annuity payments, and the date of their implementation, you choose yourself. </p><p>  We sorted out the conditions.  Now you need to understand how the bank sees its borrower.  The requirements are standard - age from 20 to 65 years, the presence of at least three months of work experience, declarative proof of income is desirable (this increases the chances of approving a loan and obtaining a larger loan amount). </p><h2>  Car loans </h2><p>  The previous lending option is suitable for those who plan to use the money for personal or domestic purposes, for example, for a trip to the sea or for repairs.  If your dream is a brand new car, then it is better to use a special product.  How attractive is a car loan issued by Rost Bank?  The feedback from the owners of the machines that used this service describes the very encouraging conditions for its provision.  Firstly, this is the minimum package of documents (only a passport and application are needed) and the ability to complete an application without a visit to the bank.  Secondly, low interest - from 8.9% in the absence of other commissions.  The amount you can count on reaches 10 million rubles, and the term extends to 7 years!  Moreover, consideration of the application lasts no more than two hours, which further brings the borrower closer to the treasured purchase. </p><p>  In order to take advantage of a loan, it is necessary to take out personal insurance (in three categories), to have citizenship of the Russian Federation and under the age of 55 years.  You can purchase commercial vehicles and special equipment for this product. </p>

    <h2>  Affordable mortgage </h2><p>  To date, there are several interesting programs for the acquisition of housing, which offers ‚ÄúGrow Bank‚Äù.  A mortgage registered with this credit institution has the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  convenience; </li><li>  availability; </li><li>  simplicity. </li></ul><p>  Borrowers planning to purchase an apartment on a mortgage can expect a rate of 8.5% per annum.  In this case, housing in new buildings provides 100% installment payment of the down payment.  As such, the use of maternal capital is allowed.  At Rost Bank, borrowers are invited to participate in programs with state support, including Young Scientists, Military Mortgage, and others.  It is also possible to take a mortgage under the AHML programs.  Any transaction, if desired, will be accompanied by a personal mortgage manager. </p><p>  Using a special calculator on the bank‚Äôs website, it is easy to calculate in advance the approximate costs associated with obtaining a loan, as well as find out the approximate monthly payments depending on the term and amount of the loan.  An example is a loan for one of the most popular programs - "Resellers".  With an apartment cost of 4 million rubles and a down payment of 30%, the amount of borrowed funds will amount to 2.8 million rubles.  We enter these data into the calculator, as well as the monthly total family income - for example, 80 thousand rubles.  If you arrange a mortgage for 20 years, then the rate will be 13.35%, and the monthly payment - 33.5 thousand.  If in this case we use the state program of AHML, the interest on the mortgage will decrease to 11.85%, and the payment will decrease to 30.5 thousand.  By changing the source data, you can choose for yourself the most suitable credit conditions. </p><h2>  Bank cards: features </h2><p>  Which bank does without plastic cards today?  It is unlikely that there will be one.  Rost Bank also has its own interesting developments in this segment.  Debit cards are issued, which is associated with the conservative policy of the bank.  However, they have a number of interesting advantages.  So, on the balance of funds on the card you will be charged interest in the amount of 2-4% per month.  It can be paid in almost any country in the world, and the conversion of funds is carried out in the most profitable way - at the rate of the payment system. </p><p>  Cards are issued in various categories - from Electron to Infinite and Platinum, have a stylish design, and also provide opportunities for discounts on car rental and hotel reservations (as part of a special privilege system).  With the help of them you can make purchases on the Internet, pay for mobile and urban communications, Internet providers, television and so on.  The credit organization Rost Bank has ATMs in all cities of presence.  In addition, you can withdraw cash with a ‚Äúpreferential‚Äù commission (0.8%) through the Uralsib Bank AVM. </p>
