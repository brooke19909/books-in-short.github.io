Joensuu is the city of most interest to tourists.  The settlement is located in the east of the country, and is the administrative center of North Karelia.  Its population reaches 74 thousand inhabitants.  This small town was established relatively recently, in 1848.  Tsar Nicholas I became its founder. At first it was a small town, but over time, Joensuu turned into a large port and an incredibly important city of industrial importance.  In the 60s of the last century he was given the status of the provincial capital.  This place is also called the forest capital of Finland.  Joensuu is beautiful at any time of the year, there is something to admire and where to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="finland joensuu" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1790646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Brief historical background </h2><p>  Finland is not too ancient.  Joensuu is no exception.  It was founded only in the first half of the 19th century.  Then, at the mouth of the Pielisyoki River, Emperor Nicholas I defeated a small settlement.  At that time, he played the role of a trading town.  In 1860, the city eliminated restrictions on industrial activity.  As a result, local sawmills began to actively develop.  In 1856, the <span>Saimaa Canal</span> was built <span>,</span> thanks to which the conditions of water transportation improved significantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Finland developed very quickly, in particular Joensuu.  So, by the beginning of the last century, it was already one of the largest port settlements of the state.  Over the past decades, the city from a small agricultural region has turned into a bustling center of North Karelia.  In 1954, the local population was 24 thousand inhabitants.  And already in 1970 it grew to 36 thousand people.  In the same period, many improvement activities in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsocial security were carried out in Joensuu. </p><p>  The local university, opened in 1969, plays a huge role in the life of the capital.  Today, the educational institution has eight faculties and nine independent units.  As the settlement grew, neighboring settlements gradually entered it.  And already in our century, two municipalities located in the neighborhood were included in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels joensuu finland" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1790647.jpg" width="518"></div>

    <h2>  Climate and attractions </h2><p>  The weather in Joensuu (Finland) is inconsistent; it strongly depends on the season.  So, the city is pretty cold.  The maximum summer temperature is +21 degrees.  In winter, frost reigns here.  It is very dark outside, so extreme caution must be exercised.  It often rains in the fall, and temperatures after summer begin to drop lower and lower. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite such unfriendly weather conditions, there are always many tourists in Joensuu, because it is incredibly beautiful and there are a huge number of attractions.  This picturesque village is surrounded by the indescribable beauty of the forest.  So I want to walk along the cozy streets. </p><p>  You can enjoy local attractions with the sightseeing train.  It runs between the center of Joensuu and the port.  You can also rent a bike and travel around all the facilities on your own.  Visit is worth the town hall, which is located on the waterfront.
