And any little hostess, playing with her doll, must feed her some yummy!  To do this, let's make a dessert in the form of a cake. </p><p>  It does not have a single small detail and sharp corners.  At work, neither glue nor coloring agents are used - accordingly, there is no threat to the health of children.  So there are absolutely no age restrictions! </p><p>  This game will allow you to develop in a child various skills necessary in adulthood.  Try to create at least 1 piece first.  We promise that you will like it and you will make a whole felt cake!  Application to him can be found not only in the game.  It can be used simply as a kitchen decor. </p><h2>  Simple cake for the doll </h2><p>  For its "preparation" you will need to acquire: </p><ul><li>  Felt of various suitable shades - pink, brown. </li><li>  Threads matching color. </li><li>  Small beads. </li><li>  Sequins. </li><li>  Filler - synthetic winterizer, cotton wool or holofiber. </li><li>  Scissors, pencils, compasses and a ruler. </li></ul><p>  At the beginning of the work, do it with the help of a compass (if it is lacking, use any object that is suitable in size - a saucer, a mug). </p><p>  Divide the resulting circle into 6 equal sectors.  These will be the details of the pieces of felt cake.  Transfer the pattern to the fabric of both shades. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tridevici.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns for cake" class="if uuid-3013933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3013933.jpg"></div><p>  The side of the piece is also necessary - in width it will be equal to five centimeters, and the length depends on the perimeter of the triangular top.  Let's make it from brown felt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cut another pink strip equal to the two long sides of the triangle - this is the ‚Äúcream‚Äù layer. </p><p>  Details are ready, we begin sewing! </p><p>  A narrow pink strip is fixed with pins in the center of a wide brown one and stitched along the entire length.  Then, starting from an acute angle, the sidewall is attached to the upper triangle with a seam ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù - let it be pink with us.  The lower part is sewn the same way - do not forget to leave a small hole, here we will put the filler. </p><p>  Everything, the "biscuit" is ready!  The case for decoration. </p><p>  Embroider the entire perimeter of the pink triangle with beads and sequins.  Garnish with ‚Äúmarshmallows‚Äù, ‚Äúfruit slices‚Äù - the methods for their manufacture are given below. </p><p>  Thus, we made one piece of cake!  Make 5 more and you will get a wonderful puppet dessert! </p><h2>  DIY felt cake in 1 hour </h2><p>  And sometimes a cake is simply urgently needed at the festive table - after all, the doll has a birthday!  In this case, there is an option in which it takes about an hour to prepare. </p><p>  Necessary tools and materials: </p><ul><li>  Sheets of felt. </li><li>  Satin ribbon. </li><li>  A strip of silk fabric. </li><li>  Thread and needle. </li><li>  Sintepon or cotton wool. </li></ul><p>  So, we make a quick cake of felt with our own hands.  The patterns here are completely simple - 2 circles of small size (12 cm is enough) and a strip 4.5 - 6 cm wide, and its length will be equal to the length of your circle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="birthday cake" class="if uuid-3013891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3013891.jpg"></div><p>  First, cut out all the details from felt.  Next, attach a satin ribbon to the side, decorating it with beads.  And then everything - top, side and bottom - sew together and stuff with any filler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Drape silk with an accordion and sew this strip along the upper seam, imitating a cream strip.  Strawberries or berries can also be sewn from pieces of fabric. </p><h2>  Foam rubber is also useful </h2><p>  But the easiest way to make treats for the doll party is as follows.  You will need a piece of foam rubber with a thickness of 4 - 5 cm, felt shreds and a needle with a thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="craftroomfun.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a piece of cake" class="if uuid-3013885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3013885.jpg"></div><p>  From the foam rubber cut a circle with a diameter of 12 cm. Apply the same circles to the felt - these are the upper and lower parts of the cake.  The side part will have a width equal to the height of the foam rubber - 4 - 5 cm, and length - the circumference - 38 cm. </p><p>  Sew all details from felt with any seam convenient for you.  You can decorate such a dessert with artificial fruits, beads, crafts from the material, etc. </p><h2>  DIY Velcro Cake </h2><p>  But the most important thing in this article is that it is possible to use it not only for playing "mother-daughter", but also as a wonderful educational toy.  Kids learn to play with each other, carefully ‚Äúcut‚Äù with a toy knife, think, add and subtract, distinguish color shades, etc. So, making such a felt cake with your own hands, you will get an educational and educational toy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Prepare a set of felt sheets suitable for the shade of thread, synthetic winterizer or cotton wool, Velcro. </p><p>  To sew a cake of felt, you must first make a pattern.  The size can be any, based on the amount of material available and your desire. </p><p>  On the triangular details of the top you need to sew one side of the Velcro. </p><p>  For one piece of felt cake, you need to connect two triangles and one sidewall, not forgetting the hole for the filler.  Having put the synthetic winterizer inside, sew this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thereisbeautyallaround.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;chocolate - strawberry&quot; felt cake" class="if uuid-3013888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3013888.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, it is necessary to stitch 6 "pieces". </p><p>  To decorate pastel shades from felt, we cut out the details for the marshmallow.  How to do it is described below.  From the bottom we sew the second part of the Velcro. </p><p>  Done!  Attach all the marshmallows to pieces and play for health! </p><h2>  Collapsible Magnet Cake </h2><p>  This wonderful designer contributes to the development of fine motor skills of the hands, memory, thinking of the baby. </p><p>  To work, you must purchase: </p><ul><li>  Felt sheets - any suitable shades. </li><li>  Metal washers - about 1 cm in diameter - sixty pieces. </li><li>  Round magnets - sixty pieces. </li><li>  Hot melt adhesive. </li><li>  Glue (you can take "Glue instead of nails - a transparent seam"). </li><li>  Chalk or remnant. </li><li>  Thread and needle. </li><li>  Expanded polystyrene 3 mm thick. </li><li>  A piece of foam - a thickness of 3-4 mm. </li><li>  Pearl beads are 0.5 cm in diameter. </li><li>  Non-woven. </li></ul><p>  First, draw a circle with a diameter of 20 cm and divide it into six sectors.  We make 2 holes in one of the triangles - here we attach the magnets. </p><p>  We draw 13 parts on the foam rubber and cut them out with the help of scissors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiwico.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt circles for making a cake" class="if uuid-3013908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3013908.jpg"></div><p>  This is one piece of felt cake.  In the first cake layer there will be 3 layers of foam rubber, in the cream layer 2, in the second cake layer - 3 more, in the second cream layer - 2 and in the third - 3. </p><p>  We take 5 parts and cut holes for magnets through them.  In five more blanks, we make indentations to the middle - here we put the washers. </p><p>  3 parts do not touch - leave as is. </p><p>  Then we will spread the washers into the prepared "nests" and gently grab them with threads to the foam. </p><p>  We will do the same with magnets, observing the polarity!  Also fix on both sides. </p><p>  Now let's collect the ‚Äúcream‚Äù: take 2 parts - the top with the washer, the bottom - the magnet - and glue them with glue droplets applied to the magnet. </p><p>  The Korzhik is assembled in much the same way, alternating a part with a washer, foam without inserts and a part with a magnet. </p><p>  So, we need to collect three ‚Äúbiscuits‚Äù and 2 cream layers.  For reliability, you can still flash the edges with thread - very freely, without tightening the edges and preventing deformation. </p><p>  Constantly check the magnets for polarity, because we definitely need to magnetize the layers! </p><p>  Next, take a felt, a template and cut out the triangles, with an allowance of 2 mm - 2 for each layer.  Still need strips of different widths - "cream" 1 cm, and "biscuit" 1.5 cm. Their length is the same and equal to 32.5 cm. </p><p>  Choose the color yourself, to your taste - after all, a felt cake can be "chocolate", "strawberry", "pistachio", or maybe assorted. </p><p>  If white felt is used in the work, then the magnets will shine through.  This is not very beautiful, so glue the details with non-woven, and only then sheathe the material. </p><p>  Sew all the details between each other with a seam ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù or ‚Äúovercast‚Äù, putting foam inside. </p><p>  So we only got 1 piece.  To create a whole cake, sew 30 ‚Äúlayers‚Äù - 18 ‚Äúbiscuits‚Äù and 12 ‚Äúcreams‚Äù. </p><p>  At the end of the work, simply fold all the layers together and decorate with ‚Äúfruits‚Äù from felt. </p><p>  Each cake can be rearranged, creating new types of dessert - this will give the child the opportunity to experiment with the composition. </p><h2>  Cake decorations - felt "meringues", "waffles", "marshmallows" </h2><p>  Decorating cakes is a must, even if felt.  And what else to dress him with, if not crafts from the same material?  Moreover, the felt keeps excellent shape and is perfect for creativity! </p><p>  For example, air meringue is very simple to create from pieces of white matter.  The scraps remaining in the manufacture of the cake will do. </p><p>  For one airy cookie, we need to cut 4 circles with a diameter of 3 cm. Now, cut three of them into 2 parts.  Each half is doubled and the free edge is sewn with a white thread.  Glue a bead in the middle of the funnel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inspiredtocreativity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apples for cake decorating" class="if uuid-3013920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3013920.jpg"></div><p>  Then glue all 6 parts to each other, hiding the seam inward.  We attach the fourth circle from below.  Done. </p><p>  Having created several of these decorations, you can lay them on a cake. </p><p>  But from felt pastel shades, an excellent ‚Äúmarshmallow‚Äù is obtained.  For him, cut a circle and cut in eight places, evenly distributing the cuts around the circumference.  On the one hand, we round off each of the sectors, and stitch along the sharp edges.  We put a lump of any filler inside and tighten the thread.  The top can be decorated with beads or sequins. </p><h2>  Fruit Slices for Cake </h2><p>  For this purpose, you will need hard felt and polystyrene foam, which was included in the list of necessary materials for the cake-designer.  It is a filler for lobules. </p><p>  So, we cut out the necessary details from felt - they are round in shape, but then (when the embroidery is ready) we will fold them in half and glue them to the lining. </p><p>  Glue must be used in minimal quantities - only so that the felt does not move out.  All seamstitches are stitched with a needle with a thread that matches the color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt fruit" class="if uuid-3013897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/3013897.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, orange, lemon, apple slices are created.  With your imagination, you can easily make kiwi, strawberries, carambola, etc. </p><p>  Kiwi seeds can be drawn with a permanent marker or sew black beads, and embroider veins. </p><p>  To decorate the cake, 6 pieces of each piece of fruit are sewn.  Attach to the surface is not worth it, because the child can use these crafts to prepare another tasty dish - a ‚Äúfruit‚Äù salad, for example! </p><p>  You can make such delicious felt cakes for your beloved children! </p>
