    <p>  In general, if you are guided in calculations by exclusively cold logic, it will be easy to understand that the Finnish company-manufacturer of Nokia phones in the mobile device market has limited space for maneuvering.  At the same time, the company acts extremely confidently, like the Japanese, who somehow manage to live in such numbers in a small territory. </p><p>  But the topic of our today's review is not these good people who, by the way, understand a lot about modern technologies, namely Nokia <span>Lumia 735.</span> In general, this line of products of the company was able to take root in the smartphone market, most likely due to high-quality cameras, which are embedded in the basis of any more or less modern apparatus.  Powerful cameras can be called one of the key features of the Nokia lineup. </p><p>  It should be noted that it is quite difficult to maintain the level of sales recently demonstrated by the Finnish manufacturer, since devices carrying the Windows operating system on board are generally not considered particularly suitable for entertainment.  In this sphere, the Android OS is undoubtedly and indisputably the leader.  That's where you really can turn around, it would be a desire!  But there is one question.  Have you ever noticed that all models of the Lumiya product line are similar to each other?  As if someone just activated the carbon copy.  The characteristics are cut and expanded, but the essence remains the same! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nokia 735: development basics </h2>

    <p>  The most applicable solutions for smartphones line "Lumiya" is the impact on the screen of the device.  Most often we are talking about changing the diagonal of the display.  Therefore, the company's engineers are also working on the resolution of the corresponding elements.  At the same time, there has been a tendency towards an almost constant rejection of any additional features.  It is simply impossible to say unequivocally what this decision is connected with.  Probably, this is known only to the developers themselves. </p><p>  The manufacturing company decided that it was time to change the rules of the game.  We will not discuss whether this was correct.  Just note that the company refused common sense, ideas and prejudices, instantly bursting into the middle price segment.  We are already talking specifically about the Nokia <span>Lumia 735.</span> By the way, it is a direct continuation of the previous device with the index 730. Some characteristics have been changed, but otherwise it is the same device. </p><h2>  Nokia 735 and 730: differences </h2>

But let's not forget that the 730th model is nothing but the ‚ÄúNokia Lumiya 830‚Äù, redone for the corresponding segment.  That is, she simply cut some characteristics.  Thus, we got the 830th with its smaller screen, a modified camera, as well as the lack of wireless charging. </p><h2>  Brief Specifications </h2>

    <p>  On board the subject of our review today is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor. The chipset has four cores operating at a clock frequency of 1.2 gigahertz.  The screen size is 4.7 inches, the resolution is appropriate, it is 1280 by 720 pixels, the so-called HD-quality.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using OLED technology.  Supported by LTE.  As the operating system installed, ‚ÄúWindows 8.1‚Äù. </p><p>  The size of the internal RAM is one gigabyte.  Eight times more is available for the user to store personal data, the device supports microSD memory cards with a capacity of up to 128 GB.  Of course, not without cloud storage.  There, the user can upload files not exceeding a total of 15 gigabytes.  The main camera has a resolution of 6.7 megapixels.  It is equipped with LED flash.  Video is recorded at a resolution of 1080 pixels.  An additional camera is a little worse - only 5 megapixels.  Nevertheless, this is quite enough for the average user. </p><p>  The battery is lithium-ion, its capacity reaches the mark of 2,200 mAh.  There is no <span>wireless charging</span> capability.  Of the interfaces, we can mention MicroUSB, Wi-Fi, operating in the b, g and n bands, as well as Bluetooth version 4.0.  The function of two SIM cards is supported.  To do this, they must be processed according to the MicroSIM standard.  There is a radio module. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  What can be found in the box except the phone?  This, of course, is a removable battery, as noted earlier, with a capacity of 2,200 mAh.  According to the standard, a charger is included in the package.  Of course, all the necessary documentation is present.  This is a warranty card, as well as an instruction manual.  A wired stereo headset is not included, it is replaced by an additional rear panel for the device.  By the way, the Nokia 735 case can also be purchased separately by contacting any mobile phone store. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Probably, none of the users will be surprised to find rounded edges.  This design is quite typical for those devices of the Lumiya product line that were just starting to show it to a wide audience, which later fell in love with the device.  The smartphone case is made of fairly bright plastic.  In general, the user has a good choice regarding color schemes. </p><p>  Currently, in the smartphone market you can find the device in the classic versions (black and white) and non-classical (green, orange).  The device comes with an additional dark panel.  Almost immediately, it becomes clear that it is not glossy, but matte. </p><p>  The phone case can be disassembled.  Thus, we can immediately put a tick in front of the item ‚Äúthe ability to replace the built-in battery‚Äù.  Inside, there are also connectors in which two SIM cards are installed.  The replaceable case is worn directly on the device board.  We can say that this design for Nokia smartphones has become classic, even branded. </p><p>  It, by the way, over time began to be used by other manufacturers of mobile devices in their creations.  This design is highly reliable.  It is possible that the use as a material for the plastic case has become optimal.  But over time, the gloss will still be wiped out.  Although there‚Äôs no getting away from it, and this is generally in the order of things. </p>
