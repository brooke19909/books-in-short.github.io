A favorable warm climate with an abundance of rainfall and fertile soil contributed to population growth, the development of culture and technology.  6000-5000 years BC  e.  In the Hangzhou area, the early Neolithic culture of Kuahuqiao flourished.  Then it was replaced by the Hemudu culture (5000-4500 BC), the first artifacts of which were found near the city of Ningbo.  Beginning in 3400 BC, the last Neolithic ‚Äújade culture‚Äù, called Lanzhou, was elevated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the second millennium BC, the power of the Shang civilization was established in eastern China.  However, the peoples of Ouye and Donggue, who inhabited the Zhejiang region, were able to maintain independence.  In the 7-3 centuries BC  e.  in this territory, the Yue kingdom was formed, which actively and with varying success fought with the neighboring kingdoms of Wu, Qi and Chu.  In 333 BC  e.  was conquered by the Chuy van (ruler).  In 222 BC  land became part of the Qin Empire.  At the same time, residents of Yue largely retained their political and social structures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.people.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pottery celadon" class="if uuid-2555527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2555527.jpg"></div><h2>  History of our era </h2><p>  During the Three Kingdoms (3rd century), Zhejiang entered the kingdom of Wu.  Being a relatively calm region, it has become a haven for many refugees from northern China, who suffered from civil strife.  The merger of cultures contributed to rapid economic growth.  Metallurgy was particularly developed, and local merchants established a wide trading network from Manchuria to South Vietnam.  According to historical chronicles, the local navy was the strongest in the Far East. </p><p>  In the middle of the 1st millennium, Qiantang (Hangzhou) was one of the three most developed cities in southern China.  The region became the base of the Sui dynasty, which managed to unite the country after a long period of unrest.  To transport food (mainly grain) from the Zhejiang province to the central regions of the country, the Grand Canal was built, and today it is a grand hydraulic structure recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The development of unique celadon ceramics characterized by the exceptional quality of glaze dates back to this historical period.  Products with a pale greenish grayish tint resembling a jade structure are especially valued. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the 900s, Hangzhou became the capital of the Wuyu Kingdom.  The city retained its capital status after the unification of China <span>by the Song Dynasty.</span>  According to some reports, in the X-XII centuries it was the largest settlement in the world, and the inhabitants of the region were considered the richest and most civilized in all of East Asia.  Even the <span>Mongol conquests</span> could not undermine the prosperity of the province.  The famous traveler Marco Polo called Hangzhou "the best and most noble city in the world." </p><p>  The final borders of Zhejiang were delineated during the Ming Dynasty.  Until the 18th century, local ports were leading in the country.  After being defeated by the British in the Opium Wars, Ningbo City in 1843 became one of five open to trade with foreign merchants.  In 1876, the port of Wenzhou joined it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxpixel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zhejiang, China: Hangzhou City" class="if uuid-2555593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2555593.jpg"></div><h2>  Recent story </h2><p>  During World War II, Zhejiang was occupied by Japan.  For help to the US Air Force, the Japanese carried out a punitive operation, destroying about 250,000 residents of the province. </p><p>  In 1949, power in the country passed to the Communists.  During the years of the Cultural Revolution, the once richest region experienced stagnation, which intensified after the restriction of maritime international trade caused by the policy of self-isolation.  However, in the 1980-1990s, Zhejiang became the epicenter of the development of a new economic policy - the merger of communist ideas and a market economy - which allowed China to become one of the leading countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.u-fukui.ac.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zhejiang University, China" class="if uuid-2555645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2555645.jpg"></div><h2>  Cities </h2><p>  Zhejiang in China is an example of a harmonious combination of urbanization and rural development.
