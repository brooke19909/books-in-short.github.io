    <p>  <strong><span>What is a tablet?</span></strong> </p><p>  Many will probably be surprised at the seemingly so obvious question.  But in our case, it does not mean the technical side, but the functional purpose.  Take, for example, smartphones.  With these devices, everything is very clear - they are designed for communication.  These are overgrown phones that can easily compete with old PCs of the last decade with their computing power.  The tablet, the capabilities and functions of which are constantly being improved, is also actively catching up with <span>stationary computers</span> in its technical parameters.  And some of them, for example, the resolution of the monitors of the latest iPad, are already ahead of the similar characteristics of most modern laptops (not counting the Apple model).  And at the same time, the capabilities of tablets raise a lot of questions, and ordinary users have a very vague idea about them.  But some of the available features will certainly interest those who would like to show their <span>creative abilities.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Photo Editing and Graphics Creation</strong> </p>

On the one hand, <span>drawing with a finger</span> on the glass is fraught with many advantages, and on the other, problems with small details often arise.  And this is the main drawback.  Despite the fact that the above applications allow you to change the scale of the picture, it‚Äôs rather difficult to achieve pixel accuracy.  And this causes certain inconvenience, especially when you want to depict filigree details.  However, the use of a high-quality, sensitive stylus allows you to cope with this problem.  Now there are even such feathers (for example, the JaJa feather) that, in addition to pressing force, also respond to the angle of inclination, and this allows you to come close to a professional level.

    <p>  <strong>Second monitor</strong> </p><p>  Not everyone knows about this curious feature of tablets.  Using the ‚Äútablet‚Äù as an additional screen allows you to display almost the same picture on the auxiliary device as the main device.  Moreover, the image on the tablet is not only available for viewing - using the touch screen you can drag and drop windows, manage the list of tasks, draw, etc. There is room for imagination to take a walk here.  Usually they use the program Air Display (iOS), ScreenSlider (Android) or iDisplay.  Unfortunately, these applications are paid, and although their price is not too high, this is the main minus of such a possibility of tablets.  In order for this function to work, you will also need to install a free server on the user computer and configure communication via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or a USB cable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung tablet features" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/212983.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Video editing</strong> </p><p>  This feature is one of the most demanding on the tablet‚Äôs resources, and therefore you can normally use it only on top-end devices equipped with iOS or Android.  iPhone and iPad are initially equipped with the Camera application, which makes it possible to carry out basic manipulations.  And the owners of any other tablets can download the application from the Google Play or Apple iTunes Store.  Despite the fact that even the best programs, such as Avid Studio and iMovie, are still far from professional work, with high-quality cameras, you can try yourself in the role of a novice filmmaker. </p><p>  <strong>Finally</strong> </p><p>  Regardless of how the future features of the Samsung tablet or tablets from other manufacturers are designed, most of the ‚Äútablet‚Äù applications come down to <span>creative activity.</span>  And although the border between her and entertainment is not too clear right now, this circumstance seems to be temporary.  A few decades will pass, and the capabilities of tablet PCs will allow them to switch from an intermediate class of devices to real computers, and the old stationary PCs will become a museum rarity. </p>
