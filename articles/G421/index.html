    <p>  The park hotel looks equally pretty both from the inside and the outside.  He has a fairly large well-groomed area.  In the evenings you can stroll not only through it, but also through the nearby Babolovsky park.  Many sights are within walking distance, including the famous royal palace. </p><p>  As for the work of the staff, the maids work quite harmoniously: the rooms and public areas are always clean, towels and bed linen are changed regularly.  Some reviews express dissatisfaction with the fact that employees at the registration desk do not speak English, which causes difficulties in communicating with many foreigners who come here to relax and see local attractions. </p><p>  Meals by almost all tourists are rated at a solid "five".  Breakfasts always consist only of fresh products, besides the buffet is constantly replenished, therefore, even arriving at the very last minute, you can get everything that was set at the time of opening. </p><p>  The hotel pool is large and always clean.  The water temperature in it, however, is somewhat high, but this is a matter of taste.  Some in their reviews regret that the use of the sauna is not included in the price, and customers also complain that geographically it is far from the pool. </p><p>  Many consider it a big plus that right from the hotel you can stroll to the palaces.  After the noise of a big city, such a promenade seems like a fairy tale.  In fifteen minutes, through Babolovsky Park you can walk to the <span>Chinese village,</span> and from there go to the Alexander or Catherine ensembles. </p><p>  One of the drawbacks of this park-hotel in their reviews, some tourists call poor soundproofing. </p>
