This wardrobe item looks very stylish and spectacular, especially if there is heat or a young lady in the resort on the street.  In addition, an important advantage of the tunic is its ability to hide extra pounds from prying eyes.  This happens due to the fact that the product is intentionally sewn several sizes larger.  From this it looks very light and airy, respectively, significantly slim the lady. </p><p>  However, many women cannot find a suitable version of this product in the store.  A trip to a professional seamstress will cost a lot, so only a few can afford it.  Nevertheless, there is a solution.  The material presented below will describe in detail how to sew a tunic with your own hands. </p><h2>  Necessary measurements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fr.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stitching tunic" class="if uuid-2870889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870889.jpg"></div><p>  Almost every woman can please herself with a new thing.  To do this, she needs to purchase in the store a piece of the fabric she likes, a needle and thread of the right color.  Scissors are almost certainly found in every home and so.  The only difficulty may arise in determining the size of the material.  But this problem is easily solved.  It is only necessary with the help of a centimeter to determine the desired product length and width.  In the first case, you should measure the distance from the base of the neck to the estimated lower edge of the tunic.  In the second - the distance from the tip of one shoulder to the other across the back, plus ten to fifteen centimeters to add volume and splendor to the product.  Also, professional seamstresses, sharing secrets about how to sew a tunic with your own hands, say that it is very important to determine in advance whether the desired product has sleeves.  If so, then you will additionally have to throw another doubled distance equal to the required length of the sleeve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The easiest way </h2><div class="photo" data-original="buhomag.elmundo.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic fast" class="if uuid-2870907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870907.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not want to bother with taking measurements, then you can do the following.  To do this, you need to find a wide T-shirt in your wardrobe or purchase a wide t-shirt specially in the store.  Its length is absolutely not important, because we are only interested in the main parameters of the product.  When the desired template is found, along with it you can go for a piece of fabric.  Or take measurements from him, and only after that go for goods for needlework.  How to sew a tunic with your own hands without taking measurements from yourself and building a pattern?  To do this, you need to use the same t-shirt, turn it inside out and outline a pattern on the prepared sheet of paper.  The main thing when sketching - do not forget to leave allowances at the seams. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Tunic is one of the simplest items of clothing, which even beginner needlewomen can sew at home.  Below is a step-by-step guide to help you avoid various problems.  In fact, building a tunic pattern is extremely simple.  You just need to prepare special pins for attaching the fabric, a centimeter and a piece of chalk or soap.  It is necessary to draw a pattern on a flat smooth surface.  This will ensure the clarity of the lines and help even beginners to sew a tunic with their own hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Building patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vn.123rf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a tunic" class="if uuid-2870914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870914.jpg"></div><p>  When everything you need is at hand, proceed: </p><ol><li>  We take a prepared piece of fabric and fold it in half. </li><li>  We pin the material with pins so that the fabric does not move during the drawing process. </li><li>  After that, we take a centimeter and postpone the previously found width of the proposed tunic.  Similarly, we outline the length. </li><li>  Now we retreat from the top about thirty centimeters and outline slots for the hands.  The gate can specially not be cut.  After all, even professional seamstresses, to quickly sew a tunic with their own hands, simply make a cut on the alleged neck. </li></ol><h2>  Cutting parts </h2><p>  Since we previously folded the cut in half, we do not have to outline the pattern of the second part of the product.  However, it is important to note: if sleeves are provided in the tunic, they must be finished immediately.  A version of a T-shaped product is considered classic.  That is, the sleeves are an extension of the shoulder line.  Each needlewoman determines their length at their own discretion.  Having dealt with the pattern, we proceed to a simpler stage.  We take large convenient scissors and carefully cut out the prepared silhouette. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitalo.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic to do" class="if uuid-2870916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870916.jpg"></div><h2>  Assembly parts </h2><p>  No need to talk a lot about how to sew a tunic with your own hands.  Indeed, in the literal sense, this process involves the use of a sewing machine or a regular needle.  Each needlewoman determines the tool at her discretion.  However, if you want to make a better and more expensive thing, it is better to work on a typewriter.  And if the reader has chosen material that is strewed, crumbled, then in addition you will also need to process the edges of the product on the overlock.  Therefore, in order not to overload yourself with complex manipulations, it is better to sew a knitted, cotton or linen tunic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you are supposed to work on a typewriter, you just need to thread a thread of a suitable color and flash the side seams and shoulder seams.  The lower edge of the product, sleeves and neck can not be processed.  Now even eminent brands offer similar products, calling them the trend of the season.  Here, in fact, is the entire instruction on how to sew a tunic with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.eyeni.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a tunic" class="if uuid-2870920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870920.jpg"></div><h2>  Drawstring Products </h2><p>  Recently, girls and even many women prefer to wear tunics that accentuate the waist or otherwise mask the "sides of the caterpillar."  A similar thing can also be done at home.  It is only necessary to determine exactly where the drawstring will be located.  Variants are considered traditional when this part runs along the waist or sides.  Both models are considered fashionable, so each beautiful lady can choose her version.  When a suitable place is determined, it must be measured.  In the first case, the waist circumference is fixed, and in the second, the distance from the lower edge of the tunic to the armpits.  After that, two pads are cut out from the prepared material and cords (or are made of fabric) of a suitable size are acquired.  Drawstring strips four centimeters wide are sewn on the back of the product, and the cords are pulled through pre-made eyelets. </p><h2>  Belt and Drawstring </h2><p>  You can also cut a belt from the main fabric.  If it will need to be inserted into the drawstring, then the width of the product should be made 1.5-2 times the finished part.  If the belt will be tied on top of the tunic, then its width can be made any. </p><p>  If a young lady is interested in how to sew a beach tunic with her own hands, she should consider a product from light fabric.  Neutral or contrasting threads will be required.  We put them in the needle, and then we sew the necessary part of the product with a regular seam.  In conclusion, we tighten it a little. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lekala.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic step by step" class="if uuid-2870934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870934.jpg"></div><h2>  An elementary version of a beach tunic </h2><p>  Many more will like an even simpler version of the product under study.  In fact, we often use it in everyday life.  Make it very simple.  It is only necessary to determine the circumference of the chest or hips - depending on which is wider.  Add fifteen to twenty centimeters to the result.  Then you should think about how long you want to get the product.  For the sea or the beach most often sew tunics to the floor.  They flirtatiously flutter in the wind and create a romantic image.  If the reader decides to execute this option, he will not even need a pattern.  It will be possible to sew a beach tunic with your own hands in just a few minutes.  But first, you need to buy a piece of fabric of the right size in the store, and then fold it in half and, using a needle and thread, overcast the long edge.  Now bend the top edge, leaving a gap for the tourniquet.  We also flash it and in the middle we make a small hole.  Finally, we make a tourniquet from the remains of the material.  We thread it, tighten it, and then tie it around the neck.  The result is an unusual tunic resembling a sundress. </p><h2>  Tunic for donuts </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself sewing a tunic for women with curvaceous forms is also easy.  However, professional stylists and seamstresses recommend making a special version of the product.  Its scheme is presented in the pictures below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic pattern" class="if uuid-2870885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870885.jpg"></div><p>  To cut such a tunic, you need to measure the distance: </p><ul><li>  from the base of the neck to the tip of the shoulder; </li><li>  from the base of the neck to the armpit; </li><li>  chest girth; </li><li>  tunic length. </li></ul><p>  Now we lay out the prepared piece of fabric on a table or other flat surface.  Fold it in half, and then in half.  We fix with pins and take a centimeter, chalk or soap in our hands.  Now, focusing on our parameters, we are building a pattern.  It should turn out to be similar to the scheme shown in the photo.  When everything is ready, carefully cut it and sew it. </p><h2>  Rough edge option </h2><p>  Professional seamstresses talk about the fact that in most cases they do not turn to patterns for full tunics.  The savvy will help to sew with your own hands a slimmer product.  For example, a geometric print looks very impressive.  It allows you to visually adjust the figure, make it more proportional and fit.  This action is another secret technique.  It means cutting out any version of an uneven edge.  Very popular options are when the corner is centered.  Also, there are often models in which one side is longer than the other.  To repeat such products at home, you need to think in advance which option is more to your liking, and then cut the tunic in any way described above.  Some needlewomen even outline a wavy line around the edge.  As a result, the tunic becomes even more original, stylish and fashionable.  Parts are stapled on a typewriter or manually. </p><p>  So, every woman can quickly make an effective tunic with her own hands.  To make everything go perfectly, it is recommended to avoid loose fabrics and use any pattern presented above.  After sewing, the finished product should be slightly stretched and thoroughly steamed with an iron.  Then your tunic will look like a stylish branded thing. </p>
