Even in his pronunciation there is something enticing.  But he is so significant, this Zakynthos.  <span>The island (reviews of</span> it will be given below), then the reserve, as well as the city.  All of them bear the same name.  The reserve is actually the first national marine park in Greece.  It was created for the sake of a unique turtle, which is included in the list of endangered species.  After all, only on the local banks does she lay eggs.  In addition, there are still seals, endemic trees and grasses grow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zakynthos island reviews" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/262480.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What else is meant by the word "Zakynthos"?  The island, reviews of which are envious of those who are forced to sit in their office, and have been on vacation for so long.  It is practically the most southern of the Greek islands of the <span>Ionian Sea.</span>  Tourists know that it is famous for its bays with breathtaking panoramic views (for example, Navajo).  If mainly people go to Greece - except for beach holidays - to go to museums and shopping, then these places are visited for the sake of their beauty and meditation.  Experienced travelers claim that everything here is in abundance.  The sea is incredibly blue, the beaches are huge and golden, the pines are emerald green.  This is the island of <span>Zakynthos.</span>  <span>Greece,</span> whose photo allows travel agencies to view tourists, is completely different here.  The <span>Olympic gods</span> also liked this place of rest <span>,</span> and people have always admired him - from Homer to medieval Venetians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece zakynthos hotels" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/262491.jpg" width="483"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, Zakynthos.  The island - reviews, as well as descriptions of its nature are filled with delight - not very big.  Residents here mainly grow olives and citrus fruits, in the north there are beautiful mountains and the world famous ‚Äúblue caves‚Äù - grottoes with a stunning color of water.  The most amazing bays, including Shipwrecks, are also located there.  True, there are relatively few settlements here, which made it possible to preserve almost pristine nature.  But the wildest beaches can only be reached by rented boat, and it is advisable to do this early in the morning.  And all there are forty-four villages.  True, most of them from fishing have already turned into first-class resorts.  But such is this ‚Äúbeach" Greece (islands).  <span>Zakynthos,</span> whose <span>hotels are</span> very different, can provide both budget "triples" - "fours", and upscale exclusive hotels.  For Russian tourists, the all-inclusive system has even appeared.  However, all these hotels are small, compact, no huge structures "a la palaces" are provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zakynthos island greece photo" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/262498.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now the city of Zakynthos.  The island (reviews, as we have already seen, are very commendable) has its own capital of the same name.  She is also on the seashore.  This city seems to be surrounded by a certain aura of the Venetian presence.  Indeed, the famous Italian trading republic owned it for a long time, so the whole local architecture bears this imprint.  There is even St. Mark‚Äôs Square and a cathedral dedicated to the same evangelist.  Almost all of the ancient ruins were built up with Venetian fortifications and temples.  The most beautiful fortress is located on the hill of Bokali, next to which it is good to take a walk on a hot day and drink coffee in one of the authentic Greek institutions. </p>
