And now this charming town, located on the Pacific coast, receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.  In the field of tourism, which brings good income to the treasury, most of its residents work. </p><h2>  The fishing village, which became popular overnight </h2><p>  The resort of Puerto Vallarta, named after a famous lawyer, delights with the amazing harmony and tranquility that prevail here.  Located on the banks of the large Banderas Bay, it became famous all over the world after the release of the film ‚ÄúIguana Night‚Äù, which won prestigious awards.  Travelers from different parts of our planet were drawn to the miniature town of Puerto Vallarta, saturated with the atmosphere of antiquity, and soon it turned into a popular resort, which can be reached from the <span>Mexico City</span> Airport <span>(Mexico).</span>  The flight time is only an hour and a half.  Russians who want to relax in a diverse country will have to change trains, as there are no direct flights from Moscow to the capital of the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="puerto vallarta" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1789612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Weather in a sunny city </h2><p>  The colonial city is dominated by a tropical climate, forming dry and hot weather.  In the period from May to November, the air temperature does not exceed 23 ¬∞ C, and from December to April rises above 28 ¬∞ C. The sun shines all year round in the resort, and the rainy season begins in June and ends in October.  True, you should not be afraid to go to a colorful city at this time, since precipitation is short-lived, but it is worth considering that the average daily humidity is 75 percent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beautiful beaches </h2><p>  Perhaps the main natural attraction is the well-equipped public beaches along the coast.  Playa Los Muertos is a popular holiday destination not only among tourists, but also residents.  The largest beach, whose water is not clear and transparent, is located near the Old Town. </p><p>  Playa Mismaloya is familiar to tourists from the film "Iguana Night", which made the resort of Puerto Vallarta world famous, but the Playa Boca de Tomates, located among the rocks, near the mouth of the Ameca River (Ameca), is not so popular, and foreign visitors are rarely here wander. </p><p>  Yelapa and Las Animas are the most remote beaches from the city, from which you can easily reach the jungle, and you can get to them only by sightseeing boats. </p><h2>  Old city </h2><p>  Puerto Vallarta in Mexico is famous for the Old Town, which is the most beautiful part of the resort.  The narrow streets are lined with large cobblestone, and walking in heels on them is quite difficult.  The Malecon pedestrian promenade (Malecon) is the busiest street, which often hosts fun fairs and national festivals.  Along it is a huge number of entertainment venues, trendy restaurants, souvenir shops and expensive boutiques.  You can walk along the road along the ocean even at night, when multi-colored display cases are lit and loud music is pouring everywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mexico time" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1789651.jpg" width="600"></div>

Expensive private yachts and cruise liners are moored here.  The wealthy Mexicans who buy housing here adore the prestigious area. </p><h2>  Church crowned with a crown </h2><p>  The visit card of the resort is considered to be the Church of the Virgin Mary - the most famous architectural landmark of the city.  The bell tower of the church, built in the last century, is crowned with a beautiful tiara, which is an exact copy of the crown worn by the wife of the country's emperor Maximilian I - Carlot. </p><h2>  Los Arcos National Marine Park </h2><p>  When it comes to the main city attractions, it is necessary to mention "Los Arcos" - a national reserve that Mexico is proud of.  Time in the marine park, which consists of five small islands covered with greenery, runs unnoticed, and couples with children often come here to rest.  The territory of the state-protected corner is rich in caves, underwater tunnels and arches, beautiful reefs that will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="puerto vallarta mexico" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1789619.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hidden beach </h2><p>  One of the natural wonders of nature is located near the resort of Puerto Vallarta.  The hidden beach located on the Marietas Islands resembles a huge pool, the sandy part of which is located under the hole, and a vault of a mysterious cave hangs over the water, and its walls protect the local landmark from the outside world.  Having gained fame thanks to photographs posted on the Web, a romantic beach was formed a century ago, and its appearance was not due to nature, but to people. </p><p>  Hidden Beach appeared as a result of military trials conducted by the Mexican government on remote islands.  And after the departure of people, the scorching sun, strong wind and high waves completed the work begun and gave the formed rocks and grottoes a bizarre shape. </p><p>  Getting to the beach hidden from the eyes of a person is not so simple: access to it is limited, and guests need a special permit, which is issued only by companies organizing environmental trips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Puerto Vallarta Hidden Beach" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1789607.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Puerto Vallarta with a truly Mexican spirit is the very city that you want to return to, and tourists walking through already familiar places always discover something new.  Spending a few days here is too little, since a busy resort with its unique face deserves more attention. </p>
