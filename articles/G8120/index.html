After the reconstruction, it represents an excellent pedestrian zone and a beautiful landscape park.  Prior to this, the embankment was a nondescript street located between the river and the park.  However, the reconstruction completely changed it.  Currently, this pedestrian zone, well-equipped with all modern requirements, can rightfully be considered the most romantic and cozy corner of the capital. </p>

About 15 wooden benches were put here, the cases of which are equipped with a backlight system.  Before them is a small scene.  This space, which remains dry even during rain, is intended by architects for performances by street artists, as well as for film screenings.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vernissage </h2><p>  An amazing and interesting place is the Crimean embankment.  The reconstruction of this zone also affected the vernissage located on it, which until 2013 was the longest in Europe.  Artists exhibited their paintings here in the open.  Before, you could not just walk here.  The embankment served as the place where the paintings were purchased.  Among the visitors of this vernissage, there were often famous athletes, politicians and stars of show business. </p><p>  After the reconstruction, Vernissage on Krymskaya Embankment is a closed pavilion with a length of two hundred and ten meters.  The exhibition complex is designed for ninety-six artists.  And places in it are provided absolutely free of charge. </p><p>  It should be noted that the wave became the basis of the architectural composition of the renovated embankment.  Its shape can be seen in the roofs of the "Vernissage", and in bicycle and pedestrian paths, in benches and artificially constructed hills.  The theme of the wave is especially visible from the Crimean bridge and emphasizes the proximity of this place to the river. </p><p>  The site arranged in front of Vernissage looks unusual.  She, unlike a regular lawn, is not planted with marigolds and petunias.  It grows interesting decorative and wild flowers, herbs and cereals.  All plants have different heights and create a common unusual composition.  Nearby grow European maples and lindens of various species.  Ornamental berries are planted here.  Basically, they are represented by hawthorn. </p><h2>  Dry fountain </h2><p>  Crimean embankment never ceases to amaze its visitors.  If you go along it to the Central House of Artists, you can see the jet fountain.  It is equipped with a system that allows laser projection of images.  Such fountains are also called dry.  The reason for this is the location of the bowl of water.  It is built below the ground.  In this regard, it seems that jets of water hit directly from under the asphalt. </p>

A similar one was opened in July 2013 in Babushkinsky Park.  However, the fountain on the Crimean embankment is much more spectacular.  In the park, this building has a very modest size.  On the embankment, a whole alley of similar fountains is arranged.  Their jets not only have a backlight, but also hit at different heights and at different intervals.

    <h2>  Rest zone </h2><p>  An interesting place is the area between the Moscow River and the dry fountain.  In this place on the Crimean embankment, a beautiful and cozy recreation area was arranged.  Garden furniture is placed here - small tables, tables and chairs.  All of them are between the rows of trees.  This solution helps create the most comfortable conditions for vacationers.  If you wish, you can conveniently sit near the fountain or sit not far from the river. </p><h2>  Pedestrian waves </h2><p>  Crimean embankment has a clear delineation of zones.  At its beginning from the bridge is the Vernissage site.  This is followed by a dry fountain zone, followed by a place of artificial hills and waves. </p>

Further, it continues with paths that, after a dry fountain, look like real waves.  Here vacationers walk and cyclists ride.  Moving along such tracks is very invigorating.  They are especially loved by bicycle extremals and those whose hobbies are connected with jumping.  As for the pedestrian waves, their height reaches thirty centimeters.  <span>Bicycle paths in</span> some places rise to one and a half meters.

    <h2>  Puddle </h2><p>  A little away from artificial waves, another fountain was built.  It has an overflow type and is called "Puddle".  In this fountain, you can wet your hands or feet, sitting right on the bench.  Everything is like in a real puddle.  The only difference is that the water here is constantly updated and, therefore, clean.  But in any case, you need to wet your feet or hands in an artificial puddle only in good weather.  Along the edge of the fountain backlights are arranged. </p><h2>  Artificial hills </h2><p>  A section of the Crimean embankment, which begins after the Puddle fountain, is equipped with individual hills.  Moreover, they have different landscaping.  On some hills you can see a regular lawn and growing trees.  Others have the appearance of a forest edge, while others grow tall herbs.  Especially spectacular are the hills that are not far from each other.  It seems that you are not in the center of a huge metropolis, but at the edge of the woods.  This effect is enhanced by original lanterns-lamps made in the form of giant mushrooms. </p>
