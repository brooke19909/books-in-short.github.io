His story, on the contrary, is ancient and very eventful. </p><h2>  A long way to independence </h2><p>  The name of the country comes from the word ‚Äúbelgi‚Äù - that‚Äôs the name of the nation that has lived here since ancient times.  It is known, for example, that in the year 54 but n.  e.  the restless Julius Caesar conquered this land, which was reported in the report on the Gallic war: the name of the population already appears there. </p><p>  After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Franks organized their state here, and then the territory changed hands from time to time, now being part of the Duchy of Burgundy (late XV - mid XVI century), then belonging to Spain (until the beginning of the XVIII century).  It came to the ridiculous: in 1713, Belgium - on the map of the Holy Roman Empire, and already 23 years later, in 1792, this is the territory of France. </p>

    <p>  Then the <span>Vienna Congress was held,</span> called "to restore order in Europe" after the Napoleonic "redrawing the borders."  As a result of this worthy forum, modern Belgium has become part of the Netherlands.  I must say that this turn of events did not particularly inspire the country's population, especially the French-speaking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Belgian number one </h2><p>  Discontent turned into a revolution: 15 years after the congress, in 1830, the "small but proud country" became an independent state.  From the very beginning of its existence, <span>this is a constitutional monarchy,</span> which, as expected, is led by the king of Belgium, who is rather a decorative figure.  Of course, formally it is he who appoints the government, but the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers should be agreed with the parliament (which, in fact, is the main one in the country). </p><p>  The proof is a funny incident that happened in 1990.  Then the King of Belgium Baudouin I flatly refused to sign the abortion law, and without his signature the document could not enter into force.  Then the Legislative Assembly set forth the clearest example of deceit and casuistry, having voted to recognize the obstinate monarch as incompetent - for just one day.  This was quite enough: the functions of the <span>head of state</span> were transferred to the prime minister, who ‚Äúwaved‚Äù the law. </p>

    <h2>  Tolerant Belgians </h2><p>  An important factor that Belgium is constantly forced to reckon with is the language spoken by its citizens.  This is reflected even in the state system of government: for example, in the government half of the ministers represent the French-speaking part of the population, the other Flemish-speaking.  Administrative division comes largely from this principle, into the Walloon and Flemish regions, respectively.  Another, third, is the capital of Brussels, but here politics and economics have already played their part. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, Belgium has three official languages.  In addition to the already mentioned French and <span>Flemish (Dutch)</span> German has the same rights.  And this despite the fact that only part of Li√®ge province speaks on it.  Truly surprising and worthy of imitation, Belgium: the language because of which some peoples destroy each other does not tear it apart. </p><p>  The tolerance of the Belgians, their ability to negotiate, to meet each other, despising all restrictions and prejudices, can only be admired.  Recently, the <span>world community has</span> stirred up the news that gay marriage was universally allowed in the United States.  ‚ÄúEka is unseen,‚Äù Belgium has the right to say on this occasion, interesting facts about which contain, for example, information that such liberties have been allowed here since 2003. </p><p>  In addition, it is one of the three countries in Europe in which euthanasia is officially permitted.  At the same time, no one was embarrassed that the majority of the population (over 70%) considered themselves Catholics, for whom such an approach to human life seems to be unacceptable. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of geography </h2><p>  The territory of the state is small - only 30.5 thousand square kilometers.  The population is also not impressive: a little more than 11 million people (for comparison: more than 8 million live in London alone).  But its density is one of the highest in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Those who are interested in <span>where Belgium is located</span> on the map should turn their eyes to the northwest of the continent.  There, between the Netherlands, Germany, France and Luxembourg, it flourishes (the standard of living of the Belgians is very high, the state is consistently among the twenty best of the best in many respects). </p><p>  <span>Belgium</span> is not famous for some supernatural diversity of landscapes <span>, interesting facts about</span> which most often lie in a completely different plane (anthropogenic).  The pattern is simple: the farther from the coast (in the west, the waves of the North Sea caress the country), the higher the terrain.  In this regard, Belgium is straightforward and is divided into low, middle (central plateau) and high (Ardennes Upland). </p><p>  The climate, as they say, is moderate, typical of most coastal regions.  It is neither particularly hot (in July - a maximum of 25 degrees on the coast), nor particularly cold (in winter - up to minus three).  Rain is not a rare phenomenon, and travelers should also bear in mind that the Ardennes are much cooler than on the coast. </p><h2>  Heart of europe </h2><p>  If you try to say briefly about Belgium, then this is a typical European country, personifying all the notorious "Western values."  It is not in vain that in Brussels is the capital of the EU and the European Parliament, whose huge modern building is one of the local attractions.  In the innumerable mirrors, of which the walls of the building almost entirely consist, either heavenly blue, then the rising sun, or gloomy gray clouds are reflected. </p>

The most famous character, without which no description of Belgium is complete, is the famous manneken pis, reproduced countless times on postcards and souvenirs.  Brussels residents love their sweet, devoid of child complexes and, on the occasion of various holidays, dress him in appropriate outfits, the number of which has long exceeded six hundred. </p><p>  It is fair to say that almost everything Belgium is famous for, the interesting facts about which are countless, was created by human hands.  Almost every ancient town boasts magnificent examples of medieval architecture. </p><h2>  Northern Venice and Mini Europe </h2><p>  Entire ensembles of wonderful Gothic buildings make up the main charm of Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, and Bruges.  The latter, among other things, has become widely known as Northern Venice, since it is also dotted with canals along which boats move slowly. </p><p>  Narrow streets, charming temples, magnificent royal palaces - all this is everyday life, which reflects the history of Belgium.  The attitude to tourists here is the most reverent, the excursions are numerous and varied, and the number of attractions is truly huge, not to be seen in a month. </p>

    <h2>  Belgian footprint in world art </h2><p>  But seriously, Belgium, reviews of which are completely negative, is more proud of the original works of art, of which there are many.  For example, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Bruges is the owner of the sculpture "Madonna and Child" by Michelangelo.  This is the only statue of Buonarotti that left Italy during the life of the master, since it was originally intended for this temple. </p><p>  In addition, the history of Belgium contains another glorious page that is related not to politics but to culture: Flemish painting is one of the most outstanding and original phenomena in the visual arts.  She gave the planet such magnificent masters as Jan van Eyck, Rubens, etc. Many canvases, owned by prominent artists, are stored in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts, owned by the state. </p>

    <h2>  Tourist paradise </h2><p>  In Belgium, everyone will find something to their liking.  You can enthusiastically look at the monuments of medieval architecture, visit the museum of modern sculptural art, lie on a sand or relax in one of the local pubs: over eight hundred sorts of beer are brewed here (the Belgians themselves consider almost the worst of them as the advertised world-famous Heineken). </p><p>  It is impossible to talk about Belgium and not say a word about the famous local chocolate, which is produced annually in the amount of 220 thousand tons.  Zealous Internet researchers even calculated that on average, every Belgian eats almost on a tile of a sweet product per day. </p><p>  Of course, this is hardly true, and not only because ‚Äúthere is a lie, a blatant lie and statistics,‚Äù but also for the prosaic reason that a fair portion of the chocolate produced is exported, which means that the Belgians do not burst it.  Which, however, are not completely discouraged about this. </p><h2>  Discreet uniqueness </h2><p>  Discreet, non-aggressive, but unique, distinctive and unique - these are the epithets that Belgium deserves in full measure.  Interesting facts about the "harsh everyday life" of the local population can be cited for hours.  Why not touch: lifestyle, legislation or culture - a peculiar local approach is revealed in everything. </p>

Before 18 - must study, after 18 - go to the polls and vote.  True, from such a ‚Äúfrenzied despotism‚Äù no one feels disadvantaged, which proves the complete absence of emigration.  Nobody wants to leave from here - quite the opposite.  And Belgium demonstrates amazing hospitality: it ranks second (after Canada) in the world in the number of foreigners who have received citizenship.
