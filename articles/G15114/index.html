    <p>  The mother of the future grandmaster claims that he became interested in chess at the age of five.  However, at that time, parents did not attach any serious significance to this.  However, the family helped the child to the best of his ability, and our hero himself showed enviable tenacity.  Often he played one for two participants.  As a result, he lost and was upset because of this. </p><p>  His first successes were victories in the championships among the children of Ukraine, as well as Europe.  He was noticed, after which he was invited to train at the Kramatorsk chess club.  There he spends two years, it is during this period that he receives the title of Grandmaster and falls on the pages of the Guinness Book of Records. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About myself </h2><p>  Chess player Karjakin Sergey claims that enormous hard work helps him achieve such high results.  He practiced almost every day in childhood and practiced for 6-7 hours. </p>

    <p>  Great help was provided by the coaches who were always nearby.  They supported with kind words and advice.  To meet the schedule, our hero had to undergo training in an individual mode.  After graduating from high school in Simferopol, chess player Sergey Karyakin became a student at the Russian State Social University.  He chose ‚ÄúSocial pedagogy‚Äù as a future specialty.  The diploma of graduation was awarded to our hero in 2013. </p><h2>  Citizenship change </h2><p>  In 2009, chess player Sergey Karjakin was already known in different parts of the world.  At this time, the grandmaster decides to move to Russia.  He took this step, despite the enchanting success that was achieved as part of the Ukrainian team.  Indeed, in 2004, our hero and his comrades became the champion of the chess Olympiad.  The main reason for this step is the weak growth prospects due to the lack of opportunities for active training.  It is important to mention here that chess player Sergey Karjakin has set himself a high goal - gaining the status of a world champion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

To keep fit the grandmaster is helped by friends - representatives of the sports world.  For example, he conducts running training with Maria Savinova, an athlete.  His activities also include walking on his hands.  A full namesake helps him with her - Sergey Karjakin - the world champion in <span>modern pentathlon.</span>  At the headquarters of our hero, a physical training coach must work; he makes up the daily routine for major tournaments.  Sergey‚Äôs schedule has a place for a full sleep, a gym and a pool.  To win major tournaments, you need to start practicing from an early age.  It is at this moment that the foundation is laid that allows success. </p><h2>  Chess Achievements </h2><p>  By the age of 26, our hero has won many titles.  He became the winner of the 36th Chess Olympiad in the national team of Ukraine.  He is also the second winner of the fortieth championship as a member of the Russian team.  He became the winner of the club championship as part of the associations "Malachite" and "Tomsk-400."  There he became the strongest on the first board. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, our hero repeated success.  Together with Malachite, he won the European Championship.  In 2015, Sergey won the World Cup in Baku.  Then our hero defeated compatriot P. Svidler. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  You already know that Sergey Karjakin is a chess player.  His personal life will be discussed below.  Acquaintance with the future wife Galina happened at the university, where the grandmaster transferred.  By that time, a girl was already working there.  They saw each other for the first time when it was necessary to settle the formalities that were associated with the move, but at that moment it did not work out a close acquaintance.  Only after the completion of the Olympiad tournament, in which the Russian team won second place, did the romance begin among young people. </p><p>  Galina is not an amateur in the business of her chosen one - she studied at the chess department, therefore she knows the intricacies of this craft.  Young people got married in 2014.  After marriage, Galina became a regular in most tournaments in which her husband takes part, as well as a happy chess mascot. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  One day, our hero suggested that players who crossed the 2700-point milestone be awarded the title of Super Grandmaster.  However, most chess players did not support this idea.  The genius of the game is not alien to the most ordinary hobbies.  In his spare time from tournaments, in addition to sports, this person likes to visit bowling and movie theaters.  According to our hero, for the first time his craving for the game arose after watching an advertisement at the age of five, which stated that even a pawn could become a queen. </p>

    <p>  In London, a simultaneous game session was held.  Its initiator was Lord Rothschild.  Our grandmaster took part in the game.  Then he had to compete on twenty boards for 6 hours against 72 opponents.  During the match, he, moving around the hall, managed to overcome more than ten kilometers.  Our hero has many hobbies, but first of all, of course, Sergey Karjakin is a chess player.  Photos of this person are attached to this material. </p>
