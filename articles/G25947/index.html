When frost bites on her cheeks, a blizzard howls dumbly and the sun hardly shows, it is especially important to recharge with positive emotions and new impressions.  Someone chooses tours to hot countries or tropical islands.  Another part of tourists wonders where to go in winter to Europe.  Christmas markets with New Year's illumination, mountain trails, northern lights or the ruins of Ancient Greece in the warm rays of the January sun can give unforgettable emotions. </p>

    <h2>  5 reasons to go to Europe in winter </h2><p>  The cold season should not scare you away.  Winter Europe will pleasantly please tourists: </p><ol><li>  <em>Christmas mood and sales.</em>  Where else can you plunge into the atmosphere of a fairy tale, take a picture with a real Santa, try gingerbread cookies, washed down with mulled wine, and also buy inexpensive gifts for loved ones? </li><li>  <em>Price reduction.</em>  In January, a lull traditionally sets in.  You can buy tickets or book a hotel room much cheaper than usual. </li><li>  <em>Mild climate.</em>  Thanks to the warm Gulf Stream, in most European countries it is much warmer in winter than in Moscow.  And in the south it‚Äôs completely sunny.  The swimming season, of course, is officially closed, but this does not stop the seasoned Siberians. </li><li>  <em>The lack of an influx of tourists.</em>  Fans of attractions will be able to calmly visit historical places, imbued with their spirit, not pushing through the crowd. </li><li>  <em>A special winter atmosphere.</em>  Europe leads a measured, unhurried life in winter, which is interesting to watch from the side.  Sit in a cozy Parisian bar, stroll through the snowy streets of Budapest, admire the icy castles of Romania, sip hot chocolate in Stockholm, watching passers-by. </li></ol>

Where to go to enjoy the speed, the beauty of snow-capped peaks and the clear frosty air?  You will be happy to receive: </p><ul><li>  <span>French Alps</span> with picturesque landscapes and tracks of varying complexity, the total number of which exceeded 4 thousand. </li><li>  Switzerland, where the resort of St. Moritz is especially famous.  Here, the Winter <span>Olympic Games</span> and World Championships were held several times. </li><li>  Bavaria, where in addition to pistes for real extreme sports there are many gentle slopes suitable for beginner skiers and children. </li><li>  Slovenia, the <span>Czech Republic, Slovakia</span> or Poland, where prices are lower, the infrastructure is not so rich, but the scenery is amazing, and the air is healing. </li></ul><h2>  Together with a child </h2><p>  At the end of December, New Year holidays begin in schools and kindergartens.  Many parents wonder where to go to Europe in winter with a child.  A storm of emotions in kids will cause a trip to Finland to real Santa Claus.  Its residence is located 7 km from Rovaniemi, the capital of Lapland.  The child will surely want to sit on the lap of his good grandfather, ride live reindeer, visit an ice hotel and see the underground park where elves live. </p>
