  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Medal "For the capture of Vienna." Battle of Vienna</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the defeat of the German army in World War II, the Soviet leadership instituted a series of medals that were awarded to participants in hostilities in Europe, namely, for liberation from the fascist invaders of the capitals of some states.  One of them was the medal “For the Capture of Vienna”.  These were the last battles that “drove” the Germans from the countries and cities they had captured. </p><h2>  The capture of Vienna </h2><p>  The medal “For the Capture of Vienna” was not accidentally established by the leadership of the USSR.  It was a heroic operation to liberate the city.  It was attended by the forces of the Ukrainian Front, which were able to clear western Hungary of the invaders and get closer to Vienna. </p><p>  The operation itself was launched on March 16, 1945, and twenty days later, namely on April 4, Soviet troops approached the city.  The battle for Vienna itself lasted from the fifth to the thirteenth of April.  The onslaught of the Soviet troops was so swift that the German invaders could not destroy the city as originally planned. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the troops of the socialist republics seized Vienna, the government of the USSR confirmed that it did not at all lay claim to any territory of the state that it had liberated. </p><p>  During this operation, thirty-two enemy divisions were defeated, and one hundred thirty thousand people were captured. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="awarded a medal for taking a vein" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24032/760113.jpg" width="548"></div></h2><h2>  Institution of the medal </h2><p>  The medal “For the Capture of Vienna” was established on the ninth of June 1945.  Initially, a large number of sketches were offered, of which more than a dozen were chosen.  However, the simplest model was chosen, which was performed by the artist Zvorykina.  On the back of the coin there was an inscription - the date of the capture of the city, and on the front side - “For the capture of Vienna”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The medal “For the capture of Vienna” (photo below) has the form of a round coin.  In addition to the inscription, a laurel branch is located on the bottom side, and a five-pointed star is on top.  The same star is also on the back of the coin.  All available images on it are convex.  The material for making the award is brass. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vein taking medal" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24032/759620.jpg" width="398"></div></h2><h2>  Who was awarded the medal </h2><p>  So, for the merits in the great liberation battle of Europe, several awards were instituted, one of them was the medal “For the capture of Vienna”.  The list of those awarded with it is quite large - about 270 thousand soldiers.  Among them were those who went directly to the assault, and also organized and led the military operation. </p><p>  Here are just a few of the names of those who have received this award: </p><ul><li>  Alferiev Nikolay; </li><li>  Omelchenko Vitaliy; </li><li>  Marinsky Ivan; </li><li>  Demina Ekaterina and others </li></ul><p>  Awarded with the medal “For the Capture of Vienna” they accomplished a real feat.  Preserving the architecture of the city, the soldiers did not use large-caliber guns.  A lot of people died there. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medal for taking a vein photo" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24032/759634.jpg" width="396"></div></h2><h2>  Other similar medals </h2><p>  In addition to the medals described above, several other similar awards have been established.  For example, “For the liberation of Belgrade”.  This medal was awarded to over seventy thousand people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is also a medal “For the capture of Warsaw”.  This award was given to the soldiers who took part in her release.  It was more than 690 thousand people. </p><p>  Another medal is “For the Capture of Budapest”.  This award received more than three hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. </p><p>  Among the liberated territories there are fortified cities.  The award for the capture of Koenigsberg was established.  It was a very large-scale operation; over 760 thousand people were awarded the medal. </p><p>  The most numerous award was the medal “For the capture of Berlin”.  She was awarded more than one million military.  This meant the end of the German army as such, as well as the final victory. </p><p>  And the last saved city.  A medal “For the Capture of Prague” was instituted for his release.  She was awarded more than 394 thousand people. </p><p>  As you can see, the victorious march of Soviet troops across Europe was crowned with success and the complete surrender of the enemy troops and their allies. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="award medal" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24032/759621.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that very many who fought at that difficult time on the battlefields for their homeland deserve rewards.  All those soldiers who subsequently received the medal “For the Capture of Vienna”, as well as other insignia, must remain in the memory of their descendants, their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  It is not known what the world would have been if Hitler had managed to complete his campaign and keep the conquered lands, but certainly not better.  This can be judged by how the war was fought, how many vain deaths occurred that were not on the battlefields.  How many atrocities and cruelties, betrayals and rot got to the surface at that time!  No, it would not be better, definitely.  Therefore, there should be in our hearts great gratitude to those who helped free our world! </p>
