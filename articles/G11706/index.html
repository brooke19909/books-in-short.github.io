According to expert reviews, at the time of its appearance, the model for a number of characteristics looked noticeably more attractive in comparison with many direct competitors.  First of all, this concerns the cost of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon 3200" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/968060.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The appearance of the camera has not changed in any way compared to its predecessor - the Nikon-3100 model.  The only exception is the panel with the shutter button, which has moved down.  Although this appearance is very harmonious and neat, it is still outdated.  The black Nikon-3200 case is made of matte plastic, the quality of which is hardly high, with rubberized inserts.  The creators of the model also saved on tactile sensations.  However, do not forget that it is designed for lovers, most of whom will not pay attention to these flaws.  The developers also provided a red version.  The dimensions of the camera are 125x96x76.5 millimeters, and its weight without a battery is 505 grams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon 3200 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/968063.jpg" width="536"></div>

A little higher you can see the ‚ÄúFn‚Äù key, which, at the request of the user, is programmed for one of four possible functions.  On the front side, the developers also placed the activation button for an additional flash type flash.  On the back of the Nikon-3200 is a three-inch TFT display, viewfinder, control keys and parameter changes, as well as the frequently used buttons ‚ÄúLive View‚Äù (displays the image on the screen) and ‚ÄúAE-L / AF-L‚Äù (allows you to lock the exposure and focusing).  The mode dial along with the shutter button and power switch, Japanese engineers installed in the upper part of the camera.  On the right side you can see the memory slot, and on the right - all the switching slots covered with a rubber pad.  Below is the battery compartment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon 3200 Camera" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/968059.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Main technical parameters </h2><p>  <span>The Nikon-3200 camera is</span> equipped with a 24 megapixel CMOS-matrix, which can be called a rather interesting idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdevelopers for a budget amateur device.  It performs well at high ISO values ‚Äã‚Äãand boasts a wider dynamic range not only in comparison with the previous version of the camera, but also with many competitors in its segment.  On the other hand, such a matrix makes the model very sensitive to the choice of optics, because such a large number of pixels must be provided with good light.  According to expert reviews, the lens, which is included in the standard package, does not cope with this task in the best way.  As for the shooting speed, it is on average 4 frames per second.  The developers did not stint on a good processor, so the camera works pretty quickly in all aspects. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  In the domestic market, the Nikon-3200 camera is sold with a fully Russified menu.  Information about the shooting parameters can be displayed to the user in the form of numbers or graphs.  For novice photographers, the second option will be more convenient.  Accelerometer, which allows you to change the orientation of the image on the display, can be called quite useful.  The user chooses the color scheme of the interface (black, blue or orange) on his own to his taste.  The developers have provided for the presence of pictures and symbols for almost all settings items.  This greatly facilitates the work with parameters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon 3200 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/968061.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Taking photos </h2><p>  Using the Nikon-3200, photos can even be created in a resolution of 6016x4000 pixels.  Due to this, images can be printed on a large poster or tightly cropped when the need arises.  Such permission entails a size of JPEG files up to 15 megabytes.  Today, the market has a large selection of inexpensive drives that will help to cope with this problem (the device supports media up to 64 GB).  There are no special claims to the device in terms of image quality.  On the other hand, the same cannot be said for a standard lens.  If the image in the center of the frame is clear and sharp, then there is a lot of blur at the edges.  In other words, it is advisable to always place the subject in the center of the frame.  In order to fully reveal the potential of the 24-megapixel sensor, it is recommended to purchase the appropriate lens, the cost of which reaches the mark of 1000 US dollars.  When buying this model of camera, a person wants to save primarily, so such a large surcharge for optics will be illogical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon 3200 photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/968058.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  Making videos is one of the main strengths of the Nikon-3200.  The instruction for the device states that this camera is capable of shooting video in Full HD and HD formats at a speed of 30 and 50 frames per second, respectively.  More operational management of this mode has become thanks to the presence of a direct start button.  This model was one of the first ‚ÄúDSLRs‚Äù to support tracking auto focus during movie creation.  The quality of the resulting picture can be called quite high, especially considering the cost and class of the device.  As standard, sound is recorded in monoform, but the ability to connect an external microphone is available here.  In conditions of insufficient light, the auto focus may be mistaken. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  High autonomy - this is not the strongest side of the Nikon-3200 model.  User reviews of the camera are an additional confirmation that a full battery charge is enough to create about 600 photos.  This is the average for a 1030 mAh battery.  On the other hand, taking into account the fact that in this case we are talking about an entry-level SLR camera, it can be called very acceptable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon 3200 manual" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/968062.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the Nikon-3200 camera was a logical continuation of the development of the amateur line of SLR cameras from this manufacturing company.  If we compare it with its predecessor, we can safely say that the developers did not make a major technological breakthrough due to this device.  The novelty has acquired a new matrix, and also boasts a higher quality of pictures and videos.  Along with this, its value increased by about 5 thousand rubles.  There are a number of disadvantages in it, due to the simplicity of the camera, the lack of a stabilizer, a rotary screen and some other flaws.  Be that as it may, it should be remembered that in this case we are talking about the simplest SLR camera that was created for beginner amateur enthusiasts who are unlikely to pay much attention to the mentioned disadvantages.  Moreover, against the background of competitors in its segment, the device looks more than worthy. </p>
