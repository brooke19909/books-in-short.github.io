Funny clothes on April 1</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At all times, human life was full of stresses, so people came up with holidays for themselves to have fun and have fun, and thus relieve nervous tension and avoid depression.  These include, first of all, April Fool‚Äôs Day or, as it is commonly called in our country, April 1.  This holiday is accompanied by practical jokes and parties.  To make it a success, you will need a costume for April 1, which you can do with your own hands. </p><h2>  A little bit about the history of the holiday </h2><p>  How and where Fool's Day appeared is not known for certain.  According to the most common version, it arose in ancient Rome, where it was called the festival of fools.  In Russia, April Fools Day became known under <span>Peter the Great</span> through foreign ambassadors who <span>played out each other</span> and courtiers.  As you know, the Russian Tsar reformer was very fond of jokes, so every year he invented something unusual, which surprised his friends and foreigners. </p><p>  Before the advent of the print press, raffles were not widespread.  That all changed when journalists started specifically launching April Fools newspaper ducks, which caused a real commotion.  Later, television joined the rallies.  For example, in 1957, the British were informed of an unprecedented pasta harvest in Switzerland, and they also showed a video report from the fields where the pasta was tied in sheaves.  Oddly enough, it turned out a lot of those who believed this information and even ran shopping to look for seedlings of this "plant".  Another famous <span>April Fools' Day joke</span> was born in Paris, when in the late 1980s one of the French publications published an article about the plan for dismantling the Eiffel Tower and its transfer to Disneyland.  This information provoked a protest among the residents of the French capital, who did not even suspect that they were being played. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Costumes for April 1 </h2><p>  Carnival costumes for April Fool's Day should be original or, as it is customary to say today, cool.  It is not necessary that they be too complicated, since the main thing in creating them is an interesting idea, and the methods for its implementation are much less important.  Everything can be used - from balloons to old CDs and candy wrappers.  For example, an original <span>alien costume</span> can be made using an ordinary green swimmer‚Äôs hat, sunglasses and rubber pipes, which should be cut into thin strips and secured with tape at the ears so that they hang to the waist. </p><p>  Conventional foil can also be used.  Together with CDs, it will help in creating <span>a robot suit</span> from a cardboard box. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúSoap and washcloth‚Äù </h2><p>  If you are going to go to a party together with your boyfriend or girlfriend, it is best to make a pair costume on April 1.  For example, it could be the option ‚ÄúSoap and washcloth‚Äù.  To make it, you need to glue a box of white cardboard with an opening for the hands and head.  It will become the basis for a costume designed for a guy.  To make it more convincing, you need to decorate it by writing ‚Äúsoap‚Äù on the chest and back in large letters and gluing pieces of bubble-wrap packaging material at the corners to simulate foam.  When the young man is suitably equipped, you can proceed to the manufacture of women's suits.  To do this, you need an organza that needs to be draped into small folds to make a dress resembling a washcloth.  On the side of it you need to sew a string of plastic round beads, which will depict a braid for hanging. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Crossword" </h2><p>  Another pairing suit for April 1 will turn out if you take two identical black T-shirts and, laying next to it, put on the chest with white paint the image of the solved crossword puzzle.  Each time you get close, the picture will add up and you can read the words written horizontally. </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúScarecrow‚Äù </h2><p>  If you have very little time to prepare for the holiday party, then you can offer a costume for April 1 in the form of a scarecrow.  You will need a flannel <span>checkered shirt</span> and a well-wrinkled hat that will help create the image of a defender of fields and gardens.  On this costume, if you can call it that, can be considered complete.  It remains only to do the appropriate makeup.  To do this, brightly paint your lips, draw a clownish blush on your cheeks and depict seams and patches on the nose and around the mouth with a black pencil. </p><h2>  "Mummy" </h2><p>  A simple and funny costume on April 1 will turn out if you wrap yourself with bandages so as to become like a mummy.  For greater naturalness, you can not wrap your chin and draw teeth on it with a black pencil.  Since you are going to Fool's Day, your ‚Äúinhabitant of the afterlife‚Äù can be anyone.  For example, a mummy-footballer or a policeman will look funny. </p>

    <h2>  "Toilet paper" </h2><p>  Do you need some fun clothes on April 1st?  Then make yourself a toilet paper suit.  It is quite easy to make, and the effect will be incredible.  At least you will surely find yourself in the spotlight.  To create such a suit, you need to glue a thick pipe with a diameter of 30 cm from thick cardboard, in which one large hole should be made for the body and one more for the head.  Moreover, they should be done with such a shift from the center so that the left end of the cylinder is on the shoulder, and the right end ends before reaching the elbow of 2-3 cm. Then two discs should be cut out of cardboard with a hole in the center into which the hand can freely pass , and close with them, like covers, the ends of the pipe.  In conclusion, you need to take a piece of white fabric, preferably flannel, with a width equal to the width of the ‚Äúroll‚Äù, and a length that will correspond to the double length of any of your T-shirts plus 15-20 cm. It needs to be folded in half and cut a hole for the neck, stepping away from the left edge to the width of your shoulder.  Then you should sew the suit on the sides so that from the upper bend to the beginning of the seam there is 50 cm left. At the end, you need to put on an impromptu shirt over the roll and get used to the idea that you will have to go for a while with your outstretched arm. </p>

    <h2>  "Pasta" </h2><p>  If you are going to April Fools Day with children, then the costumes by April 1 can be very different.  For example, make your baby a funny pasta outfit.  To do this, you need a large skein of rope of white or <span>beige color,</span> which must be cut into pieces of equal length.  Then you should take some old jumpsuit, preferably a bright color, and sew on it ‚Äúpasta‚Äù, folding them in half.  Next, you'll need a baseball cap and a colander.  Ropes should be sewn to the cap so as to hide its visor and get the effect of hanging macaroni.  To top it off, a colander should be attached to the baseball cap. </p>
