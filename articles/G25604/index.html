    <h2>  Guest reviews of beach vacations </h2><p>  As for a beach holiday in Serenity Makadi Beach 5 *, then almost all tourists were satisfied with it.  So, in their opinion, the hotel‚Äôs own beach is very large and comfortable.  Near the coast, the sea is shallow, so you can wander knee-deep in some water and play with the kids.  Those who want to swim, it is better to go into the sea on a wooden pier.  There were always enough sun loungers and mattresses on the beach.  There are a lot of different animals in the sea, so experienced travelers recommend taking a swimming mask with them or buying it in Egypt.  In addition, tourists are advised not to ignore rescue warnings about unrest at sea.  In the case of a hung red flag, you should not swim, as you can get very wounded on corals near the coast. </p>
