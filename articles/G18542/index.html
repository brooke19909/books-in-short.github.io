There are a lot of attractions on its territory. </p><h2>  Monastery of St. Tryphon of Pechenga </h2><p>  This is the northernmost sacred monastery in the world.  Located at: Murmansk region, the village of Luostari.  The shrine is located 160 km from the city.

Local produce is also sold on the territory - meat and ostrich eggs. </p><h2>  Teriberka </h2><p>  The small village became famous after the release of the acclaimed Leviathan film.  It is located on the shores of the Barents Sea.  The place is very romantic.  It is either frightening with its severity or striking with its strict northern beauty.  This is the magic of this place. </p><p>  Teriberka is a two-hour drive from Murmansk.  In mileage it is 120 km.  The road here is bad.  There are no gas stations either on the road, in the vicinity, or in the village.  Going on a trip, you should fill the tank to the top and take a few spare cans with you.  There are also no restaurants, fast food outlets or snack bars.  Of all the infrastructure, there is a small, barely surviving, local store. </p><p>  But all this is not so important, because tourists come here for special sensations.  In Teriberka you can see the northern lights.  Stock up on a good mood, very warm clothes, hot tea and mulled wine and set off to meet the magic!

The city also has developed gastronomic tourism.  Those who have been here strongly recommend trying seafood.  Their main difference from seafood, which is served in restaurants in other regions of the country, is Murmansk seafood freshly caught, and not subjected to a state of deep freezing. </p><p>  Visiting Murmansk and not tasting local seafood is a crime.  Seafood is sold and served at every step.  Also in Murmansk there are a lot of caviar on sale, about which there are excellent reviews.
