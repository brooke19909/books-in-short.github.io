This policy of her caused a huge amount of skepticism from experts and ordinary connoisseurs of this brand.  The first sign to change this situation was the model from the Lumia line, namely the Nokia 625. A review of the device is presented below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 625" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The novelty can safely be called a typical youth smartphone.  First of all, this is due to the case, which catches the eye not only with its bright shade, but also with a rather large display.  The choice of the buyer presents options in white, black and red.  However, due to the yellow or green interchangeable panels, the device can be given a very original look.  The entire front surface of the model, including the <span>front camera</span> and control keys, are hidden behind a protective glass.  The back of the <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 625 is made of polycarbonate coated with a transparent extra layer.  This creates a kind of visual marbling of a pleasant to the touch device.  For some reason, a hook is not provided for disconnecting the back cover, so it is better to remove it by prying one of the corners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All control keys are located on the right side edge.  At the same time, the volume control is located above, below is the camera activation button, and between them is the power on / off key.  This placement can be called quite successful, especially when the phone is in a horizontal position.  The build quality of the Nokia 625 is also not satisfactory. Feedback from the owners of the model indicates that there are no gaps or extra creaks here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 625 reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552359.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The smartphone display is based on the IPS-matrix and has a size of 4.7 inches.  Its resolution is 800x480, and its density is 201 dots per inch.  This is quite enough for the main applications of the device.  Moreover, the screen boasts wide viewing angles.  It should be emphasized that such display parameters are one of the factors that not only provide excellent performance and reduce power consumption, but also keep the smartphone in the allotted value segment.  A highly sensitive sensor is another advantage of the Nokia 625 screen. The reviews of experts and users of the device have become extra evidence that you can control it even with gloves on.  In addition, the display is capable of recognizing up to ten touches simultaneously. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera used in the model can be called good, but nothing more.  It is equipped with a flash and shoots with a resolution of five megapixels.  Color reproduction of photographs is not at the highest level, however, for a device of this price category it is quite acceptable and natural.  It is impossible not to note the presence in the model of proprietary applications from the manufacturer, designed to work with images.  As for shooting videos, they are recorded with Full HD resolution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 625" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552361.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The Nokia 625 is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 platform.  The processor of the device consists of two cores, each of which operates at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The main drawback of the smartphone, as well as other budget modifications, according to experts, is the RAM, the volume of which is only 512 gigabytes.  In this regard, the device does not support some games.  As for the place for saving user information and system data, 8 GB of stationary memory is reserved for them.  Storage can be increased by installing an additional microUSB card up to 64 GB in size. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Smartphone Nokia 625 operates on the operating system Windows Phone 8. In principle, it can be called quite convenient for use in mobile devices.  After all, it does not require very high performance, and also boasts nice fonts and logic, which is quite understandable for most users.  On the other hand, if the applications created today are supported by it, then they are usually stripped down or require a certain fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 625 price" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552362.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The autonomy of the Nokia 625 is at a fairly high level and relates to its strengths.  The device is equipped with a stationary battery with a capacity of 2000 mAh.  Since the technical characteristics of the model are far from the most outstanding, the smartphone is characterized by low requirements in terms of energy consumption.  Provided that he is in a mode of severe overload, a full battery charge will last for almost 2 days.  Not even all flagship modifications of this kind of gadgets can boast of such an indicator. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The main speaker can be seen on the back cover of the Nokia 625. Provided that it is not covered by anything, it is almost impossible to miss a call, because it sounds sharply and loudly.  While playing music through the appropriate application in the headphones, it plays quite cleanly.  The same can be said about listening to the radio. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 625 review" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552360.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the Nokia 625 smartphone, whose price in our country is about ten thousand rubles, has a number of advantages compared to many other devices.  Such properties include a good display, a good ratio of quality, performance and cost, as well as a high degree of autonomy.  At the same time, the model also has some disadvantages that do not allow many potential buyers to make a choice in its favor: the small size of RAM and the use of the Windows Phone 8 operating system, which does not support many of the existing applications. </p>
