    <p>  Many customers stay in it is not the first time.  And it's not that Marco Polo is the only one on the Patriarch's Ponds.  Judging by the reviews, it is really solid - with thick walls, elegant soundproofing, excellent views from the windows.  Nearby are many upscale establishments where you can have a good time.  Of the minuses, some tourists note only a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãrooms. </p><p>  Most of those who lived here believe that the hotel corresponds to the declared "stardom", moreover, they intend to stay in it upon arrival in Moscow. </p>
