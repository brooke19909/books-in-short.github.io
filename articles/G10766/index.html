Modeling is considered useful at any age.  Thanks to this type of visual activity, children receive the necessary knowledge about the shape and properties of objects, fix colors and shades.  During practical activities, the baby develops motility well. </p><p>  You can sculpt with children after a walk in the park and at the sea.  Seen on a walk can be depicted in the form of <span>plasticine crafts.</span>  But after visiting the city zoo it will be interesting to consolidate knowledge about wild animals in the process of modeling.  What animals can be molded from clay?  Absolutely any.  After the tour, the child can tell whom he met, who he liked the most, which animals are representatives of our country, and which live in distant hot countries. </p><h2>  How to mold animals from plasticine? </h2><p>  Studying animals, the child must understand what parts of his body are, what shape the body, head, whether there is a tail, what length and shape it is.  You will also need knowledge about the coat color of the character of the craft, whether horns are present on the head or not, what shape and size of the ears.  Why does a giraffe have such a long neck?  At the same time, the child recognizes the properties of plasticine.  For example, when creating a giraffe, the baby must understand that such a long neck will not be held upright by itself, but will eventually fall under the weight of plasticine on its side.  To avoid this, you need to use plug-in elements, for example, a toothpick or a wand.  Thin and long legs, such as those of a deer or ostrich, also strengthen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sculpt the tiger </h2><p>  How to mold animals from plasticine, read the article below.  Let's start with a resident of the eastern regions - the tiger.  You will need orange, black and yellow plasticine.  The largest piece of material will go to the body of a predator.  It is made of elongated oval shape.  Four identical paws are attached from below.  A round head is planted on the body in front, on the top of which there are two semicircular ears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to mold a tiger" class="if uuid-2308169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2308169.jpg"></div><p>  The tail of the tiger is long, with a black tassel at the end.  The muzzle of the beast is formed of three flattened balls of yellow color.  Dots are being hollowed on them with a pencil.  The nose itself is black, attached to the center of the muzzle.  The eyes are small round balls of black color, which are slightly pressed into the front of the head of the beast.  Last but not least, long thin sticks are made of black plasticine and attached along the entire body.  These are strips on tiger wool. </p><h2>  Chimpanzee </h2><p>  If you do not know how to mold animals from plasticine, read our recommendations below.  The next step will figure out how to mold a monkey using gray and peach colors.  The head and trunk of a primate are molded from balls, only the body needs to be made larger.  The hands and feet of a chimpanzee are represented by long and thin rods, which are smeared with fingers on the body from above and below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine monkey" class="if uuid-2308181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2308181.jpg"></div><p>  The semicircular ears consist of two parts.  The outside is gray and the inside is peach.  The hands and feet are sculpted using stacks - a special plastic knife for plasticine.  The last thing that happens is work on the face.  A ball rolls from light plasticine and attaches to the bottom of the head.  Above you need to cut your eyes.  To do this, the plasticine is rolled out in a thin layer and the necessary shape is cut out by the stack.  In the center are dots in pencil. </p><h2>  Elephant </h2><p>  It is possible to mold animals with a child from plasticine, starting with an elephant.  This is an amazing animal that has a shape that is easy to recreate with plasticine.  A long nose is attached to the large head in front.  So that the elephant could breathe, pencil holes are made on its end part, and strips are drawn on the stack.  On both sides of the trunk are white fangs.  Above the nose, on a large massive head, eyes are located.  They are made of two colors.  White circles - below, and black - the second layer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.motionkids-tv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="elephant molded with a baby" class="if uuid-2308187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2308187.jpg"></div><p>  The large head should hold tight to the body, you can strengthen it with a toothpick.  The legs of an elephant are known to everyone for their shape, similar to poles.  They are molded from thick sticks and placed below on the stomach.  The tail of the animal is small and thin, narrowed down.  At the tip is a small brush. </p><p>  The most recognizable part of the elephant's body is its huge ears.  They are molded by crushing balls with fingers from two sides.  In the same way, the middle of the ears is white. </p><h2>  Toothy Crocodile </h2><p>  Let's look at <span>how to mold animals from plasticine</span> in stages using the example of a crocodile.  An amphibian body is formed from a piece of green plasticine.  The tail and jaw are pulled.  With the help of the stacks, an oral cavity is cut so that the lower jaw is slightly thinner than the upper.  And pressing down from above, the tip becomes dulled, and the nostrils are pressed through with a pencil.  Also, dents are made with fingers on the forehead of the beast and eyes are inserted into the cavity - white balls with black dots.  You can make orange eyelids, as in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine crocodile" class="if uuid-2308199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2308199.jpg"></div><p>  The paws are made the same size and claws are attached from white plasticine to each paw.  It remains on the back to make a comb.  To do this, you need to form balls from small pieces and in a flat center line, pressing them down, put them on the back of the beast.  A pair of sharp teeth is attached to the mouth if desired. </p><h2>  Giraffe </h2><p>  To make such a high craft durable, you need to insert a wire or wooden stick inside.  A body is molded from a large piece of plasticine immediately with a long neck and head that bends forward.  Small horns and ears are attached to the top of the head. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine giraffe" class="if uuid-2308208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2308208.jpg"></div><p>  Then four legs are made and smeared with their fingers from the bottom of the body.  Several circles are glued to the body and neck of the animal.  It is interesting to make a giraffe out of yellow plasticine and brown spots on the body.  Thus, the craft will be more like the original. </p><p>  Now how to mold animals from a zoo from plasticine, you know.  Get to work with children.  Good luck </p>
