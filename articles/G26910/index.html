    <p>  The main reason that a single ticket to the Crimea owes its appearance is the reviews of the trip to the peninsula in 2014.  The first trips of Russians to the peninsula were overshadowed by completely unacceptable queues for ferries that ran between Crimea and Kerch.  In especially difficult cases of crossing, we had to expect more than a day, which caused huge problems for tourists and tour operators. </p><p>  The weather, which periodically presented surprises in the form of storms, also made adjustments to the plans of vacationers.  Crossings and ferries did not dare to cross the strait in such weather, as a result of which the communication between the peninsula and the mainland stopped completely.  Some tried to enter the territory of Crimea through Ukraine, but this required an additional expenditure of nerves, strength and money. </p><h2>  What is the point? </h2><p>  The ability to travel to the territory of the Crimean peninsula without additional waiting is the main advantage that provided tourists with a single ticket to the Crimea, the reviews about the new travel document are highly positive.  If you go savage, then for the transplant you will have to expect some time that could be spent on vacation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The travel document is a tight bunch of several travel documents ‚Äútrain ticket + bus ticket + ferry ticket + bus ticket‚Äù.  At the same time, the departure schedules of vehicles are adjusted to each other so that vacationers do not have to wait.  Another plus is the low cost of the travel document. </p><h2>  Travel by train to Crimea </h2>

    <p>  Since the border between Russia and Ukraine was blocked and trains to the peninsula do not pass through the territory of a neighboring state, the question arose of how to get to Crimea by train.  As of November 2015, there is no direct railway line that would pass through the territory of Russia and connect it with the Crimea. </p><p>  As a result, two options appeared.  In the first case, you must first take a train to the port of Kavkaz, then cross the strait by ferry, and then catch the train from the port of Kerch to Simferopol.  In the second case, you can use a single ticket, which implies that you will travel by train to Krasnodar or Anapa, and spend the rest of the journey on the bus. </p><h2>  Transportation to Crimea: general </h2><p>  If it‚Äôs much easier for you to get a couple of travel documents than three or more, feel free to buy ‚ÄúOne‚Äù, train tickets to Crimea are still inexpensive, despite the gloomy forecasts of some analysts.  This document was valid until October 1, 2015, in 2016 it is planned to resume its use, most likely, the principle of work will not change. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The decrease in passenger traffic has contributed to the cancellation of <span>unified travel</span> documents, however, tourism organizations look to the future quite optimistic.  In the summer, with the help of a travel document, more than 70 thousand people were transported; in total, about 175 thousand tourists rested in the Crimea in the summer. </p><h2>  Cost </h2>

    <p>  This summer many tourists were interested in the question of how much a single ticket to the Crimea costs.  There was no total cost of the travel document as such, since it directly depended on which city the traveler was traveling to from Crimea.  The ticket price consisted of the cost of the train ride and the cost of the receipt, which could be used to travel by ferry and bus. </p><p>  To calculate the total price, you must add from about 150 to 450 rubles to the cost of the train ticket, provided that you are leaving Anapa.  If you are coming from Krasnodar, you need to add from 250 to 850 rubles.  The price will also depend on which settlement on the peninsula you are heading for, for example, the fare from Krasnodar to Yalta will be only 250 rubles. </p><p>  It is worth noting that a similar type of travel document existed before, however, only residents of the Krasnodar Territory could use it.  Therefore, if you want to find out how much a single ticket to the Crimea costs in 2016, you just need to clarify how much the internal document will cost for residents of the region and add the cost of a train ticket to it. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Travelers positively perceived a single ticket to the Crimea, reviews about this travel document are mostly positive.  Passengers like that now they don‚Äôt have to spend time waiting for the ferry transfer, and then again on the train.  Comfortable trains that run from the central regions to the south also make life easier for vacationers. </p><p>  As disadvantages, single ticket buyers single out not-so-comfortable buses in which they have to spend 10-12 hours.  Most often, passengers who have problems with the musculoskeletal system complain, it is difficult for them to be in a sitting position for a long time.  The authors of a single ticket believed that the most difficult thing would be with the crossing, but in the summer it took no more than 45 minutes. </p><h2>  How to buy? </h2><p>  In 2015, this travel document was initially sold only at the box office of railway stations, after a while the sale of tickets and in electronic cases was opened.  In 2016, sales are scheduled to resume, so the question of where to buy a single ticket should not arise for obvious reasons. </p><p>  To purchase a document, you will need to go to the website of Russian Railways, register there in your account, then select a route to one of the cities of Crimea.  The system will calculate all the options after you click on the ‚Äúroutes with transfers‚Äù button and offer to select one of them.  The key advantage of the technology is that you can buy a ferry and bus ticket right away when you purchase a train ticket. </p><h2>  Why is the region so popular? </h2>

    <p>  After the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation, many residents of our country decided to visit the peninsula.  The reason for this popularity lies in the large number of local cultural sites that are loved by Russians.  Residents of Crimea were not afraid of the problems that arose after separation from Ukraine.  <span>The population of the Krasnodar Territory</span> still believes that the best choice of travel document is ‚Äúsingle‚Äù, railway tickets to the Crimea have become more difficult to get, but few people are upset. </p><p>  In winter, Crimea is warmer than in many regions of Russia, which is why the inhabitants of our country continue to actively go on vacation to the peninsula.  Despite the fact that in the winter season the number of tourists is significantly reduced, Crimeans receive guests with amazing hospitality and are ready to help them in solving any issues. </p><h2>  What to see a tourist in the Crimea? </h2>

    <p>  Tourist trips to the Crimea should be remembered for a long time, so immediately it is necessary to outline a circle of attractions that should be examined.  First of all, you should visit the <span>Genoese fortress, the</span> Bakhchisarai Palace, be sure to look at the ruins of the ancient city of Chersonese, where Prince Vladimir adopted Christianity at that time. </p><p>  All this will become available to you if you know how to get to Crimea by train, plane, bus and car.  The cost of traveling to the peninsula is cheaper than a trip <span>abroad, this</span> is another reason why Russians prefer to relax in the Crimea.  The prices here are much cheaper, and the quality of rest is still very high. </p><h2>  How to get from Kiev? </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that trains between the mainland of Ukraine and the peninsula have already stopped running, you can still get there.  If you do not know how to get from Kiev to Crimea, then first you need to take a train to the village of Novoalekseevka.  From there, you will need to get to the Chongar checkpoint, located 25 kilometers from this settlement, this can be done using local taxis. </p><p>  Next, you will need to spend some time in line at the checkpoint, since only people with babies can skip the line here.  After filling and checking all the necessary documents, you will find yourself in a neutral territory, where you have to walk about 5 kilometers to the Russian border.  After passing the border control at the Russian checkpoint, you can take the bus to Simferopol.  It is worth noting that it is sometimes quite difficult to get by car, since large lines accumulate at the checkpoint, in some cases traffic jams drag on for 20-25 hours. </p>
