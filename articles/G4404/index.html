    <p>  He took part in the hostilities against radical Islamists.  During the riot against the government, Dzhokhar Dudaev was supported by the Russian federal authorities. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Labazanov Ruslan was a Chechen by nationality, but was born (1967) and for a long time lived in Kazakhstan.

Somewhere in the early nineties, Labazanov Ruslan is under arrest.  Soon he was transferred to the territory of Chechnya.  Most likely, this was no coincidence, given that Ruslan probably had acquaintances both in the Grozny pre-trial detention center and outside it. </p><p>  At this time, unrest begins in Chechnya.  Nationalists and Islamists seize power in the region.  Taking advantage of this situation, Ruslan Labazanov raises a riot in jail, as a result of which he manages to be released.  There, he draws closer to the leader of Chechen nationalists, Dzhokhar Dudaev.  For a fairly short period, he is included in the circle of proxies and becomes the head of the guard detachment.  Until 1994, he held various positions in the government of the so-called Ichkeria. </p><h2>  Formation of the battalion </h2><p>  By personal order of Dudaev, Labazanov Ruslan becomes an adviser "on ethnic issues."  Immediately forms his own combat detachment.  He enjoys great authority among fighters and maintains strict discipline.  According to some sources, Labazanov was an intermediary in schemes for the illegal sale of weapons. </p><p>  In the spring of 1994, a conflict arises between Labazanov and Dudaev, which leads to a shootout.  As a result of a short battle, Ruslan gets to the hospital, where he decides to go over to the opposition.  The opposition considered Chechnya to be part of the Russian Federation and vehemently criticized the Dudaev regime.  One of the main lines of criticism was the facts about the cooperation of the new government with criminal circles.  As a result, the leader of the Niyso party, Labazanov, decides to move on to action. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For his organization, he takes over the house.  In a short time, his wards turn the building into a fortified position with firing points and other attributes of wartime. </p><h2>  Go to action </h2><p>  In early June, the members of "Niyso" organize the first rally.  They carry out armed raids on state facilities and recruit new supporters.  In the middle of the month there is a rally of opposition supporters.  During the demonstration, Labazanov‚Äôs people tie up a shootout with policemen.  The next day, Dudayev sends his fighters to capture the party‚Äôs headquarters.  After the battle, which lasted all day, the Dudaevites still managed to take the building.  Brother Ruslan and his two other associates were cut off their heads, which were put on public display in the city center. </p><h2>  Storm preparation </h2><p>  After these events, Labazanov left the city and began to build up strength again.  After some time, the Dudaevites attacked the village where the opposition strengthened and scattered their fighters.  Labazanov Ruslan retreated to Dagestan, where the main forces of the "Provisional Council of Chechnya" were preparing for the storming of Grozny.  Active participation in the creation of the militia is taken by Russian federal services.  They supply weapons and money.  A significant number of tanks were also transferred along with crews that were recruited from Russian contractors. </p><h2>  The storming of Grozny </h2><p>  On the twenty-sixth of November, the assault on the city began.  For the capture, the advancing group was divided into three parts. </p>

    <p>  The columns were formed from heavy tanks and trucks with the forces of the Chechen opposition.  After the forces entered the city, they began to slowly move towards the center - the presidential palace.  Tanks moved according to all the rules of the road and did not meet any resistance.  As a result, they reached the Presidential Palace, where they opened heavy fire on them.  A tank column without infantry support cannot function properly in conditions of urban agglomeration.  Therefore, many cars were hit. </p>
