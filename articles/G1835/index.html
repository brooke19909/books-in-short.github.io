What really happened in the house Spell tells about?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many watched the movie "The Enchantment."  The whole plot is built on real events that happened in the house of the Perron family.  A small town.  Haunted House Outstretched.  A family of father and head Roger Perron, his wife Carolyn, and five young daughters Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April move in there.  Creepy things begin to happen to them.  The aprons are desperate, but here the exorcists come to their aid, and simply put, fighters with spirits and all evil spirits.  There have already been similar films in the American box office, for example, The Amityville Horror, also based on what really happened to another American family.  Let‚Äôs try to figure out if this could happen, as Andrea Perron, the eldest of the daughters, wrote in her books. </p><h2>  Where to look for the house of Perrons? </h2>

It was inhabited at that turbulent time mainly by farmers.  The mild climate of the Atlantic coast and the vast expanses of fertile land provided them with a decent existence.  Famous for the whole world thanks to the film "The Spell", the town of Harrisville is located away from any major centers.  Even now he is extremely small.  One ring road, several quiet streets, a small pond with three streams flowing into it and only a half thousand inhabitants.  Here aprons and bought a property.

He built, as they say, for centuries.  Three hundred years stood a wooden structure, remaining in good condition.  In the summer of 1971, the Perron family looked after him.  The city called this house Arnold's estate.  Why not Smith?  Apparently, this Arnold managed to impress the residents of Harrisville with something.  It is believed that over the years since the construction, the estate has been owned by 8 generations.  Either Smith built the house in a bad place, or for some other reason, but his tenants were constantly in trouble.  Arnold himself went to the forefathers, jumping from the eaves.  His wife hanged herself in the barn.  My grandmother was 93 years old at that time.  In addition to these two suicides in the house, one person was poisoned, two drowned, four died, froze to death, and an eleven-year-old girl was raped and killed.  The stories of the birth and death of all these people can be tried to find in Harrisville's archival documents.  Of course, if any.  Let's start with Bathsheba Sherman, whose spirit in the film is the worst.

    <h2>  Real witch </h2><p>  In the film, the Perron family, and especially Carolyn, suffered from the evil spirit of Bathsheba Sherman.  This character is not invented, but really existed.  From numerous sources you can learn that Bathsheba became a servant of the devil, having sacrificed her young son.  She killed him by sticking numerous needles into her head.  This showed an autopsy, but the killer mother was acquitted of insufficient evidence.  After this, Bathsheba had more children, but the life of each of them lasted only until the age of four.  Bathsheba herself committed suicide.  According to another version, she died of an illness.  The coroner recording the death reported that her body seemed to have turned into stone.  One old Harrisville resident told Perron that Bathsheba was a rude woman and often beat her servants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Or not a witch at all? </h2>

At 32, she became the legal wife of Judson Sherman, a young farmer from a very good family.  Then, in order to feed himself, it was necessary to work from dawn to dawn, which Judson did.  His young wife, in the absence of her husband, took over all the management of the household.  It is likely that she was by no means feminine and not soft.  But in a different way in those days, she would hardly have managed to keep the house in order.  Her son was really born.  In March 1849.  Herbert was called him.  He was the third child in the family.  Before this, Bathsheba gave birth to a daughter Julia in the 1845th and a son to Edward in the 1847th.  Nothing is known about the cause of their death, just these children are not mentioned at the next census.  In 1953, Bathsheba gave birth to another son.  For what reason he died, is also not known.  But Herbert lived a long and happy life, got married, became a farmer, raised children and grandchildren.  Bathsheba herself died at a very old age, having outlived her dear husband for as much as 4 years.  She was buried in the central cemetery of the city.  There are no official records of petrification of her body.  All these facts make you wonder how real the Perron family is.  After all, the main <span>horror of the film,</span> terrorizing the whole family, is not so terrible.

One of them is the rape and murder of an eleven-year-old girl.  However, the official Prudence Arnold death document makes it clear that she was killed in Uxbridge, not Harrisville.  There are also some inconsistencies in her killer‚Äôs name.  So, Andrea Parron calls the name Bill Norton, and the WEK initials are indicated on the <span>court</span> order All data on the deaths that occurred in the house, Andrea obtained from the Black Book of Harrisville, which was the public document where all the events of the city were recorded.  She got this amazing book from a man who called himself John Smith!  It is noteworthy that before becoming Arnold's estate, the house was called the Richardson House, after the people who built it.  There is no data on the colonist John Smith.

At first it was a small wooden structure, but in subsequent years it was rebuilt several times, rooms were added, strengthened, and the appearance was changed.  It is very easy to believe in it, because so many years have passed since the construction.  Now the house is owned by Norma and Jerry Nelfrich.  They have never seen the horrors that Andrea Perron writes about in their book, they never experienced fear.  However, some paranormal phenomena in the house still occur.  So, Norma said that sometimes she hears voices similar to children‚Äôs.  It happens that doors slam in a house, furniture trembles.  Jerry noticed a bluish fog several times indoors.

Lorraine possessed <span>psychic abilities,</span> was engaged in clairvoyance.  With her husband, they investigated many cases where people were faced with paranormal phenomena.  They even created a museum that collected items related to their investigations in one way or another.  The sad story of the Perron family became known to them from one acquaintance.  The Warren worked in their house for more than a year, and subsequently were consultants in making the film.

    <h2>  Where does the soul of a suicide fly? </h2><p>  That a person has a soul, no one doubts.  Where does she go after death, as if no one knows.  Some say that they fall into a parallel world, others believe in hell and paradise, others that souls remain in our world, only on a different level, from where they visit us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Andrea Perron" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/363641.jpg?1396264726604" width="276"></div>  Psychics believe that the souls of suicides remain in the place of suicide.  Man himself passes away under the burden, it seems to him, of insoluble problems.  He believes that death is the way out.  But when moments remain before the transition to another world, most suicides passionately want to return everything.  It is in these fractions of time that a powerful release of the energy of despair and grief occurs, which keeps the souls of the unfortunate in this world.  They survive their suicide thousands of times and suffer incredibly.  Living people at the place of suicide experience inexplicable fear, sometimes anxiety or pain, sometimes despair or sadness.  It is believed that the souls of suicides feed on these feelings in order to reduce their own suffering.  If any living person comes into contact with him, souls begin to exert an influence on him.  The Perron family moved to just such a place.

    <h2>  What do the metrivals do with the living? </h2><p>  In addition to the <span>souls of suicides, the</span> souls of those who were brutally killed can also be attached to the place.  Psychics believe that the pain and fear that the victim experiences at the time of dying become for her soul an energy cell.  Some unfortunate souls who have not moved to the world of the dead behave calmly, do not interfere with the living, but simply observe them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aprons" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/363642.jpg?1396264797317" width="336"></div>  Most, experiencing unbearable suffering, begin to hate the living because they are alive, because they can not do anything, because they ignore their presence.  Then such evil souls with the help of telekinesis or various sounds begin to attract attention.  The fear of the living, arising from the sight of moving objects or from different rustles, gives the dead joy and makes them stronger.  It is believed that they can even kill the living.  The Perron family suffered from such evil souls.  The real story (the photos taken in the house confirm the presence of extraneous energies), once again showed that one cannot dismiss what official science cannot prove yet.

    <h2>  So what really happened on Arnold's estate? </h2><p>  Summing up, it can be argued that in the house of Perron there really were some paranormal phenomena associated with the deaths of previous residents.  Of course, not everything that we see in the film took place in reality.  So, there are no documents confirming that Bathsheba Sherman was a witch.  Also, there is no confirmation of some of the killings that allegedly happened in the house.  And the cinema house itself is different from the real one in which Perrons lived.  However, Ed Warren and Lorraine did work there for over a year.  It is not known whether this can be somehow connected or not, but already during the filming of the film, a misfortune happened with Carolyn - she broke her hip.  And when Perron‚Äôs daughters were interviewed, a strong wind rose.  Perhaps they were avenged by evil souls.  But all this may be a mere coincidence. </p>
