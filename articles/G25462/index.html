    <p>  <strong>Metro station Chistye Prudy.</strong>  <strong>general description</strong> </p><p>  Residents of the Central District of Moscow are familiar with the station located on the <span>Sokolnicheskaya line.</span>  The three-vault metro room is located at a depth of thirty-six meters. </p><p>  It should be noted that it was built on an individual order using monolithic reinforced concrete.  The floor of the station is lined with gray and red granite slabs, although until 1972 there was ordinary asphalt here.  Two rows of marble columns support the ceiling, into the supports of which lamps are mounted.  The walls of gray marble and black granite did not always look like that.  Until 1990, they were faced with white tiles. </p><p>  At the end of the Chistye Prudy station, a passage to the Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya line was built, just in the very place where S.M. Kirov‚Äôs bust was located before.  The pedestal had to be transferred to the transition from the Turgenevskaya platform to Sretensky Boulevard. </p>

    <p>  <strong><strong>Historical data and chronology of the construction of the metro station</strong> Chistye Prudy</strong> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even if you are not a resident of the capital, then you must know such facts anyway.  Chistye Prudy is a metro station that started operating in May 1935.  There was no central hall then, it was necessary to cross between the platforms along one of the outlets located at the entrances.  It is known that during World War II air defense departments and the General Staff were located here.  And in 1947, luminescent lighting was installed on Chistye Prudy, which was not on other subway platforms. </p><p>  The station was rebuilt into a three-vaulted station in 1971. A year later, a transition to Turgenevskaya appeared in the center of the hall.  And in 2008, a passage was opened that allows you to get to Sretensky Boulevard from Chistye Prudy. </p><p>  The station borrowed its name from the Chisty Pond and the boulevard of the same name located near it.  Surprisingly, slaughterhouse and butcher shops were dumped in this pond before, and it was called ‚ÄúFoul‚Äù.  After the pond was cleaned, a new name firmly stuck to it.  The Chistye Prudy station was first called Kirovskaya, and the street, which is today known to everyone as Myasnitskaya, was also named. </p>
