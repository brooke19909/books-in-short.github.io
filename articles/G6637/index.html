Hundreds of guests come here daily.  The city has its own airport, which, as expected, is located in the suburbs.  Guests and tourists come to Yakutsk for relaxation and transit.  Many need lodging near the airport.  Hotel "Liner" (Yakutsk) is one of the largest in this city and is located 200 meters from the airport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel entrance" class="if uuid-2795609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2795609.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that for some this arrangement is a big minus, but for someone a big plus.
