This is a favorite vacation spot for Russians.  The famous Crimean resorts are located on the coastal territory: Yevpatoriya, Saki, many salt lakes with healing properties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crimeaguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kalamitsky Bay of the Black Sea" class="if uuid-2953858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2953858.jpg"></div><h2>  Two definitions of the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bay </h2><p>  Historically, the waters of the Gulf of Kalamitsky in some sources are defined differently.  In early editions, for example, in the encyclopedia of Brockhaus and Efron, it is larger and limited to Cape Chersonesos and Lucullus.  Later it was limited to Cape Evpatoria and Lucullus.  This can be judged by the atlases of the GUGK of the USSR and Roskartografiya.  Here it is smaller and more pronounced. </p><h2>  Geographical Description </h2><p>  Kalamitsky Bay is limited by two capes: Evpatoria from the north and Lucullus from the south.  The deepening in the peninsula is 13 kilometers.  Its width at the entrance is 41 kilometers.  The average depth is approximately 30 meters.  Cape Lucullus, located in the bay, is a protected area.  There are several types of unique ecosystems.  The <span>rivers Alma</span> and Bulganak carry their waters to <span>the</span> bay.  A picturesque place with clear sea and dry steppe air saturated with aromas of herbs, attracts many who want to relax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The northern part, bounded by the Evpatoria cape, is sandy, low-lying and stretches south to Lake Kyzyl-Yar.  After it, the coast is high, loamy, with characteristic cliffs, landslides and landslides.  In these places there are salt lakes with healing mud and brine.  The most famous of them are Saki, Kyzyl-Yar.  In the northern part is the Evpatoria Bay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vil.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cape lucullus" class="if uuid-2953906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2953906.jpg"></div><h2>  Cape Lucullus </h2><p>  It is located not far from the confluence of the Alma River and is a reddish, high and steep bank, the height of which is 15 meters, where landfalls very often happen.  The color is caused by the clay rocks that form it.  On the edge of the cape there are fine sandy beaches, but swimming on them is unsafe, since you can get into a collapse. </p><p>  The water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sea and the entire territory of Cape Lukull is a conservation area and a hydrological natural monument, as it is recognized as a unique object in connection with the presence of water and land ecosystems on it.  Not far from the cape is the Ust-Alminsky Scythian settlement dating back to the 3rd-2nd centuries BC.  Its real name has not been established.  Due to collapses, more than half of it crashed into the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.krimoved-library.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calamite Bay" class="if uuid-2953850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2953850.jpg"></div><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  There are several versions of the name of the Kalamitsky Gulf of the Black Sea.  The first, like much in these places, is connected with the existence of the Genoese port, which was located on the site of the modern city of Inkerman.  This is due to the fact that the Sevastopol Bay was once called Kalamita-Liman. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second version is associated with the Greeks who inhabited these places.  In Greek, there is the word "kalamos", which has several meanings.  It is translated as ‚Äúreed, reeds‚Äù, ‚Äúgood cape‚Äù.  In Latin, there are also two opposing interpretations of the word.  This is ‚ÄúKalamity,‚Äù which can be translated as ‚Äúcalm,‚Äù and ‚ÄúKalamity,‚Äù which means ‚Äúdistress.‚Äù </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotel-uyut.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calamite Bay" class="if uuid-2953918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2953918.jpg"></div><h2>  Health Benefits </h2><p>  For those who want to spend their holidays in the Crimea, Kalamitsky Bay will be a godsend.  Many salt lakes located on its coastal territory attract thousands of tourists annually.  Of course, the coast of the gulf cannot be compared with the wonderful nature of the southern coast of Crimea, but the dry steppe air, the sea clean with clear water, healing mud and brine will allow you to usefully rest on the shore of the Kalamitsky Gulf. </p><p>  The sandy beaches of Evpatoria will appeal to those who prefer to relax with their children.  From May to September, the water in the sea and the air warms up under the warm sun.  People with diseases of the nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and respiratory organs come here to relax and improve their health.  There is everything for a healthy stay: estuary salt lakes, sandy beaches, clear sea, warm air saturated with ions of sea salts and the aroma of steppe herbs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dariyatour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kalamitsky Bay Crimea" class="if uuid-2953879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2953879.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches of the Kalamitsky Gulf </h2><p>  It‚Äôs hard to find the best vacation for families with children.  The beaches of the northern part of the bay are sandy, gently sloping, extending far into the sea.  It is calm here, it storms very rarely.  Most of the beaches are equipped, and in addition to a simple bathing, you can use water attractions, ride a boat, banana or a water bike.  The clear water of the Kalamitsky Gulf will bring great pleasure to lovers of scuba diving or diving with a mask. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dommirumir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zaozernoe crimea" class="if uuid-2953897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2953897.jpg"></div><h2>  Cities and towns of the bay </h2><p>  The village of Zaozernoe in the Crimea is located near Evpatoria, on the very edge of the cape of the same name.  The distance between them is 11 kilometers from the centers of settlements.  Not far from the village is <span>Moinak Lake Liman.</span>  It is famous for its highly mineralized water, brine and mud, which helps in the treatment of skin diseases.  The village has many children's camps, hospitals and, of course, beautiful sandy beaches, which are its main attraction. </p><p>  The unique resort of Saki is known since ancient times.  The famous <span>Saki lake</span> with healing mud and brine, mineral springs, invigorating steppe air with sea cool created the city the fame of a health resort, which literally lifts people to their feet.  The city is located five kilometers from the coast, so many lovers of sunbathing and swimming in the sea are skeptical of rest in these places, but the infrastructure is well developed there, so it will not be difficult to get to the sea.  Shuttle taxis run every five minutes. </p><p>  Along the coast of the Kalamitsky Gulf there are other villages, villages that are well known to vacationers for the most part due to their sandy beaches and affordable housing in the private sector.  The most famous include Beregovoye, Nikolaevka, Novofedorovka, Corner, Sand. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.8635922" data-lng="32.403212199999984" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/6/2/5/11625.png"></div><p>  Have you decided to spend your vacation in one of the corners of the Gulf of Kalamits?  How to get to it?  First of all, we go by train or fly to Simferopol.  Further by rail or by bus - to Evpatoria or Sak, from there by bus or minibus - to the destination.  In the immediate vicinity of Evpatoria are Zaozernoye, Coastal.  All other towns and villages are located south, so they are closer to the Sakas.  But some settlements can be reached by bus directly from Simferopol.  For example, there is a bus route Simferopol - Beregovoe. </p><p>  Rest in this picturesque corner will allow not only to be distracted from the daily bustle of megalopolises, but also to improve health.  It is especially recommended that people with diseases of the musculoskeletal system, nervous system and skin diseases visit the resort. </p>
