For example, if in a rural school the payment for heating, meals for children in the canteen, and payment for teachers' group work rests entirely with the local authorities and is not sponsored from above, there will most likely be problems.  As a rule, taxes and other fees on the ground are not so high as to provide all the needs and requirements from the local budget.  Therefore, the gas will be extremely economized, and the students along with the teachers will freeze.  Children will have to eat monotonous and scarce, cheaper in the canteen.  Many circles will not be able to function - there will be nothing to pay for the work of teachers.  Pupils will suffer because their interests, needs cannot be realized, and teachers: their load will be incomplete, and their salaries will be cut. </p><p>  The economic basis of local self-government includes the right to independently manage all types of municipal property, form, approve, use the local budget, and establish <span>local taxes.</span>  Without an economic platform, there can be no talk of any local government.  That is why the Constitution enshrines the basic economic rights of local authorities. </p><p>  Thus, the economic basis of local government is: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ all property that is in <span>municipal ownership.</span>  This can be enterprises, banks and other financial organizations, educational institutions, institutions related to health or belonging to the cultural department, municipal sports institutions, etc .; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ‚Ä¢ local budget with all its means; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ property <span>rights of municipalities</span> . </p><p>  <strong>Definitions</strong> </p><p>  Local self-government is understood to mean the activities of citizens and special organizations, legalized by the Constitution, for solving various social, economic and other issues directly on their territory. </p><p>  The role of the foundation of local self-government is played by all economic, social, legal conditions that ensure local government activities and exercise the right of citizens of their country to participate in resolving issues of local importance.  They are divided into social, legal, economic and organizational. </p><p>  The social foundations include all legal norms that determine the activities of local authorities in the <span>social welfare of</span> citizens in municipalities. </p><p>  The economic basis of local self-government is the legislative norms and rules that consolidated and regulated public relations in the field of financial planning and budgeting to solve local economic issues. </p><p>  Under the legal framework refers to the commonality of legal and legal norms that regulate, regulate all issues of local government. </p><p>  The organizational foundations contain <span>legal norms</span> that reinforce and regulate relations in society for the realization of the opportunities and rights of citizens regarding participation in self-government. </p>

    <p>  <strong>The real possibilities of self-government</strong> </p><p>  Municipalities are considered urban and rural settlements, as well as areas, urban districts, intracity territories of cities with federal status.  Citizens can mainly exercise their right to self-government in municipal units small in territory.  In larger entities, the entire economic basis of local self-government is subordinate to the local administration, which assumes all rights and obligations, as well as to those self-government bodies that are allowed by the charter of municipal units.  They are the ones who solve property, financial issues, improvement issues, and many others.  But since all this is done on behalf of citizens, it is necessary to form an active life position among the population, a sense of master and an understanding that local self-government should protect and observe, first of all, their interests, because they are considered by law to be the owners of municipal property. </p>
