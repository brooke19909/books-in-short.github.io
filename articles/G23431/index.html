    <p>  ‚ÄúI'm going to you‚Äù is a warning to the enemy about the beginning of an open confrontation.  In fact, this phrase means readiness for war and embodies faith in a further victory over the enemy. </p><p>  Next, we will examine in detail the origin of the phrase "I‚Äôm coming to you" (who said and in this connection). </p><h2>  Who said? </h2><p>  The famous phrase "I'm going to you" was first said by Svyatoslav Igorevich - the Kiev prince, who ruled Russia from 945 to 972. </p><p>  According to legend, Svyatoslav was the only son of Old Russian <span>Prince Igor</span> and his wife Olga. </p><p>  Igor became famous as a wise ruler and a courageous warrior.  He managed to conquer the lands of the <span>East Slavic tribe of</span> Drevlyans and lay tribute to them.  However, Igor‚Äôs triumph was short-lived.  In 945, Igor and his army went on a campaign against the Drevlyans, wanting to increase the requisitions from the tribe.  However, having come to the lands of Drevlyans, he found his death there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the death of Igor, his son Svyatoslav became the ruler of Russia.  However, at the time of accession to the throne, he was only 3 years old, so the power temporarily passed into the hands of <span>Olga.</span>  <span>Princess Olga</span> was a wise ruler.  She managed to finally subjugate the Drevlyans.  In addition, <span>Princess Olga</span> established friendly relations with Constantinople and adopted Christianity. </p><p>  Svyatoslav, who ascended the throne in 964, continued the policy of his predecessors.  However, unlike his mother, he refused to accept Christianity.  Svyatoslav until the end of his days remained a true pagan. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that the prince paid more attention to foreign affairs, leaving state control in the hands of his mother.  Svyatoslav Igorevich made several trips to Bulgaria.  In addition, the prince opposed Constantinople. </p><p>  The great Kiev prince died in 972.  After his death, a protracted war between the sons of Svyatoslav for the management of the state followed, from which the famous Vladimir the Great came out victorious. </p><p>  So, we examined the origin of the phrase "I'm coming to you" (who said it).  Now let us dwell in more detail on the events with which this expression is associated. </p><h2>  In connection with what the phrase is said? </h2><p>  Svyatoslav from four years participated in military campaigns.  The grand duke spent his whole life in the war.  Going on another campaign to the Khazars, Svyatoslav and uttered the famous phrase.  Initially, it sounded "I want to go to you." </p>

    <p>  This expression served as a brief warning to the enemy about the upcoming war.  Saying to his foe ‚ÄúI am coming to you‚Äù, Svyatoslav counted on a short war.  Before the campaign, a messenger arrived from the lands of the enemy from the Kiev prince, who reported the upcoming attack with a short phrase ‚ÄúI want to go to you‚Äù.  Such a statement terrified the enemy, forcing him to quickly prepare for war. </p>
