Almost every Petersburger with a Schengen visa has been to this city or to Finland itself. </p><p>  The capital is rich in its architecture and atmosphere.  There are many attractions here, they amaze with their external diversity. </p><p>  The city will not leave anyone indifferent.  Every year, millions of tourists come here to enjoy the historical masterpieces of the capital.  At first glance it may seem that you can explore all the main monuments in one trip, but this is a profound mistake.  This place is ideal for tourist excursions.  In addition to the famous museums, there are fairs, various exhibitions and more. </p><p>  In addition, if you are tired of wandering around the city, you can look into many shopping centers of the city.  Believe me, there are plenty of them here. </p><h2>  Kamppi Shopping Center in Helsinki </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fr.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Jean-Pierre Dalb√©ra, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamppi Shopping Center" class="if uuid-2249507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2249507.jpg"></div><p>  This shopping center is perhaps one of the most famous places in the city.  Perhaps due to the fact that it is located on the territory of the bus station.  This place can be said to be a city attraction.  Here you can go to the shops you are interested in, play bowling or enjoy a cup of delicious invigorating coffee.  In addition, in the shopping center there are several grocery stores and a whole food court. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the main advantages of this shopping center in Helsinki is the presence of a subway inside the building. </p><p>  At the beginning of construction, it was clear that this place would become significant for the city.  Construction began fifteen years ago, that is, in 2002, and ended by 2006.  Finnish projects reacted very sensitively to this and for a long time decided how to ennoble the territory.  As a result, the Kamppi area began to include a bus station, from where you can go to other cities in Finland, as well as countries, a huge shopping center, residential areas and a business center. </p><p>  Address: Suomen tasavalta, Helsinki.  The nearest metro station is Kamppi. </p><h2>  Shopping center "Stockmann" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Stockmann Shopping Center" class="if uuid-2249493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2249493.jpg"></div><p>  Stockmann cannot be called just a shopping center; it is a whole retail chain.  Moreover, the company was founded in 1862 by the famous German merchant L√ºbeck Georg Franz Stockman.  In order to open the first store, the organization took several decades. </p><p>  It is here that the largest shopping center in Helsinki is located.  The huge building is the constant decoration and zest of the city.  In this center you can find many trendy shops and designer boutiques. </p><p>  The shopping center includes seven floors.  The first is usually perfumery.  On the second and third floors, you can find men's and women's clothing, and on the fourth those accessories that did not fit on the floors below.  On the fifth, all stores sell products related to household and home.  On the sixth floor, you can buy goods for children and adolescents, and on the seventh there is an opportunity to issue tax-free.  For those who do not know, this is a tax refund for visitors from other countries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is also a basement where Apple products are sold in its official store.  There is also an alcohol market.  Not everyone knows that the sale of alcohol in grocery stores in Finland is prohibited, so you need to buy alcohol only in specialized places. </p><p>  Stockmann also often pampers its customers with promotions and discounts.  They are regular as well as seasonal. </p><p>  One of the <span>best shopping centers in</span> Helsinki is located at Aleksanterinkatu 52. The nearest metro station is Rautatientori. </p><h2>  Jumbo Shopping Center in Helsinki </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kon-tour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jumbo Shopping Center" class="if uuid-2249519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2249519.jpg"></div><p>  You will not find this shopping center in the center of Helsinki.
