If this is a piano and there is enough space in the apartment, then you can buy a bulky and heavy, but traditional acoustic instrument for little money.  In other cases, you should consider buying a compact piano, and <span>the Casio</span> CTK 3200 <span>synthesizer</span> may be a suitable option. </p>

    <h2>  Lightweight and functional </h2><p>  It is worth noting that this model is equipped with a keyboard that is sensitive to pressing force - this is a huge plus, far from every budget synthesizer has something like that.  The contractor can choose from two types of dynamic sensitivity and choose the best one for himself.  The design of the keyboard itself also distinguishes the CTK 3200: it is very similar to a real acoustic piano keyboard, which not only contributes to a comfortable game, but also gives the overall appearance of the synthesizer a solid, professional look. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  Casio CTK 3200 offers the user 400 tones.  This list has both classic and synthetic sound options.  Polyphony is represented by 48 notes - not too much, but for basic performing tasks this is quite enough.  The synthesizer is equipped with an auto accompaniment function, in which there are 150 styles, which opens up opportunities for improvisations and acquaintance with various musical genres. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Digital effects are not a strong point of the Casio CTK 3200. User reviews are unanimous in this regard: reverb alone is not enough, and this greatly limits both the artist and the ability to use the instrument. </p>

    <h2>  Training and Recording </h2><p>  The synthesizer has a step-by-step learning function, which is based on the principle of constructing a regular lesson with a live teacher.  This system also includes elements aimed at musical development, so it will be very useful for beginner performers.  The presence of a built-in USB-out allows you to connect the instrument to a computer and use it as a full-fledged MIDI keyboard. </p><p>  Everything else comes with a sampling function.  Thanks to it, the user gets the opportunity to record small segments from external sources, then to use them when playing certain tunes.  For example, it can be vocal lines or violin solo.  This is a great advantage, since most devices from the same price range do not have the same “capabilities” as the Casio CTK 3200 synthesizer. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The acoustic piano keyboard is represented by 88 keys, and in the CTK 3200 it is shortened - only 61 keys, but let's not forget about two types of sensitivity to touch.  Although the maximum polyphony is 48 voices, for some tones this number is halved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reverb from 1 to 10, can be turned off completely.  Voice Pad makes it easy to play samples in the memory.  There are three presets for melodic samples, and one for drums.  The synthesizer can also take on the function of a metronome (beats per measure from 2 to 6, tempo - from 30 to 255). </p><p>  A separate word also requires step-by-step training.  In addition to the possibility of repetition, voice guidance on fingering, notebooks and performance evaluation, the virtual teacher can separately parse the parts for the left or right hand, and only then proceed to join the two parties.  There are four stages of training, the first and second - “Listen” and “Watch”, and the third and fourth - “Remember” and “Auto”. </p><p>  Auto Accompaniment includes 150 rhythmic patterns.  There are other useful features, such as transposing up to 12 half tones to one or the other side, as well as fine tuning from 415.5 to 465.9 hertz, which is useful when playing with wind instruments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="synthesizer casio ctk 3200 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1775082.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Inputs and outputs </h2><p>  Casio CTK 3200, as mentioned above, is equipped with a USB output for connecting to a computer.  In addition, there is a connector for the sustain pedal, sostenuto, software or rhythm - this is the standard "jack".  The headphone output is presented in the form of a standard stereo jack, so you won’t be able to connect household headphones from your phone or computer.  However, the adapter will help to solve the problem, which can be purchased at any musical instrument or radio equipment store for little money. </p><p>  There is an audio input stereo - mini-jack.  Power Casio CTK 3200 is possible both from the network and from six carbon-zinc batteries AA or alkaline batteries.  When using the latter, the synthesizer runs for about three hours.  To save energy during battery operation, the tool turns off six minutes after the last keystroke, and when operating from the mains, after half an hour. </p><p>  The device is equipped with two ten-centimeter speakers with a power of 2 watts.  It weighs about 3.5 kg, so if a performer constantly moves or plays outside, then the Casio CTK 3200 synthesizer is the best choice for this price category. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The model was released a long time ago, so the owners managed to evaluate it and point out the advantages and disadvantages.  The former usually refers to the simplicity of the interface: the control panel is intuitive, it is convenient that the functional buttons are divided into sections, and all the necessary information is displayed. </p><p>  The owners also note the ease of the synthesizer: it is compact, easily fits in the back seat of the car.  The average weight of laptops is just over two kilograms, and this synthesizer weighs just a kilogram more, so you can take it anywhere. </p><p>  Many note the importance of the touch sensitivity function of the keys - this is a great advantage of a budget tool, as well as the full size of the keys. </p><p>  The disadvantages include the included music stand, which does not hold notes, the lack of digital effects (except for reverb) and built-in speakers.  <span>The speaker system</span> gives a total power of only four watts, and if this is enough for homework and apartment building, the synthesizer will not be able to cover a more spacious room.  This problem can only be solved by connecting additional external speakers. </p>

    <h2>  Design and equipment </h2><p>  The synthesizer body is made of high-quality matte plastic without color variations - only black is possible.  Fingerprints remain on the plastic, but they can be easily removed with a slightly damp cloth or alcohol wipe. </p><p>  Together with the synthesizer, the buyer receives a power supply and music stand.  A convenient carrying case, stand and various pedals need to be bought separately.  However, the pedal has a standard input, so it is possible to use an analog from another synthesizer, the main thing is that the polarity coincides.  This is easy to verify: if you press the sustain pedal, the sound breaks off and continues after being released, then the polarity does not match. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Casio CTK 3200 is a great compact tool.  The price for it starts from ten thousand rubles, that is, the synthesizer slightly goes beyond the budget, but the amount is quite good for a device with this set of functions.  Almost no model in this price range can give the user the same capabilities as the CTK 3200. It will be a useful purchase for those who do not want to interfere with their neighbors day or night, because you can always plug in headphones and play at full volume, but only for yourself.  Easy to carry, it will suit both a concert musician and people who are constantly changing their place of residence.  The tool is compact, does not take up much space even with a stand, so it does not hurt even in a small apartment. </p>
