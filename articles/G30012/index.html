Long socks are not suitable for low shoes: short but comfortable and warm foot socks that will not add volume will come in handy, and the shoes will be fastened without problems.  Such sneaker-socks are suitable as home slippers.  How to tie tracks on 2 knitting needles if a novice craftswoman mastered the front and back loops? </p><h2>  Choose yarn </h2><p>  Wool blend is best: it is pleasant to the skin and will not wear out quickly.  If the craftswoman is going to use the footsteps as shoes for home, she should prefer durable and maximally natural yarn, for example, 80 percent - wool and 20 percent acrylic.  Such threads are quite wear-resistant, which ensures a long life of the product.  Just do not need to buy spiky yarn, because it can "bite", even if the legs are cotton socks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.womansweekly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thread and knitting needles" class="if uuid-3201972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3201972.jpg"></div><p>  If the threads are selected in order to wear them with boots or boots, half-woolen yarn (50% and 50% or 70 to 30%) will be enough.  You can also choose the one in which the cotton threads are added - so the legs will breathe all day.  To correctly determine the required number of loops and the density of knitting, you should, as usual, tie an approximate sample, and then during work focus on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to determine the desired number of stitches? </h2><p>  Before you figure out how to knit traces on 2 knitting needles, you need to knit a small square, 10x10 in size, with that yarn from which the craftswoman will subsequently make the healers.  And the picture must be chosen one that will then be on the underside.  After the test sample is connected, pull it out a little (yarn elongation coefficient), measure how many loops you get in one centimeter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted tracks" class="if uuid-3201704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3201704.jpg"></div><p>  Now you need to multiply the resulting number by the circumference of the leg (measure at the base of the ankle, in the place where the healers will begin).  So many loops and you will need to dial for work.  Important information!  To determine the desired number of needles, you need to compare the needles themselves and the thickness of the yarn.  If denser knitting is needed, use tools that are slightly thinner than yarn. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  To understand how to tie the tracks on 2 knitting needles, for beginner needlewomen this is given a hint.  To work, you need 50-80 grams of yarn, a pair of classic knitting needles or circular knitting needles that do not have a very long fishing line, and a stitching needle (with a large eye). </p><p>  At the very beginning of the work you need to dial 56 stitches.  This number will correspond to a product with sizes from 38 to 41, if you choose thin yarn and knit tightly.  When you set the loops, you should take a thread with a larger margin - about 50 centimeters: this piece is useful when stitching the details of the eyelet.  If the edge is processed in a classical way, then the edge loop, that is, the first in a row, should always be transferred to the working spoke.  She does not get knitted.  But the last need to knit the wrong side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  First 24 rows </h2><p>  The algorithm of actions is as follows: </p><ul><li>  First row.  It is necessary to tie out an elastic band: in turn two front and two wrong.  It is quite elastic and when worn it will stretch well. </li><li>  The second and third rows knit the same gum. </li><li>  Fourth row.  Knit 26 stitches according to the drawing (which the needlewoman will choose) and double crochet, then two purl stitches, double crochet and knit the front to the end of the row. </li><li>  Fifth row.  26 facial stitches.  In those places where they made yarn, knit with a facial loop;  where knitted two facial - to connect two wrong.  Then again to the end of the row face - 27 pieces.  The main pattern is shawl knitting. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.womansweekly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting tools" class="if uuid-3201974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3201974.jpg"></div><p>  To understand how to tie the tracks on 2 needles, you need to carefully understand the presented step-by-step instructions.  And the difficulties of the craftswomen should not arise.  In even rows during knitting, you need to make crochets, and in odd rows (that is, purl), they will be crocheted with purl.  So you should knit 24 rows (for the sizes that were mentioned above).  It so happens that from the center on each side during operation, twelve loops will be added. </p><h2>  Heel </h2><p>  Row twenty fifth.  Now you need to do not add, and knit a rounded heel.  In the described embodiment, this should be done in this way: </p><ul><li>  Carefully round the resulting part. </li><li>  Remove the hem and knit the next two loops together.  Then a series of facial loops. </li><li>  Reduction should be done exclusively in the front rows, and purl should be knitted according to the pattern with a garter stitch. </li><li>  To make the heel rounded harmoniously and smoothly, you need to knit six rows. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Footprints" class="if uuid-3201708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3201708.jpg"></div><p>  But in the seventh, a sharper ending is permissible, because of which the product sits perfectly on the leg, and looks outwardly quite harmonious: </p><ul><li>  Knit the first three stitches (including the hem), return the resulting stitch to the left knitting needle and close the remaining stitches in the usual classical way, knitting them in two. </li><li>  Knit the last three loops by analogy with the first together (also considering the edge). </li></ul><h2>  Putting It Together </h2><p>  So, how to tie the tracks on 2 needles has already become clear.  But one more thing remains: to connect all the details.  Now a needle with a large eye and a thread that was left at the beginning of work will come in handy.  Fold the footprint from the center.  Due to the fact that the number of loops and rows is the same, everything should turn out as symmetrically as possible.  Sew on the upper braid, pass the needle under it, bending around through the top. </p><p>  Important information!  This seam is flat, so there will be no discomfort while wearing the product.  Although it runs through the center of the sole.  Visually, the appearance of the under-eye will remain neat, because the seam is almost invisible. </p><p>  When the craftswoman reaches the end of knitting, you need to hide the tail of the thread inside, using a hook.  It is better that the threads are placed in the lateral parts of the subsea.  So additional seals will not interfere with walking.  After such a detailed description, the question no longer arises of how to knit a simple track with 2 knitting needles.  You just need to follow each point and the result of the work will be very quickly visible. </p><p>  When the seam begins to round in the calcaneal part, it is necessary to stretch it a little and straighten it, make it ‚Äúbutt‚Äù and not ‚Äúagainst each other‚Äù.  Only then can I flash.  In the same way, knit the second footprint.  Experienced knitters are advised to knit paired products at the same time.  Thus, no reduction will be made with decreases and additions.  On the contrary, finished products will be absolutely symmetrical. </p><h2>  For kids without a seam </h2><p>  To connect the tracks on 2 needles without a seam for children, see the following description.  To do this, it will be necessary to prepare 50 grams of yarn (the thread is folded twice), knitting needles and hook No. 3. Twenty eight loops are gathered.  It is necessary to knit nineteen rows of the front surface. </p><p>  In the center, from eight loops, make a heel.  On the sides of this part, eleven loops should be typed.  Raise nine rows, and then make seven air loops in the last row.  Now these air loops should be connected to the opposite part.  Lift the hinges using the front surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingparadise.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Funny knitted footprints" class="if uuid-3201991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3201991.jpg"></div><p>  If the skilled worker is experienced enough, it will not be difficult for her to make some kind of pattern.  When the track is tied to the little finger, you can begin to reduce.  At the beginning of the row, knit two loops together.  When only two loops remain, stretch the yarn and pull it off.  The edges of the product can be circumvented gently crochet.  This is how you can tie footprints on 2 needles to a child.  He will not only be warm, but also comfortable. </p><h2>  In conclusion... </h2><p>  When the product is completely ready, it must be rinsed in cool water, adding a little fabric softener.  Thus, natural fibers will become soft, and a pleasant aroma will appear.  The footprints are dried naturally.  You can lightly steam it so that the loops take the desired shape, and the pattern becomes neat and clear.  All is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Neat knitting" class="if uuid-3201979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3201979.jpg"></div><p>  In such wonderful trails, you can walk for a long time even in severe frost, without fear of overcooling.  They are suitable for a gift to girlfriends.  When the novice craftswoman figured out how to connect the tracks on 2 knitting needles, and she mastered the simplest way to work, you can choose more complex drawings and patterns. </p>
