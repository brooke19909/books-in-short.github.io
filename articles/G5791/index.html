    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The Primasol Serra Garden 4 * hotel is not without its drawbacks and shortcomings.  The reviews allow us to draw conclusions about the following negative moments of relaxation in this institution: </p><ol><li>  On the way to the beach there is a roadway, which is characterized by rather busy traffic. </li><li>  For the use of beach towels, a security deposit of $ 10 is required.  And in order to replace them with clean ones, you need to pay 1 dollar. </li><li>  Shampoos are not included in the cosmetic kit in the bathroom. </li><li>  Very fatty and spicy food in the restaurant. </li><li>  Wi-Fi only works near the reception, and very slowly. </li><li>  The bathroom is very cramped. </li><li>  There are no ramps on the territory and in the buildings, which makes it difficult to rest with young children.  Wheelchair users are also uncomfortable. </li><li>  Given that the main contingent of the hotel is German pensioners, the animation is very sluggish. </li><li>  Beach workers help to spread mattresses and lay out sun loungers only for those tourists who give tips. </li><li>  Family rooms have air conditioning in only one room, while the second is incredibly stuffy. </li><li>  Mashed potatoes in the restaurant are made from powder, not real vegetables. </li><li>  The Germans constantly smoke in restaurants and bars, and the staff does not make any comments about it.  This is understandable, because these tourists are very generous with tips. </li><li>  Many guests on the first day are accommodated in "temporary" rooms without windows and balconies, citing the lack of places (they only relocate the next day). </li><li>  During dinner, waiters begin to clean the tables half an hour before closing.  Accordingly, you can no longer sit behind them. </li><li>  On the balcony there is no clothes dryer and towels (although it is stated). </li><li>  Leaving the room and removing the key card from the slot, you automatically turn off all electrical appliances (including the refrigerator). </li><li>  Poor soundproofing in the rooms. </li></ol><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  This is a cozy hotel with a small green area and compact rooms.  The contingent of vacationers is 80% Germans, and therefore they are given the most close attention.  If a German citizen wants to smoke in a restaurant or at the playground, then no one will make any comments on this subject.  If you do not pay attention to such trifles, but are going to relax and get a vivid experience, then this hotel is ideal for you.  It will provide good nutrition, quality service, as well as direct access to the tourist infrastructure, due to its convenient location.  And of course, do not forget that smile and courtesy help to overcome cultural and linguistic barriers. </p>
