Purchase and disposal of TVs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An obligatory attribute of spending leisure time for many people in our country is television.  But unfortunately, this type of technology often breaks down.  In addition, more and more advanced models appear annually, which are even more practical and of high quality.  Sometimes they decide to change this type of equipment because of a breakdown or because a new device has appeared on the market.  And what about the old TV?  What to do with it so as not to harm the environment?  In fact, there are plenty of places to put on an old TV, which, in addition to eliminating unnecessary trash, will also bring a small monetary reward. </p><h2>  Do not dispose of electrical appliances and household appliances in a landfill!  It is prohibited by law. </h2><p>  The main rule is that it is strictly forbidden to throw old equipment into the trash bin.  It is very harmful to the environment.  The fact is that the details of the TV contain various heavy metals, and plastic emits toxic substances when burned.  Simply put, such garbage will lie in a landfill for a long time and not decompose under the influence of external factors.  Old TV is not subject to dumping in a general landfill and under the law.  Since it has a third class of environmental hazard. </p>

    <p>  Among other things, throwing the old TV in a landfill, you can get a considerable fine for breaking the law.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to get used to take care of the ecological state of the world and the area in which we live.  Therefore, do not consider any garbage containers, landfills or simply landfills for household waste as a place for the disposal of equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reception of old TVs </h2><p>  Where to put the TV, which has become unusable?  The first option is a special bureau.  You can just pass the equipment into it.  In such bureaus, old TVs are received for recycling.

Skilled specialists can take out many details from the devices and use them in their work. </p><h2>  other methods </h2><p>  What to do with the old TV?

    <p>  Another option is to contact the owners of the slot machines.  They will happily adopt a similar technique.  It only needs to be equipped with a sufficiently large screen.  Also, owners of small cafes will accept an outdated TV to place it in the hall.  But remember that this must be a flat screen model. </p><h2>  Disposal of devices and equipment </h2><p>  Disposal of TVs takes place in several stages.  First you bring the master your technique.  Then the specialist removes all the valuable details.  Then the remaining elements are disassembled into parts.  Then they are sent for processing.  All glass parts, as well as metal, are crushed.  After which they will be further used in the processing industry.  All plastic components, including the housing from under the TV, go for remelting.  That's exactly how TVs are disposed of. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Where to hand over the device with a kinescope in the case?  Such TVs are extremely rare in recent years.  But they are still in demand.  They are also taken for recycling by a recycling company.  And sometimes such a TV brings more profit than usual.  That's because there are more parts in such household appliances that are made of precious metals.  Silver and gold from the parts goes to the manufacture of new parts for computers, televisions and other household appliances.  Products made of ferrous metal are simply remelted.  Liquid crystal screens handed over for recycling are used for the manufacture of gadgets and new modern technology. </p><p>  Buying up TVs is a fairly common type of business.  Therefore, even in a small town, you can find a place where to send the old device. </p>
