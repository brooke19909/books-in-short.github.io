  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to pay "Plato": a description of the methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  “Another scam”, “rent to Rotenberg”, “new MMM” - as soon as the people called the government’s decree on the introduction of toll roads.  The system received the official name "Plato."  Even before the entry into force of this normative act, active discussions began on the legality of this step.  There were also strikes of drivers of heavy vehicles, and even an appeal to the Constitutional Court of Russia by deputies from the Communist Party.  The next attempt to cancel this decision led to nothing.  The Constitutional Court recognized the fairness and legitimacy of such a measure. </p><p>  All opponents of this reform had to come to terms with its introduction, but immediately a whole series of questions arose.  One of the main ones was a misunderstanding of how to pay Plato.  And you still have to do this, because paying a fine for violations is very expensive.  If the violation is committed for the first time, then the amount of the fine is five thousand rubles, for a second - already ten thousand.  Carriers who constantly carry out their trips on the roads falling under this regulation are more profitable to act within the framework of the law. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.euractiv.com" data-author=": www.euractiv.com, "><img itemprop="image" alt="The movement of heavy trucks on the federal highway" class="if uuid-3196337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196337.jpg"></div><h2>  How to pay "Plato"? </h2><p>  RTITS LLC became the operator who will service this system by order of the Government, which in turn offers the following payment methods: issuing a route card or installing on-board equipment.  You can also choose how to pay "Plato" - before or after the trip.  A route map is issued each time for a separate trip in your account on the official website. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For some, the option of installing on-board equipment is more convenient, since there is no need to constantly draw up a route map.  An agreement on the free use of the device is concluded.  Installation is carried out by the driver himself, using the navigation system automatically determines the location of the car, calculates the amount payable and debits from the account.  The driver is only required to ensure that there is always money in the account. </p><p>  You can replenish your current account by: </p><ul><li>  bank transfer; </li><li>  in user information support centers; </li><li>  bank or fuel card; </li><li>  through online services; </li><li>  in an affiliate network; </li><li>  through the payment terminal. </li></ul><p>  Let's consider each method separately. </p><h2>  Bank Transfer </h2><p>  This method of payment is most often used by people far from the Internet, which is not surprising, because a driver who has worked for more than 15–20 years behind the wheel had no time to master modern technologies.  It’s easier to come to the bank, where qualified specialists will do everything themselves.  Where can I pay? Plato, in which particular bank, everyone chooses for himself.  In any institution, you still have to pay a transfer fee. </p><p>  Most importantly, you need to know the correct details of the recipient of funds.  You can get acquainted with them by printing a receipt from your personal account, or on the official website.  It should be noted that for residents and non-residents the data are different.  The term for the transfer of funds can reach up to 3 business days, so you should not postpone payment of the route card until the last moment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  User Information Support Centers </h2><p>  A hotline is open around the clock for all issues that arise with users of the system.  There you can get information about the location of information support centers, their work schedule and other contacts.  It remains only to come to the nearest center and consult a specialist. </p><h2>  Bank or fuel card </h2><p>  We accept several types of bank cards: </p><ol><li>  "WORLD". </li><li>  Master Card. </li><li>  Visa </li><li>  Union Pay. </li><li>  JCB. </li></ol><p>  As well as fuel cards: </p><ol><li>  E 100. </li><li>  DKV and other cards for international transport companies. </li></ol><h2>  Affiliate networks </h2><p>  Replenishment of a settlement record is also possible through intermediaries.  These include Euroset, the Kiwi service, Sberbank of Russia, Moscow Credit Bank, Eleksnet, and Energotransbank.  How to pay "Plato" through a self-service terminal, it is easy to understand on the example of "Qiwi", because the network of these terminals is quite widespread and is very convenient and easy to use. </p><p>  First you need to deposit money into an electronic wallet.  If not, then create.  To do this, you have to go through a few simple steps: </p><ul><li>  Go to the QIWI website. </li><li>  Click the "Register" button. </li><li>  A registration window will open where you will need to enter a mobile phone number. </li><li>  Create a password and tick off the agreement with the offer. </li><li>  Enter the one-time code that will come in the SMS message in the field. </li><li>  Click the “Confirm” button. </li></ul><p>  The electronic wallet is ready.  It is very convenient that his number corresponds to the number of a mobile phone, and there is no need to remember unnecessary information. </p><p>  To replenish it, again you will have to perform a series of actions: </p><ul><li>  select “Payment for services” on the terminal, then “E-commerce” and “Qiwi-Wallet”; </li><li>  enter a mobile phone number without 8; </li><li>  go to the next tab by clicking “Forward”; </li><li>  a field opens for entering the name of the contributor;  this is necessary in order to determine whose payment; </li><li>  press “Forward” again, check the number and enter the required amount. </li><li>  check that the amount deposited is correctly reflected on the screen, add notes if necessary (the amount of more than 500 rubles is not subject to commission); </li><li>  Click "Pay." </li></ul><p>  This completes the replenishment of the Qiwi wallet.  It is better to take a check in case the payment is lost in the system for some reason.  The electronic wallet is replenished, it remains only to decide how to pay "Plato" with it. </p><h2>  Payment "Plato" through the terminal </h2><p>  To do this, enter your electronic wallet, enter the phone number and password.  The main page will open.  Find "Plato" through the search menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Payment &quot;Plato&quot; through Qiwi wallet. Step 1" class="if uuid-3196010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196010.jpg"></div><p>  Choose the type of service you are interested in.  There are three options: </p><ul><li>  draw up and pay a route map; </li><li>  pay for a route card; </li><li>  replenish the settlement drink. </li></ul><p>  As an example, payment of a route card is considered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Payment &quot;Plato&quot; through Qiwi wallet. Step 2" class="if uuid-3196012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196012.jpg"></div><p>  If the route map has already been created, then select the item “Payment MK”, enter the number of the route map and check it.  In the payment method menu, you can choose other options, in addition to the wallet account, but then it is worth considering that the commission will be higher.  The most profitable payment methods are using a wallet or terminal.  Using the card you will have to pay an additional 1%, and using the balance on the phone - from 1% and above.  It all depends on the tariff conditions of the selected operator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Payment &quot;Plato&quot; through Qiwi wallet. Step 3" class="if uuid-3196013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196013.jpg"></div><p>  The commission for this operation will be 0.94% of the amount. </p><p>  Select the wallet account in the payment method menu, enter the required amount and click "Pay". </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Payment &quot;Plato&quot; through Qiwi wallet. Step 4" class="if uuid-3196014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3196014.jpg"></div><h2>  Is there a discount on payment for violations of Plato? </h2><p>  If for some reason you had to deviate from Art.  12.21.3 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation, which describes the procedure for observing the rules of the resolution, you will have to decide how to pay the fine for Platon.  In these cases, use standard deposit methods.  Administrative liability can be halved by using the discount law.  Can I pay a penalty for Plato at a discount?  Yes you can!  A pleasant bonus will be the fact that the 50% discount on the violation of this article applies.  But it is worth considering that this will happen only if the penalty is paid no later than 20 days from the date of the decision. </p><p>  For all questions, you can also contact the contact center by phone hotline. </p>
