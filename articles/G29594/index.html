Now this bar has been reduced, and credit funds can be obtained as early as 18 years old.  At the moment, various banks offer a youth loan, which is characterized by a not too high amount, but it is enough to buy a new phone or a stylish blouse.  Typically, banks offer this kind of program, as a loan on credit cards.  Almost all credit cards have one important property in common - they have a grace period in which previously withdrawn funds can be put on the card without overpayment for interest.  Also, almost all cards have very low annual rates.

    <p>  <strong>Youth credit cards</strong> </p><p>  Sberbank of Russia was the first financial institution to undertake to ensure the monetary future of our youth.  It was he who first understood the benefits of this enterprise, in addition, he had all the conditions for providing such loans.  Who can get credit cards?  Sberbank of Russia will be happy to provide its services to any citizen of the Russian Federation.  But each program has its pros and cons.  All the necessary information regarding an institution such as Sberbank of Russia (credit cards, conditions, etc.) can be found on all kinds of information resources.  Or you can go to the nearest branch, where bank employees will answer all your questions.  But, in principle, the conditions for obtaining a loan are the same in many institutions.  Nevertheless, we pay attention to some nuances. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  To obtain such a loan, the age of the borrower must be from 18 to 30 years.  In addition, a prerequisite is the provision of income statements confirming the solvency of the client.  For this, young people do not have to have an official place of work, you just need to go to the dean’s office and take a certificate of scholarship accrual for the required period.  This will be a guarantee of the return of credit to the bank. </p><p>  The card is valid for three years, after which you can either throw it away or order a new one.  In case of timely repayment of debts, the bank may raise the credit limit or reward the borrower in some other way.  A similar promotion may be a gold credit card of Sberbank of Russia with a high limit and low interest, it is issued after the expiration of the usual credit card.  The card limit does not exceed 200,000 rubles, but for starters, as a rule, they provide a loan of 3,000 rubles.  It all depends on the size of the scholarship - for students - and on the level of income - for a person over 24 years old.  The annual interest rate is 24% plus 750 rubles for card servicing per year.  But there is a positive point - the grace period of repayment (50 days). </p>

    <p>  This type of program is especially good when you have to pay in boutiques and supermarkets, because there are no fees for this calculation.  While the withdrawal of bank credit through ATMs is usually accompanied by a commission of 3%.  Youth credit is very helpful to the ever poor students, and the bank in any case receives its interest, even if it is low.  Therefore, after Sberbank, many commercial banking institutions also launched credit card lines designed exclusively for young people.  Thanks to today's diversity, young people no longer have to do with Sberbank alone.  They can choose the best option and order a card at the financial institution they like. </p>
