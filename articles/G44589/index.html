Its history dates back to the 7th century BC.  Ancient temples are located here, the largest of them being funerary ones.  They were built in the form of complexes - the Northern Acropolis, Mundo-Perdido. </p><p>  Here and today, excavations continue, because Tikal was a huge city with more than 100 buildings.  Pyramids have been preserved on the territory of the settlement, on the appointment of which modern scientists put forward a variety of versions.  Almost the entire territory of the unique archaeological park today is available for visiting. </p><h2>  Atitlan Lake </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the capital is an amazing natural attraction of Guatemala.

The city of Antigua Guatemala (Antigua Guatemala), often referred to simply as Antigua, was founded in 1541 and by the middle of the XVIII century reached such a peak that it could be compared with Mexico City and Lima.  It was during this period that for some time he was the capital of the country.  However, the strongest earthquake in 1773 almost wiped the city from the face of the earth, and the capital was moved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lacapital.com.ar" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Antigua Guatemala" class="if uuid-2870225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2870225.jpg"></div><h2>  San Jose Cathedral </h2><p>  The majestic Catholic Church of the city was founded in the middle of the XVI century, but due to two powerful earthquakes today we can only see a part of the original building from the second stage of construction: the very first church was completely destroyed. </p><p>  The current cathedral is rebuilt and moved to the capital.  Cult utensils were also transported there.  However, in the place of the ruins, it was possible to preserve the restored temple, which now bears the name of St. Joseph. </p><h2>  Museum of Colonial Art </h2><p>  At different times, this architectural and historical landmark of Guatemala was a university, school, church, exhibition hall.  The building is located next to Central Park and is a beautiful ensemble consisting of columns, arches, ornamental plants and fountains.  The museum began its work in 1936.  There are few exhibits in his exposition - just over a hundred.  However, visitors find it quite interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.casasantodomingo.com.gt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Colonial Art" class="if uuid-2870236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2870236.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of El Viejo </h2><p>  An amazing landmark of Guatemala.  Everyone who purchased tours to this country and leafed through leaflets is familiar with the description.  This may sound rather unusual, but this church today is a ruin of stunning beauty.  It was erected in the middle of the XVIII century and has a huge number of decorative elements.  Several large-scale restorations were carried out here, however, constant earthquakes continue to destroy the country's past. </p><p>  Today at the temple you can often find wedding processions.  Newlyweds get stunning photos on their first family album. </p><h2>  Mishko Viejo City </h2><p>  This is also the former Mayan settlement, which was built in the XII century BC.  e.  The description of the history of this Guatemalan landmark has several versions, but they all boil down to the fact that this city had important geopolitical significance until the middle of the 16th century, before it was destroyed by the conquistadors. </p><p>  Today it is a popular tourist attraction in whose territory the museum is located. </p><h2>  Santa clara </h2><p>  The large monastery complex is located on Second North Avenue.  It was founded in 1699 with funds donated to Jos√© Hurtado de Arria.  At first, a small church and several houses around appeared in this place, in which five nuns lived.  The official opening of the monastery is January 1700. </p><p>  Since 1703, the active construction of the complex began, which was completed two years later.  In various sources, the complex is described as a building with a tiled roof.  It was partially destroyed after the earthquake in 1717. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery of Santa Clara" class="if uuid-2870242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2870242.jpg"></div><p>  The reconstruction of the monastery, which was funded mainly by private individuals, lasted almost 26 years.  Almost no building from the original construction has been preserved.  Numerous changes were made during the reconstruction.  The monastery and church were reopened and consecrated on August 11, 1734. </p><h2>  Flores </h2><p>  The amazing island town, which is located on the shores of Lake Peten Itza, leaves travelers a vivid and unforgettable experience.  The mirror surface of the lake, many rare plants, the complete absence of cars, the peaceful atmosphere of the city of Flores is delightful. </p><p>  Amazingly, even the birds here meekly pose for a photo.  The central part of the city has a somewhat unusual architecture.  In general, the town leaves a very pleasant impression of a beautiful and well-groomed resort, where you can relax. </p><h2>  Atitlan Volcano </h2><p>  A stratovolcano (a layered high volcano) that has not erupted for almost two centuries.  Climbing to the top of this natural landmark of Guatemala, you will be amazed at the stunning views of Lake Atitlan and the nesting of incredibly beautiful birds that settle on the slopes of the giant. </p><h2>  Lagoon del tigre </h2><p>  Such a complex name is the National Park, which consists of a conservation area in which wild plants grow in quiet backwaters.  In this place, a huge number of birds and animals were found shelter, which are listed in the Red Book. </p><p>  It is not recommended to stroll through these wonderful places on your own.  An excursion accompanied by a guide will be remembered for a long time.  You can visit a special biological station where you can relax on the picturesque banks of the San Pedro River. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whitleyaward.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Laguna Del Tigre National Park" class="if uuid-2870255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2870255.jpg"></div><h2>  Gumarkah </h2><p>  The ancient city, which was destined to exist for about a century and a half.  Like many other settlements on this earth, it was burned by conquistadors.  For many years, numerous archaeological expeditions conducted excavations, cleared the ruins, and restored buildings. </p><p>  Today, tourists can see the remains of temples and palaces here.  This attraction of Guatemala leaves two impressions - on the territory, more precisely, in the temple of Tojil, religious sacrifices of people were carried out, as well as worship of mysterious deities. </p><p>  The surviving platforms, embankments, caves, squares - these are all the remains of the formerly residential premises, noble temples, altars and towers.  The modern descendants of the Mayans (Keche) still burn candles in the ruins of Gumarkahe. </p><h2>  Semuk Champey </h2><p>  A place that fascinates travelers with its unearthly beauty.  The waterfalls that hide in the jungle are made up of numerous light cascades.  The most difficult, but at the same time the most beautiful route to this place is called El Mirador.  There are two more easier routes that are no less beautiful. </p><h2>  Santander Street </h2><p>  Most of the tourists visiting Guatemala plan to bring national clothes and souvenirs from the trip.  They should be sent to the city of Panajachel.  There are restaurants and cafes, travel agencies, markets where products of Indian artisans are presented. </p><h2>  Monterrico Beach </h2><p>  Tourists have ‚Äúmastered‚Äù this beach relatively recently.  He is famous for a huge number of turtles.  Watching them is very interesting.  Especially lucky for those who visit the beach during the period when the cubs appear: hundreds of kids overcome all obstacles in their path, rushing to the water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monterrico Beach" class="if uuid-2870266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2870266.jpg"></div><h2>  Jewelry factory </h2><p>  At this enterprise in the capital, you can take a tour of the museum, which collects a huge amount of stones - jadeite and jade, walk through the factory, observe the process of processing them.  Entrance to the museum is free, and at the factory you can purchase your favorite product. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Travelers note that a visit to this country made a lasting impression.  Guatemala is rich in extraordinary natural, architectural and historical monuments.  The only regret is the fact that due to the high seismicity, the most ancient and unique sights continue to collapse.  It is almost impossible to stop this process, although historians of many countries help the republic to preserve its national heritage - the ancient Mayan culture. </p>
