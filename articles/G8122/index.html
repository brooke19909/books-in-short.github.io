  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pituitary gland and pituitary hormones. Their effect on the human body.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The pituitary gland is an endocrine gland located at the brain base.  Its size is small, about the size of a pea.  The pituitary gland is divided into three lobes: posterior, intermediate and anterior.  Each of the lobes is an independent gland and produces its own hormones. </p><p>  Hormones of the anterior pituitary are protein.  Six hormones of this fraction are presented in pure form relative to the chemical composition.  Today, the composition and structure of the anterior lobe hormones are thoroughly studied.  Although the exact amount of hormones that she secretes is still unknown. </p><p>  Hormones of the pituitary gland, or rather its anterior lobe, are important for many processes in the body.  The most important of these is <span>growth hormone.</span>  It is more than other hormones responsible for the full growth of the body.  If you remove the pituitary gland, then the person‚Äôs growth will stop.  According to experiments, it was found that the additional administration of growth hormone to young animals leads to an acceleration of their growth.  In humans, the intake of this hormone leads to the resumption of growth of the body.  Growth hormone helps to reduce the excretion of nitrogen from the body as a result of metabolism.  This leads to a more rapid formation of new tissues. </p><p>  The pituitary hormones and their functions are well understood by humanity.  Violation of their secretion leads to disruptions in the body.  The lack of growth hormone leads to the cessation of growth, and its excess causes gigantism.  The uneven production of the hormone is a consequence of the disproportionate development of the limbs.  Pituitary hormones also affect the condition of the urogenital system in women. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The thyroid-stimulating hormone</span> that the pituitary gland produces is a stimulant for the normal activity of the thyroid gland.  When removing the pituitary gland, iron does not perform its functions. </p><p>  Adrenocorticotropic hormone is necessary for the normal functioning of the adrenal glands.  But in the absence of the pituitary gland, they also continue to perform their functions.  But the amount of produced hormone that regulates the balance of sodium and potassium in the human body decreases. </p><p>  <span>Gonadotropic hormones</span> are involved in two processes.  The first process is participation in the process of egg production in the <span>female body</span> and sperm in the male body.  The second is in the development of the female and male hormones themselves.  Too much of these hormones leads to puberty, outpacing the growth of the body.  Removal of the pituitary gland stops reproductive function and significantly reduces sexual desire. </p><p>  Pituitary hormones are actively involved in the distribution of carbohydrates consumed with food in the body.  They play an important role in the metabolism.  Here, adrenocorticotropic hormone and growth hormone are of great importance.  They affect the activity of the pancreas and the production of insulin.  Insulin deficiency leads to a serious illness known as diabetes. </p><p>  The intermediate and posterior lobes of the pituitary gland also produce hormones that are involved in the life of the body.  <span>The hormone oxytocin</span> plays an important role for the contraction of the uterus during childbirth, for the walls of the intestine, bladder and gall bladder.  <span>The hormone vasopressin</span> is responsible for normalizing the fluid that is released through the kidneys.  Discontinuation of the posterior lobe leads to so-called diabetes insipidus.  In this case, the body loses a large amount of fluid (up to 38 liters), which must be constantly replenished in the same amount. </p><p>  Pituitary hormones play a huge role in the life of the human body.  They participate in many processes occurring in the body, and affect the work of many organs.  Removal of the pituitary gland leads to irreversible consequences and a malfunction in the life of the whole organism. </p>
