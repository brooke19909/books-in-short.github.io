This woman, who was an ideological Bolshevik and held the post of Secretary of the Central Committee (who was headed by Stalin after her), managed to survive to 93 years and avoid reprisals during the legendary political sweeps. </p><p>  There is an assumption that Joseph Vissarionovich did not touch Stasov, because with her faithful work she completely refuted the opinion that irreplaceable people do not exist. </p><h2>  The virtues of a fragile woman </h2><p>  Elena Dmitrievna had the unspoken nickname ‚ÄúAbsolute‚Äù, which made it clear that in the performance of her work she was always accurate, and her ideological position was unshakable.  Many who knew her personally said that Elena Stasova was a born and talented teacher who knew how to clearly organize information and correctly teach. </p>

    <p>  She was also a professional in conspiracy and had tremendous experience in organizing work underground.  Even Stalin himself did not want to be left without a man who possessed many necessary contacts and kept in his memory all the most subtle nuances and hidden secrets of the Central Committee. </p><h2>  Stasova Elena Dmitrievna: biography and family </h2><p>  This woman was born in St. Petersburg in October 1873 in a family whose members were of significant importance for Russian history.  Her father, Dmitry Stasov, was a very talented and well-known lawyer in Russia.  He participated in high-profile trials.  In addition, he was directly involved in the preparation of judicial reforms of Alexander II, and therefore went down in history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is known that Elena‚Äôs mother was once the chairman of the organization ‚ÄúChildren's Assistance‚Äù, which was actively involved in resolving humanitarian issues.  Remembering her childhood, Stasova wrote that her mother was often ill, and therefore her father and native uncle, Vladimir Stasov, who was a well-known public figure in St. Petersburg, a music and literary critic, were mainly engaged in her upbringing.  He perfectly knew the history of art.  It was his influence that largely determined the further formation of Elena as a person. </p>

    <p>  Since the Stasovs' house was inhabited by intelligent and highly educated people, they were always interested in literature and read a lot.  Also in the Stasovs' house they often played music.  One of the sisters, Varvara, was a musicologist, and his father, Dmitry, besides being a lawyer, first stood at the origins of the creation, and then became director of the Russian Musical Society. </p><h2>  Received education </h2><p>  Until the age of thirteen, Elena Stasova studied at home.  But in 1887, it was decided to send her to a standard educational institution.  The girl was immediately enrolled in the 5th grade of the Tagantseva female gymnasium.  Three years later, she graduated from high school with a gold medal and received the right to work as a teacher of history, as well as the Russian language. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Revolutionary activity </h2><p>  Elena Stasova, whose biography acquires a pronounced revolutionary imprint after meeting Krupskaya, decided to apply her diploma by teaching children in Sunday school.  It was there that her mother once worked, and in this place the girl met Nadezhda Konstantinovna. </p><p>  Since 1898, Elena Stasova has been active in the ranks of the Union for the Emancipation of the Working Class.  She conducts large-scale party activities in many cities: St. Petersburg, Vilno, Minsk, Orel and Moscow. </p>

    <p>  To avoid possible political repression and arrest, a woman travels abroad for some time, where she continues to conduct active work.  While in Switzerland, she takes part in the press of the newspaper Proletariat.  In 1906, Elena Dmitrievna Stasova finds herself in Finland.  She takes part in illegal shipments of party workers across the border, smuggles weapons to Russia, and collects funds for the revolution. </p><p>  She returns to her homeland in 1907, after a few years she is still arrested.  For almost 3 years, starting in 1913, Elena Dmitrievna was in exile until she was released during the 1917 revolution. </p><h2>  Political career </h2><p>  After her release, she becomes a devoted adherent of Lenin's ideas.  At first she was elected secretary of the Central Committee of the party, and a little later - a member of the Central Committee.  In addition, Stasova managed to work in the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee, was engaged in propaganda at the Berlin representation of the Comintern, and was also the chairman of the MPRO, the organization responsible for providing international assistance to the revolutionaries. </p>

    <p>  For 8 years, Stasova served as editor in the journal International Literature.  She founded an orphanage in Ivanovo, which still bears her name.  And only after the war, in 1946, Elena Stasova, whose biography was truly rich and interesting, officially retired.  Until the end of days, she lived in the famous House on the Embankment.  Elena Dmitrievna died at the age of 93, having managed to write a memoir entitled "Pages of life and struggle." </p>
