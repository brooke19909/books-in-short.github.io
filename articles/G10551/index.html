However, in antiquity, when there was no country like Turkey in the world, the town belonged to Lycia and was called Telmess, which translates from Greek as "land of fires".  This place especially attracts lovers of natural beauties, wonderful landscapes, as well as informative vacations.  They are offered many interesting excursions, for example, to the remains of the fortress, which was built by the Rhodes knights.  However, the most popular place to visit is the tombstones of the Lycian rulers, carved into a sheer cliff.  They resemble a city lost in the rocks and amaze with the beauty of its architecture.  Particularly noteworthy is the tomb "Garden of Almond Trees", built in the third century BC.  e.  For lovers of passive relaxation, 5-star Fethiye hotels will provide a huge range of spa services, as well as the possibility of complete relaxation. </p><h2>  Fethiye Hotels </h2><p>  As already noted, this resort has many deluxe hotels.  They are perfect for families, they have all the amenities and a wide range of entertainment for all ages.  The best hotels on the coast are Jiva Beach <span>Resort 5 *,</span> Club &amp; <span>Hotel Letoonia 5 *,</span> Hillside Beach Club 5 *, and more recently, the <span>5-</span> star Garcia Resort <span>Spa</span> has joined them.  Unlike budget hotels, young people are not particularly keen on this, so a relaxing holiday for tourists is guaranteed.  However, this does not mean at all that it is boring and uninteresting, just recreation and entertainment areas are skillfully separated from each other.  For example, in the reviews of tourists about the hotel <span>Garcia Resort Spa</span> 5 * you can find both references to well-organized animation and thanks for a quiet and relaxing holiday.  Everyone finds what he likes best.  And all thanks to the professionally designed interior of the hotel.  There are many magnificent hotels among four-star hotels, such as Noa Hotels Oludeniz Resort 4 *, and even among 3-star ones (Dorian 3 *, Flamingo 3 *, etc.). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Oludeniz Bay </h2><p>  This place is unique in its climate.  In the bay, beach vacations continue even in the winter months.  On the banks of Oludeniz there are more than 50 hotels of various categories.  However, in recent years, five-star hotel complexes have been mainly built here.  And this is dictated by the demand for them.  For example, in 2014, the magnificent Garcia Resort Spa 5 (Fethiye) was commissioned.  All beaches in the area are municipal, but for hotel guests who use the services of a beach, sunbeds and umbrellas are provided free of charge.  Especially popular are the Cleopatra Coast and Turtle Islands, where you can often find large turtles. </p><h2>  How to get to Fethiye? </h2><p>  Russian tourists who are going on vacation to one of the hotels of this resort need to buy air tickets to Antalya, and from there already get to the right place by car.  The distance between the two cities is about 300 km, the cost of a bus ticket is about 10 euros.  Buses run every hour.  Nevertheless, tourists who bought a tour to the Garcia Resort Spa 5 * hotel may not worry about this, because the price of the ticket most often includes the transfer to the hotel from the airport.  On the way you can admire the magnificent natural landscapes, the beauty of the Lycian mountains, covered with dense coniferous forests, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garcia resort spa hotel 5" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/520464.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In the Garcia Resort Spa 5 * tourists are offered the service according to the "ultra ol inclusive" system.  Guests can use the services of two restaurants and bars.  Chefs work hard.  This is evidenced by the positive reviews of tourists.  Here you can find dishes of international as well as national Turkish cuisine.  The main restaurant seats 300 people.  The second restaurant is <span>a la carte.</span>  At different times of the day, dishes are served here according to a certain menu: from 19.00 to 20.00 - Turkish cuisine, from 20.00 to 22.00 - seafood and fish.  From noon to 10 pm, the hotel has a bistro pub.  There is also a pool bar, a disco bar and a snack bar in the lobby.  Drinks for tourists on this system are served only locally.  Expensive drinks and hookah can be ordered at the bar for a fee. </p><h2>  Hotel service </h2><p>  Guests of the Garcia Resort Spa 5 * hotel can use the services of the SPA and wellness center, which includes a gym, hammam, sauna, indoor pools, massage rooms, etc. They include parking, laundry, dry cleaning, medical office, shops, a hairdresser etc. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  For vacationers, themed nights are organized in the hotel, animation happens throughout the day, starting with morning exercises.  For sports enthusiasts, there are table tennis, darts, water aerobics, billiards, etc. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this hotel has almost everything for an interesting holiday for children, it can not be called children's.  Here there is for them a swimming pool, slides, a mini club, a playground with swings, a children's menu, etc. For the smallest, for a fee, you can call a nanny.  In the restaurant for them you can find dishes from a special menu, as well as comfortable high chairs for feeding babies. </p><h2>  Coastal vacation </h2><p>  The beach is the biggest disadvantage of the Garcia Resort.  Do not think that it is dirty or out of order.  Everything is in order here, it‚Äôs just that it is at a great distance from the hotel, and in order to get there, you need to take the bus that leaves only twice a day: if you are late, you can only go ashore on your own, dolmushe (for $ 1.5) or a taxi (for $ 8-10).  And it turns out pretty expensive for tourists.  Some guests are content to relax near the pool, but for lovers of water activities, of course, this is a very big minus.  As already noted, all the beaches in this resort are municipal, but where tourist buses are brought, umbrellas, sun loungers and towels are provided free of charge.  If you use other beaches that you liked more, then you will have to pay for all these amenities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garcia resort spa 5 turkey" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/520387.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Garcia Resort Spa 5 *: guest reviews and ratings </h2><p>  There is still little information on this hotel on tourist portals.  And the thing is that he is completely new and young, and still not so few tourists managed to visit him.  However, the few reviews that they leave indicate that this hotel is of the highest level.  The problem with the beach is the most negative point.  But tourists know about this in advance, so they should be prepared for the fact that they will have to experience some inconvenience.  And in everything else, it‚Äôs even very good here: calm, comfortable, clean and beautiful.  Particularly well tourists speak out about the fun and active animators who turn leisure travelers into a real holiday.  Girls who care about their figure praise the art of chefs preparing delicious vegetarian dishes.  And gourmets are also very happy with the menu.  In short, this young hotel from the first days has established itself as a very respectable and welcoming.  Tourists feel welcome here.  And in their reviews they promise that they will definitely return here next year. </p>
