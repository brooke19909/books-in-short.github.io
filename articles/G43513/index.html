Right!  New Year's or <span>costume party.</span>  But very often it happens that the guests at first are very happy with the option to come in funny costumes, and then they are very upset.  After all, to come up with and recreate a truly good image is quite difficult.  To make it easier for you to make a choice, we offer you several master classes on how to make a mouse and mouse costume and Mini Mouse for children and adults.  After all, these characters are immortal and there are many options for how you can easily make their outfits. </p><h2>  What you need to know in order to create a mouse image </h2><p>  How to make a mouse costume with your own hands to impress everyone?  To do this, you need to think through all the details.  Firstly, decide what kind of mouse you want to be: a gray mouse-mouse, a brown mouse, an elegant Minnie Mouse, or maybe everyone knows Mickey Mouse.  The common features of all these costumes are just ears and a ponytail.  Although the outfits of a mouse-mouse and a simple mouse are similar to each other.  The difference is only in color: the first suit should be in gray shades, the second - in brown. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, after you have chosen an image, think over and provide details.  That is, if you want to recreate the outfit of Minnie Mouse, you need to use white polka dot fabric.  And if you want to become a brown mouse, then do not forget about a full-fledged headdress - a hat with ears. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thirdly, do not forget about the main details of the mouse costume.  These are ears and tail.  You can buy a tail, or you can do it yourself.  To do this, just pick a fabric of the appropriate color (gray, brown or black, if it is someone from the Mouse family), cut two identical strips, rounded on one side, and sew them together.  To make the tail voluminous, fill it with cotton, sintepon or any other filler.  By the way, small shreds of unnecessary fabric are also suitable. </p><p>  Fourth, take care of makeup.  If you have only ears on your head, then you need to additionally draw a nose and antennae with a black eyeliner.  And if you chose a hat or a mask as a model for your ears, then makeup may not be necessary. </p><p>  Fifth, if you decide to sew a New Year‚Äôs mouse costume for the <span>New Year,</span> then take care of the appropriate decor.  For example, glue stars on your outfit, sprinkle with serpentine or confetti, attach rain to your ears, and so on.  If this is the outfit of a mouse girl, then you can make a magic wand, like all princesses.  She will approach this alongside. </p><h2>  The easiest option for tailoring a gray mouse costume </h2><p>  Even if you do not bother much, you can make an original costume.  It is enough to use the master class below. </p>

    <p>  The procedure for sewing a hat with ears: </p><ol><li>  Take the black felt and cut out two identical blanks from it - two circles connected by a rectangle (Figure 1). </li><li>  Cut two smaller circles from the fur and place them on the blanks (Figure 2). </li><li>  Put the halves together and sew them together (Figure 3).  Only circles need to be cut, leaving loops. </li><li>  Put the ears on the bezel (Figure 4).  Sew the eyelets.  Then the ears will not slide off the rim. </li><li>  Make a bow of pink tulle.  To do this, cut a wide strip and fold it with an accordion.  In the center, tie a thin strip of tulle so that the ribbon does not open.  Tie the finished bow on the rim between the ears (Figure 5). </li></ol><p>  All is ready!  You can complete the image. </p><p>  By the way, between the fur, as a layer, you can use cotton wool, synthetic winterizer or any other filler.  The main thing is to push tightly so that the ears are voluminous and stand. </p><h2>  Outfit of a mouse for a girl from a dress </h2><p>  There is another way to make <span>a mouse costume for a girl with your own hands.</span>  In this case, the outfit will consist of a one-piece dress, so it is better to choose a red fabric with white polka dots to create the image of Minnie Mouse.  Such a suit is not suitable if you want to make a suit with a simple gray or brown mouse.  The image will be inexpressive and boring, which is not suitable for little girls. </p><p>  Instructions on how to sew a mouse suit with your own hands (a photo of the work process is attached): </p>

    <ol><li>  Sew on the bodice of the dress.  It can be one-piece or the sleeves will be sewn separately.  Remember that they must be in the form of flashlights (Figure 1).  The bodice pattern can be either complex (that is, with tucks), or simple (like a t-shirt). </li><li>  Stitch the elastic to the neckline and sleeves.  To the neckline, it is sewn to the very edge.  And the gum should be sewn to the sleeves, stepping back from the bottom a couple of centimeters to get a frill. </li><li>  Sew a skirt.  This can be done very easily and simply.  To do this, fold the fabric in half and cut one corner (Figure 2).  Its size should be equal to the volume of the waist. </li><li>  Next, measure the required length, taking into account the turn of a few centimeters.  Cut the excess in a semicircle.  You got a blank skirt (Figure 3).  It remains only to sew it.  The seam will be at the back. </li><li>  Tuck the bottom of the skirt and stitch black or white lace.  It is also necessary to stitch together the bottom and top of the dress (Figure 4). </li><li>  Take the black satin ribbon and either sew it to the waistband, covering the seam, or simply tie it, making a bow at the back (Figure 5). </li><li>  Make the Minnie mouse icon from the black buttons - one large and two smaller (Figure 6).  Sew them together on the bottom of the dress in the shape of a muzzle with ears. </li></ol><p>  The Minnie Mouse outfit for the girl is ready.  Add the ears and that's it. </p><h2>  Boy‚Äôs Christmas costume for a mouse with our own hands - we sew according to the pattern </h2><p>  An outfit for boys can consist of elements such as panties with straps with a tail, a black T-shirt, white gloves and a hat with ears.  Half of the things can be bought ready-made.  These are gloves and a T-shirt or golfik.  The second part is easier to sew on your own.  This will require a pattern.  It is quite simple and consists of only one element - the leg. </p><p>  A master class on how to sew a children's mouse costume with your own hands. </p>

If you want to create an image of Mickey Mouse, then you need red matter, and if you need an outfit of a simple mouse, then take gray or brown material. </li><li>  Make three more of these parts and arrange them in pairs. </li><li>  From the same material, cut two stripes that should be the same width as the two leggings folded together.

To do this, wrap them a couple of times a centimeter and sew them (Figure 7). </li><li>  Stitch the shorts fully and twist them. </li><li>  Fold the ribbons in half, which will soon become suspenders (Figure 8). </li><li>  Go over the details with an iron so that it is easier to work with them (Figure 9). </li><li>  Make a stitch on each suspender. </li><li>  Make holes on both sides of each button suspender and sew along the contour. </li><li>  Sew on the pants inside the back two buttons - left and right. </li><li>  Sew the front buttons on the outside. </li><li>  Fasten the suspenders to the panties (Figure 10). </li><li>  Make a tail of two long stripes at will. </li></ol>

    <p>  Instructions for creating a real mouse mask: </p><ol><li>  From felt to the color of your suit, cut the main part in two copies - the upper part of the muzzle of the mouse and ears. </li><li>  From pink felt, cut an oval nose and two middle ears. </li><li>  From white felt, cut out white oval eyes. </li><li>  Sew the two parts of the mask together along the contour, stepping back from the edge a couple of millimeters.  Sew on the sides of the tape. </li><li>  Stitch nose, middle of ears and eyes. </li><li>  Carefully cut out the eye holes and stitch the edges to make them look neat. </li><li>  Embroider the antennae with a black floss thread.  To do this, sew three lines of stitches from one point. </li><li>  Cut the stitched tape in half and gently burn its ends so that it does not crumble. </li></ol><p>  The mouse mask is ready!  She just ties the ribbons at the back. </p><h2>  Real hat with ears </h2><p>  Sometimes there are times when the ears on the rim do not fit the costume (for example, if the boy is wearing an outfit), and the mask is not needed.  Then you need to make a hat. </p><p>  To create it, take a felt or felt of brown, white, black and pink colors, threads, a needle and scissors, as well as some synthetic winterizer or cotton wool. </p><p>  The hat itself for a mouse costume with your own hands is done as follows: </p><ol><li>  Cut out the contour of the muzzle from brown felt, from which wide strips extend along the sides.  The upper part of the muzzle should be much larger, as it will bend. </li><li>  Also cut brown ears from brown felt. </li><li>  From a pink felt, cut a circle or an oval for the nose.  It should be large. </li><li>  Cut out eyes from white felt, and pupils and antennae from black.  The latter are cut out as follows: take a rectangle and cut it into stripes, but not completely. </li><li>  Sew on the main part of the eyes and ears. </li><li>  Sew antennae and nose on them.  Leave a small hole and push cotton or synthetic winterizer there so that the nose is voluminous.  Sew in the hole. </li><li>  Now you need to sew the strips that extend on the sides of the muzzle, and sew on them the upper part of the mask. </li></ol><p>  The hat with the ears is ready!  You can also make a similar hat without eyes and nose.  To do this, just cut a smaller workpiece - no bottom part is needed.  Sew the parts together, as in the previous version.  And to complement the image, draw a mustache and nose in black pencil. </p><h2>  How to make a mouse costume with your own hands - an adult option </h2><p>  An adult outfit is created in the same way as for little girls and boys.  You need to choose the appropriate outfit and find the right size.  This applies to ready-made clothes (for example, skirts and T-shirts). </p>

    <p>  If you want to sew a mouse suit with your own hands, the instruction will be as follows: take a ready-made <span>pattern of a</span> mouse <span>suit</span> with your own hands and adjust it to the necessary parameters (for example, size, style, and so on).  If this is a sketch of a children's dress, then simply proportionally increase the details.  To do this, measure your parameters and compare them with the proposed ones.  If this is a pattern of individual elements (for example, skirts), then select the fabric that is necessary in color. </p><p>  Fabric Tips: </p><ol><li>  If you want to become Minnie Mouse, then for a dress or skirt, choose red or pink fabric with white polka dots. </li><li>  To become Mickey Mouse, you need red fabric pants. </li><li>  The costume of a simple mouse is sewn most often from gray material.  But sometimes you can choose a brown fabric. </li></ol><h2>  How to create a mouse image from ready-made clothes </h2><p>  Sometimes it‚Äôs not necessary to buy ready-made carnival costumes or sew them yourself.  It so happens that the outfit can be made almost from your own wardrobe. </p><p>  So that an adult can turn into a cute Minnie Mouse, it is enough to acquire such items: </p><ul><li>  short dress or <span>sundress in black</span> ; </li><li>  red belt; </li><li>  red or yellow shoes; </li><li>  blouse in a red strip or polka dots; </li><li>  mouse ears. </li></ul>

    <p>  You can replace the dress and blouse with a white or black <span>blouse with short sleeves</span> and a red skirt with white polka dots. </p><p>  To transform into a mouse mouse, select a gray loose tunic and matching leggings. </p><p>  For adult guys, a mouse suit from a simple wardrobe can be made as follows: put on a fabric tracksuit in gray or brown shades, add a ponytail and ears, and also wear gloves that are suitable in color.  To recreate the image of Mickey Mouse, take red shorts or breeches, black golf and black men's underpants or leggings. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the tail and gloves do not have to be worn.  But the image must be complete.  Nothing complicated if you try and connect your imagination. </p><p>  The advantage of home-made carnival costumes to those bought is the following: thanks to an approach such as creating an image from hand-made materials and clothes, your holiday outfit will not just hang on your shoulders in a wardrobe for the rest of your life and wait for your next hour.  Any kit can be turned into a daily one.  Simply detach the tail and remove the other distinctive attributes of the mouse.  And the ears can be put on the shelf, as a reminder of the wonderful image and a fun evening. </p>
