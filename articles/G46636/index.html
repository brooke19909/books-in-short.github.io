But there are several basic color variations on sale.  In addition, this device is perfect for full power, as well as charging any battery in devices such as Acer Iconia Tab A511, A500, A700 and A701 and so on.  It is especially worth noting that the charger is quite powerful - a full charge of the device is carried out for 45 minutes - 1 hour. <br><br>  In addition, you need to pay attention to the fact that this charger is for all the main varieties of Acer Iconia Tab, including A511, A500, A700, A701 and some others.  In principle, it is universal, but only for Acer devices.
