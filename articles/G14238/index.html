However, a headphone model has recently appeared on the market that relates to budget devices.  This unit is more suitable for DJs and record companies. </p><p>  This model is Sennheiser HD 205. Most recently, the second generation of the existing device was released, but the differences between them are only in appearance, and they are insignificant.  Information about the first model is quite small.  It has long been discontinued, and on the official website there is not even a description, however, reviews on the Internet about these headphones are still preserved.  Having analyzed them, we can say how comfortable and good they are.  The average price is from $ 40 to $ 60. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 205" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1577013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  <span>Headphones Sennheiser</span> HD 205, although positioned as DJs, are great for beginner musicians.  Especially considering that the device belongs to the budget market.  The device connects to phones quite easily and simply, however, for a better connection, you need to use only stationary computers.  Ideally, there should be an awesome graphics card or a good sound amplifier. </p><p>  If we talk about musical styles, it must be said that these headphones are ideal for playing electronics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of all the minuses of the Sennheiser HD 205, it can be noted that the device puts great pressure on the head. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 205 ii" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1577017.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Headphones have a closed type of construction.  They are connected using a cable with a 3.5 mm jack.  The frequency range is from 14 to 20 thousand Hz.  Headphones weigh about 205 grams. One-way cable 3 meters long.  A quality case is included.  Gold plated connectors. </p><h2>  Design and construction </h2><p>  Sennheiser HD 205, reviews of which create an opinion about their almost perfection, are headphones in compact sizes.  The design has minimalistic and calm notes.  The manufacturer gives a two-year warranty on his device.  In order to store the headphones, he supplies a case.  The design, in principle, is normal, but there is still a special rigidity. </p><p>  At the top of the headband you can see the manufacturer‚Äôs logo, which is written on the case.  The emblem was applied using special technologies.  On loops on both sides the image in silver shades flaunts.  The ear pads are replaceable, they are round in shape, made of black vinyl.  One of the Sennheiser HD 205 cups (the reviews are mostly positive) can calmly transform, move in two directions, allowing you to listen to music with one ear.  All headphones are made in black, except for the outside of the cups. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In any place, in addition to the noisiest, noise isolation gives the maximum effect, so that the environment is completely inaudible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 205 headphones" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1577018.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  These headphones are great for playing music from portable devices.  Consumers test them on phones and players. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the bass is not as powerful as we would like.  But this drawback is fully justified by the sound, which is served at the professional level.  Play accented and detailed.  Treble is quite a bit behind the ideal, but along with the bass sound quite harmonious.  The latter are dense and deep, but not aggressive, which is sometimes not enough. </p><p>  Amid all the notes, the midrange, unfortunately, sounds unnatural.  The second generation has the same problem - Sennheiser HD 205 II.  The highest range is well controlled, no noise, sharpness too.  These nuances are important enough for playback from digital sources. </p><p>  High frequencies sound quite pleasant, fresh, and low frequencies are subtle and smooth.  Headphones behave differently in different genres, but the playback quality does not seem bad under any circumstances.  If we talk about electronic music, then everything is fine.  Hard rock sounds confusing and weak. </p><p>  When watching movies, bass is heard dynamically and aggressively.  The explosions in the headphones are good enough, the sound of broken glass is quite realistic, clear and loud.  The gun fires accurately, but the background noise is blurry and dull. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 205 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1577019.jpg" width="411"></div>

    <h2>  Positive and negative sides </h2><p>  Among the advantages of the Sennheiser HD 205 model, consumers note the high-quality assembly, equipment and sound.  For its value, the playback level is suggestible and does not require any amendments.  Although the equipment does not consist of a large number of devices, it is still quite normal.  In addition to headphones, the manufacturer also provides a special adapter from 3.5 mm to 6.3 mm.  The case is placed only in a box with the Sennheiser HD 205 II device, the first generation did not have it.  The dominant material is plastic.  You won‚Äôt work especially well with such headphones, however, as a home model, they are quite adequate. </p><p>  The disadvantages include the cable and inconvenience.  The wire is too long for the model used for portable connection.  For music, such a cable - just right.  Convenience, unfortunately, is not at the best level.  Due to the fact that the design of the headphones does not allow them to sit comfortably on the user's head, they put too much pressure, especially during prolonged use.  That is why before buying them, you must definitely try on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 205 price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1577020.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Sennheiser HD 205 Headphones are affordable.  Their sound is at an excellent level, bass is well audible.  At the output, they give high-quality and vivid reproduction. </p><p>  Of the common advantages, it is possible to note the presence of a cover for transportation, affordability, a good level of sound insulation. </p><p>  Of the minuses, consumers note inconvenience while wearing, after a certain interval, the plastic from which the headphones are made begins to creak, the device practically does not fold, the cable is not removable, so you can not replace it if it breaks.  It is because of these points that many do not like the Sennheiser HD 205. The price of headphones is 3-4 thousand rubles. </p>
