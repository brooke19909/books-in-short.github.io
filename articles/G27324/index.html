  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Headphone device: types, design of headphones and principle of operation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In today's world, you can find a wide variety of all kinds of headphones.  Therefore, to make the necessary choice will not be difficult even for the most demanding consumer.  The choice of headphone device is carried out according to several parameters, the most important of which is the way to keep it in your ears.  On this basis, two main types of devices are distinguished.  The first are inserted directly into the ear.  The latter are called false because they are applied to the ears from the outside. </p><p>  There are other differences that allow us to classify the available types of such devices.  Thus, headphone devices can be divided into wired models and those that work without wires.  There are also open type devices and closed devices.  In addition, they can take the form of inserts or be vacuum.  There are a number of other features that allow you to divide devices into groups. </p><p>  The headphone device is the fundamental reason for the choice of most modern consumers.  Today, this type of acoustic accessory is represented by several major product groups. </p><h2>  Plug-in </h2><p>  In everyday life, these devices have a simpler name - they were called "inserts."  Among other models, they have the most attractive cost.  Most often, all kinds of mobile gadgets are equipped with such accessories.  For example, they can act as a headphone device for a phone.  The modern standard of such models was created by the developers of Etymotic Research. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="au.kensington.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones for" class="if uuid-3160178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3160178.jpg"></div><p>  This happened in the first half of the 90s of the last century, but this group of goods became widely available much later.  The device of the speakers and headphones of this brand does not differ in the best sound quality - say the reviews.  In addition, the technique does not fit well with the anatomical features of some people.  The package includes ear cushions made of foam rubber, but they do not produce the expected degree of sound insulation. </p><h2>  Interchangeable nozzles </h2><p>  For more expensive phone models, interchangeable nozzles are provided.  They allow better fixation of the headphone device in the ear.  A positive quality of such samples is their compactness, which creates comfortable conditions during travel.  However, in-ear devices are being replaced by more advanced models of in-ear headphones that share similar external data with them. </p><h2>  Intracanal </h2><p>  At the moment, these accessories are one of the most popular types of goods that allow you to listen to all kinds of sound information from mp3 players, as well as smartphones.  The fixation of such devices in the ear is much better than in the previous model due to a deeper fit.  This feature allows you to significantly improve the playback quality of music tracks by reducing the amplitude of vibrations on the membrane.  It also helps to reduce the degree of sound distortion, as user reviews say. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="for phone device" class="if uuid-3160179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3160179.jpg"></div><p>  A large number of different nozzles are always included with the devices.  The quality of the in <span>-ear headphones is</span> significantly higher than that of the in <span>-ear headphones</span> , but still lower than the on <span>-ear headphones</span> .  This is due to the fact that the miniature speaker is not able to physically compete with larger samples.  Owners of this type of headphones are advised to pay attention on the streets because of the high-quality isolation of playback from external noise. </p><p>  It is worth noting that plug-in and intra-channel devices due to their compactness are the most successful for use in mobile phones.  In addition, a useful headset is always present in their kit.  A headphone device with a microphone is most popular among other analogs. </p><h2>  Overhead </h2><p>  The way to fix these accessories on the outside of the ear is eloquently embedded in the name of the device.  This kind of headphones is the most convenient in relation to sports models.  They are superimposed externally on the auricle, but do not completely overlap it.  The speaker, which serves as a sound source, does not fall into the internal cavity, but transmits sound from the outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiamart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones for a mobile phone" class="if uuid-3160181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3160181.jpg"></div><p>  This causes the installation of a more powerful emitter capable of delivering a more powerful volume.  This is made possible by increased dimensions.  This <span>type of headphone</span> is relatively compact.  They install two types of mounts.  They have separate arches, worn on each ear, or connected by a common mount in the form of an arc.  Among the main disadvantages, insufficient sound insulation can be noted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Full size </h2><p>  This type of accessory is well suited for stationary home use, thanks to its superior sound quality.  However, the volumetric dimensions of the devices of this group do not allow them to be used successfully for trips and movements.  Although connoisseurs of full-fledged sounding, this fact does not always stop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphone device" class="if uuid-3160185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3160185.jpg"></div><p>  Cups of such models, by their size, are able to completely overlap the auricles.  This feature, combined with elastic ear pads, allows you to create significant isolation from external noise, which makes it possible to perceive even the finest musical shades.  Today, <span>full-size headphones</span> belong to the premium segment.  Such accessories are lightweight and convenient in configuration.  In some cases, folding models are used with a shortened version of the cord, which makes it more profitable to use the device with mobile devices. </p><h2>  Monitor </h2><p>  This kind of model has many external similarities with full-size headphones due to its size.  The cups of these devices are also capable of covering the entire surface of the auricles.  But they differ in a more voluminous design, as well as a significantly increased power of the emitter.  In addition, a powerful connecting arc and a cable having a long length are installed on such headphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bluetooth device" class="if uuid-3160186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3160186.jpg"></div><p>  This version of the headphones is completely not intended for use with portable equipment and is unsuitable for listening to tracks of poor quality.  It uses a wide range of audio transmission, distributed in a balanced balance.  Such accessories are used for studio equipment and high-quality professional audio equipment. </p><h2>  Signal Transmission Methods </h2><p>  This feature allows you to separate the headphone model by the method of connection to the reproducing equipment.  This group has long been dominated by wire systems that have no alternative at all.  However, today in the consumer market you can buy headphones that use a wireless signal transmission system at a certain distance.  Such devices are of exceptional quality; they do not limit freedom of movement at all.  The most popular are bluetooth headphones.  The device is very compact and transmits sound quality. </p><h2>  Wired </h2><p>  Wired systems have still not lost their relevance and are the most popular group of products among sound-transmitting devices.  They have a more attractive cost and are of high quality playback.  To connect this type of headphones, wires of different lengths are used by means of a connector equipped with a 3.5 mm mini-jack serial jack. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphone for phone device" class="if uuid-3160182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3160182.jpg"></div><p>  A microphone or volume control can be installed in the wire, as well as a button that allows you to receive a call.  Wired systems are used for absolutely all types of headphones, regardless of the design or type of switch.  USB headphones are in great demand.  The device allows you to connect, bypassing the line output, designed for most wired systems.  The plug of these headphones fits any unoccupied USB port that is available on all modern devices. </p><h2>  Wireless </h2><p>  The new wireless system allows the user to get rid of all the restrictions associated with wires.  For some people, it remains a mystery what kind of systems there are and what you need to pay attention to when buying such devices.  Although today there are still all 4 types of wireless systems, however, the radio and infrared ports are almost never used. </p><p>  The most popular is the compact device - Bluetooth headphones.  In addition, there is an increase in demand for Wi-Fi systems, a hallmark of which is a large reception radius.  Wi-Fi devices are capable of receiving transmissions directly from the network.  Such devices receive power from personal batteries built into the case.  Among the headphones with wireless equipment, you can also find hybrid systems that allow you to use different connection paths. </p><h2>  IPhone Headphone Device </h2><p>  The main producer of this category of products is Apple, which recently launched a new series of AirPods with a wireless connection system.  This is the company's first experience in producing wireless headphone devices that connects via Bluetooth.  This decision, most likely, was provoked by the absence of a 3.5 mm diameter jack in the new iPhone 7 / 7s, which allows connecting wired accessories.  This means that consumers had to use adapters or purchase proprietary devices that have a Lightning connector to connect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultofmac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bluetooth headphone" class="if uuid-3160183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3160183.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  When choosing headphones, it is necessary to take into account that not only the external characteristics matter, but also the ability to transmit high-quality sound.  This factor should be put at the top of the list of requirements for the purchased device.  Before making the final decision, it is recommended to make a summary assessment of the positive qualities of the accessory and evaluate the quality of reproduction. </p><p>  Do not stop the final choice on models that can produce the loudest sound.  This property does not always match the sound quality.  It is better to pay attention to gadgets with better sound insulation.  Using headphones with enhanced isolation from external sounds is not recommended in crowded places to avoid unpleasant situations.  Use the device for limited time periods.  Otherwise, hearing problems may begin. </p>
