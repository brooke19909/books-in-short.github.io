However, this man is an outstanding historical figure.  Some scholars are inclined to compare it with Prometheus, and his discoveries are mentioned among the most significant achievements of the twentieth century.  The turbulence technique he developed is capable of giving humanity completely new sources of energy.  The ingenious inventor left behind a considerable number of interesting ideas that are still awaiting their implementation.  Let's get acquainted with some of his discoveries. </p><p>  <strong>Light and shadow</strong> </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victor Schauberger" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/71456.jpg" width="339"></div>  Being a hereditary forester, Victor Schauberger from childhood admired the virgin beauty of the forest.  But the water interested him no less, and once he made a very interesting discovery: she prefers the shadow and does not like direct sunlight.  And it happened as follows.  In the forest in which he was a forester, a spring has long existed - an old stone house towered above it.  When the dilapidation of the building reached its limit, and the house fell apart, the source was in direct <span>sunlight.</span>  Some time has passed, the spring has dried up.  It would seem a coincidence.  But a new hut was erected on the site of the old one, and the water in the spring reappeared.  Why?  The riddle!

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Trying to find the answer, Schauberger Victor came across the following fact in one of the books: in ancient times, the Romans knew that water does not like sunlight, and therefore it was customary to cover the springs with stone slabs, and they inserted a pipe to get the liquid, and they did it so as to prevent air from entering it.  From this, Victor Schaurberger was able to conclude: water loves shadow.  No wonder all the sources are in deep, shady crevices of rocks or in a dense forest. </p><p>  <strong>Why can a fish fly?</strong> </p>

Only after several decades of intensive observations did he manage to get an answer to this question.  It turns out that the secret lies in the temperature of the water.  The lower its value, the better ‚Äúflying‚Äù abilities the fish gains.

    <p>  Any theory needs proof, and Victor decided to confirm this problem in a very original way.  He heated about a hundred liters of water and poured it into a stream above the place where trout frolicked.  Of course, such a volume could not significantly change the temperature in the stream, but nevertheless the fish was clearly worried, began to stay in place with difficulty, began to beat more often with fins, and in the end was washed away downstream. </p><p>  Any force inevitably creates an opposing force of equal magnitude - such a conclusion was made by Victor Schauberger in the course of his observations.  The energy of the water comes from a vortex (naturally flowing) flow and is directed towards the flow.  This force is used by trout.  After solving this natural phenomenon, it becomes clear why one can sometimes see such an unusual phenomenon on a cold winter night: small rounded stones rise from the bottom of the reservoir and begin to circulate on the surface like floats.  The energy of the vortex is fraught with many mysteries.  Perhaps the future of technological progress lies precisely behind the vortex engines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victor Schauberger Water Energy" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/71455.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Confirmed by science</strong> </p><p>  Subsequently, the findings of the ingenious inventor were confirmed at practical universities in Stockholm and Stuttgart.  The test results confirmed that when the water is cooled down to + 4 ¬∞ , it begins to be saturated with additional energy and is purified from organic impurities.  The fact that the moon's rays give water strength, while the sun's rays reduce it, is also scientifically confirmed.  One can only be surprised at how Victor Schauberger was ahead of his time. </p>
