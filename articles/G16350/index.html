    <h2>  Puerto Plata and surroundings </h2><p>  The area where the province of Rio San Juan is located is the north of the <span>Dominican Republic.</span>  It is famous for its beautiful long sandy beaches and pristine jungle.  Between his cities and villages, they move either by taxi or by local buses.  The latter are very cheap, they travel slowly, stop near each pillar, but with their help you can literally get to any place of interest.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to understand their schedule and directions.  Breathtaking beaches stretch for about a hundred kilometers.  One of the best restaurants in the resort is located in the village of Cabarete, not far from our Grand Bahia Principe hotel.  The capital of the resort is interesting for its colonial architectural style, mansions and palaces of Spanish aristocrats.  She is also known as one of the first places where the famous discoverer Christopher Columbus arrived. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Grand Bahia Principe San Juan 5 * Resort is located seventy kilometers from Puerto Plata Airport.  Despite such an insignificant distance, the transfer to the hotel is quite tiring.  From Punta Cana you travel almost across the island, it is about five, or even seven hours.  If we add a twelve-hour flight from Russia by this time, the journey turns out to be very long and difficult.  However, the wonderful service of the hotel helps to quickly forget about the inconvenience and begin to enjoy life.  This is the north of the Dominican Republic, where nature is much more beautiful than in the south, because the real jungle has been preserved.  Here you will be entertained by unseen birds all day with their twittering, and palm twigs will create a welcome coolness.  Eight kilometers from the hotel is the famous Playa Grande Beach.  At 5 km - a large supermarket "Gaspar Hernandez." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Bahia Principe San Juan 5 reviews" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1993112.jpg" width="600"></div>
