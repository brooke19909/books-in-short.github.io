Lenovo Miix 3: problems after updating</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  So, today we will bring to your attention a tablet called Lenovo Miix 3. This is a fairly new model that has already won the hearts of many buyers.  But why is this happening?  What's so special about her?  Or, perhaps, we are dealing with nothing more than well-advertised goods?  We will try to figure this out.  The technical specifications of the Lenovo Miix 3 device, as well as the numerous owner reviews and expert tips, will help us.  Let us begin as soon as possible with you to study our today's question. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  What to look for at the very beginning?  For example, on the screen.  This component is very important for the tablet.  And Lenovo Miix 3 offers its owners pretty good options in this regard.  The diagonal of such a screen is 10.1 inches.  This is a great indicator for a gaming device.  The resolution is also high - 1920 by 1200 pixels.  This means that the Lenovo Miix 3 tablet allows you to watch movies and videos in excellent quality and Full HD format. </p>

    <p>  The display on the gadget is capacitive, touch.  It supports up to 10 simultaneous touches.  This allows the tablet to respond quickly to commands sent.  So you can be sure that with this gadget you will be provided with speed and quality.  The image on the screen always remains bright, beautiful and clear in all weather conditions.  All this thanks to the latest technologies that were used in the manufacture of Lenovo Miix 3. And this fact is extremely pleasing to the owners.  After all, for a tablet, the screen is a very important point, especially when it comes to a gaming gadget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The overall dimensions of the device is also an important parameter.  If you choose a Lenovo Miix 3 tablet or some other for a student or work, then you should still pay attention to the dimensions of the device.  It is not always convenient to carry this or that model.  Therefore, do not overlook this parameter. </p><p>  For example, the tablet Lenovo Miix 3 has pretty good performance in this sense.  Indeed, despite the large screen size, the dimensions still remain not so huge.  In length, the model is 257 millimeters, in width - 172. But the thickness of this device is not so small - almost 1 centimeter.  More precisely, then 9.3 mm.  Nevertheless, this does not interfere with the comfortable storage of the tablet.  Carrying it with you in a bag or backpack is not a problem.  We can conclude that this particular tablet is perfect for work or study. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet lenovo miix 3" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/982209.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, Lenovo Miix 3, the reviews we are studying, has a small weight for its parameters - only 549 grams.  This is enough to feel the device in the bag, but not to add extra load.  Even a child can handle such a tablet.  And it pleases.  You don‚Äôt have to worry that it will be difficult for you to carry the device with you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Another important point that affects both the main characteristics of the gadget and its cost is the processor.  The more powerful it is, the better.  And the tablet Lenovo Miix 3 830 can really boast of this component.  It is not as large and powerful as in some modern models, but nevertheless it remains at its best. </p><p>  The thing is that the processor here has 4 cores.  This is the average for a gaming tablet.  And the clock frequency of each core is 1.3 GHz.  We get a processor with a capacity of 5.2 GHz.  The numbers are pretty big.  Yes, you can also find models with 8 cores, but only they will cost 3 times more than a Lenovo Miix 3 830 tablet. Therefore, it does not always make sense to buy such gadgets. </p><p>  As many users assure, "Lenovo" is perfect for both work and entertainment.  And all this thanks to a powerful processor.  Yes, the basic characteristics are also important for the performance of the device.  But the processor plays an important role among them.  And now it‚Äôs very difficult to find a worthy and powerful model.  But if you chose Lenovo Miix 3 830 (32GB), the characteristics of which we will learn more and more, then you can rest assured - you made the right choice. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  The next moment is the RAM.  It also affects the performance of the tablet.  The greater her score, the better.  So, it makes sense to pay close attention to this moment. </p>

    <p>  For example, it is worth considering that the Lenovo Miix 3 10 tablet receives reviews in this sense, normal.  Not as good as it could be, but not terrible.  After all, we will be offered 2 GB of RAM on the device.  There are models with 3 and even 4 gigabytes, but they will cost several times more.  And, as many owners note, so much space on the tablet is simply not needed.  This is an excess. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But 2 GB of RAM is normal.  Most modern games and applications require a given amount of space.  So you can not worry about the fact that you will be somehow limited in content.  After all, it is this factor that is able to alienate most potential buyers from one or another model. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  Do not forget about the operating system.  Now she is given a lot of time.  After all, the nature of the installed content, as well as the functionality of the entire gadget, depends on it.  Many are used to seeing Android on modern technology.  But just for such a familiar description, the tablet Lenovo Miix 3 1030 does not fall.  After all, it has one distinguishing feature. </p><p>  And, of course, this is an operating system.  She's a little unusual - based on Windows.  Initially, version 8.1 is installed here.  But if necessary, you can upgrade it to Windows 10 absolutely free. So you have to prepare for the fact that applications for Android will be banned for you.  But Windows has its advantages.  For example, such tablets are more functional.  And you can run more useful applications and games on them than on Android.  Many refuse such a device as the tablet Lenovo Miix 3 830 (or higher) precisely because of the unusual operating system.  But this is not worth doing.  After all, Windows is beginning to actively introduce itself into gadgets of various types.  And, moreover, it is successfully advancing.  And that means that very soon Windows will start attracting customers. </p><h2>  Free place </h2><p>  Any tablet must have hard disk space for storing information.  And the more it is, the better.  It is very important.  And most buyers choose a gadget based on this parameter.  At Lenovo Miix 3 830 (32GB), the characteristics in this sense are quite good.  But among the buyers are still always dissatisfied customers. </p>

    <p>  The thing is that in this model you will be offered 32 GB of free space for data.  But in practice, we get only 30 gigabytes.  2 of them are occupied by the operating system and the files necessary for its functioning.  In principle, this is a completely normal indicator.  But if you consider that the operating system is Windows, then very soon you will begin to experience a shortage of space.  And this is not very nice.  There are several ways out of this situation.  The first is to constantly monitor installed content and get rid of unnecessary, old files in the system.  This is not the best way out.  After all, buyers are not used to constantly cleaning their own gadgets.  Therefore, you have to resort to one well-known and popular technique. </p><h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  For example, it is worth inserting a special device into the device.  It is called a memory card.  Unfortunately, this feature is now not available on all tablets.  Nevertheless, our case is an exception.  The Lenovo Miix 3 tablet receives reviews in terms of support for memory cards are simply excellent.  And now we will find out why. </p><p>  With a shortage of space, it is enough to connect a microSD card to the tablet.  There is one small restriction - the maximum allowable amount of space.  In our case, it is 128 GB.  Perhaps, for a modern gadget, this is not such a limitation.  After all, memory cards larger than 128 GB simply do not exist in nature.  So, it is with this tablet that you will get the maximum performance relative to the space additionally built into the device. </p><p>  As the owners emphasize, despite the fact that the operating system is Windows here, you still will not run out of space with such a memory card.  In addition, your data will become mobile.  It is very comfortable.  So already for this characteristic it is worth paying attention to the Lenovo Miix 3. For many, this moment is important.  In principle, exactly the same as all other characteristics. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Do not forget about the battery.  The thing is that it is he who can often influence the decision to purchase.  Of course, everyone wants to buy a gadget that can be actively used for a long time without recharging.  But, unfortunately, finding something like this is quite difficult.  But Lenovo Miix 3 is quite suitable for these parameters. </p><p>  The battery capacity here is 6000 mAh.  On average, such a device should work with the active use of about 7 days.  But if you believe the practice, then in reality, recharging will be required after 5 days.  Nevertheless, this is a very good indicator.  Especially when you consider that most gadgets and tablets refuse to work after 2-3 days. </p>

    <p>  Battery for Lenovo Miix 3 is not removable.  And, unfortunately, sometimes this can be a huge problem.  In particular, if the operating rules of the device are not observed.  Batteries tend to deteriorate quickly in the event of abuse.  So, replacing a non-removable battery will give the owner a lot of inconvenience.  But to avoid such a problem is quite possible.  It is enough just to follow all the operating rules and completely discharge the gadget before putting it on recharge. </p><p>  A little more clarity about the duration of the tablet.  In a waiting state, he can "lie idle" for about 2-3 months.  With inactive, but daily use, about a month.  If you constantly keep the Internet on, and even use it actively, you can count on only 20 hours of excellent work.  So it all depends on the intensity of contact with the tablet.  In principle, these indicators are quite pleasing to many buyers.  After all, do not forget about the cost of the device and additional equipment, which also plays an important role for owners. </p><h2>  Supply </h2><p>  When buying any gadget, it is important to know in what configuration you will receive it.  Maybe it makes sense to purchase a more expensive model, in which "all inclusive"?  In our case, to be honest, there may be some conflicts among buyers and sellers.  After all, Lenovo Miix 3 has a variety of equipment. </p><p>  The rarest and best is all-inclusive.  There is also a special <span>keyboard for the tablet,</span> and a case, and instructions.  In addition, here you can find a wire for connecting and synchronizing with a computer, a cover, a sticker on the screen, as well as a key fob and a headset (company).  Typically, such delivery is carried out only abroad.  It is very rare in Russia.  And, as a rule, she has to make purchases through foreign online stores. </p>

    <p>  But the Russian configuration is not very encouraging.  After all, usually in the box with Lenovo Miix 3 is only a guarantee, instructions, as well as a headset.  And not always branded.  A charger and a wire for connecting to a computer are for granted.  But the keyboard <span>for the tablet, case</span> and other components are usually purchased separately.  And this is not very good effect on purchases in Russia.  After all, it‚Äôs better to wait a month or two until they bring you a complete set, than spend the extra money.  Yes, and not so small amounts. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Often the price plays a decisive role in the choice of a tablet.  In our case, we can say that the price tag is decent.  Especially if you take into account that we will deal with the Windows operating system and the real gaming gadget. </p><p>  The average cost of this device is about 8 thousand rubles.  Even in an incomplete configuration, this is quite a good indicator.  Only a small number of manufacturers will allow you to set a tablet with similar characteristics at such a low price. </p><p>  Nevertheless, among the buyers there are still constantly dissatisfied owners.  For example, some believe that the average cost of this model should not exceed 5000. If you think about it, you can understand such users.  Especially when you see the message ‚ÄúDrive is locked‚Äù (Lenovo Miix 3) when you turn on or try to download data on the device.  So, this opinion is based on numerous failures.  What should buyers prepare for? </p><h2>  Errors and malfunctions </h2><p>  It is extremely important to know what kind of malfunctions and errors can arise during the work with this or that technical device.  So, for example, the most common problem with Lenovo Miix 3 users is the hard drive.  He constantly refuses to work.  And this is only corrected by replacing the "iron".  This requires taking the device to a specialized help center. </p><p>  But most often, Lenovo Miix 3 has problems after updating the operating system.  Fortunately, they are not as dangerous as a hard drive failure.  Usually you have to reinstall the system.  Or take the tablet to a technical assistance center - there the wizards will quickly rectify the situation.  But after that, updating the operating system will be prohibited.  Inconvenient, but not critical. </p>
