    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Gloria Verde is popular with travelers, but this does not mean that it has no shortcomings.  Based on the reviews of tourists, you can highlight the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  when ordering food, the prices indicated are not those on the menu, but much higher; </li><li>  expensive airport shuttle (much cheaper to call a taxi); </li><li>  pools are poorly looked after, water is almost never drained; </li><li>  food left over from breakfast and lunch can be seen at the distribution during dinner; </li><li>  rare replacement of bed linen; </li><li>  boring animation, insufficiently saturated entertainment program; </li><li>  inflated prices for SPA services; </li><li>  a small area on which as many as three hotels of the network are huddled; </li><li>  in the fall, the air conditioning system does not work, despite the rather hot weather; </li><li>  there are not enough free sunbeds on the beach; </li><li>  fatty and spicy foods prevail, and therefore diet foods have to be ordered separately; </li><li>  unscrupulous cleaning (in most cases, maids only take out the garbage); </li><li>  nightly animation ends at midnight, which is early enough. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Gloria Verde Resort is an interesting option for families.  Given the living conditions, food and entertainment, it can be argued that travelers with young children will especially like it.  But active tourists, as well as fans of noisy events, can get bored here.  But everyone can enjoy the sea and nature here. </p>
