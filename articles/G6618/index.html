Scientific methodology - basic principles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the XXI century, scientific knowledge in almost all spheres of human life reached its peak.  People have learned to know the world around them not only through practical successes and mistakes, but also theoretically, through the development of concepts, knowledge, etc. A similar success of all existing sciences has arisen thanks to an additional category that has also developed over many centuries.  After all, not one of them could have ‚Äúgenerated‚Äù any kind of concept if it had not applied certain methods, techniques or methods in the process of theoretical understanding.  It is thanks to these three components that the latest knowledge in one or another field appears in the world, which ultimately leads to the evolution of the entire human species.  Thus, in the article, the author will try to consider the essence of such a concept as methodology, as well as its key aspects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the methodology" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/938199.jpg" width="528"></div>

    <h2>  Concept of methodology </h2><p>  You need to understand that this term can be found in many existing scientific fields.  The concept of methodology is so multifaceted and specific that many mistakenly call this category a separate science.  Such conclusions are misleading.  In this case, the logical question arises: "What is the methodology?" <strong> </strong>  For a better understanding, you need to refer to its history.  The term "methodology" itself has ancient Greek roots.  The word meant "the path to something," or "thought."  In a modern interpretation, methodology is the doctrine of the methods, methods and techniques of researching a scientific subject.  Thus, we are not talking about a separate industry, but about a set of methods for studying a single scientific segment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To fully understand the question of what a method and methodology are, you need to fully consider the essence of this teaching.  It has not only a peculiar structure, but also some species branches, which will be discussed later in the article. </p><h2>  Classical teaching structure </h2><p>  The scientific methodology has a peculiar and rather complex structure, filled with various elements.  The whole doctrine consists of different theoretical and practical ways of understanding a scientific subject.  The classical structure of the methodology contains only two main elements.  Each of them characterizes a certain side of the "development" of a scientific subject.  Simply put, the classical structure is based on the practical and theoretical side of the manifestation of methodology in the form of a holistic teaching.  From here, the following elements can be distinguished: </p><p>  1. Epistemology, or the theoretical part of the doctrine.  Its main goal is scientific concepts that arise only with the logical development of the subject.  Gnoseology is responsible not only for knowledge, but also for its processing with the aim of "collecting" rational grain.  This element is directly related to the scientific industry itself. </p><p>  2. The second element is of practical importance.  There are no more specific theorems and concepts.  The basis is an algorithm, a set of ways to achieve a practical goal.  It is thanks to the second element that theoretical knowledge can be realized in a real policy due to the principles of practical application that appear in the whole complex of actual actions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, the scientific methodology is also subject to other ways of structuring, which indicates the importance of this doctrine. </p><h2>  Secondary structure </h2><p>  In addition to the elements presented, a secondary structure is distinguished in the teaching system, which allows us to more accurately see the connection of the methodology with the scientific branches that exist today.  A conditionally similar structure can be divided into five components, namely: </p><p>  - The methodological basis, which, in turn, consists of a number of independent sciences: psychology, philosophy, logic, systemology, ethics and aesthetics. </p><p>  - The second element allows you to see the forms and characteristics of the activity, as well as its norms and principles. </p><p>  - The logical structure of the construction is the third element.  It includes the subject, object, subject, form and means of implementation. </p><p>  - At certain stages of the actual implementation of the methodology, this process can be divided into phases, stages and stages. </p><p>  - The fifth element is the technological characteristic of solving certain problems. </p><p>  Given the rather complex and ramified structure of methodological doctrine, we can conclude about its development prospects in the structure of individual sciences.  All existing types of exercises today are formed under the influence of a particular industry.  For a complete answer to the question of what a methodology is, it is necessary to consider the ‚Äúvital activity‚Äù of this teaching as part of specific scientific knowledge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Methodological Directions </h2><p>  Theory and methodology are inextricably interconnected concepts.  However, this teaching is found not only in purely scientific fields.  There are several main areas of development of the methodology, among which there are practical branches of human activity, for example: </p><p>  - Methodology for solving problems in the field of computer science. </p><p>  - Methodological base of programming. </p><p>  - A set of methods and methods of business modeling. </p><p>  These areas show that the practical method and methodology as a whole <strong> </strong>  can be used in practice to the fullest.  More theoretical areas are scientific methodology (topic of the article) and biogeocenology (a mixture of biology and geography). </p>

    <p>  It should be remembered that in a standard form the scientific methodology has certain distinctive features, which can be traced on examples of specific branches of science. </p><h2>  Methodology of law </h2><p>  Law is a rather specific scientific branch.  It was originally formed as the main regulator of social relations.  Therefore, law directly affects society.  The methodology of knowledge of law and methods for its implementation are quite different.  In the first case, we are talking about a theoretical understanding of legal concepts, in the second - about the actual implementation of such concepts on a public plane.  Thus, the methodology of law is duality.  If in other scientific branches only abstract methods of obtaining knowledge are mentioned, then the methods for obtaining ‚Äúlegal statements‚Äù are clearly listed in law.  Simply put, we are talking about specific methods, namely: </p><p>  1. The scientific method consists of the fundamental principles of an industry or science in general.  With its help, it becomes possible to see much deeper the essence of a particular issue, as well as its role and place in the legal policy.  Most often, the general scientific method (used in all industries) and the private scientific method (applicable only in law) are distinguished. </p><p>  2. Through the philosophical method, it becomes possible to study law on the basis of existing ideas of worldview.  In other words, the comprehension of law takes place (legal understanding is developed) through criticism, comparison and characterization of its constituent elements. </p><p>  3. The <span>special legal method</span> exists exclusively in the field of law.  It is a system of specific <span>methods: normative</span> analysis, comparative law, etc. </p><h2>  "Applied" methodology in law </h2><p>  It should be noted that the methodology of knowledge is not a single set of methods.  There are also a number of techniques that are aimed not at knowing the industry, but at its actual application.  In this case, the value of the method is paramount, because it helps to realize the right.  Lawyers identified two main methods: </p><p>  1. <em>Imperative</em> - the imperative of power that exists in the sources of law.  Subjects are not able to regulate their own behavior. </p><p>  2. <em>Dispositive</em> - based on the equality and independence of the parties that have the ability to independently make decisions within the framework of legal norms. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the scientific methodology of law exists not only at the theoretical, but also at the social level, which makes it possible for all kinds of concepts to really be realized.  It is for this reason that law is a socially regulatory science.  A completely different methodological base can be seen in economics or sociology, because the scope is completely different.  We will try to consider these industries, taking into account the subject of their study. </p><h2>  The process of cognition in economics </h2><p>  The economic methodology differs significantly from the legal one primarily in that it does not contain practical methods of implementation.  Economic theories exist, as it were, beyond the real economy.  Science coordinates this area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife, but does not directly affect it.  The process of cognition in economic theories is saturated with various techniques.  Moreover, these methods are used so extensively and deeply that through a few you can fully understand some of the problems of the scientific industry.  At the same time, the economic methodology is directed exclusively towards a positive outcome.  In other words, the concepts of scientists in this industry are very often ‚Äúutopias‚Äù, which hinders their application in real life. </p><h2>  Economic types of study </h2><p>  In order to answer the question of what is methodology in the economic sector, it is necessary to consider each method of study separately.  As a rule, in science, methods (methods) are distinguished that arise in comparison with the natural sciences, namely: </p><p>  - the method of differentiation and separation of the economy as a separate science; </p><p>  - a method for determining the scientific field in terms of existing methods; </p><p>  - a method of <span>fundamental research of the</span> principles of economic theories; </p><p>  - a <span>method of logical</span> understanding of economic phenomena for their further foresight; </p><p>  - a method for developing theoretical knowledge using empirical and philosophical approaches; </p><p>  - mathematical method; </p><p>  - a way of correlation and comparison of economic phenomena; </p><p>  - A historical method for studying the formation and emergence of the economy as a whole. </p><p>  Also, the methodology of the economic system contains a number of specially scientific methods used exclusively in the economy.  For example, through economic modeling, any economic phenomenon can be fairly simplified and abstract in order to highlight its main aspects.  Functional analysis, in turn, will help to see the real effectiveness of the properties of a particular scientific aspect.  In economic modeling, graphs and charts are actively used.  With their help, you can see the dynamics of an economic phenomenon in a certain period of time or in another environment that is of scientific interest. </p><p>  The most risky, but at the same time effective method is an economic experiment.  It helps to see the real effect of the economic phenomenon, but it is almost impossible to predict the results.  Thus, an economic experiment is a rather dangerous method of studying science. </p><h2>  The subject of knowledge in sociology </h2><p>  If throughout the article methods and methods of studying and practical application of knowledge in specific fields were considered, then sociological science is ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù in that it develops for the most part theoretical knowledge.  Social methodology, or rather, the totality of methods in a given industry, directly depends on the subject of its study.  According to many scientists, sociology is the science of society and the processes that arise in it.  This definition shows the <span>subject of science,</span> which is actually the object of the action of its methods. </p><p>  It follows that the methodology and <span>research methods of</span> social science have developed as a result of its close relationship with cultural studies, psychology, anthropology and other humanitarian disciplines.  Thus, the subject is an important aspect that predetermined the emergence of a whole array of ways to obtain fundamental knowledge of this industry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="method and methodology" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/938206.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sociological methods </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the basis of sociological methodology are <span>empirical methods</span> .  That is, those with which theoretical knowledge is developed.  Using sociological methods, theoretical and quantitative concepts are derived.  Each of these species appears due to the use of individual study methods.  We can distinguish a number of the most standard, or rather, popular methods of study used today: </p><p>  1. <em>Observation</em> is the most classical method encountered in a large number of sciences.  With it, you can capture information through visualization.  There are many ways to observe, depending on the awareness of the object, the purpose of the method, the perspective of studying a social group, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="concept of methodology" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/938201.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  2. As for the <em>experiment</em> , here the information is obtained by introducing some indicator into a certain environment in order to further monitor the process of its change.  Today, an experiment is one of the most effective methods of cognition in any existing science. </p><p>  3. Many social phenomena become clear after conducting a <em>survey of a</em> single social group.  This procedure can be performed both orally and in writing.  Today, the survey is one of the most effective ways in the science of sociology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="economic methodology" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/938200.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  4. The <em>analysis of documents</em> is a whole set of methods, which includes the study of the press, paintings, print, media, etc. Thus, the analysis methodology has its own system, and also allows you to derive certain sociological patterns based on trends that prevail in society within a certain time frame. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, in the article, the author tried to answer the question of what is methodology.  Various variations of this concept were presented in the context of different branches of science.  It should be noted that the development of methodology as a separate additional knowledge will affect the evolution of methods for obtaining practical and theoretical concepts in all the sciences that exist today. </p>
