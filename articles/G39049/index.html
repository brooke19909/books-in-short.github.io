This place is considered damned from the very beginning of time, therefore no one has ever lived here, built beautiful castles and churches, equipped beaches along the picturesque sea bay.  The Italians call this place the "gates of hell", "the valley of ghosts", and all because these lands are covered with human bones, which have been resting here since the time of the Romans. </p>

Since most of the lands belonged to the Roman Empire, all laws came from the emperor.  And now, from all cities and provinces, sick people began to be exiled to the island of Poveglia, so that they would not infect the rest.  After the suicide bombers finished their earthly journey, their bodies were burned, forming giant <span>mass graves.</span>

    <p>  In the Middle Ages in Italy, the epidemic of the <span>bubonic plague</span> again began <span>,</span> but this time the island of Poveglia became a real torture chamber for the sick.  They were not allowed to calmly wait for their time - many were burned alive here and did not even bother to bury.  After the disease subsided, this place was covered with ash and was forgotten for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, a psychiatric hospital was opened on the island, and a bell tower was attached to it.  Since then, all the patients who fell into its walls have sworn that they hear endless screams, see ghosts, and feel irresistible fear.  Soon paranormal events became apparent to doctors, which led to the popularity of such an operation as lobotomy.  However, in these parts it was made using a drill, hammer and other improvised tools.  Again, the island of Poveglia became a torture chamber for people who, for one reason or another, fell out of normal society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="poveglia island italy" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/279618.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Soon, after one of the doctors, who himself saw a ghost, when he did a lobotomy for his patient, died, falling from the bell tower, the hospital was closed.  The island has remained empty, but modern lovers of mysticism, psychics and adventurers set foot on its land. </p><p>  If you decide to go to the island of Poveglia, the path will begin with a boat trip.  After landing right on the shore, you will see the very bell tower with which the doctor fell.  Next to it in the ashen hills you can see the ruins of the church, built here in the 12th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="poveglia island photo" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/279616.jpg" width="425"></div>  On one of the coasts of the island is a defensive fortress, which is here called the "octagon."  Not far from it is a two-story building of the hospital, which is not distinguished by outstanding architecture.  Nearby are houses that are in a dilapidated state and are gradually overgrown with ivy.  Most likely, doctors who worked in a madhouse lived in them.

    <p>  The island of Poveglia scares with its darkness, ash and the burning smell of burning of all tourists and residents of the country.  Italy recently sold these lands to a private owner, but he could not make them picturesque and attractive for tourists, despite the natural landscape.  Everyone is afraid to spend the night here, because there are legends of screams and groans, which are published by the plague-infected martyrs.  If you ask the Venetians, they will not tell you anything about the island of Poveglia.  Photos and videos of people who have been here may be the only reliable source of information about what is happening on these mysterious lands. </p>
