    <h2>  A bit of history: Mayan time </h2><p>  The Island of Women in Mexico was discovered by a Spanish expedition <span>on March 4,</span> 1517.  Francisco Hernandos Cordoba, who headed it, found there many idols made in honor of Ixelles, whose sanctuary was on the island of Mujares.  For Mayan peoples, this goddess was one of the main until the post-classical period.  They considered her the patroness of childbirth, medicine, tissue and fertility.  Most often presented as a toothless old woman.  However, in the ruins of Nanj Tunic in Guatemala, archaeologists found her image in the form of a young woman. </p><p>  On the southern side of the island of Isla Mujares, there used to be several observatories that served as a Mayan lighthouse, which traveled along the coast of the Caribbean Sea, and also mined salt in special lagoons.  Unfortunately, over the years they have collapsed.  If you come to the island now, you can see their remains, and in 10-20 years the sea will finally swallow them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Pirates and their buried treasures </h2><p>  For 300 years after the discovery of the Spaniards, the island of Isla Mujeres remained uninhabited.  Because of this, such legendary pirates as Henry Morgan, Diego el Mulato, Lorencillo, Pata de Palo and Jean Lafite have been hiding on it over the years.  On the island you can still hear stories about their travels, treasures and valuables hidden under the white sands, as well as the ghostly phenomena of sea robbers and their slaves. </p><p>  Some legends say that captain Jean Lafite at the end of his life made Isla Mujeres his base.  There are many different opinions on how and when he died and where his body is.  Many say that he was killed during a mess with the Spaniards during his trip to the Caribbean.  But <span data-width="">Jack C. Ramsay Jr.</span>  , his biographer, in his book Jean Lafitte: Prince of Pirates, wrote that he died in 1826 from dengue fever on the island of Isla Mujeres in Mexico, and was buried here. </p><h2>  The sad story of captain Mundak </h2><p>  Another legend tells the sad love story of Fermin Mundak, who arrived on the island in 1825 along with looted goods.  Almost immediately, he began to build a large estate here called Vista Alegre.  As a result, it occupied more than 40% of the entire island and included the Windrose garden, a vegetable garden, pens for cattle and poultry, plantations with exotic plants brought from all over the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Once Fernando saw Martinian Gomez Pantoia - a beautiful brunette girl with a willow camp, white face and green eyes, 37 years younger than him.  Falling in love with her, he did everything possible to please.  But alas, all his expectations did not materialize.  The girl married her peer.  As they say, after this Fermin gradually went crazy and died alone in Merida.  His empty tomb is still waiting for him in the cemetery of Isla Mujeres.  It depicts a skull and bones and carved the words: ‚ÄúLike you, I was.  Like me, you will be. ‚Äù </p>

    <h2>  Today </h2><p>  After Mexico gained independence in 1821, the small fishing village on the Island of Women (Isla Mujeres) began to gradually grow and develop.  He began to take tourists in the 1850s.  Since there was still no modern technology at that time, people from the mainland were brought to the island by the sons of local fishermen in their small boats.  During World War II, a military base was located on Isla, after which it was removed from here. </p><p>  In 1970, the development of Cancun began.  While he was growing up, sandy streets were laid on the island of Isla Mujeres, water was filtered and a telephone connection was established.  Tourism here flourished due to the beloved by many inhabitants of the island of Ramon Bravo, who was a diver, cinema and colleague Jacques Cousteau.  This man is widely known for his work on preserving marine life and the habits of sharks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The people of Isla Mujeres are proud of their history and hope for a promising future.  They are very friendly, open to communication and helping others.  Even the two most powerful Atlantic hurricanes that took place in 2005 did not force them to ‚Äúclose the doors‚Äù to tourists.  The island and its inhabitants are today happy to welcome visitors from all over the world. </p>

    <h2>  What can be done on the island? </h2><p>  The Island of Women in Mexico is more laid-back and calm than Cancun, but this does not mean that there is nothing to do here.  You can go diving, go shopping, eat fresh seafood at a local restaurant, play golf or explore all corners of this wonderful place by cycling through it and enjoy a massage in the salon.  However, relaxing on the beach of the Island of Women in itself will also be magnificent. </p><p>  If a measured rest is not for you, be prepared to take a day trip to the Contoy National Reserve, swim with dolphins, whale sharks or sailing ships, go to the underwater sculpture museum or discover the Mayan civilization in Tulum, Chichen Itza, Kobe or El Mecco.  So you will definitely not have to miss the island. </p>

    <h2>  Water recreation </h2><p>  Women Island in Mexico is one of the most interesting places for lovers of water sports and divers.  There are a lot of different beaches, the most popular of them are located in the north and west.  Calm turquoise waters, soft white sand and wonderful sea views make them ideal for sunbathing, swimming and snorkeling.  But the eastern beaches of the Island of Women are very dangerous for such procedures because of the strong currents of the Caribbean Sea.  Swimming there is strictly prohibited. </p><p>  Most underwater tours start in El Farito.  Here, at a depth of about 2 meters, you can see many tropical fish and beautiful corals, as well as a small statue of the Virgin Mary, which was found and placed here by local fishermen, who were once shipwrecked and survived, according to them, only thanks to their faith in higher powers. </p><p>  From this place, tours continue to the Sac-Bajo River or the Musa Underwater Sculpture Museum, which deserves special attention.  It was founded by artist Jason de Caires Taylor, who is currently the leader of this place.  Consists of 12 galleries that contain about 1364 artificial "houses" for underwater inhabitants.  The sculptures located in it are submerged to various depths throughout the national park and are clearly visible both during surface and underwater swimming. </p><p>  For advanced divers the possibility of drifting and night diving, as well as descent under water next to the sunken ships.  Both beginners and novice bathers can enjoy the use of water procedures along with dolphins (in Dolphin Discovery, the cost is from $ 30) or whale sharks (only from June to mid-September, the price is from $ 125). </p>

    <p>  At the end of the walk you can go to the Capit√°n Dulch√© Maritime Museum, which contains old photographs of the family of Captain Ernesto Dulce, the founder of the 5th naval region on the island of Isla Mujeres in 1930, and his belongings.  There is also an impressive collection of model ships, including a copy of Calypso by Jacques Cousteau.  There are also 2 rooms in which a video is shown featuring this captain and Ramon Bravo.  The exhibition is completed by marine artifacts and historical documents. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about holidays on the Island of Women in Mexico indicate that it is really very interesting here.  You can see various sights, touch history, imagine how pirates roam the coast in ancient times, swim in boats or plunge into the underwater world in the literal sense of the word.  There is where to stay.  It offers youth hostels, 5-star hotels, luxury rental houses, beach houses and so on. </p><h2>  Be careful! </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the streets of Isla Mujeres are quite narrow and are often crowded with mopeds, golf carts and taxis, taking happy visitors to rest on the Island of Women (Mexico), i.e., to the stopping place (hotel).  Keep this in mind when exploring the city.  Do not allow children under 18 years of age and those who have drunk to ride a golf carriage or a moped.  Remember safety! </p>
