Artists, for example, learn to hold a pencil correctly, make sketches, learn anatomy, structure, graphics, and only then begin to paint in watercolor or oil.  So lovers of photography: in order to become a professional in such an unfamiliar profession, you need to learn different tips for a novice photographer, adjusting them for yourself.  Believe me, as soon as you listen to them and begin to apply in life, the level of your skill will instantly increase!  So, what do you need to know and do when embarking on such a wonderful craft as photography?  In this article, we will cover 10 tips for beginner photographers. </p><h2>  Why do we need training and more practice? </h2><p>  One of the first tips for a novice photographer with a reflex camera is the mandatory preparation for shooting and the maximum amount of practice.  Before preparing for shooting, decide on what you like best in photography - this is what you will use when choosing devices.  Explore each genre of photography, noting for yourself the pros and cons of each, from the landscape and reportage frames to portraits and artistic filming.  Preparation involves not only the theoretical part, but also the acquisition of the necessary devices.  For example, for portraits you will need lighting and a flash, for landscapes - a good tripod, for reporting - a sensitive lens with a zoom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tips for a novice photographer SLR camera" class="if uuid-2316215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64040/2316215.jpg"></div><p>  Once you have decided on the subject of work, proceed to the practical part.  Do not forget that at any time you can ‚Äúretrain‚Äù in another style of photography, but it is absolutely undesirable to do this at the first failures.  In photography, the quality and recognition of the photographer through the pictures often comes only with experience.  To do this, shoot as much as possible and more often.  Try to take pictures in your free time, taking as many frames as possible, experimenting with frames, lighting, rooms, models.  Do not be afraid to make mistakes, re-read the tips for a novice photographer, and soon you will notice your progress in photographs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A tripod for the photographer to help and do I need to copy? </h2><p>  Tips for beginning photographers from a professional very often begin with this: buy a tripod and learn how to use it.  This device will help you not only avoid the horizon in photos, but also blurry frames, the effect of trembling hands and many other troubles.  It is often difficult for novice photographers to cope with themselves in preparation for the first shooting with the participation of models, and even here a tripod will help to cope with the psychological moments!  While you will establish, adjust, move it, you will have time to think over the camera angles, composition and even the <span>pose of the model.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 Tips for Beginner Photographers" class="if uuid-2316220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64040/2316220.jpg"></div><p>  What about copying?  If you want to learn how to make beautiful high-quality pictures, do not be afraid to consider the work of eminent photographers.  Choose the photos you like and try to recreate them.  Disassemble and analyze the differences between the copy and the original.  Copying is a mandatory part of training, because only using the experience of masters, you can understand your style and create a new one.  But do not go in cycles in copying, create! </p><h2>  Analyze and print! </h2><p>  After each shot, take a look at the basic tips for a beginner photographer, and then sit down to analyze the footage.  Examine your mistakes, think about how you can fix them, and try to take into account each remark.  For example, after receiving a lighted photograph, think about whether it was necessary to use the flash in such shooting conditions? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Be sure to transfer your best shots to paper.  So you will appreciate your work by decorating the walls with photographs and showing pictures to guests.  Do not hide your creations, they really deserve to be seen by as many people as possible! </p><h2>  More is better, and why do you need criticism? </h2><p>  As soon as you decide to decorate the walls with your photographic works, try to print them on A4 sheet format.  So you can see the depth of the photo, evaluate every detail.  At the same time, make sure that the quality of the image for printing is high: perform processing using graphic editors, monitor the size of the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tips for beginner photographers from a professional" class="if uuid-2316232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64040/2316232.jpg"></div><p>  In no case do not be afraid of criticism!  But do not expect adequate comments from your relatives and friends, as well as professional photographers.  Believe me, they judge objectively, because the former are afraid to offend you, and the latter will probably not answer anything ‚Äúfor a start‚Äù.  In order to get objective criticism, show your photos to people who are with you on the same wavelength and level, or slightly higher. </p><h2>  Buy if necessary and participate in exhibitions </h2><p>  Do not rush to buy everything at once in order to just learn to take pictures.  The technique has the ability to become obsolete, and your desire to be a famous photographer can be fleeting.  The best advice for a beginner photographer is to buy only when you realize that without this purchase you will not be able to realize your idea and do not pursue fashion.  With only a SLR, a tripod and a couple of additional lenses in your arsenal, you can quite compete with the same novice photographers like you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tips for a beginner photographer" class="if uuid-2316260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64040/2316260.jpg"></div><p>  Take part in photo dryers, exhibitions, consider criticism, take praise.  And do not lose the opportunity to hone your photography skill in a new setting.  If there are no such exhibitions, organize your own!  Contact your favorite cafe, photo printing point, museum with a request to post several of your works indicating authorship and contacts.  Call your friends and rely on word of mouth - and soon they will recognize you. </p>
