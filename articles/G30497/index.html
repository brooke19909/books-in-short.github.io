Such a product was indispensable for a person of any status and condition. </p><p>  Rich noblewomen covered their mittens with beads, embroidered patterns and fur lapels on top of a knitted product, which was often dyed in brighter colors with natural dyes.  And various maids and serfs were content with the classic version, which, although it was simple, it perfectly heated frozen fingers. </p><h2>  Fashionable today </h2><p>  Currently, mittens are not going to give up their positions.

So, you should choose threads with a high content of wool of sheep, goats or merino.  In addition, angora, cashmere, rayon and nylon can be included in the composition, which will provide your mittens with tensility and softness.  In total, about 200 meters of yarn will be needed.

Their thickness directly depends on the yarn you choose. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You will also need: </p><ul><li>  Various knitting things, like a marker or an automatic row counter. </li><li>  Beads or half beads for further decoration. </li></ul><p>  And finally, how to knit mittens, if you do not even know where to start?

    <ol><li>  First, we knit the left mittens: for this we collect 42 loops and evenly distribute over several knitting needles.  Now you need to mark the beginning of the row with the so-called "marker" and connect all the loops into a ring. </li><li>  We knit the first circle and, reaching the marker, shift it to the right knitting needle.  Then we knit the second row with facial loops, after which we repeat the action 4 times using a garter stitch. </li><li>  Next - it's time to make mittens cuffs: with them, their use becomes easier.  To do this, we knit about 5 centimeters according to the scheme given below.  After the cuffs are ready, you need to knit four more rows of garter stitch. </li><li>  Now we add one loop so that there are 43 on the knitting needles, and we knit according to the scheme given in the description to the 18th row.  When the required number of rows is ready, we make the 18th row, 11 loops from which you need to knit with an unnecessary thread of bright color. </li><li>  After the loops of a different color were on the right needle, remove them and move them back to the left.  We knit the first 2 loops together with the front stitch already with the working thread, the next 7 also, and the last 2 are again connected together with the front loop.  As a result, we got 9 loops that are responsible for the finger. </li><li>  Now you can forget about all the difficulties and continue to knit the product to the end of the pattern, performing all the details and patterns. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mittens princess with a description" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/1987332.jpg" width="489"></div></li><li>  When the entire base of the mitten is connected, the remaining half of the loops are removed on an unnecessary thread and fixed on the back of the product.  The same thing is repeated with the second remaining group.  Unfixed front loops are sewn with a stitch ‚Äúfrom loop to loop‚Äù. </li><li>  Having turned out the mittens, we hide all unnecessary threads, carefully tied them. </li><li>  Now is the time to make a finger for the Princess mittens, the description of which we are gradually finishing the product.  To do this, remove unnecessary thread from the mitten and distribute all the loops into 3 knitting needles.  We knit a finger according to the scheme presented above. </li></ol><h2>  Finishing touches </h2><p>  The mitt is completely ready to add decor elements.  To do this, we will take a transparent thread and fix it with the help of beads in certain places of the product. </p><p>  That's all, now it remains to repeat all the steps in the manufacturing process of the second Princess mittens, the description of which we have already familiarized with earlier.  Keep your hands warm and stylish with homemade accessories for the cold winter! </p>
