At the word "Paris" it could be the Eiffel Tower.  London is the Tower or <span>Buckingham Palace,</span> and Hurghada is the sea, corals, the sun, a great mood and a cozy hotel. </p><p>  The well-known Coral beach Hurghada 4 is the hotel with the most stunning <span>coral reef</span> in the area.  It combines excellent service and pristine nature, surrounded by the hotel's park area, like a precious frame. </p><h2>  Hurghada </h2><p>  Being still in the middle of the 20th century a simple fishing village, Hurghada began to gradually transform into a world-class resort.  As the ‚Äúdemand‚Äù for local attractions grew - the Red Sea with its coral reefs, a pleasant climate, and ancient monuments - hotels grew along the seashore. </p><p>  The most attractive for tourists from all over the world is the climate of Hurghada.  The coldest month of the year - February - is suitable for those who love warmth.  The water temperature at this time does not fall below +20, and air - not higher than +25 degrees. </p><p>  The best time to relax are the months from April to July and from September to the end of November.  The air temperature in these months is on average +35, and water - +28 degrees.  Suitable for those who like to bathe in "fresh milk".  Since the air is dry, the heat is easier to carry in Hurghada than in resorts with a wetter climate. </p><p>  Today, there are more than 200 hotels in the city, and he obviously will not stop there.  Every year, new tourist areas open, including parks, pools, attractions, restaurants, bars and hotel buildings.  The city is constantly expanding, which gives tourists the prospect of an even greater choice of entertainment and quality of leisure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Especially popular are the "old" hotels, built at the beginning of the "boom" in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHurghada.  They have their own established traditions and a time-tested culture of customer service.  This also applies to <span>Coral beach Resort (Hurghada,</span> Egypt). </p><p>  The description will not convey the atmosphere of trust and goodwill that the hotel team created.  If you can provide all the necessary rooms and create the most comfortable living conditions, then the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù of the hotel doesn‚Äôt just arise.  It is created by an aura that is formed from the smiles of satisfied customers and the wonderful location of its employees to them. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The most important advantages when determining a vacation destination are the price of the tour, the location of the hotel and the amount of services and entertainment that it provides to its customers. </p><p>  Coral beach hotel Hurghada 4 is an ideal base for your vacation.  It is located 300 m from the Red Sea, 20 km from the city of Hurghada and 20 minutes.  from the airport. </p>

    <p>  The uniqueness of the hotel's location is that it is located just between 4 closed lagoons, which are not afraid of the winds blowing here constantly.  Due to this location in the lagoons there is no turbidity of the water, nor strong waves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If on other beaches it is difficult to swim due to waves, and the water is often muddy, then near the Coral beach hotel Hurghada 4 the color of the sea is invariably blue, and the surface is calm. </p><p>  It is convenient to get to the Old Town from the hotel for shopping, for which you can use a minibus, which takes guests 2 times a day to the shopping centers of Hurghada, or take a taxi and not depend on anyone.  When visiting the city, you should follow the "safety rules" for your pockets, as local thieves love careless tourists. </p><p>  The hotel itself, consisting of a main building with a reception desk and separate bungalows, is conveniently located in a park area. </p><h2>  Hotel Green Zone </h2><p>  Resorts around the city of Hurghada literally step on the desert.  For the Egyptians, it is imperative that all hotels are "buried" in greenery, which clearly attracts tourists. </p><p>  Description of the hotel Coral beach hotel Hurghada 4 (Egypt, Hurghada) should begin with the surrounding park area. </p><p>  Looking at the park, you immediately realize that its design was taken seriously.  Each bush, flower garden and each palm in its place creates the general harmony of the green zone, divided into sections by paths. </p><p>  All paths are paved and comfortable for walking.  In the evening lanterns light up, and cozy benches dispose to rest and contemplation of the surrounding nature.  It is recommended to study park paths well in the daytime, as it is easy to get lost here at night. </p>

    <p>  Palms bear fruit, flower beds are in constant bloom, and the grass is in well-groomed condition, which indicates the quality work of both landscape designers and gardeners.  Areas with dead grass, if any, are cut out and fresh growth is laid in return. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Reviews of the Coral beach Hurghada 4 hotel (Hurghada) also note the extraordinary beauty of its beach, and for a certain part of tourists it is of real value. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  This hotel is the only one among the resorts of Egypt that provided part of the coast under a nudist beach.  This is a rarity, both for the resort business in general and for the Arab culture as a whole. </p><p>  The total length of the beach is also surprising - 1200 m, which, given the constant development of the coastline, is considered a real luxury.  To allocate part of the territory for nudists is a good commercial move, since there are many such people in the world, and there are not so many offers from leading resorts in the world. </p><p>  The first bold step in Egypt was made by the hotel "Coral Beach Rotana Resort" (Hurghada).  The hotel's beach for straights is called ‚ÄúCleopatra‚Äù, and ‚Äúexposure‚Äù is allowed there officially, so you can not be afraid to get a fine for indecent behavior in a strict Muslim country. </p><p>  Instead of umbrellas, the place is equipped with huts, the weaving of which closes the nudists from the views of people from the rest of the beach.  In each wicker compartment there are deck chairs with mattresses, protected from the scorching sun and wind by the walls. </p><p>  The place is popular for couples with children, and its most frequent guests are Italians, Germans, Americans, to a lesser extent Russians, perhaps because the beach is not ‚Äúuntwisted‚Äù by Russian travel agencies. </p>

    <p>  The rest of the beach is just as good - white sand, there are calls to the sea cleared from corals and a pier leading to the depths.  To the convenience of vacationers: </p><ul><li>  plank beds with mattresses; </li><li>  umbrellas </li><li>  towels, which can be obtained either at the hotel or taken on the spot; </li><li>  bars with refreshing and alcoholic drinks and snacks that allow you to "kill" the appetite before lunch or dinner. </li></ul><p>  The convenient location of Coral beach hotel Hurghada 4 in the immediate vicinity of the beach allows you to walk to a cool room and relax from the heat after bathing in just a few minutes. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The hotel, which opened its doors in 1990, was renovated in 2012 and offers its guests 244 rooms.  There are all conditions for a relaxing family vacation.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1,000,000 m <sup>2</sup> , one-story bungalows are located, which are separate cozy houses with an open veranda.  They do not touch each other in any way, therefore peace and quiet are guaranteed here.  For lovers of noisy parties and night walks <span>, Coral beach Resort 4</span> (Hurghada Egypt) is unlikely to be suitable. </p><p>  The reviews of all vacationers are united in that it is a quiet family hotel for those who like to relax in an atmosphere of harmony with themselves and nature. </p>

    <p>  The bungalows are 4 blocks, each of which has its own remoteness from the sea.  In the immediate vicinity is the 1st block, but even from it the sea is difficult to see due to the wide strip of the beach, which is about 200 meters.  Near each bungalow there is a flower garden, which is pleasant to behold, sitting in wicker chairs near a glass table on the veranda.  The rooms are categorized: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù - 226 rooms (35 m <sup>2</sup> , 3 + 1); </li><li>  ‚ÄúClassic Suite‚Äù - 6 rooms (40 m <sup>2</sup> , living room, closable bedroom, 2 verandas); </li><li>  "Classic" with sea view - 8; </li><li>  "Ambassadorial Suite" - 2 rooms (living room with 2 bedrooms, kitchenette, 3 terraces, 2 bathrooms and a shower); </li><li>  Royal Suite - 2 (living room with 3 bedrooms, kitchenette, 4 terraces, 3 bathrooms and 1 shower). </li></ul><p>  Coral beach hotel Hurghada 4 (Hurghada) in each "Classic" room provides guests with: </p><ul><li>  1 or 2 beds (on the 1st can easily fit two adults); </li><li>  sofa; </li><li>  linen closet; </li><li>  safe; </li><li>  coffee table; </li><li>  2 armchairs and 2 bedside tables; </li><li>  2 mirrors on the wall; </li><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  mini-bar (paid); </li><li>  bathroom and toilet; </li><li>  hair dryer; </li><li>  floor lamp and table lamp. </li></ul><p>  Each room is constantly replenished with stocks of liquid soap, shampoo and shower gel.  Towels and cleaning are changed daily, and linen is changed every 3 days.  A paved path leads to the sea from the bungalow, passing through the green area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCoral beach hotel Hurghada 4. </p><p>  The price of the tour depends on the number of days and the selected category, and averages from $ 700 per person (8 days, all inclusive).  For such affordable prices with this level of accommodation and a large developed infrastructure, customers love this hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The green zone of the hotel is simply huge and accommodates both food facilities, entertainment, and services.

    <p>  Coral beach <span>Hurghada hotel 4 (Hurghada)</span> provides a transfer to Hurghada to its customers by appointment at the reception.  Since there are only 11 seats in a fixed-route taxi and it only goes 2 times a day (leaving at 12.30 and 19.30), it is better to think over a ‚Äúsortie‚Äù to the city in advance.  They don‚Äôt give much time for purchases, only 2.5 hours, taking into account travel. </p><p>  There is a taxi call service so as not to depend on the minibus and bargain with local sellers to the fullest.  Bidding in Egypt is appropriate and compulsory, otherwise the seller will be offended.  It is important to conduct "negotiations" politely, but with persistent obstinacy, which allows you to bring down the price by 2-3 times, and sometimes more. </p><p>  The hotel is suitable for combining leisure and work, as it provides a conference room with the necessary equipment.  For business people, the press for trousers and ironing of clothes (paid) will not be out of place. </p><p>  Since the hotel is more family-friendly, there are always many small guests who are provided with free accommodation up to 12 years without an extra bed.  A separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãentertainment for children of different ages was created by Coral beach hotel Hurghada 4. </p><p>  The reviews of couples vacationing here with children are only positive, both for the work of the staff and for the events held at the hotel for small spectators. </p><h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  In Egypt, they treat children of any nationality very well.  This is noticeable not only in such trifles as figures from towels, but also in the work of animators, cooks and all the attendants. </p><p>  At the disposal of children here: </p><ul><li>  The restaurants have children's corners with appropriate furniture, where they eat on their own.  Tables and chairs are brightly colored, which makes the kids happy, and the fact that they are separate from their parents makes them feel independent. </li><li>  Upon request, a baby bed will be brought to the room, which is provided free of charge. </li><li>  The children's pool is unheated, so when choosing a tour in winter, you should consider this.  The water in it is quite warm, since it manages to warm up in the sun during the day, but it is better not to let the smallest children splash around in the early morning.  For children, a small area is provided in the adult heated pool. </li><li>  Coral beach Resort Hurghada (Egypt hotel) has its own mini zoo, which allows you to not only get to know the animals and touch them, but you can even ride some.  Goats with goats, ponies, geese and other animals live in the zoo. </li><li>  Equipped playground allows you to "free" from excess energy and have fun playing with new friends. </li><li>  A kids club with animators who come up with new contests and games every day is a favorite meeting place for kids. </li></ul><p>  Every night, children spend discos, and during the day they are entertained by professional animators.  Games in the pool and on the beach, drawing competitions and sports - this is not all that awaits young customers at this hotel. </p><p>  Coral beach hotel Hurghada 4 prepared no less entertainment for active and sports people. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  The climate and nature of Egypt are conducive to sports or, at least, an active life on the shore, on and below the water.  There is rarely bad weather here, therefore, vacationers have at their disposal classes both indoors and outdoors.  Everyone can visit: </p><ul><li>  A gym where aerobics and fitness training is conducted under the guidance of a trainer. </li><li>  Water and aerobics classes in the pool are enjoyed by both women and men. </li><li>  Beach volleyball is one of the ways to combine sport with the ability to imperceptibly sunbathe. </li><li>  Futsal for those who can not live without football. </li><li>  Darts and table tennis. </li><li>  Table football in a special game room is available for 30 minutes.  play for free upon presentation of the coupon received at the reception.  After this time, the game is paid, although inexpensive. </li><li>  3 courts, one of which with lighting (you have to pay for the light). </li><li>  Billiards (for a fee). </li><li>  Camel riding for extreme sports enthusiasts (paid service). </li><li>  Riding horses for customers of all ages. </li></ul><p>  Hurghada Coral beach hotel (Hurghada, Egypt) is famous for its outdoor activities.  All divers in the world know that the Red Sea not only has amazingly beautiful reefs, but is also the safest for beginner divers. </p><p>  The hotel‚Äôs school of divers employs professionals who will reveal the ‚Äúchips‚Äù necessary for diving, learn the sign language under water and take them on a yacht to the most beautiful reef thickets, where they can make the first real ‚Äútrip‚Äù to the depths. </p><p>  In addition to diving, windsurfing awaits water lovers.  You can also rent a boat, yacht or catamaran for several hours. </p>

It is enough to have a mask and flippers to get an unforgettable impression of its beauty.
