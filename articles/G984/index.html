Autumn in Japan shines with hundreds of flowers, and millions of Japanese are keen to make their way to the other end of the country to enjoy beautiful views. </p><p>  Yellow, orange, red, brown ... In fact, saffron, gold, cinnamon, copper, brown tea, orange, honey and dozens of shades of these colors are present in Japanese autumn colors. </p><h2>  Autumn in Japan </h2><p>  Japan, which is usually associated with a giant metropolis and modernity, is also a country of unique nature.  More than 70% of the surface of Japan is mountainous and overgrown with forests.  <span>Hokkaido Island</span> and the central hills of Honshu are dominated by conifers, pines, firs and cypresses.  But even their dark green color mixes with all the purple flowers of Japanese red maples in the fall, as well as beech, oak and birch trees.  Nature has very generously awarded Japan.  Red <span>maples in the fall</span> and its other treasures are admirable: high mountains, glacial valleys, fast flowing clean rivers with numerous waterfalls and caves, hot springs and beautiful beaches. </p><h2>  Weather in Japan in the fall </h2><p>  Hot summer is replaced by autumn (September - November) with fresh wind and pleasant air temperature (18 ¬∞ C).  Forests are covered with colored leaves, and chrysanthemums bloom in parks and gardens.  Early autumn (September) is the main typhoon season, which usually lasts more than one day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At this time, the sun almost always shines, encouraging long trips along the colorful hills.  To see the real "autumn explosion", it is best to visit the country Land of the Rising Sun in November. </p>

    <p>  Autumn in Japan is a very good time to visit historical sites, national holidays and natural landscapes. </p><h2>  Mount Fuji in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãautumn leaves </h2><p>  Lake Kawaguchi, Yamanashi Prefecture, is one of the famous five great lakes surrounding Mount Fuji.  During November, the shores of the lake are covered with red and gold leaves.  At this time, the festival of folk autumn "Fuji Kawaguchiko" is held here.  A place worth visiting is the 150-meter ‚Äútunnel‚Äù extending along the northern shore of the lake. </p>

    <p>  About 2 thousand people take part in it, which takes about five hours, and the column extends for about 2 km.  Participants often carry historical weapons and other items of the ancient era. </p><h2>  "Bridge to the moon" </h2><p>  Kyoto is the most visited city, especially tourists try to get there in the fall.  After all, it is famous for its beautiful views.  The Arashiyama area attracts many guests who want to enjoy close contact with nature. </p><p>  The famous Togetsu-kyo bridge (155 meters) connects the banks of the Oikawa River.  Its name means "the bridge that passes by the moon."  It was given by the emperor Kameyama.  He noticed that at night the moon moving across the sky seemed to pass through a bridge.  The view of the calm flowing river and the yellow and red leaves in the background create a breathtaking view. </p><h2>  Autumn landscapes and calming hot springs of the Yokoya Valley </h2><p>  Yokoya Valley is located in Nagano Prefecture.  Here you can take a walk while admiring the beautiful scenery.  By the end of October, bright red leaves on trees prevail in the valley, giving it the status of one of the most popular autumn walks in eastern Japan. </p>

    <p>  Along the route you can see four waterfalls, and then continue the journey towards the mountains.  After a walk, you should swim in the hot springs. </p><h2>  Castle in the clouds of Etizen Ono </h2><p>  The castle is located in the center of Ono, in Fukui Prefecture.  According to legend, it was built by order of Kanamori Nagachaika from 30,000 stones donated by Oda Nobunaga.  Construction lasted 5 years.  In 1775 the castle was burned, and now you can admire it in its restored form in 1968.  Surrounded by mountains and located at an altitude of more than 249 meters above sea level, Etizen Castle has attracted attention, and in recent years has become known as the "castle among the clouds."  The best views open in October and November. </p><h2>  Suspension bridge over the emerald lake in the Sumata-kyo Valley </h2><p>  The Sumata-Kyo Valley, located in the central part of Shizuoka Prefecture, is famous for its picturesque Oigawa and Sumatagawa rivers.  At the confluence of two rivers above an artificial lake is the "suspension bridge of dreams."  According to rumors, love confessions made on the bridge always find the answer.  Due to the beautiful contrast of red maple leaves in autumn in Japan and the emerald water of the lake, this place is very popular for autumn walks. </p><h2>  Japanese seasonal delicacies </h2><p>  The Japanese are known for their love of seasonal products, and therefore many fruits, vegetables or fish have become symbols of a particular season.  In autumn, it is primarily the fruits of persimmons (Shonai khaki).  In addition, during this period, traveling in Japan, it is worth trying apples, Japanese nihonnashi pears and tangerines. </p><p>  Japanese autumn is primarily associated with the "new rice" - fresh rice.  Rice grown this year is considered more white, tender and softer than last year‚Äôs ‚Äúold‚Äù. </p><p>  In autumn, it is worth trying grilled saury (Cololabis saira), a type of carnivorous marine fish of the Scomberesocidae family called the Japanese summa, grilled with soy sauce.  This is one of the dishes without which there is no autumn in Japan. </p><h2>  A carpet of red lilies in Kinchakud </h2><p>  Kinchakuda Park is located in the western part of the city of Hidaka (Saitama Prefecture), surrounded by the Coma River.  Every year from September to October, the riverbank is covered with a carpet of more than 5 million red spider lilies (licorice).  During the flowering season, the park hosts a lily festival, which attracts many tourists who come here to enjoy the plants. </p>

    <p>  Watching lilies under the calming streams of water is one of the reasons to visit the fall in Japan. </p><h2>  City go san </h2><p>  The holiday is celebrated on November 15, during which parents ask the deity to take care of their children.  It involves girls from three to seven years old, as well as three- and five-year-old boys.  Children dress in beautiful kimonos. </p><p>  The age of children is associated with ancient rites: </p><ul><li>  the children walked with shaved heads for up to three years ‚Äî only then they were allowed to grow their hair; </li><li>  five-year-old boys wore hakama for the first time; </li><li>  seven-year-old girls were allowed to change the narrow strap with which they tied a kimono into an adult traditional obi. </li></ul><p>  If you think of Japan only as a "country of sakura blossom", and there is no way to visit it in the spring, it is worth reviewing vacation plans.  Japan is also beautiful in the fall - from September to November.  This season is especially recommended for visiting the country and not only because of pleasant temperatures and generally good weather, but also for contemplating the beautiful atmosphere of colorful autumn maple leaves. </p>
