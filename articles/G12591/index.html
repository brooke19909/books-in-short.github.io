    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  If you want to get an objective picture, do not neglect the negative comments about the Sol Parque San Antonio 4 * hotel.  The reviews contain information about such shortcomings of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  disgusting quality of room cleaning - the floors do not wash, and the dust is not always wiped; </li><li>  old uncomfortable pillows with lumps (and due to the fact that they are feather, allergies can occur); </li><li>  Wireless Internet in the room practically does not catch; </li><li>  in the rooms and in all other rooms of the hotel there is a very old atmosphere, which has long been in need of repair; </li><li>  cramped rooms, when moving around which you will constantly beat your feet on furniture; </li><li>  Considering that the hotel has very few vacationers from the CIS countries, the staff practically does not understand Russian; </li><li>  <span>the TV shows poorly</span> (the image is very blurry, and the sound supply is constantly interrupted); </li><li>  during dinner, all drinks in the restaurant are available only at an additional cost (even ordinary drinking water); </li><li>  although the hotel is non-smoking, the smell of tobacco smoke is everywhere; </li><li>  even in cool weather, the pool does not turn on the heating; </li><li>  the rooms are not comfortable enough, which is associated with an ill-conceived interior. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotel Sol Parque San Antonio 4 * (Tenerife) makes a rather pleasant impression on travelers.  Its main advantage is a convenient location in a green park area.  Also worthy of attention is good nutrition and quality service.  If we talk about the shortcomings, then this is certainly an outdated situation, which is associated with the fact that the hotel has not had a major overhaul or redecoration for a long time. </p>
