    <h2>  Fresh air is also needed </h2><p>  Tired of closed spaces?  Then you should definitely visit the ‚ÄúArtifact‚Äù, ‚ÄúCarrera‚Äù and ‚ÄúVilla Embargo‚Äù.  The first club is divided into three zones, two of which are indoors, and one on the street.  It is popular among Rostovites of different ages.  And all thanks to the delicious and affordable cuisine and interesting cocktails. </p><p>  "Carrera" is a beach club that is located outside the city and begins its work in May, when the street is already getting warm.  It accommodates two and a half thousand visitors.  The main advantage is not location at all, but diversity: the organizers change the program daily.  For example, today the club has live music, tomorrow - a fire show.  And in the ‚ÄúCarrera‚Äù you can lie on the beach, exposing yourself to the sun.  At the disposal of visitors are also water sports, volleyball, tennis, catamarans and more. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best night clubs in rostov on the don list" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/1782470.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  A bit of erotica </h2><p>  Visiting a nightclub (Rostov-on-Don), the female sex prefers fun, and the male prefers striptease.  You can watch it in clubs called ‚ÄúOut Hall‚Äù (striptease and delicious dishes from the chef) and ‚ÄúCosmos‚Äù (immerses its visitors in the atmosphere of an unforgettable erotic dance).  Where to go - the choice is yours! </p><h2>  And finally </h2>

    <ol><li>  A club called "Baba Luba" - lively sound, delicious beer and an incendiary atmosphere. </li><li>  Bucharest is a bar of bad habits.  Based on the name - harmful alcohol, harmful food and no less harmful relationships. </li><li>  "Kalinka" - youth, fiery dances and delicious cocktails. </li></ol><p>  Nightclubs in <span>Rostov-on-Don</span> reviews have a complete contradiction.  But they should not be taken into account.  It is worth making a choice on your own and visiting places where the thickness of your wallet allows you to get there. </p><h2>  What to look for when choosing a vacation spot? </h2><p>  What institution should you choose?  When choosing a night club (Rostov-on-Don is simply crowded with such establishments), you should pay attention to: </p><ol><li>  Pricing policy (fortunately, on the official website of each of the above clubs you can find the full price list). </li><li>  Cocktail card (if the purpose of the visit is to treat yourself to delicious drinks). </li><li>  Cuisine (Russian, Ukrainian, Japanese, Italian). </li><li>  Hookah, karaoke, terrace, dance floor. </li></ol><p>  Have a great time! </p>
