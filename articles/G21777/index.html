Elements with hard-to-read patterns are not used.  But this does not stop him from being a very interesting accessory.  The peculiarity of bactus is that it is worn with pleasure both by the fair sex and children, and men.  It suits absolutely any style of clothing. </p><h2>  Bosnian knitting - what is it? </h2><p>  This knitting method is of Bosnian origin.  It is remarkable in that each even row is knitted with the help of connecting posts (they are also called blind).  The finished thing is very durable and flexible.  All knitters are able to perform such columns - as a rule, in this way close the rows in knitting in a circle.  Many craftswomen use Bosnian knitting, tying armholes or necks, or for cuffs.  The pattern on the finished panel is obtained due to the alternation of the front or rear working loops.  They work exclusively with the back thread both in the front and in the back row.  Often this method is taken as the basis for creating a belt, ribbons, collars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vplate.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bosnian Baktus crochet master class" class="if uuid-2609053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2609053.jpg"></div><p>  To create a crochet bactus by the Bosnian method, you do not need a lot of skill and skill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of Bactus </h2><p>  Some wardrobe items have strange names of foreign origin.  Bactus was no exception.  The birthplace of his creation is Norway, and he reached us from northern European countries. </p><p>  Simply put, a bactus is a triangular-shaped scarf that resembles a scarf.  Knit it with knitting needles and crochet.  Usually it is decorated with pompons, tassels, fringe and so on.  Such a thing will perfectly refresh and make your image unique.  Such a scarf is worn both in the cold season and in summer.  Just for winter bactus, take thick yarn, and in the heat, tie an openwork scarf made of cotton threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warm baby" class="if uuid-2608095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2608095.jpg"></div><p>  Products created using Bosnian knitting are valuable in that they keep their shape incredibly well without losing elasticity. </p><h2>  Crochet a traditional Bosnian baktus </h2><p>  First, recall how blind connecting posts fit.  Dial a chain of air loops.  Insert the hook into the loop that will be second from it.  Grab the thread and pull it through the loop on the hook.  Insert the hook into the adjacent loop and pull the thread in the same way.  So knit the entire row and make an air loop.  Everything is very simple. </p><p>  Modern bactus, of course, is far from original, but who said that the product should not be unique?  We will knit a product that is completely unlike an ancestor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For knitting traditional bactus, any, but not too soft threads are suitable that will help emphasize the relief pattern.  For a warm scarf, take thick yarn containing wool, and for a thin summer, use cotton or viscose threads. </p><p>  There are 4 basic rules of principle: </p><ol><li>  Work always starts from the corner, with a chain of three air loops.  In the first loop, 2 crochet posts are knitted. </li><li>  All odd rows end with a chain of air loops. </li><li>  All even rows are knitted with blind columns. </li><li>  In all rows, the thread is necessarily captured by the rear walls of the loops of the previous row. </li></ol><p>  Due to the use of dense yarn, a simple bactus pattern will be embossed and exotic. </p><p>  So, let's start crocheting Bosnian bactus.  The master class and scheme are given below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tvorlen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="classic bactus pattern" class="if uuid-2608161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2608161.jpg"></div><ol><li>  First row: a chain of 3 air loops, 2 double crochets in the outer loop and 3 lifting loops. </li><li>  <span>Second row: connecting posts.</span> </li><li>  <span>Knit the third and subsequent rows according to the scheme, not forgetting the extreme loop to create an even row.</span> </li><li>  <span>Knit the middle of the cloth in two rows with a double crochet without adding loops.</span> </li></ol><p>  Further knitting is similar to the first half.  We do not tie the rows to the edge, reducing the loops and not forgetting to compare both halves of the scarf. </p><p>  Having knitted 150 cm, knitting finish.  Tie the sides of the resulting triangle with single crochet and decorate with tassels or fringe from the remaining threads. </p><h2>  Elegant openwork bactus for a child </h2><p>  Creating crocheted Bosnian bactus fishnet using complex patterns is a very painstaking process.  But the resultant product is amazingly beautiful! </p><p>  We will take a simple pattern, even a beginner in knitting will be able to use it.  Our scarf has a size of 150 * 54 * 54. Take yarn with 50% acrylic content - two skeins should be enough.  Crochet number 2.5. </p><p>  How to crochet Bosnian bactus?  Description and diagrams will help you with this. </p><p>  The scarf begins with 1 air loop and fits in according to the pattern.  We add 12 times, adding 1 element in the fourth row.  At a distance of 55 cm from the beginning of knitting, 26 motifs will be obtained.  Tie it this way: 3 single crochet in an arch of air loops, 5 air loops, 1 half-column in an extreme single crochet.  Repeat several times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stranahandmade.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork bactus pattern" class="if uuid-2607796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2607796.jpg"></div><p>  So the Bosnian children's bactus is ready!  You can hook the fringe around the edge, or leave it as is - it all depends on your taste and imagination. </p>
