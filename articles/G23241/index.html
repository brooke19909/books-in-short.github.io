  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Documentation management - the basis for the successful operation of the enterprise</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A document is a very capacious concept.  It is used in numerous and diverse fields of activity of people, is the subject of study in many scientific disciplines.  Therefore, it is impossible to build an unambiguous definition of this concept.  The meaning and significance of the document depends on in which area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman activity it is used.  Indeed, in jurisprudence, with the help of a document, you can testify or prove something, in historical science this is a valuable <span>source of information</span> about past events, and in production and business properly organized documentation support of management is the key to success, because the document here is the main carrier of business information, with the help of which <span>management decisions</span> are recorded and transmitted <span>.</span>  It is very important to consider that, unlike newspapers, magazines, books that contain processed information, the document is its primary source, because it is here that it is recorded for the first time. </p><p>  Management Documentation Basics </p><p>  The scope of activities that provides document management and work with official documents at the enterprise is traditionally called office work.  This term appeared in Russia in the XVIII century.  Moreover, initially the word case denoted a lawsuit or an administrative issue decided by the authorities.  Accordingly, clerical work denoted activities related to the adoption of final decisions on these issues.  Later, they began to call documents collected in a certain sequence and according to certain rules.  About 10 years ago, clerical work was replaced by the term ‚Äúdocument management support‚Äù, which means the creation of documents, documentation, i.e.  recording information on paper or other media in accordance with certain rules and standards established by various regulatory acts and regulations, as well as organizing a document management system at an enterprise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can create documents using various documentation tools.  The simplest are pens and pencils, the more complex are a typewriter, tape recorder, video camera, photo equipment, etc.  Finally, nowadays computers are used everywhere for creating documents, which greatly simplifies and improves not only the documenting process, but the entire document management system.  <span>Computer technology</span> with its extensive capabilities is currently the main and universal source for creating and storing documents, the main <span>carrier of information.</span> </p><p>  Documentation support of management is also the creation of a complex multi-level document management system.  It can be compared with word formation.  Letters make up words, and words are parts of phrases and sentences, so documents make up the primary system, which is the basis of higher-level documentation systems.  Without such an integrated system of working with documents, from their creation, circulation, and ending with archiving and storage, the successful operation of the enterprise, production and business management are impossible.  We can say that competently and clearly organized documentation of management is a basic necessity for the work of any enterprise, which can exist only when the document management system operates correctly in it. </p><p>  Almost all employees of the institution face documents in their work.  Managers with their help receive the necessary information about the activities of subordinates, coordinate their work and eliminate the problems that arise.  Employees using documents record various information they need in their work.  Therefore, to know what documentation management is, to understand the <span>basics of office work is</span> necessary for every specialist. </p>
