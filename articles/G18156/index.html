  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew a bag with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No matter how many bags you have, they are constantly in short supply.  Either the color does not fit the dress, the texture is not at all the same, the size is required completely different.  Buying individual accessories for each outfit is quite expensive, but you want to look stylish.  What to do?  Solving this problem is very simple.  You need to sew a bag for each outfit yourself. </p><p>  You can use for this purpose any improvised material available in the house.  This can be a piece of fabric, pieces of leather, old jeans, faux or natural fur, sugar bags and even shafts from torn boots.  What material to use to sew the bag will depend on its purpose, your desire and handicraft skills. </p><p>  For shopping bags, burlap and dense fabric are more suitable, which can be decorated with applique or a bright print.  Winter handbags look great in fur and leather.  For a summer accessory, fabric or <span>finest leather is</span> more suitable <span>.</span>  You can complement the finished product with rhinestones, beautiful zippers, lace, rivets and buckles.  Any model you make, made by yourself, will be very individual.  Let's look at how to sew a bag yourself. </p><p>  Let's start with the simplest.  You can sew a banana bag of any size using various materials.  By making it big, you get a sporty option.  Using <span>denim</span> and choosing the average size, you get a youth version.  And by making such a <span>handbag small</span> and making it from satin or thin leather, you get an evening accessory. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We will consider the evening bag.  It is assembled from three main parts: two round sidewalls and a base in the form of a rectangle, the length of which corresponds to the diameter of the side parts.  First, cut out the template of the sides of the desired size.  Measure the diameter.  <span>We cut out the template of the</span> main part, the width of which is taken arbitrarily, according to your desire, and the length is equal to the diameter of the side parts with an addition of 2 centimeters for stitching the zipper. </p><p>  We need a piece of dense satin and lining <span>fabric, an applique of</span> rhinestones and a decorative lock.  Handles for a bag can be made of fabric or a decorative chain.  We cut out from the satin and lining fabric two round parts and one main part, adding one centimeter per seam on each side.  The length of the lock should match the width of our handbag. </p><p>  We take the main part from the pad and sew round parts on the sides.  We get a cylinder of fabric with an open entrance.  We sew decorative zipper into the main part from the atlas.  We sew the side parts to the resulting ‚Äúpipe‚Äù.  Now insert the stitched lining into the bag so that all the seams are inside.  We open the open slice for the zipper on the lining on both sides inward and pin it to the zipper with needles.  We lay a decorative stitch, connecting the satin handbag with a lining along the zipper, and remove the needles. </p><p>  Now you need to make a pen.  On this bag model, the handle can be either long or short.  We make two short ones.  We measure the necessary length of the handle.  We cut out two parts of the required length and width.  For greater density, you need to glue the cut strips with non-woven. </p><p>  We cut a strip of non-woven fabric, smaller in size than the handle part by one centimeter in all sections.  We lay out the blank of the handle with the wrong side up and put non-woven glue down on it.  We abundantly wet the parts from the spray gun and iron them.  Under the influence of steam, they stick together well.  Now we fold our billets in half, bend inward the seam allowances and iron.  We lay a decorative stitch along the entire length of the handle on both sides, connecting the edges. </p><p>  On the bag mark the location of the handles.  We put them on the marks, bend the ends inward and, after jokes with needles, we sew them well.  Sewing a bag is not enough.  It is required to decorate it.  To do this, we take the selected appliqu√© from rhinestones and stick it with an iron to the selected place.  This option patterns will quickly sew a bag of leather.  And the color of the selected material and various decorative details will make it a wonderful addition to your suit. </p>
