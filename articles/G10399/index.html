Goa is the blue dream of many, because it is here, under the sultry sun, on the ocean, that our winter dream comes to life.  However, not everyone has the opportunity to take a ticket to expensive business-class hotels.  But there is a way.  South Goa is the place for any category of travelers.  Moreover, regardless of the level of income, you can spend your vacation truly magically.  Today we will tell you about a small but very comfortable economy class hotel called Nanu Resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanu resort" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1069106.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  To begin with, this is a three star hotel.  For guests who are accustomed to luxury, it may be too modest, but in fact it is an excellent representative of its category.  Terrific territory, neat and well-groomed, comfortable hotel and clean rooms - what more could a tourist want, who will spend all day on excursions, and come back just to relax!  Meals at the Nanu Resort Hotel can be selected based on their vacation program.  It can be breakfast or <span>full board,</span> but if you plan to spend more time outside the hotel, then the first option is most convenient.  According to people who have already been to Goa, this is the best value for money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanu resort 3 india goa" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1069107.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located just a couple of minutes from the best beach in Betalbatim.  For an inexperienced tourist, this is not even a hotel, but a real paradise on earth.  It is surrounded by rainforest.  Only 7 km separates it from the commercial center of Goa, and 19 km from the international airport.  Nanu Resort is rightfully considered one of the best on the coast due to the highest quality of service, attentive staff and comfortable rooms. </p><h2>  Accommodation for tourists </h2><p>  As we already said, Nanu Resort 3 * is a cottage type hotel.  That is, on the territory you will find cozy two-story cottages (there are only 23 of them), as well as sixteen two-story villas.  In addition, there is another one-story building - administrative.  In total, 72 guests can relax here at the same time.  At the peak of the beach season, the hotel is never empty, so vouchers must be purchased in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanu resort 3" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1069108.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  Depending on how much you expect, you can choose different numbers.  All of them are exceptionally cozy, clean and comfortable.  From those who have already been to Nanu Resort, reviews about the rooms are extremely positive.  To this it is worth adding that, having rested here once, people come back again and again.  Standard rooms are equipped with air conditioning and TV, telephone and bathroom with shower.  And the best part is the huge terrace overlooking the road.  A refrigerator is also provided in the room upon request.  More expensive apartments contain the same set of furniture and amenities, but the view from the window makes the most capricious travelers delight.  Right under your windows is a wonderful garden that magically smells of freshness and flowers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The third category of rooms is on the second floor.  This is Super Deluxe, which overlooks the sea.  Each room is designed for two adults, plus there is the possibility of installing a cot.  However, it is necessary to discuss this in advance, at the time of issuing the permit.  The rooms have simple decor with a minimum of frills, but they are very cozy and comfortable.  This is made possible thanks to the beautiful wooden furniture and the warm colors of the interior. </p><h2>  Average cost of tours </h2><p>  Basically this is the choice of people who are looking for an economy class vacation, but at the same time they are sensitive to the quality of service and, most importantly, cleanliness in the hotel.  Reviews of tourists every year confirm that such requests are better than other hotels by Nanu Resort 3 *.  The cost of a trip for two adults, including flights, is about 100,000 rubles.  Total package is designed for 11 nights.  There are shortened tours that are designed for 7 days, their cost is about 60,000 rubles.  There are direct flights from Novosibirsk, St. Petersburg and several other large cities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanu resort betalbatim" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1069110.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Nanu Resort 3 * (India, Goa) is a real tropical paradise.  And well-groomed and civilized.  The hotel area is reminiscent of a Bounty advertisement at the same time, as it is surrounded by a magnificent forest and faces the ocean, and on the other hand there is a European cottage town.  Neat rows of beautiful cottages, elegantly decorated paths, flower beds, lawns, all this creates a fantastic mood.  An outdoor pool is available on site at all times.

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Entertainment does not end there.  We will not talk about the beach, which is famous for Nanu Resort 3 * (India).  Betalbatim is worth mentioning separately.  But right next to the beach you will find a cozy bar where you can drink soft drinks or a snack.  For avid athletes, a gym and a tennis court are constantly working.  For businessmen and their business colleagues, the hotel has a conference room for 300 people.  Modern equipment will allow you to realize all your ideas and worthily hold the most difficult seminar or training.  Every evening, live music sounds here, you can safely listen to it, or dance for your pleasure.  If you want to relax and rest, then for sure you will like the Ayurvedic complex.  Here you will find a whole range of wellness spa treatments that you will surely like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nanu resort 3 india betalbatim" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1069114.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For children and youth companies </h2><p>  A family with young children will definitely enjoy it.  In order for you to relax normally, babysitters and animators work, and to entertain older tomboys, there is a magnificent kids club and a playground.  Therefore, you can go on the most fascinating tour and not worry about your baby.  The only drawback of this hotel is the lack of Russian-speaking staff, so you need to teach your child the basics of communication with foreigners at home. </p><p>  But the older guys here are frankly bored.  They have not yet learned to enjoy silence, like adults, and there are no discos and incendiary programs here.  Therefore, there is only one way out: with the onset of the evening, go to the center and have fun from the heart. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The most important asset, which Nanu Resorts 3 * (South Goa) is rightly proud of, is, of course, the beach.  Only 80 meters from the hotel, and you find yourself in the realm of bliss and carefree happiness.  The hotel is located on the first coastline, and its staff pays great attention to cleanliness on the beach.  You will not find cigarette butts and cans here, and the sandy beach of any tourist returns to childhood.  For a fee, you can use sun loungers and umbrellas, rent <span>beach towels</span> and mattresses.  If you are still in doubt about where to go on vacation, then Nanu Resort is definitely worth choosing.  Betalbatim will captivate you with its beauty, as well as a clean, magnificent ocean.  Here is the best diving of all that you can imagine.  If you wanted to try yourself in the role of an underwater swimmer, then you can not find a better place.  <span>The beauty of the underwater world</span> will charm you for many years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in India" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1069115.jpg" width="549"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  You can talk a lot more about this wonderful hotel.  But it‚Äôs better to see it once in your own words than to hear it many times.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, this is not just a good hotel, but the best in all of India.  Therefore, if you want to visit Goa, then do not experiment, choose what has already been tested by hundreds of other tourists.  As a result, you will get the most memorable vacation of your life for quite reasonable money, given the remoteness and exoticism of Indian resorts.  The most popular months to stay here are November, December and January.  At this time of the year the heat is not so strong, but the time of heavy rainfall has not yet arrived.  For tourists who are not accustomed to the difficult climate of these places - the time is right.  Once again, we draw your attention to the fact that the hotel does not have Russian-speaking staff.  Therefore, before going on the road, check your knowledge of English and grab the simplest phrasebook so that you can communicate.  That is why tourists are not recommended to leave the tourist area, because, lost, it will be difficult to find out their location due to the language barrier. </p>
