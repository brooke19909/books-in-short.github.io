The time has passed long ago when almost all processes were carried out manually, and food was cooked on fire.  New household appliances allow you to almost completely automate the cooking process and even bring it to perfection.  However, when it comes to talking about a device such as an electric barbecue, the opinions of culinary and gourmet people disagree. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electric barbecue" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10685/105654.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Some argue that this device only spoils the meat.  It dries it, cannot fry it properly and does not give it the aromatic smell of smoke.  Others say that homemade barbecue, powered by electricity, is no different from other appliances of modern cooking.  Naturally, she cannot repeat the whole procedure of frying meat on an open fire and is not able to recreate the ideal taste of such a barbecue, but at the same time she brings the preparation as close as possible to reality. </p><p>  Most restaurants and bars cannot afford to cook meat on an open fire, as this violates <span>the fire safety</span> and sanitary <span>requirements</span> .  Therefore, cooks in these institutions are simply forced to use such a device as an electric barbecue.  Customer reviews about the cooked dishes are almost always positive.  This is due to the fact that the heat treatment of the product on such a device completely imitates its preparation on fire.  With proper pickling and adding the appropriate spices, it is almost impossible to distinguish a dish cooked on a fire, and one for which an electric barbecue was used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home-made barbecue" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10685/105659.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that negative reviews about this device come mainly from those people who themselves do not have it, but speak out solely because of a biased attitude.  Owners of barbecue respond very positively about them, because, having tried to cook a dish on it once, you immediately begin to appreciate the ease of the whole process and the taste of fried meat.  At the same time, an important advantage that a modern electric barbecue has is that it can be cooked at any time of the year and regardless of the weather. </p><p>  Today, there are new models of such devices that have a large number of different functions.  They can fry not only meat, but also fish, vegetables and mushrooms.  At the same time, such an electric barbecue can work in grill, barbecue and even cook shawarma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="barbecue electric reviews" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10685/105678.jpg" width="328"></div>

    <p>  Thus, it becomes clear that this device can cook various dishes, not limited to just kebabs.  It is readily used not only by ordinary housewives, but also by cooks around the world.  The flavoring qualities of the products prepared on it are almost in no way inferior to the qualities of those prepared on an open fire, although a real gourmet can still feel the difference.  But the most important thing in this device is the ability to use it at home, without lighting a fire and without going out into the countryside. </p>
