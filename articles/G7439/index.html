It is the capital of entertainment and nightlife nationwide.  Here you can find a record number of bars, restaurants, nightclubs and discos per square kilometer.

For example, Gumbet with numerous hotels of various categories, among which the most popular are three-star hotel complexes, such as Peda Hotels Gumbet Holiday Beach 3 *, as well as tourist clubs. </p><p>  The city of the same name with the peninsula is located in its very center.  This resort is unlikely to suit lovers of a quiet and measured beach holiday, for example, people of retirement age.  Noisy and cheerful youth from many countries of Western Europe, for example, from France, Scandinavia, Great Britain, and more recently from the Russian Federation, come here yearning for entertainment and adventure.  However, there are no lovers to save on vacation here, since Bodrum is also relatively expensive compared to other Turkish resorts.

Sun loungers, umbrellas, mattresses and towels are free of charge for hotel guests.  But for water activities: skiing, windsurfing, diving, catamaran, banana, parachute and more - you will need to pay. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Everyone who reads reviews of tourists about a particular hotel should understand that some of them are subjective opinions.  But if these comments are found often, in many, then this is alarming.  As for this particular hotel, here the biggest discontent of the former guests is caused by uncleanliness of the staff, which leads to the contaminated state of the entire hotel.  In addition, it is not customary here at the end or beginning of the beach season to upgrade the design and interior. </p>
