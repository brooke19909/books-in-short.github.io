In addition to traditional tourist attractions, many infrastructure objects are being built on the coast of Thailand, working to provide service and comfort for everyone who seeks in these not-so-distant lands.  Every year something new is built and there is another reason to pay attention to Thailand.  This reason became and will continue to be a water park in Pattaya, the largest resort center of Thailand.  Such water attraction parks are very successful and are being built at many world resorts.  Their creators and developers are constantly trying to surpass everything that has been achieved in this area before.  And here, on the Thai coast, this was largely possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in pattaya" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/269068.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong><span>Pattaya Park</span> - a new generation water park</strong> </p><p>  The main thing that distinguishes this complex of water attractions is its well-thought-out design and convenient for visitors the layout of all elements into a single whole.  The water park in Pattaya is designed and built taking into account all the engineering and design developments in this area around the world over the past decades.  Here, of course, there is everything you need for a good rest, both for adults and for children.  Among the most significant - pools and slides, quite significant in height and very intricate along the trajectory of descent from this height.  The water park in Pattaya over the entire period of its work managed to win many positive reviews from those who managed to visit it and experience the novelty of its attractions and the steepness of its slides.  Among the visitors to the complex there are a lot of Russians.  They are attracted here by the fact that here everyone can find entertainment in accordance with requests.  From those who want to get a dose of adrenaline during the downhill from the level corresponding to the upper floors of the hotel complex to small children who are assigned a special zone with all the necessary attributes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in pattaya photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/269067.jpg" width="500"></div>  The positive points include the good location of the water amusement park.  It is located in the immediate vicinity of the Pattaya Park Hotel and many of its visitors live in this complex.  It is interesting to note that the flow of visitors to the water park does not decrease even from May to September, when Thailand plunges into the traditional rainy season.  But regardless of the season, most Russian tourists retain very good memories of the water park in Pattaya.  Photos on the background of its slides and pools will long reinforce these pleasant memories of a <span>vacation in Thailand</span> against the backdrop of an endless Russian winter. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya park water park" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/269066.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Prices and working hours</strong> </p><p>  Available for visitors to the water park in Pattaya from ten in the morning to six in the evening.  The cost of visiting is 100 baht for adults and half as much for children.  The negative points include the fact that staying at the Pattaya Park Hotel, which owns this complex of water attractions, does not give its guests any preferences when visiting the water park.  You will have to buy a ticket on a common basis. </p>
