    <h2>  Smartphone hardware </h2><p>  The computational basis of the smartphone is a 2-core chip "A5".  The clock frequency of each of them is 800 MHz.  If such a CPU were installed on a device running Android, then it would obviously not be enough for comfortable operation.  But Apple devices are running iOS, and this chip is enough for the normal and smooth operation of the system.  Of course, the latest innovations of this platform on this smartphone cannot be fully felt, but for most everyday tasks it is quite enough.  This is watching movies, and <span>surfing the Internet,</span> and listening to music, and reading books - he will cope with all this without any problems. </p><h2>  Screen, cameras and graphics </h2><p>  Modest enough by current standards, the display at the ‚ÄúiPhone 4S‚Äù.  Its characteristics are really not impressive.  The display is based on a high-quality IPS matrix, whose resolution is 640 by 960. Its diagonal is 3.5 inches.  The image on the screen is not grainy, the image quality is not satisfactory.  But working on such a small display is not entirely convenient.  There are two cameras on this gadget right away.  At the heart of the main one is an 8 megapixel sensor, which is amplified by additional optical elements.  As a result, the quality of the photos is simply impeccable.  The situation is similar with videos recorded on this device in HD quality.  <span>The front camera</span> is based on a 0.3 megapixel sensor.  It is quite enough for making video calls.  The connecting link of the graphics subsystem is the PowerVR SGX543MP2 video accelerator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  An interestingly organized memory subsystem in the "iPhone 4S".  The characteristics of each smartphone of this model can vary significantly.  Each device can have a different amount of integrated memory, and its volume changes as follows: 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB.  The larger the capacity of the built-in drive, the more expensive the cost of the gadget, but at the same time the device is more functional.  The situation with RAM (random access memory) is much simpler, the capacity of which in any case in "4S" is 512 MB.  The only thing that raises criticism is the lack of a slot for installing an external drive.  But this is already a "disease" not only of this model, but of all devices that are running iOS. </p><h2>  Body and ergonomics </h2><p>  Unusual appearance of the iPhone 4S smartphone.  Specifications, instructions and user reviews suggest that aluminum and glass are connected in the device case.  It is this decision of American engineers that sets the gadget apart from competitors.  In essence, it has no analogues.  The side faces are made of aluminum, and the front and back covers are made of glass.  Moreover, the entire front of the gadget is covered with impact-resistant glass "Gorilla Eye."  The rest is the same ‚ÄúiPhone 4‚Äù of the previous generation, but with a more efficient CPU and an improved camera.  At the same time, as noted earlier, the diagonal of the display is 3.5 inches, which means that managing it with one hand is not difficult. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The nominal battery capacity in this smartphone is 1432 mA / h.  It is integrated into the iPhone 4S.  The description, characteristics and reviews of the owners of the gadget indicate that its one charge is enough for 2-3 days with an average level of use.  But if the phone is operated to the maximum, then you can count on 1 day of battery life.  On the one hand, the build quality of the smartphone is not satisfactory.  But if the battery fails, then replacing it yourself will be problematic. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  As noted earlier, iOS is the iOS 4S device.  Characteristics, reviews indicate that this is a well-run system, the functioning of which does not cause complaints.  It immediately has everything you need to work.  If something was not in the basic configuration, then the necessary software is easy to install from the Apple app store, and even free programs can be found. </p>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  An impressive set of interfaces for the iPhone 4S.  Characteristics, reviews of the owners of the gadget distinguish these from them: </p><ol><li>  Full support for all 2nd and 3rd generation mobile networks. </li><li>  Built-in CDMA communication module. </li><li>  Wi-Fi allows you to transfer information at speeds up to 150 Mbit / s when connected to the Internet. </li><li>  You can use bluetooth to share small files, as well as to connect a wireless headset. </li><li>  Wired port for connecting to a PC and for charging the battery. </li><li>  3.5 mm audio port for connecting a wired stereo headset to a smartphone. </li><li>  The ZhPS transmitter is also integrated into the device, which allows you to easily turn this device into a full-fledged navigator. </li></ol><p>  The only <span>criticism is the</span> lack of support for 4th generation networks.  But at the time of the device‚Äôs release, they were still at <span>the design stage,</span> and installing such a radio module at that time was not entirely advisable. </p><h2>  Owner reviews and expert opinion </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúiPhone 4S‚Äù turned out to be almost flawless.  Review, specifications, reviews of owners and experts indicate this.  Stable and reliable software component, excellent hardware stuffing - these are all ‚Äú4S‚Äù.  Among the minuses of this device, only the absence of a slot for installing an external flash card and a built-in battery can be distinguished.  On the other hand, you can immediately select a gadget with the required amount of memory.  And due to the built-in battery, the build quality of the case has been significantly improved.  And the battery itself, as experience shows, is of high enough quality. </p>
