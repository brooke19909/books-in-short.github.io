    <p>  The hotel is located in a picturesque bay called Nabq Bay, surrounded by palm trees, exotic plants, very close to the golden beaches.  The nearest international airport is just five kilometers from the hotel complex, in the famous resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.  The distance to the less popular place among tourists, Naama Bay, is only 20 kilometers - if desired, you can easily get here by public transport or by rented car. </p><p>  In fact, the location is considered one of the advantages of the Nubian Village 5. Sharm El Sheikh is a great place for various types of recreation, as it can offer travelers not only luxurious beaches, but also entertainment centers, high-class service and, of course, interesting historical sights worth seeing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Short description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  A large well-groomed area with a huge amount of greenery is one of the many characteristics that the Nubian Village 5 hotel is famous for. Reviews of tourists confirm that the infrastructure of the complex is really convenient.  In the center is a large main building, and around it are three-story residential buildings and small secluded bungalows.  All of them are built in the traditional Nubian style, which gives the hotel a unique touch.  And between the buildings there are narrow stucco-lined streets, secluded arbors and spacious courtyards with fountains. </p><p>  By the way, the resort complex was opened in 1999.  The last major overhaul was carried out in 2004.  Nevertheless, every year the hotel is improving - here you will find not only a homely atmosphere and genuine hospitality, but also modern equipment and interesting design.  There is another hotel located next to Nubian Village, Nubian Island 5. In fact, these two hotels represent a single large resort complex, since, regardless of the place of residence, travelers can use the territory of both hotels. </p><h2>  What do the rooms on the hotel look like? </h2>
