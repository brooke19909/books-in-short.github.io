  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The phone does not accept incoming calls: reasons and solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A lot of smartphone users are faced with such a problem when the phone does not accept incoming calls.  There are a lot of reasons why this can happen, starting from a trivial software failure and ending with a hardware failure.  Today I would like to talk in more detail about the most common reasons because of which incoming calls are not accepted.  Well, and, of course, helpful troubleshooting tips will be given.  Well, let's get right to the point! </p><h2>  Software crash </h2><p>  One of the most common reasons why the phone does not accept incoming calls is a malfunction of the operating system.  This is quite common, so there is nothing special about it.  In general, crashes and malfunctions in the OS can be caused primarily by not very good firmware or poor system optimization.  As a rule, cheaper phones from not very well-known brands are more likely to be affected by this ‚Äúphenomenon‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uk.businessinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not accept incoming calls due to a system failure" class="if uuid-2529448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529448.jpg"></div><p>  There are two different ways to fix this problem.  First, it‚Äôs the easiest - rebooting the phone.  You can even just remove the battery for 10 seconds, then insert it back and turn on the device.  In most cases, this solution helps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second way is to reset to factory settings.  If the first solution did not help, then the failure occurred on a more global level, and a simple reboot will not fix it.  In this case, resetting to the initial state helps a lot.  You can perform this procedure through the device settings. </p><h2>  Flight mode </h2><p>  The second reason the phone does not accept incoming calls is flight mode.  A lot of users like to use the ‚ÄúAirplane mode‚Äù function, so that for some time no one bothered them.  But, as practice shows, a very large percentage forgets to disable this function after which, as a result, they do not receive incoming calls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcmarket.com.hk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not accept incoming calls due to airplane mode" class="if uuid-2529446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529446.jpg"></div><p>  The solution to this problem is incredibly simple - just turn off this feature.  This can be done either through the status bar or as it is also called the "curtain".  You can also disable ‚ÄúFlight‚Äù through the settings in the ‚ÄúNetworks and Connections‚Äù section (on different phones, this section may be called differently).  Another ‚ÄúFlight Mode‚Äù is disabled through the shutdown menu, which is activated when the power / lock button is pressed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Incorrect network definition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not accept incoming calls due to an incorrect network definition" class="if uuid-2529447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529447.jpg"></div><p>  The next reason that the phone does not accept incoming calls is an incorrect network definition.  Typically, the phone automatically detects the network of the cellular operator in automatic mode, but sometimes, malfunctions occur, as a result of which the device switches to the wrong frequency. </p><p>  In order to fix this problem, you need to follow 2 simple steps: </p><ol><li>  Go to settings and go to the menu "SIM-cards and networks." </li><li>  Next, you need to select the "Mobile Networks" section and set the definition there either to automatic mode, or search and select the desired network, according to your mobile operator. </li></ol><h2>  Radio module malfunction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not accept incoming calls due to a faulty radio module" class="if uuid-2529450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529450.jpg"></div><p>  The next reason why the phone does not accept incoming calls is a faulty radio module.  Alas, nothing can be done about this.  Often, communication modules in devices fail.  This can happen due to a manufacturing defect, due to frequent device drops, moisture getting inside, etc. There is only one way to fix the problem - by replacing the module with a new one. </p><h2>  Antivirus on Samsung </h2><p>  Well, and at the end of such a small fad, dedicated to Samsung smartphones.  Very often, many owners complain that their Samsung phone does not accept incoming calls.  This happens not only because of the above reasons, but also another, separate, which applies only to devices of this brand.  The fact is that if you install Dr.  Web on a smartphone from Samsung, the application automatically blocks most of the numbers from which incoming calls will not be accepted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.eprice.com.tw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung phone does not accept incoming calls due to antivirus" class="if uuid-2529449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529449.jpg"></div><p>  There are two ways to fix this problem.  The first is to remove the antivirus and find a replacement for it.  The second is to go to the application settings, go to the ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù item and check the box ‚ÄúAccept all calls and SMS‚Äù there.  Everything is simple! </p>
