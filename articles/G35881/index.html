    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Avila Resort Pattaya is located in Pattaya.  This is one of the most popular resorts in Thailand, located in its southeastern part, on the shores of the Gulf of Thailand.  To be more precise, the complex is located in close proximity to Jomtien Beach.  It is about three kilometers to the center of Pattaya.  You can get to it easily and quickly, because from here regularly go songteo (local minibuses). </p><p>  It is worth noting that Jomtien is the most calm and quiet area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort.  No, there are also numerous bars, restaurants, shopping centers.  Just the relatively incredibly noisy and boiling center of Pattaya, Jomtien is still quite calm. </p><p>  Utapao Airport is about 40 kilometers from the hotel.  But in the immediate vicinity, in addition to the beach, there is <span>the Pattaya Aquarium, a</span> race track, an outlet (a shopping center with brand boutiques, but modest prices).  In three minutes you can drive to the floating <span>market of Pattaya,</span> in five - to the cabaret "Alcazar".  In general, there is something to see, so you won‚Äôt be bored. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About service </h2><p>  Avila Resort Pattaya provides the standard facilities and services needed for a comfortable stay.  It features free high-speed Wi-Fi, public parking near the building, and a 24-hour reception.  A shuttle service (free of charge) and room service are also available.  Luggage storage, dry cleaning and laundry services are also available. </p><p>  The staff speaks not only Thai, but also English, so you should keep this in mind.  Here, by the way, there are very friendly and friendly people who are always ready to help guests - book tickets, book an excursion, or just orient around the area. </p>

    <h2>  What else is there in the hotel? </h2><p>  Avila Resort Pattaya is not a resort hotel, but just a place for a comfortable stay.  There is no entertainment except for the pool and sun terrace.  However, many attribute this to pluses, because in the evenings it is very quiet and calm.  And besides, the lack of leisure has a positive effect on the price. </p><p>  But Avila Resort Pattaya 3 * has a small but cozy restaurant.  Only breakfast is served here, but they, as the guests were here assure, are pretty good.  There are always hot dishes - omelettes, scrambled eggs, fried sausages, a variety of meat, fresh vegetables and fruits (watermelons, melons, papaya, pineapples, etc.), salads, and also spaghetti fried with meat and herbs, rice porridge, crispy toasts and more.  Standard drinks - teas, coffee, milk, juices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As mentioned earlier, the hotel is in a good location.  So finding a bar or restaurant suitable for day and evening meals is easy.  In the immediate vicinity are fruit stalls, remote fast food and many other places.  Just remember: Thai dishes usually have a lot of spices.  And if you do not want a large number of spices, then it is better to warn the waiter or cook about this. </p>

    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Some of the nuances regarding booking are also worth knowing when you are going to a hotel formerly known as <span>iCheck inn Jomtien Pattaya</span> (ex.).  Avila Resort starts check-in at 13:00 and lasts until 22:00.  Guests leave from noon until 12:30.  But as travelers who have been here assure, the time frame is rather arbitrary.  If people arrived earlier than 13:00, and the room booked by them is free, then they will be settled immediately. </p><p>  The hotel can live with children.  But for each additional guest (whether it be a child or an adult), you need to pay 500 TNV (about 880 rubles at the current rate).  The apartment can accommodate an extra bed or cradle for the baby.  But that it is necessary, guests must inform the property in advance, preferably when applying for a reservation.  The administration must confirm the provision of this service. </p><p>  Also, by submitting an application, the guest will be required to provide their credit card details.  The hotel accepts Visa and Master Card.  By the way, if a guest wants to pay for accommodation right away, then he should know that funds are credited in the name of Boss Mansion.  If you are interested in any additional information, or want to clarify any point, it is better to contact the administration directly. </p><h2>  About the rules </h2><p>  It is also important to know that a deposit is required at this hotel.  Its size is 1000 TNV.  This is about 1800 rubles at the current rate.  When guests are evicted, money is returned to them in the same amount and currency. </p><p>  Also, upon arrival, you will need to provide a credit card, the data of which was indicated when drawing up the reservation request.  Therefore, you must use only your personal credit card.  You will also need an official identification card (a passport suitable for anyone is always with you).  And the minimum age for self-registration here is 18 years.  All younger guests are registered as adults +1, for example. </p><h2>  About staff </h2><p>  Guests who are reviewing Avila Resort Pattaya are particularly attentive to hotel staff.  The cleaning is daily and thorough.  Towels are changed with the same regularity.  The bed is covered with fresh linen every three days.  Every day, during cleaning, the maids replenish their supplies of clean bottled water, tea, sugar and coffee.  Bath accessories (shampoos, gels and liquid soap) - also, as they become smaller in dispensers.  However, if guests need something, just ask about it.  At the reception they also give out beach towels. </p><p>  The grounds and pool are always kept in perfect cleanliness.  This also can not but rejoice.  The hotel territory, by the way, is closed at night, and 24-hour security is on duty at the entrance. </p><p>  The beach is quite close, 700-800 meters, but for the convenience of guests who are not eager to walk, a bus runs to the hotel every day from the hotel.  And he also takes the guests back.  The schedule of this minibus can be found at the reception. </p>

    <h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  People staying at Avila Resort Pattaya Jomtien 3 *, reviews are mostly good.  However, this is not surprising, because it is a comfortable hotel with very low prices.  Ideal for tourists who prefer a budget vacation. </p><p>  The hotel itself is small, so there is no fuss and crowd sensation here.  But if you want absolute silence and solitude, it is worth planning a vacation for the winter.  Still, most people have vacations in the summer.  But the climate in Pattaya in winter is favorable for a beach holiday.  After all, the thermometer does not fall below 26-30 degrees.  And the water is the same temperature.  And even in winter there is practically no rainfall, waves, storms.  In general, an ideal place for a sea holiday. </p><p>  Also 2.5 kilometers away is the wonderful Dongtan Beach.  It is not crowded and quiet, and cleanliness is carefully monitored here, as many popular hotel complexes go out to it. </p>

    <h2>  Other interesting nuances </h2><p>  Guests who have been here are advised to rent a car, or at least a bicycle.  Walking around the city in order to explore the sights to move around is not very convenient, but on any vehicle - just right.  In addition, in Pattaya there really is something to see.  And some places are so outlandish that the guide does not lead guests to the resort there. </p><p>  Many more are surprised to note the fact that among the many channels on the TV you can find two Russian ones - the 1st and NTV.  And Wi-Fi works well, steadily - and not like in many other hotels. </p><p>  To summarize, we can conclude that this small, clean and comfortable hotel will be a great option for people who dream of a budget, relaxing and enjoyable vacation.  All the most important things here are for this - comfortable conditions, pleasant staff, favorable location and, of course, modest prices. </p>
