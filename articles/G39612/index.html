But with the advent of open access to digital channels, many questions arose.  As a rule, all of them relate to the problem of the correct choice of a <span>digital set-top box to the TV,</span> its connection and settings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="set-top boxes" class="if" height="176" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1789913.jpg" width="600"></div>  Say what you like, but the cost of the receivers is still quite high, and many buyers do not want to simply squander their family budget.  In order to choose the best option from the first try, it is necessary to study all the nuances.

    <h2>  Types of Digital Television </h2><p>  The main disadvantage of analog television is the loss of signal quality during broadcasting.  In digital transmission of audio and video information is encoded in binary code, so that all data loss is reduced to zero.  But for the "perception" of encoded signals, the TV must be able to "decode" them. </p><p>  Unfortunately, this feature is only built into modern models.  That is why it is necessary to purchase a digital set-top box for the TV, which will also act as a decoder in old TVs. </p><p>  Currently, digital television is divided into 4 types, depending on the broadcast technology: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  on-air, DVB-T or DVB-T2 standard - broadcast by TV towers; </li><li>  satellite, DVB-S format - transmitted, respectively, by satellites; </li><li>  cable, DVB-C or DVB-C2 technologies - signals are received via lines; </li><li>  Internet TV, IPTV - access to the channels requires access to the global network. </li></ul><p>  The first thing to do before buying a set-top box for receiving digital television is to carefully examine your TV.  Some models already support multiple digital broadcast formats at the same time. </p><h2>  Broadcast Receivers </h2><p>  Broadcast digital television is the most low-cost option, because to watch channels you need a regular indoor or outdoor antenna and the set-top box itself.  In some cases, the amplifier will not be amiss, but it depends on the distance from the TV tower.  When buying a set-top box for on-air TV, it is important to ensure that it necessarily supports the DVB-T2 format. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect the console to the TV" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1789659.jpg" width="600"></div>  The disadvantages of choosing such a set-top box to the TV can be called the dependence of the image quality on the signal strength - the more noise, the worse the "picture".  Another drawback is the relatively small number of channels - there are only 32 of them. In addition, you will not be able to watch broadcasts in HD quality, because the signal is broadcast in the usual format.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main advantage of the set-top box for terrestrial television is its price.  Models cost 1-2 thousand rubles, while they have a large set of built-in functions.  A typical representative is the Oriel set-top box.  The next advantage is mobility.  You can connect another TV to the set-top box at any time. </p><h2>  Satellite tv receivers </h2><p>  To view satellite TV programs, in addition to the receiver itself, you will need a satellite dish, as well as a signal amplifier.  It is not recommended to assemble such a set of equipment on your own - there is a high risk that the receiver will not fit the amplifier.  From here follows the main minus - the high cost of the finished kit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="set-top boxes for receiving digital television" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1789661.jpg" width="600"></div>  When choosing a satellite receiver, make sure it supports the DVB-S format.  As part of the set-top box, you can also use the CI slot for installing a conditional access card.  With it, for a fee, you can view blocked paid channels. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

    <p>  Speaking of channels.  Any satellite television operator provides its customers with about 1000 programs.  But for this you will have to subscribe for a monthly fee.  Without it, the number of gears will drop to 30-50.  But in any case, all TV channels will be broadcast in HD quality. </p><h2>  Cable duct prefixes </h2><p>  There are not many options for choosing a cable television receiver.  More precisely, he is only one - to contact the cable TV operator.  Unfortunately, cable set-top boxes for receiving digital television are designed to receive a signal from only one provider.  If you choose another service company, you will have to re-purchase the receiver. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv set-top box oriel" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1789664.jpg" width="600"></div>  The advantage of such a television is its high image quality, which does not depend on local conditions.  So, if a satellite dish can stray from a strong wind, as well as a street antenna, then it is almost impossible to create interference in the cable.  Another advantage is that you only pay for the channels you want to watch.

    <h2>  Internet tv </h2><p>  To watch Internet channels, you need a smart TV set-top box, as well as a router and high-speed Internet.  The principle of broadcasting programs is as simple as possible - a receiver purchased from a teleoperator connects to the wired Internet, goes online and shows the channels that you are subscribed to. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prefix smart tv" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1789663.jpg" width="508"></div>  In fact, this feature can be implemented on a regular PC, but the image quality, as well as the number of channels and many other factors will largely depend on the site owner.  IPTV also gives you access to more than 100 channels, all of which are in HD quality. 
      <br>

    <p>  In addition to watching your favorite shows, the Smart TV set-top box will give you the opportunity to access the Internet directly from the TV, as well as watch the program of channels, ‚Äúrewind‚Äù time forward, pause the film and much more.  A significant drawback of such consoles is their price.  In some cases, it can reach 25 thousand rubles.  The cheapest options are at the level of 6-7 thousand. </p><h2>  Connection Features </h2><p>  The answer to the question "how to connect the set-top box to the TV" depends on the model of device you have chosen.  If you purchased a receiver for terrestrial television, then to connect you will need an antenna coaxial cable.  You can buy it or make it yourself by screwing the f-connectors on the tips. </p><p>  You can use several options to connect a <span>satellite receiver</span> .  It all depends on the functionality of your device.  As a rule, there are several connectors on the back wall.  It can be Scart, RCA-slots, output for coaxial or composite cable and other ports.  The easiest way to connect through the "tulips". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a set-top box for a TV" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1789662.jpg" width="480"></div>  There will be no problems connecting a cable receiver, because when you select this option, the provider company will do everything for you.  Also, do not think about how to connect the set-top box to the TV when choosing Internet TV.  More often the problem is solved using an HDMI cable.  But you can also use Scart, RCA - it all depends on the functionality of the equipment.

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Hardware Setup </h2><p>  After combining the set-top box and the TV, you need to switch to the corresponding playback mode.  If you used a coaxial cable, then nothing needs to be done.  If Scart, RCA, then the remote control put the TV into AV-input mode.  When using an HDMI cable, you accordingly need to select the item of the same name in the menu. </p><p>  After that, start searching for channels.  If, when deciding how to choose a set-top box for a TV, you prefer IPTV or cable TV, then no additional manipulations are required - everything is already set up for you.  Enjoy watching! </p>
