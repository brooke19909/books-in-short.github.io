  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Hitler Hated the Jews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many versions that tell us about the reasons why the once-terrible World War II was unleashed.  The fact that its instigator was Germany, in particular its leader, Adolf Hitler, remains undoubted. </p><p>  His biography has been written and rewritten hundreds of times.  An attentive reader, having studied it, will understand some of the Fuhrer‚Äôs motives, and will also answer the question of why Hitler hated Jews, gypsies, other nations and races. </p><p>  Among others, the following reasons can be distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Hitler had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconquering the world and dividing it into three races.  To the first and highest, he attributed the "true Aryans", ie  native Germans.  They had to rule the world.  He assigned the Slavs to the second group, who were assigned the role of slaves.  The third group consisted of Jews, gypsies and so on.  It was planned to completely destroy them.  This is one of the most popular and plausible answers to the question of why Hitler hated the Jews. </li><li>  After <span>World War I</span> , Germany experienced a severe economic downturn.  People lived poorly and hard enough.  At the same time, most banks and profitable enterprises were owned by Jews.  Hitler considered this humiliating and found, in his opinion, the correct way out of the situation.  Moreover, he was convinced that the defeat in the war was also the work of the capitalists, especially the Jews. </li><li>  Hitler's mother was seriously ill.  Many historians believe that she died as a result of an unsuccessful operation performed by a Jewish doctor.  And this aroused in young Hitler hatred of this people.  However, this version is quite controversial.  Taking into account that the woman was ill with cancer, and the medicine of that time was not well developed, it can be assumed that the doctor‚Äôs guilt is minimal. </li><li>  Hitler accused the Jews of the revolution that took place in Russia, the emergence of Bolshevism and so on.  He sought to destroy the capitalists. </li><li>  According to one version, during the years of turbulent youth, Hitler was "awarded" syphilis by one of the Jewish prostitutes.  The realization that the disease was incurable strengthened his hatred of the Jews. </li><li>  During his school years, little Hitler had a Jewish teacher who inspired fear in the boy. </li><li>  The father <span>of Hitler</span> 's <span>wife,</span> Eva Brown, was a Jew.  Before the wedding, he promised the future father-in-law a considerable amount as a dowry.  However, things did not go beyond promises.  This fact reinforced the growing hatred and hostility towards this race. </li><li>  The genocide of the Jews began in the first days of the war.  One more version is clearly seen in this.  In order to raise thousands of people and make them fight, <span>good reasons</span> and motives are needed.  Germany fought to establish world domination.  To maintain the morale of the soldiers, victories were needed.  For this it was necessary to kill someone.  Since the Slavs were chosen as future slaves, the role of victims was assigned to Jews and Gypsies.  These peoples are few in number, and it seemed to Hitler that they would simply be destroyed.  The realization that it was in their power to wipe an entire nation off the face of the earth raised the morale of the soldiers. </li></ol><p>  Each of the versions of why Hitler hated the Jews, everyone decides for himself and which one to believe.  Anyone can try to prove or disprove. </p><p>  Many historians and psychologists studied the identity of Hitler.  Most of them came to the conclusion that he was not completely healthy mentally.  His friends and teachers noted some aggressiveness, lack of sociability and estrangement.  He was very quick-tempered and harsh in judgments.  For posterity, he remained a mystery and a monster that destroyed millions of people.  Many of them, including women, children and the elderly, did not die on the battlefields, but were tortured to death in concentration camps and gas chambers.  The terrible experiments that were put on civilians still excite the imagination.  The real reasons why Hitler hated the Jews are not known for certain. </p>
