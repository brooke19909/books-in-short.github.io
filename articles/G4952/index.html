  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foreign policy of Alexander 2</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the last third of the 19th century, the policy of Alexander 2 was not very successful.  The defeat in the Crimean War and the creation of the Crimean system, according to the conditions of the Paris world, weakened Russia's position and its influence on European countries.  Petersburg was no longer the diplomatic capital. </p><p>  For the failure of the foreign policy of Alexander 2, the public blamed Nesselrode.  Then the emperor dismissed him, and appointed A.M. Gorchakov to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs.  A visionary man, inclined to make decisions independently, under Nicholas 1 he did not receive a promotion.  However, his abilities were noticed and appreciated by Alexander 2. The foreign policy proposed by Gorchakov immediately after being approved for the post was fully approved by the emperor. </p><p>  Gorchakov was forced to admit that at the moment the country is militarily and economically weak.  He insisted that now Russia should focus on its internal affairs, as well as strive for peace with other countries, and seek allies for protection.  The Minister believed that Alexander 2‚Äôs foreign policy should not be active for some time, relations with neighboring, closest states should be established. </p><p>  First of all, Gorchakov decided to undermine the Crimean system, drawing closer to France.  A common rejection of Austrian politics brought the two sides closer together.  The result of the interaction of the French and Russians was the emergence of a new state - Romania.  However, due to a dispute over the status of the Black Sea, about the Holy Places and the Polish question, relations between the two countries did not receive further development. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the accession of Alexander 2, the national movement of the Poles revived.  In 1861, a demonstration was dispersed in Poland.  The Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich, who was appointed governor there, instructed A. Velepolsky, the local aristocrat, to carry out a number of reforms in the country.  Decrees were prepared on conducting classes in schools in the Polish language, on the restoration of the University of Warsaw, on making life easier for peasants.  At the same time, Velepolsky announced the recruitment of young people from the politically unreliable army.  This decision provoked a new uprising in 1863, an attack on military garrisons.  An <span>interim government</span> was urgently created and Poland declared independence.  The conciliatory policy of the Grand Duke completely failed. </p><p>  England and France felt that after what had happened they had the right to intervene in the affairs of Russia.  <span>Napoleon 3</span> proposed convening an international congress, granting amnesty to those who took part in the riot, and restoring the Polish constitution.  Gorchakov rejected all proposals, since he considered the Polish question an internal affair of Russia and forbade Russian diplomats to even discuss it.  In 1864, the <span>uprising in Poland</span> was finally crushed.  And <span>Prussia</span> helped in <span>this,</span> which signed a convention with Russia, which provided, if necessary, free passage through its borders. </p><p>  In the late 60s of the 19th century, the foreign policy of Alexander 2 was aimed at solving the German question.  Now it was a major problem in many countries of Europe.  O. Bismarck, the Minister-President of Prussia, wanted to solve this issue by active action.  Russia supported him and in 1870 a war broke out between Prussia and France.  The victory of Prussia finally led to the fall of the Crimean system, the creation of the <span>German Empire</span> and redrawing the map of Europe, to the collapse of the regime of Napoleon 3 and the formation of the Paris Commune. </p><p>  But not always the foreign policy of Alexander 2 corresponded to the interests of Russia.  In particular, this concerns the declaration of the Russo-Turkish war in 1877.  This decision of the emperor was provoked by the inability to solve the Eastern crisis by diplomatic methods and pressure from the leaders of the Slavic committees. </p>
