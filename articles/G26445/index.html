    <p>  Today, a lot of masquerade dresses are on sale, but if you want to emphasize individuality and be sure that such an outfit will be unique and inimitable, then you should arm yourself with sewing accessories and sew a New Year’s monkey costume yourself.  Moreover, this process is simple!  And the description of how to create a “monkey” costume, presented in this article, will help to understand the main stages of work and will become a good guide for making a beautiful outfit for boys and girls. </p><h2>  How to create an image? </h2><p>  First of all, the main details should be determined.  The suit "monkey" must have a long tail and ears.  And such elements as a muzzle on a hat, a bunch of bananas and appropriate makeup can already be attributed to accessories and additional details. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas monkey costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1118540.jpg" width="399"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>A monkey costume</span> for a boy can consist of pants and a jacket or overalls.  But girls can beat the image a little differently, using a beautiful tutu skirt, gloves on her hands and even a hat on her head.  It is only a little imagination and transfer all the planned details of the suit on paper, drawing a small sketch.  This will help to navigate the stages of work in the process of creating an order. </p><h2>  Panties and T-shirt: a quick way to cut </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that for a dress it is best to give preference to knitted fabrics that stretch well.  This will ensure a comfortable fit.  You can sew a monkey costume with your own hands from such paintings as velor, velvet, diving, terry or fleece.  Naturally, the color must be taken brown. </p><p>  To create a pattern of pants and a T-shirt or overalls, it is not at all necessary to trouble yourself by taking measurements, complicated calculations and creating drawings.  It is enough to take things appropriate for the size in the child’s wardrobe, turn them inside out, put them on film or paper and circle them, straightening the details of the cut along the main seams.  The only thing that will require a <span>centimeter tape</span> is to measure the distance from the shoulder to the waist.  And then such a need appears only in the case of combining pants and T-shirts at the waist to create a jumpsuit template. </p><p>  Otherwise, everything is quite simple: </p><ul><li>  cut patterns; </li><li>  transfer to fabric; </li><li>  to cut with allowance for seams; </li><li>  sew a <span>monkey</span> costume <span>with your own hands,</span> assembling the parts into a one-piece product. </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that the tail will need to be sewn into the middle seam of the panties or overalls in the appropriate place.  For a playful image, you can beat the ass and the midsection of the character by stitching round patches on them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It remains only to complement the image with a tie or bow-tie.  You can also beat details such as gloves in the form of paws, which will greatly delight the child and his friends at the matinee, when it will be necessary to gracefully dance for Santa Claus near the Christmas tree. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY monkey costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1117465.jpg" width="386"></div>

    <h2>  Tutu skirt for girls </h2><p>  For a girl, a monkey lady will be a win-win.  Elastic waist size, stripe stripes 10 cm wide and a length equal to double the length of the skirt will quickly turn into a chic skirt.  To do this, just tie the fabric on an elastic band.  You can also complement the outfit with brown knit socks and gloves.  The tail should be attached to the elastic of the skirt and brought out between the elements of the tutu skirt. </p><p>  The carnival costume of the monkey must be fun and elegant.  And perhaps here you can not do without bright beads around the neck.  This small detail is able to instantly transform the entire outfit. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that the combination of colors is one of the important points.  Since leggings, gloves and a T-shirt should be brown, it is better to choose orange, yellow, green, red or pink for the skirt.  Although the option with a rainbow skirt is also good! </p><h2>  How to make ears? </h2><p>  What is a monkey suit without ears?  This is one of the most important details that makes an image recognizable.  Make them quite easy.  For the manufacture you will need cardboard and fabric brown and beige or pink.  It’s better to make the ears big enough, but don’t get carried away, as Cheburashka will immediately draw.  So, two semicircles are cut out of the cardboard, after the template is transferred to the fabric and four details are cut out: two from dark matter, two from light.  In this case, allowance for seams of 1 cm along the contour of the elements should be given.  Next, the fabric parts are folded face inwards and stitched.  When a semicircle slice remains, the product is turned out, cardboard is inserted and carefully sewn up, tucking the slices inward. </p><p>  Such ears can be glued to the hair band, a hat sewn from two semicircles, in the volume of the child’s head, or glued to the hood.  For girls, the option of attaching the ears to hair clips and clips is suitable. </p>

    <h2>  How to make a tail? </h2><p>  The tail is one of the easiest elements to perform.  For him, 10 cm are cut out of the fabric, folded face inward, a line is laid and turned out.  On one edge, you can tie a knot, and the second edge is sewn into pants or attached to the elastic of the skirt. </p><h2>  Fun accessories for the perfect look </h2><p>  New Year's monkey costume can be made quite spectacular.  A bunch of bananas sewn from yellow fleece on a belt, a necklace made from textile segments of oranges or whole tangerines will add cheerful notes to the image.  To create such parts, fleece or felt is suitable.  Both of these materials can be glued together with a hot gun and not be tormented with sewing on small elements. </p><p>  The butterfly on the neck of the monkey boy will make the character an interesting gentleman.  Continuing the idea, you can make a cane and a hat-cylinder on the head, as well as white cuffs on the sleeves, which will perfectly combine with large glove-paws.  These items are best sewn from fleece. </p><p>  Girls will definitely like the idea of ​​a wig with long hair, which, in combination with protruding ears, will look so cute that you can’t take your eyes off the baby.  Such a monkey costume will certainly stand out from the total mass of children and will delight not only the child, but also those around him. </p>
