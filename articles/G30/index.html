    <h2>  Tasks of enterprises </h2><p>  In the process of analyzing and summarizing the documents adopted by the Ministry of Finance, and the publication of methodologists that regulate and describe the formation of financial statements, we can identify the main goals of organizations.  They consist of: </p><ol><li>  Improving the regulatory and legislative framework. </li><li>  Unification of accounting registers. </li><li>  Tax simplification.  This will exclude the routine of specialists in constant allocation of deductions. </li><li>  Optimization of work plans of accounts. </li><li>  Improving workflow and minimizing the volume of accounting papers. </li><li>  To simplify the balance by enlarging articles and eliminating forms that do not have significant informative value for government agencies. </li><li>  Reduction of reporting forms. </li></ol><h2>  Normative base </h2><p>  The accounting (financial) statements of small businesses are regulated by norms approved by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation in 1998.  The need to adopt new standards was caused by the transition of the domestic accounting system to the level of compliance with international rules.  New documentation has been introduced in the country since January 1999.  All acts are distributed on several levels.  These include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Level 1 - legislative.  Documents of this category are Federal laws, government decrees, Decrees of the President, Civil Code of the Russian Federation.  The main regulatory act that regulates the accounting (financial) statements of small businesses is Federal Law No. 129 of November 21, 1996. </li><li>  Level 2 are the provisions of the Ministry of Finance.  They act as regulatory standards (PBU). </li><li>  Level 3 contains <span>guidelines,</span> letters, orders of the Ministry of Finance and other executive bodies, which are responsible for the accounting (financial) statements of small businesses. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="financial statements for the year" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/757345.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  A special place is occupied by the <span>working documentation of the</span> enterprise.  It determines the <span>accounting policies of the organization</span> in the technical, organizational and methodological directions. </p><h2>  Manager Capabilities </h2><p>  An important point is not only the direct formulation of the tasks of accounting for the activities of small businesses.  Of particular importance are the methods for solving them.  Unified rules and methodological foundations that enterprises must follow when organizing and maintaining records are defined in Federal Law No. 129. In accordance with it, the preparation and presentation of financial statements depending on the volume can be carried out directly by the head of the organization.  At the same time, the director of the enterprise, as before, has the opportunity: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Form a special structural unit authorized to keep records. </li><li>  Introduce the position of chap.  accountant. </li><li>  Transfer accounting to a specialized company or specialist on a contractual basis. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting reporting" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/757346.jpg" width="490"></div></li></ol><h2>  Accounting Forms </h2><p>  According to the Model Recommendations, the organization can use various forms of documentation of ongoing business operations.  It can be: </p><ol><li>  Departmental forms of financial statements. </li><li>  Forms present in unified primary documentation albums. </li><li>  Self-designed forms.  They must necessarily contain the relevant details provided for in the Federal Law No. 129. </li></ol><h2>  USN accounting reports </h2><p>  A simplified system is recommended by the Model Guidelines for organizations in which the production, performance of work or the provision of services is carried out by simple technological processes.  Moreover, the total number of business transactions per month does not exceed one hundred.  According to standard recommendations, it will be most appropriate if the financial statements (a sample can be found in the article) are prepared according to the organization‚Äôs own work plan developed, which will be based on a standard project for accounting for economic activities of individual entrepreneurs.  This documentation is approved in the process of adopting the accounting policies of the organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting reporting forms" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/757347.jpg" width="500"></div>

The procedure in accordance with which the reflection of the main business processes is based on the working Chart of Accounts.  Intangible assets and fixed assets are kept separately in subaccounts of accounts.  01. Depreciation deductions for fixed assets and intangible assets are reflected in the account.  02.

    <h2>  Important point </h2><p>  It should be remembered that, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2 of the Regulation governing the composition of the costs of production and subsequent sale of products (services, works), which are included in the cost, and the procedure for generating accounting results that reflect the report in the tax, include in the cost of production and depreciation charges intended for the full restoration of fixed assets.  Today, the Unified Norms are approved by the Ministry of Finance.  Thus, when compiling a tax report, it is necessary to adjust the amount of taxable profit by the amount of excessively accrued depreciation, in accordance with the calculation method used by the organization. </p><h2>  Write-offs </h2><p>  Along with the linear accrual method, an organization in which financial statements are submitted according to a simplified system, as before, also has the opportunity to write off in the form of depreciation accruals up to 50% of the initial cost of the fixed asset, the life of which is more than three years.  At the time of disposal, write-off is carried out through account 02, as recommended earlier by the Instructions.  However, there is a clarification in the Model Recommendations.  It says that when selling OS the income from the sale is recorded on a credit account.  99 "Losses and Gains."  There are no recommendations on the reflection on the accounts of their sources of the financial result that was revealed during the gratuitous transfer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting reporting" class="if" height="211" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/757349.jpg" width="330"></div>

The received digit is sent to the account.  84 "Uncovered loss (retained earnings". Previously, enterprises on the basis of the "Special Purpose Fund" took into account the amounts of property revaluation, the value of valuables received free of charge, and other changes of a property nature. Currently, according to the current Standard Recommendations, it is reflected in subaccounts c. 83 "Additional paid-in capital". </p><h2>  Methodology and organization of accounting </h2><p>  Maintaining and submitting financial statements are carried out using established register systems.  They are provided for in the Model Recommendations and are: </p><ol><li>  Journal-order form of bookkeeping for business associations and small enterprises. </li><li>  Simplified system. </li></ol><p>  The first form greatly facilitates accounting.  The total and monthly information of order journals is transferred to the General Ledger.  Accounts in it are opened in the sequence of numbers that are assigned to them in the work plan.  The general ledger is necessary to summarize current accounting information, draw up a balance sheet, and verify each record.  This document, along with order journals, provides detailed, full correspondence on credit and debit in each <span>synthetic account.</span>  With this form of accounting, the number of registers of analytical reporting is minimized.  This is due to the fact that some journal-order lists contain all the necessary data. </p>
