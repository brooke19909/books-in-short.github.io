    <p>  It was decided to pay special attention to the fight against tanks, which the enemy had significantly more.  To this end, on the site between Gant and Fr.  Balaton (83 km) created more than 60 anti-tank areas, in which the main artillery forces were concentrated. </p><p>  In many respects, the success of the Soviet troops depended on the timely delivery of fuel and ammunition.  Front-line warehouses were located on the other side of the Danube (in the east), so it was decided to build <span>cableways</span> and a pipeline for transporting fuel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This made it possible to increase the material and technical base of the troops.  Prior to this, supplies were delivered through crossings, but it was impossible to rely on them only because of the spring ice drift and the actions of German aviation. </p><h2>  Balaton operation: fighting events </h2>

    <p>  On the morning of March 7, the battle on Lake Balaton resumed with an attack by German forces.  The command was looking for vulnerabilities in the defense of the anti-Hitler coalition.  At the same time, the Soviet command sought to timely transfer the available forces to more threatening sectors.  For two days, the enemy could not break through the tactical area, but they managed to wedge into it at a distance of up to 7 km. </p><p>  On the morning of March 8, the attackers introduced the main forces.  The fighting did not subside for several days, during which the Wehrmacht troops were able to break through two lines of defense.  However, this success was not consolidated, since the lines of defense of the Soviet forces did not end there. </p><p>  Within ten days, the enemy advanced 15-30 km, using a large number of tanks.  They still failed to break through to the Danube, and by March 15 their offensive had ceased altogether due to a lack of necessary reserves. </p><p>  The Battle of Balaton was the last significant offensive of the German armed forces during World War II.  Having repelled the onslaught of the enemy, units of the Ukrainian Front went on a counterattack, which was aimed at Vienna. </p><h2>  Losses </h2><p>  The fighting lasted two weeks with the use of various military weapons, tanks, aircraft, so the casualties on both sides were impressive. </p><p>  On the part of the USSR, 32899 people were affected, of which 8492 were killed. </p><p>  Soviet sources indicate that the Wehrmacht lost about 40,000 people, as well as 300 guns, 500 tanks, 200 aircraft.  For them, "Spring Awakening" turned into disastrous losses. </p><h2>  results </h2><p>  The Nazi bloc was unable to complete the task, while a large number of soldiers and military equipment were lost.  His troops were weakened and exhausted, as a result of which Soviet forces were able to launch a successful attack on Vienna. </p><p>  Hungary, for which World War II was associated with the plans of the Wehrmacht, was liberated from the Nazi bloc. </p>
