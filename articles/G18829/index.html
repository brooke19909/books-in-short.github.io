If you are configured to buy a home theater or portable speakers, then you need to consider different parameters.  But if you have already decided on the choice of the manufacturer, then consider that half the battle is done.  We will consider the acoustics of Audio Monitor. </p><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  Audio Monitor was founded in 1972.  This is a British company that specializes in the design and development of audio systems.  At first, the company began working in a small factory near Cambridge, and since then it has changed its location several times.  The company has become famous thanks to its excellent acoustic models, which we will consider further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acoustics audio monitor" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1824548.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Acoustics </h2><p>  Before you understand the acoustics of Audio Monitor, you need to understand what it is.  In general, from Greek this term is translated as ‚ÄúI hear.‚Äù  This is the science of sound, which studies the nature of sound physics, its problems, their occurrence, distribution, perception and impact.  If we return to the topic of the article, then we are talking about the <span>speaker system.</span> </p><p>  In this case, acoustics is represented by a device that reproduces sound, which is built on acoustic design and mounted heads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types </h2><p>  <span>Speakers</span> can be completely different.  So, in addition to technical parameters, it makes sense to pay attention to types.  For home, there is often floor acoustics, shelf and portable. </p><p>  Floor-standing is the best option for those who want to create a system with powerful rich sound.  All this thanks to a pair of speakers and a high-quality audio source.  All this can be supplemented with a good amplifier that works to create a rich stereo scene or forms a frontal wave based on a multi-channel system.  If you want the scene to be shaped as good as possible, add a couple more sound emitters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="floor speakers monitor audio" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1824547.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The floor type is characterized by large dimensions and thick wooden walls.  This design creates scoring for large areas.  The only drawback of such a system is the resonant vibration, for this the speakers are provided with damper compartments, a reinforced structure and special anti-resonant chassis. </p><p>  The shelf system is most convenient for those who do not want to create a home theater, but like to listen to music.  Music lovers acquire this type to compensate for the size of a small room.  Users place columns on shelves, as the name implies.  Or purchase additional anti-vibration stands.  So, a shelf system is an ideal option for mini-systems or docking stations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Acoustics Audio Monitor can be portable.  So, for some time now, quality compact speakers have become popular that can not only be taken out on the street or taken with you on a trip, but also used in everyday life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shelf speakers monitor audio" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1824551.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Exclusive </h2><p>  Next, we will consider several models for each <span>type of speaker system.</span>  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that this is not a rating, because usually it requires models from different manufacturers.  If we consider the products of a particular company, it is better to choose the most popular options.  Outdoor speakers Audio Monitor has many models in its arsenal.  Consider a couple of the most interesting. </p><p>  Silver 8 is a three-way speaker system, which is made of very expensive and high-quality materials.  This equipment should be considered premium.  Although the cost of 2 thousand dollars is not prohibitive, still not everyone can afford to buy such speakers. </p><p>  The system looks as expensive as it costs.  She has several finishes, including black oak, red walnut, white <span>piano lacquer</span> , etc. The natural veneer finish is complemented by speakers with a metallic sheen.  An inch tweeter with a domed membrane is hidden under the grid.  It used aluminum alloy with ceramics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Each lane has four speakers, a phase-inverted enclosure, has two ports and HiVe II technology.  The values ‚Äã‚Äãof the frequency range fluctuate around 32 Hz - 35 kHz.  The sensitivity is up to 90 dB.  The nominal impedance is only 4 ohms.  The total power is 200 watts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acoustics monitor audio bronze" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1824550.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Junior Model </h2><p>  Another interesting option for floor acoustics is Monitor Audio Silver 6. This is the youngest version of the previous model.  But it is also designed to install a home theater.  The configuration is 2.5-way, equipped with two midbasses.  Branded diffusers are still made of aluminum-magnesium alloy, coupled with ceramics. </p><p>  The nominal impedance reached 6 Ohms, while the sensitivity fluctuates around 88-90 dB.  Frequency range 38 Hz - 31 kHz.  Special acoustic speakers, documentation, controls and grilles are included. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Similar models usually find a positive response from customers.  They are high-quality, thoughtful and at the same time simple.  Paired with a good player, they give excellent sound and show the full frequency range.  In addition to all the technical advantages, they look perfect and add to the interior high cost. </p><h2>  On the shelf </h2><p>  Shelf acoustics Audio Monitor presented model Bronze BX1.  Both speakers look great, almost perfect.  They have good body materials, strong, high-quality and wear-resistant.  In height, the equipment turned out to be only 35 centimeters. </p><p>  As usual, there is a large selection of finishes so that the device can fit perfectly into the interior of the room.  At the back there is a pair of terminals, new technologies are used, tweeter, mid-frequency and low-frequency speakers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers monitor audio silver 6" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1824546.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Depending on the genre, the acoustics produce a certain sound.  In some cases, it is a pulsating bass, powerful low frequencies or a clean and spacious range.  Easily plays rhythms.  In order for this option to fully realize itself, it is better to purchase a good amplifier for it. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  This model has become an excellent choice for music lovers and those who are deprived of spacious rooms.  There is enough sound for a small room with a head.  It spreads easily and evenly ‚Äúcaptures‚Äù every corner of the room.  Their size is their advantage.  Users noted the nice design, clear midrange, deep bass and scale.  The complaints concerned the details.  Still, if audiophiles turn on complex rhythms, they may hear some inaccuracies. </p><h2>  Gold </h2><p>  Portable speakers Audio Monitor AirStream S150 were born last year.  Its golden version received many positive reviews, because it looked very attractive.  The release of this model was to remind the fans of the manufacturer about the thirty years of the Gold Dome tweeter. </p><p>  This speaker was paired with a charcoal-black grill where speakers were hidden.  On the sides were 3-inch bass drivers, and between them was the famous Gold Dome.  There is an amplifier D here, which allows you to create sound with a total power of 40 watts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="floor speakers monitor audio silver 6" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1824545.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For just 150 pounds, the British were the first to try the new product.  The wireless speaker, as usual, worked with USB, designed to recharge gadgets.  There was a 3.5 mm slot for synchronizing with other types of equipment.  If necessary, it was possible to hang the acoustics on the wall. </p><h2>  Series </h2><p>  Acoustics Audio Monitor MR Series is also popular among users.  For example, one of the most popular among them was the MR2 model.  This is acoustics that works best when installed on a rack.  An inexpensive option, which pleased those who had long looked at the manufacturer, but could not afford its products. </p><p>  Often this series is compared with BR, which at one time was considered inexpensive.  This option has become even cheaper.  He had some inaccuracies finalized.  Increased dimensions, equipped with some technological innovations.  The MR2 is the most affordable model available.  It is designed to show style and class.  The body turned out a little rounded, has a vinyl finish to choose from walnut or oak. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, it feels best on racks than on shelves.  But even without this, it reproduces high-quality sound, detailed, balanced and clean. </p><h2>  Owner feedback </h2><p>  The series as a whole received positive feedback.  First of all, due to the fact that many buyers could afford it.  Users noted the accuracy and speed of work, attractive design, successful design.  The owners talk about the melody and controllability of the sound, but to get the highest quality sound that you can get, you need to overheat the speakers. </p><h2>  Bronze </h2><p>  Acoustics Monitor Audio Bronze is also popular both around the world and in Russia.  Back in 1998, the world saw three popular series of Bronze, Silver and Gold.  We‚Äôll talk about bronze.  There are many models of this option.  So, a good option for floor acoustics was the Bronze BX5 model.  Case type - bass reflex.  Presented in several colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="portable speakers monitor audio" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1824549.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The nominal impedance is 8 ohms, sensitivity up to 90 dB.  The number of speakers is three.  The maximum power is <span>150 watts,</span> which for the floor system, of course, is a low indicator.  But still it will be generally sufficient for an average speaker system.  Frequency range 36 Hz - 30 kHz.  There are all the necessary connectors and slots. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Acoustics Audio Monitor has become a cult at the time and continues to delight fans with its products.  The company does not produce models as often as many other manufacturers, but when it presents a new product, it always hits the bull's eye.  And before us is the perfect product that is suitable for any user. </p><p>  The company cares not only about the ears of music lovers or audiophiles.  There are many conventional models that are designed for both floor and shelf systems.  Recently, he is trying more and more to expand his choice and make acoustics accessible to all buyers.  But to a greater extent it still refers to expensive systems, with high-quality materials and high sound performance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers monitor audio mr series" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1824552.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So, owners of acoustics from Audio Monitor get a good, detailed, powerful sound.  Moreover, it practically does not change with respect to cost.  Small deviations in the frequency range, in terms of impedance and total power can affect the price.  Also, sometimes a large role in the pricing policy of a particular model is played by its appearance and choice of materials. </p>
