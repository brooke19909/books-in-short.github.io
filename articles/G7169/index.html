Not always purchased models correspond to our ideas about comfort.  Some believe that making home-made shoes with your own hands is a very complicated matter, accessible only to experienced shoemakers or experienced craftsmen.  There are light models made of felt, fabrics that even a novice master can do. </p><p>  Slippers can be created from a variety of materials using an old sweater, sheepskin coat, felt or worn jeans, taking into account the time of year and the wishes of the manufacturer.  Knitted knitted slippers work great.  The article will consider some of the simplest options for <span>making shoes</span> with your own hands.  The presented patterns will help to master the sewing technique more easily, and photographs will give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the finished products should look in the end. </p><h2>  Open slippers </h2><p>  For cutting, you will need felt, scissors and measurements of the feet of both legs.  You can draw a pencil around the contours on a sheet of cardboard and then transfer the dimensions to felt, or you can accurately outline them directly on the material or use an insole from other shoes.  On the upper half of the pattern, "wings" are drawn left and right.  You can measure their length with a flexible meter, applying it to your leg, do not forget to leave the material to the overhang, and this is not less than 3 cm on each side. </p><p>  After cutting the left and right slippers, you need to connect the "wings", trying on the leg, and sew in the center with stitches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt spanking" class="if uuid-2526973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2526973.jpg"></div><p>  To decorate such shoes, you can use a bright large button, as in the photo above.  DIY shoes can be sewn in just a few minutes.  If you want to extend the life of such a product, you can sew a leather insole on the sole of the slippers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Closed slippers </h2><p>  To cut such a model of slippers, you need to do two details.  First, circle both feet on thick cardboard to create the sole of the shoe.  Then, go around the outline with a pencil again, adding 1 cm of fabric to the hem.  Secondly, you need to draw a pattern of the top.  To do this, measure the height of the foot at the highest point from one edge to the other.  Having put a sheet of cardboard to the pattern of the sole, add 2 cm on both sides and draw a straight line.  Then, the trajectory of the sock is circled in a semicircle and reaches smoothly to the indicated marks.  The top line is rounded, connecting the marked points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="closed toe slippers" class="if uuid-2526982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2526982.jpg"></div><p>  Then they begin assembling shoes with their own threads.  So that the sole is thicker and warmer, it is possible by the same standards to cut another layer of fabric and an internal insulation made of non-woven fabric, and a purchased leather or felt insole is also suitable.  It is recommended to sew the sewn layer of fabric on the sole with a piping of satin ribbon or a strip of dense fabric.  The upper part of the slippers is sewn, starting from the center point, so that the fabric does not skew.  The top of this part of the pattern also wraps around the edging so that the threads of the fabric do not split.  To decorate, you can first sew an applique or lace on a fabric, attach a bow or pompom from threads.  That's it, ready-made home-made shoes are ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Closed shoes pattern </h2><p>  To make closed slippers at home, you need to outline the contour of the foot.  The pencil should not be tilted inward, it must be held straight down.  Also, be sure to step back 1 cm along the edge to hem the fabric and seams.  The upper part of the pattern consists of two halves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="closed slippers pattern" class="if uuid-2526978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2526978.jpg"></div><p>  The front edge bends upwards by approximately 12-13 cm for all sizes of adult shoes.  The back has a heel lift of 6 or 7 cm. The length of the pattern along the outer edge should be equal to the distance from the center point of the toe to the center of the heel.  Use a flexible meter to measure. </p><p>  After one side pattern is made, it is turned over to the opposite side and simply outlined again.  So both sides of the pattern will be the same.  If the fabric from which the shoes will be sewn with their own hands will additionally be insulated with a layer of synthetic winterizer, then it is necessary to add 0.5 cm from all sides, since the insulation significantly increases the size.  This must be taken into account so as not to sew smaller slippers. </p><p>  After cutting, the fabric is sewn on the heel, in the center of the toe and around the entire sole.  Decorative seams can be made with contrasting color floss threads.  Such shoes can be sewn from an old sheepskin coat.  DIY home-made shoes made of fur will be very warm and durable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Closed toe slippers </h2><p>  According to the pattern proposed above, you can sew comfortable soft slippers for your child.  So that there are no seams in the middle of the sock, the side patterns are combined together, then the seam will remain only at the back.  The photo below shows that the cutting is made in two layers - the upper part is made of knitwear, and the lower one is sewn of artificial thin fur.  To sew such shoes with your own hands at home, you first need to cut and put together the details of the fur, and then, adding 1 cm from all sides to the measurements, make the outer fabric part of the craft. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="closed fur slippers" class="if uuid-2527081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2527081.jpg"></div><p>  So that the child, moving in slippers on the floor of the room, does not slip and fall, you can additionally sew on the sole of the suede insole over the fabric.  Slippers need to be decorated depending on the gender of the child.  For a girl, you can decorate products with bows, sew butterflies or make roses from satin ribbons.  For boys, you can use ready-made applications of superheroes or cars from cartoons. </p><h2>  Leather slippers </h2><p>  If you still do not know how to sew home-made shoes with your own hands, patterns of simple slippers will help solve the problem.  It is advisable to use a piece of leather or suede for such slippers.  The pattern is quite simple, the bends of the lines are best drawn using a pattern.  As you can see in the photo below, the whole pattern is sewn with just one side seam.  It is best to make it external so that the inside of the seam does not press on the skin of the foot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather slippers" class="if uuid-2526971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2526971.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, these slippers take on the full shape of a foot, like a second skin.  Their legs do not soar in them, a person feels comfortable both in summer and in winter. </p><h2>  Baby booties for baby </h2><p>  Felt is a very soft and pleasant material for the body, so it is quite suitable for children's shoes.  In the first frame in the photo below, it can be seen that the pattern of each product is two parts.  The first is the contours of the foot, for convenience, you can use any baby‚Äôs shoes and simply circle around the perimeter with a pencil on cardboard.  The second detail of the pattern is a strip of fabric with rounded ends.  Its length is equal to the size of the foot in a circle plus a few centimeters per smell. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baby booties made of felt" class="if uuid-2526993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2526993.jpg"></div><p>  Before sewing booties, the central points on the heel and on the strip of the second part of the pattern are determined.  They join together with pins, and sewing starts from the heel zone.  On the left and right products, the smell is made into the inner part, that is, the fold is obtained oncoming. </p><p>  For work, you need kapron thread, a needle and scissors.  It is best to use a seam over the edge.  Threads of contrasting color look beautiful.  After trying on, you can make a pair of pinches on top so that the slippers fit snugly to the foot and do not fall. </p><h2>  Felt shoes with side seam </h2><p>  From the <span>sheet of felt</span> according to the pattern below, you can cut comfortable soft slippers in which the details are connected by a wide cord of bright color.  For a boy, you can sew in blue or black, and for a girl in red, pink or yellow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt slippers for pattern" class="if uuid-2526969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2526969.jpg"></div><p>  For the pattern of the foot, they simply circle it with a pencil; in addition, you will not need to leave the fabric on the seams.  The wide part of the pattern corresponds to the size of the leg lift, and the long part is equal to the measurements of the foot along the perimeter.  Slippers height is optional.  You can measure any person‚Äôs shoe as a sample. </p><p>  For seams, wide cuts are made with a knife.  To do this, under the bottom, substitute a wooden board.  Each slot should be at an equal distance from each other, then the shoes will look neat. </p><h2>  Knitted slippers </h2><p>  With your own hands, you can knit slippers from yarn for both a child and an adult man.  These can be short products, similar in shape to ordinary slippers, or you can add a knit up and make warmer winter slippers by the type of socks or ankle boots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onecraftymumma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitwear" class="if uuid-2527092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2527092.jpg"></div><p>  The lower part of such products is usually knitted with a garter stitch.  On the knitting needles, the number of loops corresponding to the perimeter of the insole is typed, that is, the double size of the legs.  You can start knitting from threads of dark yarn, highlighting the sole separately.  In the photograph of the sample, this part of the product is connected with burgundy threads.  Then blue yarn joins and knitting continues until the height of the slippers is reached. </p><p>  Further work continues only on the sock side.  10 central loops are counted, and they are knitted with the addition of an outer loop in each row by knitting 2 edge loops together.  In this way, the foot is raised to the required level.  If you want to knit short slippers, then you will only have to knit 5-6 cm, then one row is knitted along the entire length, and the loops are closed.  The product is stitched from the top of the heel down the sole to the toe. </p><p>  If high ankle boots are knitted, then the front part of the slippers is made of a higher height, and then you can go along the entire length of the knit to a 1x1 or 2x2 elastic band and raise the bootleg up to the desired height. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to sew home-made shoes with your own hands.
