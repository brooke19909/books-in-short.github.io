    <p>  What to look for when visiting the Field of Mars in St. Petersburg?  The history of this place is connected with the monuments located in the park area, and with the attractions located in the immediate vicinity.  The territory of the square is really large (about 9 hectares).  Monumental obelisk - a monument to the victims of the Revolution is located in the middle of the green zone.  In the northern part of the park is a monument to the commander Suvorov.  Nearby is also the Marble Palace, which currently operates as a branch of the Russian Museum.  The barracks of the Pavlovsky Life Guards regiment are also included in the ensemble of the Field of Mars.  On a walk through the square you can also appreciate the prospect of such attractions as the Mikhailovsky Palace and the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical information </h2>

    <p>  At the beginning of XVII, the local area was surrounded by water on all four sides and was a swamp.  Later, the territory was drained, and thanks to this it became possible to conduct <span>military exercises,</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãfestivities.  Names changed: Amusing meadow (Bolshoi, Tsaritsyn) and the final "Field of Mars".  It was assigned to the territory in the 18-19 centuries.  The name was associated with the holding of military parades and exercises on the ground and was especially strengthened after the installation of the monument to commander A.V. Suvorov. </p><p>  For about two centuries, the park zone served as a venue for public festivities and parades, when, after the revolution, a memorial zone also appeared here: a burial place was organized for victims of the revolution in mass graves.  To date, the Monument to the Victims of the Revolution no longer has a bright Bolshevik orientation, rather, this monument is dedicated to all the people who died during the Revolution.  Because of this, the name of the park was also temporarily changed: it began to bear the name "Square of the Victims of the Revolution."  It was assigned to the territory until 1944. </p><p>  Good service in the name of the life of the people who lived in Leningrad during the siege years was served by the Field of Mars: it was here that kitchen gardens for growing vegetables were spontaneously arranged.  Hence the fireworks thundered in honor of the day the blockade was lifted on January 27, 1944.  Later in 1957, the memorial Eternal Flame, the first in the country, was lit at the memorial.  The <span>Eternal Flame</span> exhibition was restored in 2005, and to this day it burns in memory of the victims of revolutions and wars.  What is the Champ de Mars now? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Champ de Mars in St. Petersburg: modern significance for the city </h2>

    <p>  Today, the Field of Mars is one of the favorite places to spend time in St. Petersburg in the summer.  The territory retains its historical function.  This is, first of all, one of the most important places of memory where such memorial events as ‚ÄúMinute of Silence‚Äù and laying flowers at the monument to the victims of revolutions and wars are held.  In addition, city flash mobs, rallies and meetings of activists of various directions are held here. </p><p>  For example, one of the last high-profile events held by St. Petersburg residents is a flash mob in memory of Alan Rickman, when many people came to participate or observe from outside.  The organizers invited all who came to simultaneously wave the luminous "magic wands" and direct them up.  One of the favorite places for walks of city dwellers and visitors is the Field of Mars in St. Petersburg! </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The Champ de Mars is a pleasant park area.  To enjoy the unique view of one of the main memorial places of St. Petersburg, there are several route options.  The first most optimal one is to get off at the Gostiny Dvor metro station, walk along Sadovaya Street, which is to the right of the station exit, cross Nevsky Prospekt through the <span>underpass</span> and then continue along the street towards its beginning.  The street rests in the Field of Mars, so finding it will not be difficult.  Another option could be the path from the Gorkovskaya metro station, then you need to head towards the Neva River directly along Kantemirovsky Prospekt and cross the Troitsky Bridge.  From this point you can get to the northern part of the park. </p><h2>  What to prepare for? </h2>

    <p>  The park does not have any fences and a work schedule, it is open for visitors around the clock, at night it is beautifully illuminated by lanterns.  It is worth noting that dog owners often visit the park, but the territory always remains clean, and the dogs walk exclusively in the muzzles.  The square is surrounded by water on three sides: from here you can go to the Kutuzov embankment, to the <span>Swan Canal</span> or to the Moika River. </p><h2>  Places similar to Champ de Mars: gardens and parks </h2>
