But few people think about the terms of its action.  As a result, situations arise when after a month of use a ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù piece of paper becomes unnecessary.  For example, if a driver travels abroad by car.  How to be in this situation?  You can make insurance for 3 months. </p><h2>  Briefly about the service </h2><p>  MTPL is a vehicle <span>liability insurance</span> policy.  With it, you can reimburse expenses that were incurred by other participants in the accident.  The duration of the contract depends on the vehicle category: </p><ul><li>  cars registered in the territory of another state; </li><li>  cars entering the territory of Russia in transit; </li><li>  cars constantly used in Russia. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="biz.a42.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic CTP" class="if uuid-2625565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2625565.jpg"></div><p>  According to the current legislation, in 2018 the driver can make insurance for 3 months.  The price of the policy is fixed at the time of signing the contract and does not change even if tariffs change.  If the client wants to add insurance, then the cost of the supplement will be calculated at the old rate. </p><h2>  Can I make insurance for 3 months? </h2><p>  The validity period of CTP is determined by Art.  10 Federal Law No. 40 of 04.25.2002. The insurance contract is concluded for one year.  The exception is the following owners: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Recently acquired a car and driving it between regions.  In this case, the policy is issued for 20 days.  As soon as the vehicle is delivered to the place where it will be registered, a standard contract is drawn up. </li><li>  Having a vehicle older than 3 years.  In the absence of a diagnostic card, the policy can be issued for 20 days. </li><li>  Having cars registered in other countries.  In this case, you can stay in the Russian Federation for 20 days, and then take out insurance for 3 months.  In case of violation of this rule, a citizen will have to leave the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  Limited use of the vehicle means the ability to use the car only by the person designated by the policyholder, or the seasonal use of the vehicle for 90 days or more per year.  That is, the driver can buy a policy for the period of actual use of the vehicle, and not for the entire duration of the contract.  The driver must notify the UK in writing of the limited period of use of the car.  This period will be specified in the contract.  If the driver becomes a participant in an accident, the insurance company will indemnify. </p><div class="photo" data-original="biz.a42.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian bills" class="if uuid-2625563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2625563.jpg"></div><p>  For drivers of all other categories, the contract is valid for an insurance year.  It is not always equal to the calendar.  If the policy was issued on 02.02.2017, then its validity expires on 01.02.2018.  This is important to consider when signing a document. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Should I buy a ‚Äúminimum" policy? </h2><p>  CTP insurance for 3 months is often bought to save money, as its cost is 50% lower than the standard.  At first glance, it seems that when calculating the tariff, lower coefficients are used.  In the form, the cost of the policy is divided by month.  You can specify any of them: running consecutively or one at a time from different seasons.  The cost will not change until the end of 12 months, even if tariffs increase.  If the policyholder needs to extend the period of use by 3 months, he can pay 0.2 of the price, and for the remaining 6 months - 0.3 of the annual amount.  That is, if you buy several ‚Äúshort-term‚Äù policies per year, the driver will overpay on insurance.  This is the financial policy of insurance companies.  In addition, he will have to go through the policy process several times. </p><p>  The cost of a short-term policy: </p><ul><li>  3 months - 50% of the cost; </li><li>  4 months - 60% of the cost; </li><li>  5 months - 65% of the cost; </li><li>  6 months - 70% of the cost; </li><li>  7 months - 80% of the cost; </li><li>  8 months - 90% of the cost; </li><li>  9 months - 95% of the cost. </li></ul><p>  The cost of the certificate for 10-11 months will be more than a full-year annual contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtosreda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance policy" class="if uuid-2625566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2625566.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, ‚Äúone-day‚Äù insurance companies sell short-term insurance to drivers who do not fit into any of the categories.  Such buyers need to be prepared for problems, since the contract is contrary to the law on compulsory motor liability insurance.  If an accident occurs during its validity period, the insurer will refuse to indemnify.  The document will be declared void, and the civil liability of the driver - uninsured.  The owner will have to repair the car at his own expense.  Moreover, which policies may not be included in the SAR database.  If a traffic police officer finds out during the inspection, the driver faces a fine of 800 r.  Part 2 of Article 12.37 of the Code of Administrative Offenses. </p><h2>  Exceptions to the Rules </h2><p>  If there is no legal reason to issue short-term insurance, but the driver does not want to overpay, there is still the opportunity to issue a policy for 3 months.  The procedure for termination of the contract has not been canceled.  If, for example, the owner has sold a car, he has the right to contact the UK and receive part of the cost of the policy.  It does not matter that the contract was concluded only 30 days ago.  The insurer is obliged to return funds for the period in which the policy will not be used.  Of this amount, 23% is withheld.  A small part of this amount is transferred to the Union budget.  Most of the funds remain with the insurance company, although this is not prescribed in any law.  Therefore, the client can sue and get the rest of the amount. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtosreda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="policy purchase" class="if uuid-2625572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2625572.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  To apply for car insurance for 3 months, you need to provide: </p><ul><li>  car owner's passport; </li><li>  Title </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  vehicle registration certificate; </li><li>  diagnostic card. </li></ul><p>  Certificate renewal should be started no later than 2 months before the completion of the previous one.  Otherwise, the insurer will charge the amount to the undisciplined client, taking into account the increasing coefficient. </p><h2>  Calculate the cost </h2><p>  Each driver can independently find out the cost of the policy using the OSAGO calculator on the website of the insurance company.  It is equipped with current rates and coefficients necessary for calculation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtosreda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DVR on the road" class="if uuid-2625569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2625569.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The motorist needs to enter his data, technical specifications, indicate the period of operation.  The minimum price will be calculated for a driver with a long experience, who had no accident in the previous year. </li><li>  A resident of a metropolis can reduce the cost of the policy by transferring the car to a relative living in a small village.  The tariff will be calculated on the basis of a small ‚Äúterritory coefficient‚Äù. </li><li>  The owner of several cars can transfer to a car with an engine of less than 50 liters.  from.  This will reduce the ‚Äúpower factor‚Äù. </li></ul><h2>  How to renew a certificate? </h2><p>  The annual cost of the policy is fixed at the time of signing the contract.  This document defaults to 12 calendar months.  The deadline is adjusted only upon written request of the client.  For example, a client came to make insurance for 3 months, as he plans to sell a car.  To do this, he must write a statement and pay 50% of the cost of the policy.  If the transaction did not take place, then he can contact his UK and extend the policy.  At the same time, for the remaining 9 months, he will have to pay another 50% of the cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtosreda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance policy" class="if uuid-2625573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2625573.jpg"></div><p>  According to the rules of CTP, a policy cannot be bought by installments.  If there is no opportunity to pay the policy at full cost, the driver can buy car insurance for 3 months, and then periodically renew it.  It is important 2 months before the deadline to engage in re-registration of the contract.  Otherwise, the cost of the surcharge will be calculated at an inflated rate.  For the use of the vehicle during the period not provided for by the policy, a fine of 500 rubles is charged.  For the lack of a policy as such, the driver will be fined 800 rubles.  If an accident occurs during this period, the insurance company will pay compensation to the victim, and then provide a recourse claim. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sysertcity.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="online policy" class="if uuid-2625578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2625578.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The car owner can buy insurance for 3 months by paying 50% of the tariff.  If a need arises, the duration of the contract can be extended.  Using a short-term policy in order to save money will not work.  The financial policy of the UK is designed in such a way that it is more profitable to conclude an annual contract right away, rather than deal with renewal each time.  Moreover, for the use of a car in a period not stipulated by the contract, as well as for the lack of insurance as such, a fine is provided.  Therefore, short-term insurance should be issued only if the driver has objective reasons: selling a car, moving to another country, etc. </p>
