    <p>  Engineers and designers of companies are trying to make new models of smartphones thinner, more powerful, with large screens at Full HD-resolution, with support for a huge range of applications, in general, more beautiful and more expensive.  All this in order to cause the delight of the future owner and sometimes even awe in front of his creation.  And in pursuit of such ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù, the manufacturer very often neglects energy saving, that is, autonomy, and this is a fact. </p><p>  It is impossible to carry advanced technologies along with enviable characteristics and have excellent autonomy?  No matter how! </p>

    <p>  This statement is refuted by the hero of today's review - a stylish and very capable gadget from the middle price range, distinguished by a capacious battery and good technical indicators.  This is Huawei Y6 Pro.  Characteristics, hardware and communication capabilities, as well as the opinions of specialists, together with the reviews of ordinary smartphone owners will be discussed later in the review.  On the shelves of many stores, the model is presented as Enjoy 5, Honor 5X Play, Honor 4C Pro and Holly 2+.  But under the cover, the inscription Huawei Y6 Pro invariably flaunts (price - 11 thousand rubles). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The gadget has a monoblock and attractive design.  The model is softly rounded in the corners and looks like a classic rectangular smartphone.  The five-inch screen is bordered by a black insert and recessed into it, due to this, visually it looks a little larger than its dimensions.  If you look at the upper and lower frames more closely, you can see the original and quite nice texture. </p><h2>  Front </h2><p>  The front camera eye is located in a place traditional for such gadgets - above the screen.  The company consists of <span>a light</span> and proximity <span>sensor</span> .  Directly below the screen itself and just above the brand logo, the on-screen pictograms are conveniently located: ‚Äúsquare‚Äù, ‚Äútriangle‚Äù and ‚Äúcircle‚Äù.  Icons have the usual functional characteristics: ‚ÄúRecent Applications‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù and ‚ÄúHome‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  If you are left-handed or simply do not like the location of the icons, then you can easily change them in the Huawei Y6 Pro menu.  Owner reviews are full of words of gratitude for this, albeit small, but for someone critical feature of the gadget. </p><h2>  Rear </h2><p>  A very remarkable metal frame runs along the device‚Äôs perimeter, which contrasts beautifully with the plastic case, which, incidentally, has an original and pleasant to the touch texture.  On the back of the gadget, in the upper part, there is a camera with a flash.  A little above the eye you can see the microphone, and below you can see the pretty logo of the manufacturer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  You will not find speakers in the usual place for such dimensions.  Engineers considered it more appropriate to place them on the bottom, to the micro-USB connector.  At first glance, it might seem that the speakers have a stereo scan (holes on both sides of the output), but in fact there is only one speaker, and the sound flows through only one grille in the Huawei Y6 Pro.  The feedback from the holders of the gadget‚Äôs gadget was divided in this case: someone was quite happy with such a false grille and mono sounding, and someone was sunk into the soul that he was being deceived. </p><p>  Under the removable cover, you can see a couple of modern micro-slots for SIM cards and one place for a micro-SD drive.  The battery occupies almost the entire space, but nevertheless does not interfere with working with cards.  Under it, you will see the identification numbers, as well as the series number, assembly and other technical information about the Huawei Y6 Pro.  Reviews about the "friendliness" of the cover are mostly positive: with proper dexterity, it is easily poked with a fingernail and just as easily put in place. </p><h2>  Ergonomics and gamma </h2><p>  With its impressive weight of 160 grams, the device has the appropriate dimensions: 143.1 x 71.8 x 9.7 mm, which fits well with decency for five-inch gadgets.  At the moment, official dealers have two versions of colors: Huawei Y6 Pro Gold (golden) and Gray (gray). </p>

    <p>  Both scales look great both in the hands of strong men and weak women, and regardless of status and age, whether a student or a respectable gentleman for 60. At the price of Huawei Y6 Pro Gold and Gray do not differ, so what to choose is a matter of taste for everyone. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The five-inch model has a basic resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels, which even today, in search of "more, higher and more powerful", in this class of devices is considered a decent feature.  The density of dots per inch is also a good indicator - 294 ppi.  And all this works on a completely sensible IPS-matrix, with proper saturation and contrast. </p>

    <p>  The brightness adjustment range has a good variation in the entire Huawei Y6 Pro series.  The review of corners is also up to the mark.  You can easily watch photos or videos in the company of one or two friends.  Moreover, viewing angles are equally good both horizontally and vertically for all Huawei Y6 Pro models.  Owner reviews note the only, and for some, a critical drawback of the screen is the lack of <span>oleophobic coating.</span>  So a microfiber cloth will become your constant travel companion, if you don‚Äôt have a desire to fork out for an expensive coating procedure. </p><p>  More or less inexpensive rescue from dust, scratches and other dirt for Huawei Y6 Pro is a cover, so the first thing that owners of a smartphone recommend is to purchase any case you like after buying a gadget, the benefit of the design, shapes and varieties of workmanship in stores is more than enough. </p><h2>  Hardware platform </h2><p>  For the speed of the smartphone, the Mediatek MT6735P series platform runs on four cores with a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz (ARM "Cortex-A53").  For video streams, the built-in chip from the Mali T720 MP2 series at 600 MHz is responsible.  In general, the capacities for most daily tasks are more than enough for the Huawei Y6 Pro models. </p><p>  The review showed that the gadget is equipped with two gigabytes of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory.  Moreover, the user of them remains approximately 10 GB.  The device supports all modern micro-SD-drives up to 128 GB, and therefore, owners of Huawei Y6 Pro should not have problems with free space.  The case from the brand (company) is equipped with special pockets, so you can store all your memory cards and SIM cards in one place. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The model provides for work with two micro-SIM cards.  They work alternately, that is, when one SIM card is active, the other switches to offline mode.  The gadget feels great in the core networks of all well-known mobile operators and supports 2G, 3G and 4G technologies. </p>

    <p>  Support for popular wireless protocols is also available: Wi-Fi at 802.11 b / g / n and Bluetooth version four.  Some owners in their reviews complain that the Huawei Y6 Pro mobile phone was not equipped with NFC technology, but for this price, the available features are more than attractive. </p><p>  In addition to the standard set of <span>communications, the model</span> supports domestic GLONASS and imported GPS / A-GPS.  The gadget can easily be used as a navigator, coupled with standard Google Map mapping. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Two things are especially attractive in the Huawei Y6 Pro - the price and battery life.  The available 4000 mAh battery allows the phone to "live" in normal mode for about two days.  Even if you load it, as they say, to its fullest, charging will still be enough for almost a day. </p><p>  More specifically, at full screen brightness, playing video in Full HD consumes the battery for almost eleven hours, and this is an excellent indicator for models in this segment. </p><p>  Autonomy can be significantly prolonged if you turn on special energy-saving modes and disable especially "gluttonous" third-party applications.  Moreover, the gadget takes on the optimization of the software and the entire device as a whole, competently reminding and connecting the currently required mode (custom function). </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning another feature of the model.  Y6 Pro can act as an external battery powering other gadgets, and this, as a rule, is the prerogative of expensive devices from the category "price exceeded 30 thousand rubles."  Users in their reviews appreciated this feature, putting the highest rating in the autonomy section. </p>
