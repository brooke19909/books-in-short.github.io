The rights of the buyer are regulated by law by the established period during which the consumer can see the defect in the product and return the goods to the seller.  This period is counted from the date of purchase of the product and is 14 days.  Not all people are aware that not all goods are eligible for exchange.  Or return.  There is a list of technically sophisticated products that cannot be exchanged.  In this case, a return is not always possible, since the buyer may encounter a lot of difficulties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of technically sophisticated products" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56302/1965853.jpg" width="478"></div>

    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  Products that were specifically approved in the law on technically sophisticated products are a special category.  What does it mean?  The law was adopted by Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 924. This type of goods is mentioned in 2 lists, so the seller may, depending on the situation, take advantage of the legal illiteracy of the buyer and mislead him about his rights.  In this case, the seller may refer to one list as well as to another.  The choice of the necessary list directly depends on the answer to the following question: ‚ÄúIs there a flaw in the product?‚Äù  By answering it you can find out if the product is technically complex.  And also whether it is possible to refuse the acquisition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="technically sophisticated product of inadequate quality" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56302/1965852.jpg" width="530"></div>

    <p>  If a good quality product without defects for some specific reason does not suit the buyer, it is impossible to exchange or return it.  And one more nuance.  All technically sophisticated products listed on the special list cannot be exchanged or returned.  This must be considered when buying them. </p><p>  After 15 days, the process of returning or exchanging defective goods becomes much more complicated.  During the entire warranty period, you can exchange or return the goods in the following case: the goods with the defect are located at the repair company or the seller with whom the contract was concluded.  At the same time, non-compliance with the established repair dates was revealed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exchange of technically sophisticated goods" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56302/1965850.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Significant defect of goods </h2><p>  Such defects are repaired by a service center or a seller who performs repairs under a contract.  In some cases, the buyer can repair a technically complex product with a defect at his own expense.  But only on condition that the seller agrees to this.  The buyer must present documents proving the costs.  The seller‚Äôs obligation, on the other hand, is to recover these costs.  In addition, the repair of goods with any defect can be made by the seller at his expense. </p><p>  Moreover, the seller can lower the price of the product by mutual agreement of both parties.  The amount of the discount is usually negotiated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="technically sophisticated household goods" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56302/1965847.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What product flaws are significant? </h2><p>  The ability to use all the functions of the product that are provided by the manufacturer, as well as use it for its own purpose, determines the materiality of its shortcoming.  If it is impossible to perform its functions, as well as if the deficiency cannot be eliminated, this defect in the goods is considered to be significant.  In addition, the disadvantage may be significant under the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  The defect is manifested more than once after the product is repaired. </li><li>  Due to the existing shortage, the product becomes dangerous to human life. </li><li>  Significant time and material costs are required to eliminate this defect. </li><li>  The lack of goods reduces the beneficial effect of use due to the fact that not all mechanisms in it can function. </li></ul><h2>  Return Good Quality Goods </h2><p>  And what to do in this case?  The Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights" specifies the procedure for the return of technically complex goods of good quality that do not have shortcomings.  Nothing complicated.  There is a certain list of goods that are not subject to the general exchange rule within two weeks, if it does not fit according to certain criteria.  For example, in form, style or configuration. </p><h2>  Defined Warranty Products </h2><p>  In addition, you cannot return or exchange the following products included in the list of technically sophisticated household goods for which the warranty periods are set.  It: </p><ul><li>  Household electronic devices. </li><li>  Household woodworking and metal cutting machines. </li><li>  Household equipment and computers. </li><li>  Electric cars and household appliances. </li><li>  Cinema and photo equipment. </li><li>  Musical instruments and instruments. </li><li>  Gas household appliances and equipment. </li><li>  Telephone sets. </li><li>  Electronic toys. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Return Procedure </h2><p>  <span>Defective goods</span> can be returned or exchanged while the warranty period established by the manufacturer is valid.  This also applies to products that are not exchangeable.  If the warranty period for the goods is not established, the return may be carried out within two years after purchase. </p><p>  If after the purchase there is any deficiency in the product, the buyer must contact the store with a written complaint.  After its consideration and verification, one of the following decisions should be made: </p><ul><li>  Exchange of technically sophisticated defective goods for a similar product of good quality. </li><li>  Reviewing the price of a product with a significant drawback and its reduction, as well as paying the buyer a difference in value. </li><li>  The seller can terminate the transaction for the purchase of defective goods and make a full refund to the consumer. </li><li>  Exchange of goods for another quality product with recalculation of value. </li><li>  Troubleshooting of goods by the seller at his expense.  Repairs must be carried out within the time period that is approved by law, otherwise a penalty and fines may be imposed on the seller. </li></ul><p>  It is up to the consumer to decide which option is preferable to choose.  If the buyer wants to exchange some specific technically complex product of inadequate quality, and the desired product is not available, then the store can provide it after receipt.  If the seller violates the terms of the return, exchange or liquidation of defects, he may be held liable.  These issues must be taken very seriously.  After all, these are your rights and your money.  Be careful. </p>
