It is impossible to take your eyes off earrings, rings and beads made of this stone. </p><p>  Also on the market you can find silk products.

Here you can find branded items at incredibly low prices, however, the quality will be more like Vietnamese. </p><p>  When purchasing goods on the market, remember that it is possible and necessary to bargain here, but it is better to do it with a smile. </p>
