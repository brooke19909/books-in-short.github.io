    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The first museum on the territory of the modern <span>Penza region</span> appeared in the XVIII century.  In 1789, one of the province‚Äôs first entrepreneurs, the landowner A. I. Bakhmetev, who owned the famous crystal factory, founded a museum under him.  This institution had a small exposition, the basis of which was the best works of the masters of the enterprise.  It became the first museum of art and industrial profile in the Russian province. </p><p>  In addition, in 1892, with the money bequeathed to the former governor of Penza and the famous philanthropist N. D. Seliverstov, the third Russian provincial art gallery was founded.  In it, numerous valuable works of painting and decorative and applied art were originally exhibited to the city. </p><p>  By the beginning of the last century, small museums of the provincial scientific archival commission, as well as statistical, church and historical-archaeological committees, also functioned in Penza. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Base </h2><p>  Penza, whose local history museum is today considered one of the main attractions, in the first decade of the last century developed at an accelerated pace.  In 1905, a society of science lovers began to operate there.  At his meeting, it was decided to organize a natural history museum.  For six years, work has been carried out to create a collection.  The museum itself began to operate in February 1911.  By 1915, in his collection, there were 22,949 storage units, and in his library there were 1,818 books. </p><p>  After the establishment of Soviet power, the museum was nationalized and received the status of a state.  In 1924, he was officially reissued as a local history. </p>

    <h2>  Further story </h2><p>  An invaluable role in the formation of the collections of the Penza Museum of Local Lore, in the organization of its exposition and research work was played by N. Zaikin, N. and I. Sprygin, E. and A. Shtukenberg, B. Gvozdev, D. Protasiev and A. Magnitsky. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the institution did not stop its work for a single day.  During this period, exhibits from the evacuated Orel KM and the museum of Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev were placed in his building. </p><p>  After the end of the war, the staff of the Penza Museum of Local Lore was engaged in a fundamental reorganization of the museum exposition based on new ethnographic materials, as well as the introduction of new forms of cultural and educational activities.  In 1952, a special department of funds was created.  At that time, the museum collection already had nearly 60,000 exhibits. </p><p>  Over the years of its existence, the Museum of Local Lore (Penza, mode of operation, see below) has achieved significant success in research, exposition, exhibition, gathering, and cultural and educational activities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It has repeatedly become the venue for all-Russian meetings and seminars, as well as international scientific conferences.  In addition, its staff published more than 60 monographs, as well as thousands of collections of scientific papers, articles and several dozen books. </p><h2>  Natural Science Collection </h2><p>  Many tourists, deciding where to spend a vacation, are wondering about what is interesting Penza.  The local history museum of the city is a place where you can find answers to this question.  For example, in his natural science collection more than 10,000 objects are represented.  Acquainted with them, you will find out that fossils of the Mesozoic era were found in the region: ichthyosaurus vertebrae, lower jaw of the Mosasaur, prints on the sandstone of the Pliosaurus, etc. The museum exhibit also shows the bones of animals of the Cenozoic era - mammoth, bison, rhinoceros, giant deer, as well as zoological and ornithological collections. </p>

    <h2>  Local Lore Museum (Penza): Zoo </h2><p>  In February 2017, a new department was opened at OKM.  It became a contact zoo, where more than 50 species of animals and birds are represented, many of which can be picked up.  Children and adults enjoy communicating with monkeys, reptiles, chameleons, scorpions, chinchillas, ferrets, a huge rabbit and the largest tortoise living in Russia. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore (Penza): address </h2><p>  This cultural institution is easy to find.  It is located at: Krasnaya Street, 73. Before the October Revolution, this street was called Noble and was, as they would say today, the most prestigious in Penza.  Representatives of the richest and most notable families of the city built their dwellings on it, therefore, in the area, in addition to the Museum of Local Lore, there are other attractions.  These include old houses and an art gallery. </p>
