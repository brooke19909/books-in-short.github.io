She was the wife of <span>Prince Igor.</span>  According to one information, Olga got married in less than fifteen years.  Igor met with his future wife on a hunt and was captivated by her beauty and mind.  The annals indicate that Princess Olga was the prince's only wife, despite polygamy permitted then. </p><p>  According to some information, the future ruler of Russia bore the name of the Beautiful before marriage.  Subsequently, from Oleg she took the name Olga. </p><p>  As you know, in 945, Igor died at the hands of the Drevlyans.  His wife ascended the throne.  In the annals you can find a fairly detailed description of the revenge of the ruler for the death of her husband. </p><p>  Soon after Olga‚Äôs oracle, the drevlyans sent matchmakers to her to call her married to <span>Prince Mala.</span>  The ambassadors arrived in the boat.  Residents of Kiev took her along with the matchmakers to a huge pit in the courtyard of Olga‚Äôs tower and buried them alive. </p><p>  The following ambassadors of the Drevlyans, who arrived at the request of the ruler, were burned in the bathhouse. </p><p>  According to custom, Princess Olga arrived in the lands of the Drevlyans to celebrate a feast on her husband.  During the trip, on her orders, the Drevlins were drunk, and then chopped at the grave of Igor. </p><p>  In 946, Olga, Princess of Kiev, made an army against the Drevlyans.  After an unsuccessful siege during the summer of the city of Iskorosten (the drevlyanskoy capital), Princess Olga ordered it to be burned with the help of birds, to which incendiary mixtures were tied. </p><p>  After the victory, the ruler established <span>taxes</span> and tributes throughout the Novgorod and Pskov <span>lands</span> . </p><p>  After conquering the Drevlyans, the ruler returned to Kiev.  Princess Olga ruled until Svyatoslav came of age (her son and Igor).  However, even after she remained at the helm of the state, since her son was constantly on campaigns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The baptism of Princess Olga (in 955) is noted in the annals as "a great act."  Christianity was adopted and the ruler in Constantinople received the <span>name Helen</span> .  After returning to Kiev, Olga tried to attach Svyatoslav to the faith.  But the son was adamant and did not succumb to persuasion. </p><p>  Olga was the first ruler of Russia, <span>who converted to Christianity.</span>  According to many researchers, it was this fact that predetermined the adoption of Orthodoxy in the entire state. </p><p>  According to some legends, Olga personally received baptism from Constantine.  Elena was called her in honor of the mother of the emperor - the holy queen Helena.  According to some reports, Konstantin married to Olga before baptism.  However, the wise ruler pointed out that Christians should not be married to the Gentiles.  Then Olga was baptized.  The emperor again called her to marry.  But this time, Olga refused the tsar, since marriage was impossible - she became his godmother. </p><p>  Other sources indicate that Princess II was baptized by Princess II (co-ruler of Constantine), as well as Patriarch Polievkt. </p><p>  Since Svyatoslav was on campaigns almost all the time, his mother had to rule the state.  In 968, the Pechenegs made their first foray into Russian land.  Olga with children Svyatoslav took refuge in Kiev.  Soon, the son lifted the siege.  However, Svyatoslav did not intend to stay in Kiev for long.  In 969, he was going on a new campaign, but Olga stopped him.  By that time, she was seriously ill.  Three days later, Olga died. </p><p>  The ruler bequeathed to bury herself according to the Christian tradition and not to serve a trident. </p><p>  According to historians, they began to venerate Saint Princess Olga during the reign of Vladimir the Baptist.  According to information, in 1007, the prince transferred the relics of all the saints (including Olga) to the Church of the Holy Virgin, built by him in Kiev. </p><p>  Around that time, began to mark the day of memory of the ruler of July 11/24.  At the same time, official canonization (general church glorification) occurred, apparently, somewhat later - in the middle of the 13th century.  In 1547, Olga (Elena) was canonized. </p>
