They allow you to take a break from the noise of cars and breathe clean air.  You can get to the park at any time of the year to be alone with nature.  Tula also boasts of having such a place.  Platonov Park is very successful, so there are always visitors in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="global71.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fountain in the park" class="if uuid-2444221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/2444221.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Platonovsky Park in Tula owes its appearance to a man who has done a lot of good both for the city and for other people.  Ignat Platonov had many ranks, including a <span>merchant of the first guild,</span> an honorary citizen of the city and others.  He made his investments in these lands to ennoble them.  Thanks to the merchant, trees appeared, as well as several fish ponds.  Among other notable cases of Platonov was the maintenance of a hospital for the poor in Tula, which he actively helped. </p><div class="photo" data-original="greenword.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flora and fauna in the park" class="if uuid-2444218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/2444218.jpg"></div><p>  In modern years there was a forest, which later became a resting place.  Now Platonovsky Park in Tula is very popular among the townspeople.  Here you can often see families with children for a walk, weddings.  Photoshoots for the celebration are especially spectacular here, because this is facilitated by beautiful nature.  The gazebo in the park is very popular.  Many newlyweds have already managed to visit here before starting a life together.  On the territory there is also a pond, near which it is always nice to walk, watching the smooth surface of the water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the park </h2><p>  Not only people living nearby come to the place of rest, but also those who live in other areas.  Tourists also often come to the park to get acquainted with its territories. </p><p>  The address of Platonovsky Park in Tula: General Margelov Street.  There are several convenient ways to get to your destination: </p><ul><li>  on the minibus at number 9, get off at the Platonovsky Les stop; </li><li>  by bus number 18 or minibus number 62, get off at the stop "General Margelova Street". </li></ul><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.153792" data-lng="37.578543999999965" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/8/6/7/2867.png"></div><h2>  Landscaping </h2><p>  <span>Residents of Tula</span> have spent quite a lot of energy to make the park well-groomed and accessible for walking.  Some time ago there was a restaurant on the territory, and then the place was watched.  However, this did not make the park a complete vacation spot.  The earth began to overgrow with a wild forest, and appeared a windbreak.  But the words of the townspeople were heard, so a project appeared to improve the territory.  The work did not begin immediately, but the first stage was completed by the anniversary of the city.  The reconstruction of the Platonov Park in Tula markedly changed it.  A lot of dead wood and garbage were taken out from there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diary.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gazebo in the park" class="if uuid-2444182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/2444182.jpg"></div><p>  Gradually, the place began to come to life.  People can now walk along the alleys, relax on benches and return in the evening from work by the light of lanterns.  Platonovsky Park in Tula has two zones for culture and walks.  An embankment was built at the pond, a fountain, a playground and rotundas appeared.  Now the place is gathering many citizens who are desperately fighting for the improvement of this place.  Now other projects continue to develop.  They will be associated with the coverage and development of sports infrastructure. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  The townspeople are delighted that they have a decent place to relax.  Therefore, on the Internet you can see many photos of Platonovsky Park in Tula.  People visit the park quite often.  Because here you can enjoy nature and fresh air.  A considerable number of visitors write that they try to come here every week.  Couples before the wedding often come here with the photographer to pre-select locations for filming.  Beautiful nature attracts all lovers of taking photos here.  After all, they always turn out very original and spectacular.  At any time of the year, the park is beautiful in its own way. </p>
