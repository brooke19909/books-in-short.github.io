    <p>  Travelers who find themselves in Barcelona (in search of excursions or travel) must certainly go to the magic fountain of Montjuic.  Even the most sophisticated tourists claim that for half an hour admiring this miracle will leave an indelible mark on the traveler‚Äôs heart and memory. </p><h2>  Magic Fountain of Montjuic </h2><p>  The famous fountain of Barcelona is a real extravaganza, which merges together dancing water streams, the play of light and the bewitching sounds of music.  This creation is located at the very foot of the National Palace on the famous Montjuic hill (for which, in fact, it received such a resounding name).  The history of this miracle of the world dates back almost a hundred years, and from this the fountain seems even more amazing.  Many travelers come to Barcelona for the sole purpose of seeing the magical fountain of Montjuic with their own eyes. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The construction of this massive building began back in 1929, when, in preparation for the world exhibition, the authorities realized that the city lacked a highlight, the very sight that would bewitching and captivating at first sight.  A young architect Carlos Bugiagas joined in the search for a solution to this problem.  He presented a draft of the fountain, which at that time could be called impossible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Despite the fact that almost no one believed the creative engineer, he did not even think of abandoning such a bold project.  About 3,000 builders worked under his leadership, who did the almost impossible - they completed the project on May 19, 1929.  They miraculously managed before the start of the exhibition. </p><h2>  Fountain now </h2><p>  The famous magic fountain of Montjuic has been working properly to this day, however, for many years he suffered more than one change.  So, until the 80s of the last century, observers were pleased only with the dancing of jets and the murmur of water.  After they began to use music during the show.  Before the 1992 Olympics, the fountain was completely reconstructed, giving it its former chic and grandeur.  In addition, since then, the construction began to expend water more economically.  Characteristically, during the reconstruction, none of the many original mechanisms were affected. </p><h2>  Technical features </h2><p>  It is impossible to ignore the technical description of the magic fountain of Montjuic, since without it it is simply impossible to imagine all the splendor and uniqueness of this design.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fountain is truly impressive.  It reaches 3,000 square meters, while the structure is capable of passing about 2.5 tons of water through itself per second.  To provide sufficient power, 5 powerful pumps are involved in work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The fountain consists of 3620 separate sources of water, from which streams break out and create the feeling of really dancing jets.  The highest geysers fly up to a height of 50 meters, which can be compared to a 16-story building. </p><h2>  Backlight </h2><p>  This fountain was not called magic at all by chance.  In addition to amazing cascades of water and singing, it boasts a completely unusual lighting.  Unlike the thousands of other fountains in the world that are simply illuminated by multi-colored lamps, the Montjuic fountain emits just a fabulous magical radiance.  The ceramic-metal filters and the high power of the jets that burst from sources provide such an unusual effect.  To create a colorful show, 4760 special light sources are used, which are presented in 50 different colors and shades. </p><h2>  Music </h2><p>  The musical accompaniment used during the show is quite diverse.  Among the compositions there are both classical works and modern hits.  For many years, at the climax, the song ‚ÄúBarcelona‚Äù, performed by Montserrat Caballe and Freddie Mercury, invariably sounded.  In these moments, viewers forget about everything in the world, trying to capture every detail of this amazingly bright event in their memory. </p>

    <p>  According to tourists, in 20 minutes the show manages to change several musical compositions, hundreds of forms of water flows and the same color shades.  The only thing that can overshadow at such a moment is a really large crowd of people and difficulties in finding the best place to review the performance.  In other words, the magic fountain of Montjuic in Barcelona is one of those few attractions in the world that simply cannot leave its guests indifferent.  Everyone who has ever seen this holiday show from afar, certainly advises all other tourists to do it. </p>
