    <p>  Human activity is distinguished by a social and transformative nature, as well as productivity and consciousness.  This distinguishes us from the behavior of other living beings within the framework established by nature. </p><p>  We consciously put forward our goals, which allows us to predict the final result.  Our behavior leads to the receipt of products, benefits.  For this, a person uses various tools.  The transforming nature of human labor allows you to change yourself, as well as the surrounding reality.  The social nature of the activity is manifested in the ability to make contacts and in cooperation to produce common benefits for all. </p><h2>  Human needs </h2><p>  By creating the necessary conditions for existence, a person satisfies his needs.  People experience and realize their need in certain conditions created to support life, as well as personal development. </p><p>  Needs are most often grouped into 3 groups.  This is a natural, social and ideal need of a person to create specific conditions for his existence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Natural needs are given to us by nature.

    <p>  The highest stage is cultural needs.  This allows a person to develop their spiritual abilities, talents, and also to know the world around them. </p><h2>  Relationship needs </h2><p>  When studying activity as a way of human existence, attention should be paid to the interaction of needs.  All three categories discussed above are interconnected.  For example, in satisfying his needs for food, a person takes care of a variety of dishes, aesthetics of the table, the beauty and cleanliness of cutlery, a pleasant society, etc. </p><p>  A feature of human nature is an extremely rare state of complete satisfaction of their needs.  If some need is satisfied, another pops up, capturing his attention and forcing him to direct his efforts to a certain area. </p>

    <p>  Needs also have their own hierarchy.  Until natural <span>needs</span> are satisfied <span>, a person</span> does not pay attention to his social and cultural needs.

All our actions are determined by purpose.  To achieve it, a person uses certain means.  This allows you to get the desired result. </p><p>  The goal is the awareness of the consequences, the achievement of which is directed by human forces.  First, the mental contours of the future product or result arise.  Next, a person thinks what means will help him to reach his desired goal. </p>

    <p>  Using the necessary tools, gaining certain knowledge and skills, a person receives a result.  It can be both material and spiritual benefits.  This person desires consciously. </p><h2>  Main activities </h2><p>  Activity as a way of existence of a person and society has several main directions.  They are classified according to various criteria.  First of all, the process of creation can be practical or spiritual.  It depends on our attitude to the world that surrounds us. </p><p>  When a person‚Äôs consciousness changes, it is a matter of spiritual activity.  Transforming the material objects that exist in our reality, people carry out practical actions. </p><p>  Activities can also be progressive and reactionary.  This is due to the course of history and the development of the personality of each member of society.  Our efforts may also be constructive or destructive. </p>

    <p>  Activities are legal or prohibited, acceptable and immoral.  The formation of these varieties was influenced by the basic norms of morality, general cultural values. </p><p>  On a social basis distinguish mass, collective or individual work.  It is creative, innovative, template, monotonous or inventive, etc. </p><h2>  Motivation </h2><p>  Motivation of activity is the reason why a person puts forward a particular goal, is engaged in certain work.  It is this explanation that drives us to create or destroy. </p><p>  The motive is motivation.  Sometimes, various reasons lead to the performance of the same type of activity.  For example, a group of people is reading a book.  One of them does this because he has a craving for new knowledge.  Another person reads in order to take his free time.  A third representative of the group is engaged in this activity in order to earn the approval of other members of the group. </p>

    <p>  It happens that the same motive leads to different activities.  For example, wanting to earn the recognition of society, a person can show his abilities in the production, sports or social sphere, etc. The variety of motives and goals determines the overall activity. </p><h2>  Activity awareness </h2><p>  Activity as a way of human existence is a conscious process.  However, the degree of this knowledge may be different.  Motives are formed under the influence of interests, needs, as well as beliefs of a person.  They give meaning to action. </p><p>  The whole process of a person‚Äôs work to achieve his goals consists of a sequence of certain acts.  They are called action.  For example, in the process of obtaining education, we read certain literature, listen to lectures by teachers, write down the material presented by them, solve problems and follow the instructions of teachers. </p><p>  When a goal is set and at the same time a person presents its result, as well as the procedure for performing actions using specific means is established, this is called a conscious activity. </p><p>  However, in reality, this process may go beyond goals and motivations.  Strong feelings, emotions can influence actions.  However, awareness of the goal may be absent.  This causes impulsive actions.  Such activity is called unconscious. </p><h2>  Stimulation </h2><p>  In the process of a person‚Äôs work in various directions, motivation and stimulation of activity arise.  If the motive is the reason why we carry out certain actions, then stimulation is a reward.  This gives the activity efficiency. </p><p>  Motivation and stimulation are a strategy.  They mutually complement each other.  For example, an enterprise can simultaneously improve working conditions, while increasing wages.  Complexity gives a good result. </p><p>  But stimulation and motivation can also confront each other.  For example, wages increased by 5%, but inflation was 10%.  Productivity for this reason has decreased.  The motivation mechanism should be adequate to the stimulation process. </p><p>  Having studied what constitutes activity as a way of human existence, we can realize the essence of this concept, as well as delve into its features. </p>
