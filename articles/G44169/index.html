    <p>  However, in general, this province is characterized by an attractive ratio of quality of services and their prices for holiday-makers.  For example: the approximate price of a weekly tour for two adults at the Annabella Diamond Spa 5 * hotel in April 2015 is $ 1,125.  Thus, the five-star vacationers buy less than $ 100 per person per day. </p><h2>  Note: Alanya climate </h2><p>  For a quality vacation, holidaymakers should be adequately taken into account the weather. </p><p>  Alanya (Turkey) is characterized by an average annual temperature of +20 <sup>0</sup>  and humidity close to 65%.  The southern part of this province is considered the warmest resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTurkey, as it is protected from the winds by the picturesque Taurus Mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spa hotel" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/721795.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resort season of Alanya takes a period of time from April to October, respectively, the swimming season here lasts about 300 days.  The most popular summer months for tourists.  The air temperature at this time is in the range + 26‚Äì33 <sup>0</sup> C. The water temperature, respectively, from June to the end of October is + 25‚Äì27 <sup>0</sup> C. </p><p>  Thus, for the vast majority of vacationers, due to its climatic conditions, according to indications for their health, Alanya is suitable. </p><p>  Tours here are relatively inexpensive, and resort opportunities are differentiated for every taste.  It is also important for a tourist to correctly select a travel agency, which you can really entrust with your holidays, flights, insurance, and excursions. </p><p>  We recommend choosing a tour operator or travel agency, after selecting those who have been working on the market for several years.  There are other choices, for example, on the tour operator‚Äôs website checked in advance, you can specify only the price that you are willing to pay for the tour.  In this case, you will be offered a number of hotels with a different number of stars.  However, it‚Äôs more practical and safe to still buy a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù tour from the selected operator - to a specific hotel. </p><h2>  About Incekum </h2><p>  Alanya Province is quite large.  We will limit our choice to Incekum resort, 25 km away from the famous Mediterranean resort of Alanya.  Hotel Annabella Diamond <span>Hotel Spa 5 *</span> - the subject of this article - is located here, one and a half kilometers from the nearest village of Avsallar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star Alanya hotels" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/721801.jpg" width="560"></div>

This is a rapidly growing resort village, where there are numerous shops, restaurants and, of course, hotels.  "Alanya, 5 stars" - in a similar resort advertisement, new hotels of the 3rd-4th generations of Inzhekuma, part of the resort region of Alanya, look more and more attractive. </p><h2>  Unique natural areas </h2><p>  The word "Incekum" in Turkish means "thin sand".  Indeed, pure golden, perfectly clean sand, periodically cleaned by hotel beach machines - the calling card of Annabella Diamond.  Nature here is favorable for a calm, measured rest.  Around - majestic mountains and fragrant pine forests.  A tape of beaches is just perfect.  So with the natural surroundings, the Annabella Diamond Hotel Spa 5 * hotel was just lucky.  In ancient times, the legendary Queen Cleopatra liked these places. </p><p>  The relatively young resort of Incekum has now significantly developed its infrastructure.  It is considered an ideal peaceful place for a comfortable family vacation.  And the hotel we have chosen, thanks to the developed children's infrastructure, the solid work of its mini-club, is an ideal place for the relaxation of the youngest tourists. </p><h2>  About the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel complex of the first line Annabella Diamond Hotel Spa 5 * was built in 2012.  An area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 thousand square meters is allocated for it.  It is a single seven-story building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Annabella Diamond Hotel offers a variety of whirlpool bathtubs with healing salts, algae and mud, individually selected by experienced professionals in intensity and temperature, a Turkish hammam, steam room, sauna, Vichy shower, a wide range of massages, stone and acupuncture. </p><p>  All this is very dignified.  Clients in their reviews about the spa hotel, in addition to improving the general condition of the body, also note <span>aesthetic pleasure,</span> thanks to the additional use of scented candles and oils, lighting, music. </p><h2>  Beach description </h2><p>  The hotel beach is located directly next to the hotel complex.  He is beautiful: the azure sea and golden manicured sand.  The beach is cleaned daily.  Judging by customer reviews, he is perfect.  Broad is its sandy strip. </p><p>  Sun loungers, umbrellas, mattresses are issued to guests of the aforementioned hotel for free.  Regarding <span>beach towels,</span> in fact - they are also free, but they are issued only on the security of money.  There is a beach hotel buffet nearby. </p><p>  The entrance to the water is smooth, gradual, which is convenient for children.  The bottom is sandy.  The water is clear and visible at a depth of 8 meters.  Generally speaking, hotels with sandy beaches, convenient for families with children, are the hallmark of Inzekum.  In particular, here is located one of the best in the Mediterranean - <span>Cleopatra's beach,</span> which we strongly recommend visiting.  To do this, it is preferable than from a tour operator to buy this tour at travel agencies.  However, there are options even more profitable. </p><h2>  Excursions - to guests of Turkey </h2><p>  According to tourists, one of the most popular <span>excursions in Turkey</span> is a visit to the thermal springs of Pamukkale and the city cut out in the rocks - Cappadocia.  These excursions are quite long, it takes 2 days.  For their implementation, travel agent services are required. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels with sandy beaches" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/721794.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <p>  The mineral waters of Pamukkale formed a natural cascade of snow-white pools.  Here, the ancient Romans recovered.  According to legend, here Queen Cleopatra herself took healing baths. </p><p>  Cappadocia is famous for its underground rocky cities with complex architecture, water supply, sewage. </p><h2>  Excursions on your own.  Alanya </h2><p>  The most creative tourists organize excursions on their own using their English vocabulary and advice from local residents.  A bus runs from Avsallar to Alanya every 10 minutes.  It takes about 1 hour to get to Alanya Bus Station.  The fare is 4.5 lira per person.  Here at the station, the exchange rate of $ for lira is more profitable than in the exchangers of Avsallar. </p><p>  From here we recommend taking a bus number 4 to the Ich-Kale fortress.  He walks in an hour, the ticket price is 2 lira.  The road to the fortress takes about half an hour, the ticket price is 2 lira.  You will pay 10 lira per person for entering the fortress.  Then we recommend that, going down the mountain, walk about 3 km towards the salt cave (tourist attraction) and the famous Cleopatra Beach.  Bonus - wonderful landscapes.  On the way - descent to the Kzyl Kule tower (Red Tower).  The entrance to the cave is 4.5 lira.  Right in front of the cave is Cleopatra Beach.  He is considered the best in the resort of Alanya.  The sea and sand here are perfect, the service is wonderful.  The blue flag beach itself extends over two kilometers.  There are many cafes and restaurants here ... However, returning to the Annabella Diamond Hotel, it should be noted that the last bus from the cave to the Alanya bus station leaves at 20.00.  From there, it is easier to get to Avsallar: buses run until 1am. </p><p>  We add that the locals are good-natured and, answering your questions, will be happy to advise you. </p><h2>  Self-guided tour.  Side </h2><p>  Those wishing to take a tour with an overview of the unique buildings of the ancient world, we recommend visiting the open-air museum - Side.  From Alanya, it can be reached in 50 minutes by dolmushe (distance - 43 km). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="annabella diamond hotel alanya" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/721800.jpg" width="560"></div>
