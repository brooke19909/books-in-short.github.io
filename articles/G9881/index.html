    <p>  So away doubt and uncertainty!  A little perseverance, attention, time and a minimum of financial costs, and a stunning outfit will be ready. </p><h2>  Simplicity of cut is the key to success </h2><p>  Evening dresses on the floor, the patterns of which have many details, you need to immediately sweep away.  Such work can only be done by professional seamstresses.  It is better for beginners to choose simple models made of fabrics embroidered with beads, stones or sequins.  These canvases can not be combined in any way with a complex cut with many embossed seams, the performance of which the beginner will be practically unable to do.  And the outfit with this combination will be overloaded.  Therefore, for the product it is best to choose the simplest cut.  Tucks on the chest and waist, as well as cutouts on the back and decollete, are all that is needed to create a win-win option. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The fabric is everything </h2><p>  Today on sale you can find just a huge number of fabrics for evening wear.  A variety of colors, textures and design solutions for the design of the canvas is simply amazing in its chic.  And to dwell on any one option is very difficult. </p><p>  In order not to get lost, you need to immediately outline your preferred color scheme, which is most suitable for the color of your hair and complexion.  And you should also decide on the layering of the dress.  This can be a model made of one layer of fabric (for example, velvet, oil, brocade, guipure based, and so on) or multilayer when combining several balls of chiffon, mesh or lace fabric with a base fabric.  Quite often, combinations of paintings are used, for example, guipure or lace with chiffon or oil, as well as velvet or velor with mesh, thanks to which simply <span>elegant evening dresses</span> go to the floor.  Patterns of such products are simple in execution, the main thing is only to understand the principle of work.  And then only imagination will limit the possibilities. </p>

    <h2>  Base pattern: building the rear shelf </h2><p>  Pattern <span>evening dresses</span> in the floor of a straight and fitted silhouette is built on a basic basis.  First you should measure the figure.  It will require data on the volume of the chest, waist, hips, shoulder width, neck circumference.  You must also know the solution of tucks and the height of the chest, the length of the back and front (through the center of the chest) to the waist, as well as the length of the product from the waist to the bottom of the hem. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The construction takes place in a rectangle.  In it, the vertical side is the length of the product, and the horizontal is equal to the volume of the chest + 2 cm. The first stage is the markup.  Here, on the drawing, the line of the chest should be designated, which is located in accordance with the vertical measurement ‚Äúchest height.  Further the waist is planned.  It should be noted here that the main strip is drawn in accordance with the measure "back length to waist".  After, during the construction process, on the front half of the dress, this length is adjusted for the correct distribution of the tuck-in darts. </p><p>  Further along the line of the chest, the width of the back and armhole is noted (the volume of the chest divided by 4 + 2 cm).  Next, at the top of the rectangle, ¬º neck girth measurements are noted.  From this point they rise upwards by 1.5 cm. Then the neck of the back is removed.  After you should continue the shoulder seam.  To do this, 1.5 cm deviate from the horizontal lift point and draw a shoulder, which should also deviate at the extreme point by 1.5 cm from the upper side of the rectangle.  After they draw a tuck of the back.  You can see its location in the photo proposed in the article. </p><p>  Pattern evening <span>dresses on the floor with an open back</span> is built on this basic basis.  Here you just need to simulate a little by drawing the necessary depth of cut directly on the drawing. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Dress pattern:</span> building the front shelf </h2><p>  The front shelf of the pattern for the dress is built as simple as the rear.  First, the center is determined on the line of the chest, laying aside on the auxiliary line ¬Ω part of the measure ‚Äútuck solution‚Äù.  After, the perpendicular is raised to the top.  Having retreated on the upper side of the rectangle from the intersection point of 2.5 cm, draw a tuck for the chest in the form of a triangle with a vertex in the center.  After that, draw the shoulder seam of the front shelf, which is 2.5 cm below the upper side of the rectangle. The extreme point should be at a distance of 3.5 - 4 cm from the side of the rectangle. </p><h2>  Dress pattern: armhole and side seam </h2><p>  After the upper part of the pattern is ready, you should determine the middle of the armpit zone, put a point, shifted 2 cm from it and draw, rounded the corners of the drawing, the line of the armhole.  After from this point you should lower down the vertical.  Further, tucks should be noted at the waist.  To do this, determine the difference in the volume of the chest and waist, divide it by 3 and draw on the side seam and in the middle of the shelves.  The lower peaks should not reach the hips by 4 cm, the upper ones will be located on the chest line. </p><p>  Further, from the waistline, draw a side seam to the bottom, which on the thigh line should correspond to half of this measure. </p><p>  These schemes help create evening dresses on the floor.  Patterns from the photos presented in this article will help to better understand the drawings. </p>
