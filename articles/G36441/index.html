In order to make a specific list, you can use customer reviews: </p><ul><li>  Cost.  Domestic consumer considers the price factor paramount.  It so happened that in Russia not every person is able to purchase vacuum cleaners, focusing only on technical and functional criteria.  As you know, many budget models are able to work out just a few months.  That is why Zanussi products remain unrivaled.  It is in the middle price category. </li><li>  Dimensions  Vacuum cleaner models are small.  Their weight is calculated optimally.  Given these factors, it is not only easy to clean surfaces with a vacuum cleaner, but also without difficulty it can be moved to any place. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner zanussi" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1448840.jpg" width="282"></div></li><li>  Convenience of design.  Wheels are installed on the case, which greatly facilitate the movement of the device during operation.  It is also worth noting the location of the main buttons and their size.  They are located on the upper part, quite large.  This allows you to even turn on the Zanussi vacuum cleaner with your foot.  1800W, 1600W, 1400W, 2000W - power consumption, data about which are indicated directly on the case.  The cord of the device is twisted inward using a special mechanism.  In order for it to return to its initial position, you only need to press the appropriate button. </li><li>  Design.  The last criterion of benefits, according to buyers, is the appearance.  All models are ideal for both the younger generation and older people.  Cases are presented in different colors.  All shades are bright and contrasting.  Basically, two or three colors are used in the design.  In bagless vacuum cleaners, the trash bin is made of clear plastic. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Unfortunately, everything cannot be cloudless.  The Zanussi vacuum cleaner, however, like the apparatus of other brands, has advantages as well as advantages.  Let's consider which ones: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Noise level.  Many people, leaving reviews, noticed that during operation the vacuum cleaner makes a very loud sound.  Of course, this is accompanied by certain inconveniences. </li><li>  Garbage container.  As mentioned above, the devices are small.  Naturally, this affects the dimensions of individual parts.  The trash bin will fill up very quickly, and this leads to a decrease in efficiency during operation.  Therefore, sometimes you have to stop the vacuum cleaner in order to carry out cleaning. </li><li>  Cord length.  This indicator varies from 4 to 8 meters, depending on the model.  Many consumers, buying a vacuum cleaner with a four-meter cord, noticed that during the cleaning of a standard apartment the device has to be switched several times to other outlets. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bagless vacuum cleaner" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1448844.jpg" width="309"></div></li><li>  HEPA filter for the Zanussi vacuum cleaner.  This type of filter is installed on almost all models.  In a clean state, it copes with its task perfectly, but when clogged, the dust suction power decreases, an unpleasant odor appears in the room.  Even there are versions that there is a likelihood of contracting viral diseases. </li><li>  The quality of the plastic.  Unfortunately, the lower cost of vacuum cleaners has led some materials to be very fragile.  For example, a garbage container.  It is made of fragile plastic.  Therefore, you must handle it with extreme care. </li></ul><h2>  Zanussi ZAN3020 </h2><p>  The Zanussi vacuum cleaner ZAN3020 is commercially available.  Its cost varies within $ 50.  The device is a model made in a simple modern design.  The case is solid, the buttons are gray.  The dust collector is designed for garbage volume of 1 liter, type - bag.
