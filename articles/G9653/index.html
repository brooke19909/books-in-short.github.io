Under Catherine II, these territories were inhabited by Volga Germans (many historical monuments testify to this).  Here are the ruins of the old Lutheran church, the old mill and the village school are preserved, the old houses of the Germans in different conditions are found throughout the park.  At the beginning of World War II, the <span>Volga Germans</span> were forcibly taken out of these places, and entire settlements fell into decay.  You should definitely visit the memorial site "Gagarinskoe Pole" - the <span>place where the</span> first person who visited space, Yuri Gagarin <span>, landed</span> .

And all because it is here, on its shores, that a third of Russia's population lives.  The name of the river comes from the Old Slavonic word "moisture".  Once, due to its geographical location near the Volga, Moscow became the center of Russia, the capital of the Russian state.  It is a beautiful, powerful river with decent depths and picturesque islands.  It is inhabited by 76 species of fish and 47 subspecies.  The Volga is used as the largest transport highway, and upstream, it supplies bread, salt, fish, oil, coal, and metals.  Down deliver wood, construction and industrial materials.  Therefore, it is of great industrial and agricultural importance for the country.  Since the 30s of the last century, hydroelectric power stations have also been built on the Volga.  Today there are 9 of them in its waters. Of course, all this leads to serious environmental problems that local ecologists are working on.  The Volga has a significant place in Russian culture, in Russian folklore; it is called the Mother River.  Many songs and poems have been written about her, the great Russian river has become one of the symbols of a vast country. </p><h2>  Saratov region on the map </h2>
