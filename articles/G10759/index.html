    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel complex was built in 1999.  But the building, like what is inside it, looks modern and new.  After all, the last restoration was carried out 4 years ago.  And cosmetic repairs are done here regularly. </p><p>  Be Live Collection Canoa 5 * is located in the southeastern part of La Romana, near the fishing village of Bayahibe.  Near the hotel is located East National Park - one of the main local attractions.  One airport, Aeropuerto Internacional de La Romana, is a 30-minute drive away.  The second, located in Punta Cana, is a little further away.  It takes about 75 minutes to get to it.  And the third airport is located in Santo Domingo.  From him to the hotel to get an hour and a half. </p><p>  But what is here in close proximity to the complex is the beach.  To be more precise, the hotel is located right on it.  The territory of the hotel, consisting of separate buildings, is huge, but well-groomed, planted with greenery and vegetation.  By the way, there are 871 (!) Rooms in the hotel.  But, despite such a number of apartments, the hotel is rarely empty.  And this testifies to her level and prestige. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service list </h2><p>  The Be Live Collection Canoa 5 * has everything that guests can use: private parking, two large conference rooms (with a capacity of 320 people), a pharmacy, a hairdresser, a car rental service, laundry, dry cleaning, a small theater, a medical center, several shops (one of which is a souvenir), a beauty salon, even a business center.  All this is here. </p><p>  But this is not the whole list of services.  Naturally, there is a camera where guests can leave their belongings, an excursion bureau, concierge services, a currency exchange office, an ATM, as well as a 24-hour reception, where they can conduct individual check-in. </p><p>  It also provides services for people with disabilities.  There are bridal suites and non-smoking rooms.  And, of course, VIP services at a hotel of this level are also available.  The staff speaks not only Spanish, but also Italian and English.  There is no Russian in this list yet - there are not so many tourists from Russia in the Dominican Republic. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  In the end, it‚Äôs worth saying a few words about the reviews that leave about the Be Live Collection Canoa 5 * hotel.  Most of them are positive. </p><p>  Many people pay attention to the territory.  Beautiful, large, well-groomed - there is a mass of tropical vegetation and animals.  Peacocks, geese and ducks walk around the territory, and turtles and fish live in artificial reservoirs.  This adds a special touch. </p><p>  The staff is polite and attentive.  Daily cleaning, linen is changed 3-4 times a week.  Towels on request.  Fresh bottled water is left in the rooms every day, cosmetic supplies are replenished regularly. </p><p>  I‚Äôm also glad that they can change the number for free if they don‚Äôt like something.  And it is better to take apartments in remote buildings from the pool and not on the first floors - there is quieter. </p><p>  And, of course, the beach.  He's perfect here.  Firstly, marked with a blue flag for cleanliness.  Secondly, the sea has a beautiful bottom.  Thirdly, there is never algae here, even if there was a storm or rain.  And yet, which is important for many, there are many sun loungers.  So everyone will find a place for relaxation on the beach. </p><p>  If we draw conclusions, we can confidently say - this is a resort for people who want to not deny anything to themselves during their holidays, enjoy a beach holiday.  The hotel is ideal for this type of vacation - many tourists have already confirmed this. </p>
