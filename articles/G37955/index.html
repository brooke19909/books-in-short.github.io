In their dreams, this process proceeds <span>without a hitch,</span> and at the end you get stunning wardrobe items that conquer all those around you with their beauty and elegance.  However, in practice, this business most often turns into a complete failure. </p><p>  For most beginning tailors, the greatest difficulty is the construction of the technical drawing of the product and the patterns by which its elements will be created.  But in fact, you can sew easily without patterns or using elementary patterns that even first-graders can create.  In this article, we will just talk about what even inexperienced couturiers can make with their own hands.  So, today we sew <span>simple dresses,</span> skirts, trousers and bags without a pattern.  Our article proposes the manufacture of ten things that will appeal to any fashionista and probably will not gather dust in the closet without work! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.merricksart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sundress without a pattern" class="if uuid-2500870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500870.jpg"></div><h2>  Long dress </h2><p>  Our hit parade will begin with a very beautiful maxi dress made of fine knitwear.  In this outfit, you can safely go to the beach or take a walk to the store, also this mother should pay attention to expectant mothers.  Thanks to her simple and free cut, she will suit all the girls! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We sew this dress without a pattern - it will be replaced by an ordinary T-shirt, suitable in size.  The amount of fabric for a sundress depends on how long the finished product will be.  The store should be asked to make a cut equal to the length of the dress, plus 5 cm for processing slices.  The cloth is folded in half so that the fabric stretches in width, and not in length, then in its upper part it is necessary to put a T-shirt and draw a chalk around its outline in the neckline and armhole.  The side lines are extended to the very bottom, while the sundress is made a little flared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.merricksart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do-it-yourself beach sundress without a pattern" class="if uuid-2500899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500899.jpg"></div><p>  First you need to stitch the side seams, then the sundress is sewn along the shoulder line, the cut sections are cut in the front, back and in the armholes.  Lastly, the hem of the product is hemmed.  That's so easy and simple we sew without patterns a very beautiful dress.  Each girl will be able to do it. </p><h2>  Spaghetti Strap Dress </h2><p>  What else can you do yourself without a pattern?  We sew a dress bag on the straps of a wide ribbon!  There are two options for this model.  The first photo shows a gray dress, which is sewn from a rectangular cut of fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="agulhadeouroatelie.blogspot.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a short dress without a pattern" class="if uuid-2500871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500871.jpg"></div><p>  Directly along the fabric, you need to draw a rectangle, the length of which will be equal to the width of the product plus a few centimeters for seams and freedom of fitting.  For the reference point, you need to take either the volume of the hips, or the volume of the chest (which is larger).  The width of the rectangle is the length of the dress, plus 5 cm for hem hem and 10 cm, which will go to create a drawstring.  A ribbon will be threaded through it, draping fabric into beautiful folds and playing the role of shoulder straps.  Recall that we sew this dress without patterns.  First, the fabric is shortened sideways, then the hem is processed, and lastly, the upper part of the product is formed by double folding. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="agulhadeouroatelie.blogspot.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to easily sew a dress" class="if uuid-2501946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2501946.jpg"></div><p>  The second version of the dress is a bit more difficult to sew.  The upper picture shows a step-by-step master class on its manufacture.  This dress has an armhole.  To form it, you can, like for a sundress from the previous section, use a T-shirt, along which you will need to draw around the contours of the top of the product.  First, the armhole is processed, then the top of the front and back are already bent.  Only after that the details are sewn together and the hem is lined up. </p><h2>  Beach dress </h2><p>  Now we will learn how to sew a <span>dress for a beach</span> or a sauna easily and simply without patterns.  It can also be worn at home.  This model has a semi-tight silhouette, so for sewing it is better to use stretching cotton fabrics - knitwear or terry on a knitted basis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="We sew a dress without a pattern" class="if uuid-2500866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500866.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see from the picture, our dress is just a rectangular piece of fabric with cutouts for the hands on both sides.  The cut must be hemmed around the perimeter using a sewing machine, it is also recommended to process the places through which the hands are threaded.  This will prevent the fabric from shedding and make the product more accurate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Short skirt with elastic band </h2><p>  Skirts are indispensable items in any women's wardrobe.  They can be long or short, narrow or loose, straight or flared - there is simply an unlimited number of models, each of which is good in its own way.  Some of them are real works of tailor's art, but there are skirts among them that can be sewn easily and simply without patterns.  For example, such a model as in the following photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deco.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a skirt without a pattern" class="if uuid-2500872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500872.jpg"></div><p>  Her length can be adjusted depending on the height of the girl and the type of her figure.  The option we proposed is a skirt reaching the top of the knee.  For it, you will need to prepare a piece of fabric with a length of about 65 cm. The length of the finished product is 45 cm. </p><p>  This skirt is sewn very quickly and simply.  First you need to cut the new thing, taking a piece of fabric, which in width will be equal to the volume of the hips plus 5 cm for seams and freedom of fitting, and in height - the desired length of the skirt plus 10 cm. </p><p>  The first step is double hem processing the hem of the product.  It is better to put in at least 1.5-2.5 cm, so the bottom of the skirt will look more presentable.  Next, you need to choose the length of the skirt and set aside this distance from the folded cut.  Another 5 cm is measured from this line, the excess fabric is cut off, and the product blank is ironed along the hemline of the belt and hemmed.  Then you need to make a side seam, but do not wrap the belt so that elastic tape can be inserted there.  Sections at the side seams are best wrapped with an overlock or zigzag so that they do not crumble while wearing a skirt.  When the elastic is inserted in the belt, the hole must be sewn up using a machine or manually. </p><h2>  Shirt blouse </h2><p>  Next, we will manufacture a beautiful elongated blouse, and this time we will also do without patterns.  We sew a product from two ready-made things - an old shirt and a tight knitted T-shirt or T-shirt.  In addition, we need a finishing braid for edging the neck and decorating the connecting seam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aubouillonleon.canalblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a blouse from a shirt" class="if uuid-2500869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500869.jpg"></div><p>  From the shirt you need to cut off the upper part - it will no longer be useful.  The back and front part are narrowed in shape, while the shelves with buttons go back, and the back panel turns into the front of the blouse. </p><p>  From a t-shirt you need to make a bodice with a round neckline and a back with a deep V-neck.  Armholes are enclosed and built up.  The neck is machined.  Then you need to compare the upper and lower parts of the blouse, sweep them together and sew on a sewing machine.  Over the stitching on the front side of the product, a finishing tape is configured. </p><h2>  Harem Pants </h2><p>  Now, without a <span>pattern, we sew</span> trendy harem pants <span>with our own hands</span> .  They can do yoga, dancing, flaunting on the beach or in the country - this model of trousers does not hinder movement, because they are very free and spacious. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew harem pants without a pattern" class="if uuid-2500865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500865.jpg"></div><p>  They consist of two parts - the trousers themselves, which are made of a rectangular cut of fabric, and the belt.  The material must be taken thin, flowing and well draped - it can be rayon, a cotton fabric with frequent weaving of threads, football jersey, etc. For trousers you will need a section 140 cm wide and 120 cm long. For girls about 160- tall 165 cm pants will reach (at the lowest point) to the ankles.  In addition, you need to prepare a piece of fabric 64 x 20 cm for the belt and a wide elastic band. </p><p>  Such bloomers are extremely simple to sew: </p><ul><li>  to lay sections and edges of fabric; </li><li>  fold the material in half and in the upper part in the center, where the halves fit together, mark a place under the belt (32 cm); </li><li>  lay lines on both sides to the marks; </li><li>  fold the belt detail along face to face and sew it; </li><li>  to sweat a belt to trousers; </li><li>  insert an elastic band into the belt and sew an open section with a hidden seam. </li></ul><p>  All!  So fast and without patterns we sew cool trousers-harem pants. </p><h2>  Pants for home </h2><p>  The manufacture of the following items is demonstrated on the basis of children's pajamas, but this does not mean <span>that such pants</span> cannot be sewn by an adult.  Moreover, it can be not only wide pajama pants, but also narrow leggings.  Their creation will also occur without patterns and without patterns.  We sew just for some ready-made thing, which will become a template. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewdelicious.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pants without a pattern" class="if uuid-2500874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500874.jpg"></div><p>  The clothes need to be turned to the wrong side and folded with the trouser leg to the trouser leg, having properly straightened all the folds.  Then the "pattern" is laid on a canvas folded in half and circled with tailor's chalk.  When cutting trousers, it is necessary to consider in which direction the fabric stretches!  It is necessary to cut out two such details, which are further stitched together.  The place of bending of the fabric is the future lateral external seams, and the sections indicated by the dotted line are the lines along which the inner (step) seam, the central and back seams, and the crotch are sewn.  The belt can be made with an elastic band or with a lace. </p><h2>  Retro top </h2><p>  Another elementary thing in tailoring is a top with ties.  This wardrobe item was especially popular in the 60-70s in the West, but now it regains its former glory.  This top will perfectly complement skinny jeans with a high rise or a sun skirt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hartsfabric.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original top do-it-yourself" class="if uuid-2500873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500873.jpg"></div><p>  It consists of a rectangular piece of fabric and four ties that are sewn in its corners.  The width of the product should be approximately equal to the width of the shoulders.  Material length is two product lengths plus 5-6 cm per hem.  Before sewing the top, you need to prepare two narrow braids that are tied on the back, and cut two wide ties that cross from the back to the front.  Their length should be sufficient not only for the girth of the body, but also for the formation of a beautiful bow.  How to sew a top can be seen in the picture in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hartsfabric.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to just sew a top" class="if uuid-2500868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500868.jpg"></div><h2>  Shopping Bag </h2><p>  Finally, we show how you can make two options for bags with your own hands.  We also sew them without patterns, since all measurements and calculations can be applied immediately to the fabric.  The first bag is a rectangular rectangular sack with a lining, so for it you need to prepare not only the outer fabric, but also the inner lining. </p><div class="photo" data-original="unirazi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a bag" class="if uuid-2500867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500867.jpg"></div><p>  After cutting two panels of the required size, handles are sewn to the outside.  Then, in both parts, side seams are made.  Between themselves the details are connected so that the seams are inside the bag.  To do this, you need to turn the inside out, stitch them in a circle together, leaving a small hole un sewn enough to turn the bag back.  Then the non-sewn area is swept away manually.  So that the lining does not slip out, you can give a line around the circumference of the bag at a distance of two to three centimeters from the outer edge.  The bag can be left as it is, but even before the two parts are stitched together, the bottom is formed in it.  To do this, cut the corners, as shown in the figure. </p><h2>  Beach bag </h2><p>  Our last craft is a fabric bag, for which it still does not hurt to prepare a pattern.  But we assure that its construction will not be any difficulty.  Making drawings by eye directly on the fabric is undesirable, since the product consists of four parts, which subsequently need to be combined with each other.  In general, the progress of the work is clear from the picture; we only draw the attention of readers to how the pens are sewn together.  To halves beautifully connected, one of them needs to be slightly narrowed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crapivemade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="We sew a bag easily and quickly" class="if uuid-2500875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2500875.jpg"></div><p>  We hope that the proposed workshops will appeal to readers, and they will certainly bring them to life. </p>
