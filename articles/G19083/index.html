Here, Greek and Turkish traditions coexist peacefully with local Cypriot traditions.  All this creates a unique flavor that makes staying in Cyprus a continuous series of bright holidays.  Sveltos Hotel 3 * hospitably welcomes all tourists who decide to visit Cyprus, and one of its Larnaca resorts.  The hotel was built back in 1984 and managed to survive many renovations.  The latter not only updated the interior of the rooms, but also significantly expanded the infrastructure, making the stay here even more pleasant and comfortable. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Sveltos Hotel is located on the outskirts of the Cypriot city of Larnaca, just less than 6 km from its central part.  It is only 45 km from the capital of the island, the city of Nicosia, 41 km from the largest resort of Ayia Napa, and about 51 km from another interesting tourist site - the city of Protaras.  This location is convenient for those guests who plan on vacation to travel around the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sveltos hotel" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1516149.jpg" width="517"></div>  Regarding entertainment centers, the Sveltos Hotel is a bit far away.  They will have to be approached by city buses.  But very close to the hotel there is a police station.  The sea is also almost nearby, although Sveltos is not located on the first coastline.  In a straight line from it to the coast exactly 387 meters.  On the way to the beach you need to cross two roads, but, according to most tourists, this is not annoying.

Cyprus, being a popular resort, attracts many young people.  Therefore, to expand its clientele and diversify leisure, after the latest innovation, a brand new tennis court, an excellent volleyball court, a place for playing darts, and a fitness room were built at the hotel.  On the territory there is a large pool, around which there are enough sun loungers and umbrellas.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  It is no secret that many travel to the Mediterranean for the sake of the warm sea and the bright but gentle sun.  All this can be fully received by guests of Sveltos Hotel 3 *.  Cyprus - Larnaca, Protaras, Paphos, Pomos - in other words, absolutely all resorts in the country are proud of their beaches and clear sea.  The beach closest to the Sveltos is covered with fine and very smooth pebbles, and there is a sandy beach 100 meters away.  On both, the entrance to the sea is very gradual, and the depth begins 20-30 meters from the water's edge, and only sand under the feet is in the sea.  Sunbeds and umbrellas on these beaches cost 2.5 euros per day, there are few people, but there is almost no entertainment, but there is a good bar where you can have a drink and a snack.  Some guests on buses or on rented cars go to other <span>beaches of Cyprus.</span>  One of them is located in the center of Larnaca and is called Finikoudes.  There is plenty of entertainment here, and nearby on the promenade there are lots of taverns and shops.  But the beach itself and the water in the sea are not as clean as we would like.  The second beach is called Mackenzie, and it is located near the airport.  Its advantages are pure <span>volcanic sand,</span> clear water, a wide strip of shallows, which is good for young children.  Its disadvantages are undeveloped infrastructure, insufficient quality sand cleaning by beach workers, noise from the airport.  In addition to these two most popular beaches, guests of Sveltos Hotel, who love to discover something new, can go to any other corner of the island's coast, of which there are several dozen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sveltos Hotel 3 Cyprus Larnaca" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1516156.jpg" width="515"></div>
