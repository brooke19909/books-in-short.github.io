    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  So where is Denmark located?  In the very north of Europe, in Scandinavia.  The borders of the country are washed by the waters of the North and Baltic Seas.  By land, it is adjacent to Germany, and by water, it is adjacent to Norway and Sweden.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country along with water expanses is 700 thousand square meters.  km  Land takes only 42 thousand square meters.  km  The coastline of the country is 7300 km.  Numerous islands of Denmark are counted here.  Greenland is formally part of the country, but it has its own government, which makes it independent.  A feature of the state is that it owns a large number of islands (about 400), of which 80 are inhabited.  The largest island is Zealand.  Many island parts are so close to each other that they are interconnected by bridges. </p><p>  Denmark as a whole extends to the flat territories, only in the center of <span>the Jutland peninsula</span> there are small ridges of hills.  The highest point in the country is 170 meters above sea level (Mollehoy Hill), and the average height of the territories is about 30 meters.  The shores of Denmark are distinguished by an intricate, rugged fjords, shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The country is very rich in water resources, about a dozen rivers flow here, the longest of which is Gudeno.  60% of Danish land is suitable for agriculture.  During the period of rapid settlement of the country, natural forests were almost destroyed, and today the state spends a lot of resources to restore them.  About 3 thousand hectares are planted with oaks and beech trees here annually.  The country is actively developing the oil, limestone, natural gas, salt, chalk, sand, and gravel deposits available on its territory. </p>

    <h2>  Country history </h2><p>  In those places where Denmark is today, the first people appeared about 10 thousand years ago.  They came from more southern territories following the retreating glacier.  A sustainable culture of sufficiently high development was formed here in the 2nd millennium BC.  At the beginning of a new era, tribes of the Danes lived in northern Europe, who actively conquered lands south of Jutland and in England.  The genes of the tribes living in the territory of modern Denmark have become one of the significant components in the formation of the English ethnos.  In the Middle Ages, the Danish Viking tribes became famous for their militancy.  They successfully seized land in the Seine River and created the Duchy of Normandy there.  Success accompanied them in the conquest of the English territories.  In the 10-11 century, England was almost completely subordinate to the Danish king Knud the Second and paid tribute to him.  In the 11th century, the territory of Denmark was very large, including parts of modern Norway, Germany, Sweden.  But later, serious internal disagreements began between the ruling forces and the clergy.  The 13th century was a time of protracted civil wars, but the kings of Waldemar the Fourth, Eric Copenhagen, Christian the First and Queen Margrethe actively suppressed internal resistance and led the conquest of new lands.  Until the 15th century, Denmark strengthened its position in Europe, in the 16th century Protestantism penetrated the country and became the state religion.  In the 16th century there was a rapid development of Danish culture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Moreover, the country throughout its history almost unceasingly participated in various wars, in the North of Europe there was an active struggle for territories, various peoples that are part of the state periodically raised uprisings, and conflicts between the people and the aristocracy also systematically arose.  In the 18-19th century, serious social and political transformations took place in the country, the monarchs tried to reduce the influence of the church and enable the people to live better.  Strong external pressure does not stop, especially a lot of friction was with Sweden.  At the beginning of the 19th century, Denmark became a constitutional monarchy, after which the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù century came, many outstanding scientists, artists, philosophers work here.  However, in the second half of the 19th century, new times come, after the war with Prussia, Denmark loses a large amount of land.  The beginning of the 20th century was marked by internal political struggle, a <span>multi-party system was being</span> established in the country, <span>and</span> socialist sentiments were growing.  In 1936, Denmark concluded a non-aggression pact with Germany, but nevertheless in 1940 the Germans occupied the country.  The liberation came with the British army in 1945.  For several decades, the country has been negotiating accession to the European Union and in 1996 became a full member of the Schengen Agreement. </p>

    <h2>  Administrative division </h2><p>  Since 2007, Denmark, on the map of which there are five territorial units, has refused to divide its territory into communes, as it was before.  Now the country is divided into five districts, in which, in turn, cities and communes stand out.  Traditionally, the Danes themselves divide their country into 4 large parts: Southern, Central and Northern Denmark and Zealand, the capital region is kept apart.  Each district and cities have their own elected bodies - representative councils.  Greenland and the Faroe Islands have a special status and are autonomous units, with their own laws and regulations. </p>

    <h2>  The capital of Denmark </h2><p>  The largest city in the country and its capital - Copenhagen - is located on the islands of Zealand, Amager, Slotsholmen.  The settlement dates back to the 12th century.  At that time, Denmark was a rather significant state on the map of Europe, and over time it only gained strength, as did its capital.  Today Copenhagen is the safest metropolis in Europe.  569 thousand people live in the city, and if you count the entire agglomeration, then more than 1.1 million.  The population density in the capital is very high - about 6.2 thousand people per square meter.  km  But this does not adversely affect the quality of life.  The city is very comfortable for living, in its 10 districts and four suburban areas very favorable conditions for living are created.  Copenhagen is rich in sights and museums, but most of all visitors are impressed by the absolutely soothing atmosphere of the city.  It is nice to walk here, looking at architectural monuments and breathing in fresh air from the sea. </p>

The average life expectancy in Denmark is 78.6 years, which is 7 years higher than the global average.

It is spoken by about 96% of the population.  <span>The Danish language</span> came from the Scandinavian language, but acquired unique features during the autonomous development, so understanding between residents of different countries of northern Europe would be difficult if they did not communicate in English.  Some of the inhabitants also have German, Greenlandic, and Faroese languages ‚Äã‚Äãin circulation.  In addition, 86% of the population speak English, 58% - German, 12% - French. </p><p>  The official religion of the country is the Lutheran Church of the Danish people, according to the constitution, the monarch must profess this religion.
