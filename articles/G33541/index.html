There are no mountains, because the steppe wind freely blows through the city from all sides, which ensures constant change of air masses and creates a unique healing microclimate.  Clean beaches with fine-grained sand and pebbles stretch along the coast.  At 22 kilometers in length stretched along the coast of the Kalamitsky Gulf Evpatoria.  The embankment of the city is divided into two parts, which are named after the writer Maxim Gorky and the world's first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova. </p><h2>  Tereshkova Embankment: historical background </h2><p>  The old embankment of Yevpatoriya, whose photo is often found on view cards, got its modern name in the early 1970s.  It was formed in the 20s of the XIX century under the mayor S. M. Pampulov.  In the 90s of the XIX century, under the city architect A. L. Heinrich, the transformation of the embankment began.  Now almost every house here is a monument of history and architecture.  And then along the coast were built the first two-story hotels, city baths and one of the future attractions of the resort - St. Nicholas Cathedral.  At that time, Karaite A.M. Shakai built the Rossiya Hotel, which later became residential building No. 22, in which was located Z. I. Gimelfarba, the Model Institution of Warm Sea Baths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Evpatoria photo of beaches and promenade" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1400800.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Monuments on the embankment of Tereshkova </h2><p>  The beaches were then sandy, they were bathing.  It is worth noting that Evpatoria, the embankment of which is now surrounded by greenery, was then practically without green spaces.  Local residents were engaged in landscaping the city, because the trees and shrubs are located quite randomly. </p><p>  Some more noteworthy structures on the Tereshkova embankment: </p><ul><li>  The former house of <span>M. M. Popovich,</span> built in classical style (residential building No. 22). </li><li>  The building of one of the most beautiful Art Nouveau hotels - Bo-Rivage, where the Orbita boarding house is located now (once the royal suite stayed here for tea). </li><li>  On the street  You can see Revolution House 41, in the summer of 1891, Lesya Ukrainka lived in it. </li><li>  The city‚Äôs first three-story building, built in the neoclassical style, has now become house number 20. </li><li>  Sinani Karaite House (house number 27, it now houses a health-improving complex), </li><li>  House of consular agent Karl Marten. </li></ul><p>  Now there is completely no beach.  The embankment of Yevpatoriya is limited by stone breakwaters, from which slippery, mud-covered steps descend into the sea itself.  Bathing is prohibited, since the bottom near the shore is quite polluted, but this does not prevent local residents from breaking the ban, as well as basking in the sun, lying on stone slabs and fishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Evpatoria embankment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1400779.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Evpatoria, Gorky embankment: historical background </h2><p>  The unique architecture of many coastal buildings is famous for the city of Yevpatoriya.  Gorky Embankment, about a kilometer long, is one of the city symbols.  Its history began at the end of the 19th century, when desert beaches began to be built up with summer residences of wealthy people.  All these buildings are unique, built in different styles and radically different from each other.  Since then, the sea has come very close, and there is practically no sandy beach in this place - almost all the dachas are occupied by motels and health resorts. </p><p>  Of particular architectural interest is the summer residence of the mayor of S. E. Duvan, ‚ÄúCarmen‚Äù (now a children's sanatorium), the summer residence of the Zemstvo doctor B. I. Kazas, the ‚ÄúRiviera and Ostend‚Äù by A. Shishman, the building of the Central Resort Clinic and the Central Resort Library.  It is worth paying special attention to the Alpine Rose cottage, which is located next to the former dolphinarium - this is a unique building decorated with various wooden elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach promenade of yevpatoriya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1400798.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Gorky Embankment in the Present </h2><p>  In 2003, in honor of the 2500th anniversary of the resort, Gorky embankment was restored: beautiful arches were installed on the site of the destroyed columns, a statue of Hercules was erected, which became a new local attraction.  Walking along the coast, you can see many architectural monuments and sculptural compositions.  It is difficult for some residents to get used to how quickly Evpatoria is changing.  Vacationers most often take photos of beaches and the promenade in this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quay of yevpatoriya photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1400790.jpg"></div>  Frunze Park itself, through which you can go to the promenade, is the center of entertainment and nightlife in the city.  There are many cafes and restaurants, attractions for children, you can take pictures with live sculptures, stilts and fantastic heroes, as well as purchase various souvenirs.
