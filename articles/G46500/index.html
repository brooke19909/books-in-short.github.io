In this case, non-standard models come to the rescue, which, although not in great demand, but firmly occupy their niche in the consumer market. </p><h2>  Types of cars </h2><p>  The washing machine under the sink can be activator or drum type.  Activator, in turn, are divided into models with a centrifuge for spinning and without.  Let us consider in more detail each of these options. </p><h2>  Activator without centrifuge </h2><p>  A striking representative of this class is the Baby washing machine.  She has been familiar to Russians since Soviet times.  The device is a plastic container with an activator (a disk with blades, which alternately rotates clockwise and counterclockwise), a timer and a drain hose.  Water is manually poured into the tank, the powder is poured, and the timer starts.  After washing, the soapy solution must be drained and filled with a fresh portion of water. </p><p>  There is no separate program for rinsing in such models; to start it, it is necessary to turn on the washing mode and add fresh water.  Such a machine can easily fit under the sink due to its small size, but the large number of manual operations makes it unattractive to the consumer.  The "Baby" washing machine is inexpensive, but no more than 2 kg of laundry is placed in it.  Basically, it is bought by poor citizens or summer residents. </p>

    <h2>  Activator with centrifuge </h2><p>  The washing machine under the sink with a centrifuge is larger in size, since the compartment in which the laundry is being washed is attached to the tank in which the washing takes place.  The inconvenience for the consumer is that wet clothes have to be transferred to a centrifuge.  Such models can wash up to 6 kg of things, as a rule, they have several modes, such as gentle, enhanced or normal washing.  Water is also poured manually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Buyers are much more interested in small washing machines under the drum-type sink.  They are no different from standard front models in terms of functions and indicators.  Similarly, these appliances differ in the class of washing, spin speed and energy consumption. </p><h2>  Type of control </h2><p>  Very often, a <span>washing machine (automatic)</span> under the sink has a mechanical control type.  This is confirmed by many models, for example, Candy Aquamatic 1D835-07.  The mechanics are considered more reliable, but it does not differ in the variety of programs. </p>

    <p>  Washing modes are strictly adjusted and fixed in time. </p><p>  A washing machine under the sink with an electronic programmer is much more convenient to use.  You can set different washing modes depending on the type of fabric, delay the start for several hours, see on the electronic timer how much time is left until the end of the program.  The model itself will adjust the required amount of water and select the optimal mode of rotation of the drum. </p><h2>  The financial side of the issue </h2><p>  And how much are compact washing machines?  Prices vary.  Simple models such as "Baby" or the modern "Fairy" will cost a couple of thousand rubles.  For units with an extraction, the price rises two times, but still remains quite low.  Drum washing machines have a completely different cost.  Prices for such models are two times higher than standard units with the same functions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Characteristics of drum machines </h2><p>  First of all, buyers are interested in how much space a washing machine takes under the sink.  Photos that can be found on the network give only a distant idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe dimensions of various models.  Typically, sinks are placed at a height of 85 cm, the tank itself will be 20 centimeters in depth, and even drainage into the sewer will take its place.  It turns out that the washing machine under the sink should ideally not be higher than 50-60 cm. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, such models cannot be found on sale.  Those options that manufacturers offer are 60-70 cm high.  This means that the washing machine of the indicated dimensions will not enter under the sink at all or will partially protrude - this should also be taken into account.  As an option, first buy your favorite model, and only then install a sink above it, slightly raising it relative to the standard height. </p><p>  Small height is not the only advantage of compact cars.  They are also smaller than standard frontal models in height and depth.  And this means that they can be installed in a small niche, in the gap between the sink and the bath or the wall and the toilet.  In situations where only a few centimeters are not enough, compact models will help out to install a standard automatic machine. </p><h2>  Loading </h2><p>  The maximum possible load of the machine is closely related to its dimensions.  If in ordinary frontal models the drum capacity can be increased by increasing its diameter, then in compact models you won‚Äôt do that anymore.  All the components there are so close to each other that there is practically no room for manufacturers to maneuver.  Increasing the load by increasing the depth is also not an option - then the washing machine will cease to be compact, and it will no longer fit under the sink. </p>

    <p>  Depending on the model, 3 to 4 kg of laundry can fit in compact units.  In principle, this is not so little.  The estimated weight of the duvet cover is 1 kg, the sheets are 800 grams, and the pillowcases are 400 grams. Accordingly, one set of bed linen will enter this automatic machine without any problems.  Of course, some large thing will not fit in the drum - a blanket, pillow, winter down jacket or jacket, but t-shirts, dresses, underwear in such devices can be washed without problems. </p><h2>  Washing class </h2><p>  The washing efficiency depends on three factors: mechanical, chemical and temporary.  Simply put, the longer the laundry is washed, the more effective the powder used in the work, the more often things turn over, the more intensive the solution passes through the layers of fabric, the better the result.  In small devices it is quite difficult to ensure the movement of linen and the circulation of the solution, especially at maximum load.  Therefore, compact washing machines often have a lower washing class.  Of course, not all, but among them the percentage of Class B models is much higher than that of standard front-end units. </p>

    <h2>  Number of revolutions and spin class </h2><p>  Compact activator models with a centrifuge do not squeeze much.  The spin class is not defined for them, often manufacturers do not write the number of revolutions in the characteristics at all.  As for automatic machines, the situation is somewhat different.  They are necessarily assigned a spin class, the technical specifications indicate the number of revolutions.  As a rule, this figure is from 800 to 1300 (it is quite enough to get dry clothes from the car).  The spin class varies between B and D. According to these indicators, compact devices differ little from standard automatic machines. </p><h2>  Electricity class </h2><p>  If we are talking about machines of the activator type, then for them the class of electricity is not defined.  As practice shows, these models consume a little, because the main expense is to heat the water, and in such units it is poured manually from the tap already at the temperature that the owner needs. </p>

    <p>  Compact drum models are no different from standard counterparts.  Similarly, class A and A + automatic machines dominate among them.  In addition, since their load is small, they take a little water.  And that means that little energy is spent on its heating. </p><h2>  Functions </h2><p>  Since the range of compact models is not very large, in the store, the buyer has to choose between 2-3 cars.  You should pay attention to the number of programs, the ability to adjust the spin speed and temperature. </p>

    <p>  The function of additional washing or soaking will not be superfluous, which will help to cope with heavily soiled linen.  Recently, an option called ‚Äúdelayed start" has been in demand among buyers.  It allows you to delay the start of the washing machine for several hours.  Thanks to this feature, owners do not have to wait for the grace night period of energy consumption.  You can delay the launch for a couple of hours and go to bed calmly at 10 in the evening. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Surely buyers are concerned about the question of how such a washing machine behaves in the work.  Reviews indicate that most owners are happy with their purchase.  If we are talking about drum-type models, then they are no worse than their standard counterparts.  Some complaints relate to a high level of noise and vibration, due to the low weight and low stability of such models. </p>
