Features of construction, pros and cons, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before buying a property, people often wonder about which house is better - brick or panel.  Each type of building has its own nuances, the construction technology differs, and various materials are used.  Each person decides for himself in which house he will live comfortably.  To do this, you need to find out how the panel house differs from the brick house.  It is necessary to highlight the advantages of each type and after that choose one of the options. </p><h2>  The history of panel houses </h2><p>  It is not so easy to compare which house is better - brick or panel.  Panel began to build back in the USSR.  In the fifties of the twentieth century, the construction of buildings of this type increased.  The buildings were strong, many buildings exist today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multi-storey building is better brick or panel" class="if uuid-2953290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2953290.jpg"></div><h2>  Technologies and nuances of panel building construction </h2><p>  When the question arises as to which multi-story building is better - brick or panel, then you need to find out the construction technology.  For example, panel houses are assembled by analogy with the designer.  The building is built of concrete slabs.  Joints cement. </p><p>  Nowadays, technology has improved.  Instead of concrete slabs, they began to purchase sandwich structures.  They are distinguished by their "filling."  Inside this design are soundproof materials, as well as thermal insulation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sandwich panels are much larger than concrete slabs, due to this, apartments began to be located above the ceilings, the area increased. </p><h2>  The advantages of panel buildings </h2><p>  Panel designs have a number of undeniable advantages, which should be noted: </p><ol><li>  The construction of such houses is carried out in a year, which is considered fast for a capital construction project.  Brick and monolithic erected much longer. </li><li>  Affordable prices for apartments for a person with an average income.  This pricing policy is due to the fact that the cost of materials is not high.  Another reason lies in the fact that not so many people are involved in the construction, respectively, the cost of labor is small. </li><li>  This type of house can be exploited for a long time.  The projects recorded the permissible period of use of housing of this type from forty to fifty years.  Half a century is a solid period for a residential building.  In reality, prefabricated houses are used even longer than indicated in the design documentation. </li><li>  Repair in the house can be done with your own hands.  The panels are smooth, they do not need to be additionally aligned. </li></ol><h2>  Cons of panel houses </h2><p>  If in doubt, which house is better - brick or panel, then it is worth finding out the disadvantages of each.  The panel has the following disadvantages, which are noted by the reviews: </p><ol><li>  There is a ready-made layout that is almost impossible to change.  Bearing walls must not be demolished by uniting the area.  If you want to make an arch or expand the opening, then you need the permission of the chief architect of the city. </li><li>  Poor insulation.  You can sneeze, and from a neighbor above or below you can hear a wish for health.  Good audibility is explained by the thickness of the panel.  They are thin enough, and the sound goes well through them. </li><li>  Low thermal insulation.  Panel houses are considered cold due to the thickness of the plates.  Perhaps the joints were badly closed and the apartments were quickly cooling.  Many people themselves insulate the walls from the inside.  It‚Äôs better to do this outside and invite professionals for this.  Now many companies are engaged in insulation of panels and sealing joints. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which multi-storey is better brick or panel" class="if uuid-2953291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2953291.jpg"></div><h2>  The difference between modern panel buildings </h2><p>  Over the years, technology in construction has changed, prefabricated houses are no exception.  They got better.  For example, the layout of apartments has changed for the better.  In new buildings, apartments are already available for purchase with repair and with glazed balconies, loggias.  In many apartments, developers began to make two bathrooms, which is very convenient for large families.  Nowadays, you can see various bright facades of houses that delight the eye in the cold season.  Builders began to rely on multi-layer panels, it became warmer in apartments.  Sound insulation in houses has improved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can‚Äôt say exactly which house is better - brick, block or panel.  Each has its own characteristics. </p><h2>  Brick building trends </h2><p>  It is believed that the most reliable houses are built of brick.  Nowadays, there is a tendency to reduce the construction of brick houses, although the apartments in them are being bought up during the development process.  Such trends are explained by the fact that the cost of materials increases every year.  Construction lasts longer than the construction of buildings from other materials.  Usually, to build a brick multi-storey building, it takes up to two years.  Many workers are involved in the construction of this type of building, and labor costs are increasing.  As a result, prices for apartments in brick houses are much higher than in panel and monolithic ones.  This type of housing is considered to be elite. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raymondjamesrestoration.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which multi-storey building is better brick or" class="if uuid-2953306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2953306.jpg"></div><h2>  Differences in construction technology </h2><p>  The construction of residential apartment buildings of brick has a number of its own characteristics.  Ceramic brick is considered to be an environmentally friendly material, which is ideal for housing construction.  This material can be used in places with high humidity, for example, on the river bank.  Brick houses retain heat very well, so the apartments have a warm microclimate.  A clear plus is the reduction in utility bills, since there is no need to additionally heat the apartment.  If the building was erected from silicate brick, it is better to insulate the apartment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Nowadays, houses of a combined type have become popular.  These include monolithic brick buildings.  Apartments in such houses are highly valued, but they rarely build these buildings. </p><p>  Many people do not know which is better - a panel or monolithic brick house.  It is important to study not only the apartment supply market, but also to understand the difference in building technology.  Then it will turn out to choose the option suitable for yourself. </p><h2>  The advantages of brick apartment buildings </h2><p>  Choosing which is better - a brick or panel house, you should decide on the pluses of the first.  These include: </p><ol><li>  It is permissible to erect a building of any design. </li><li>  You can make a layout as you wish.  Many developers sell square meters, and tenants erect walls at their discretion.  Some leave apartments as a studio. </li><li>  Demand for apartments in brick houses is always high.  If necessary, quickly sell the apartment, you can easily find buyers. </li><li>  Among other buildings, brick houses have the best sound insulation indicators.  Apartments in such houses retain heat for a long time. </li><li>  In brick buildings, due to the properties of the material, there is no mold and fungus on the walls. </li><li>  The life of such houses is quite impressive.  They can serve up to 150 years. </li><li>  They are comfortable for residents.  In summer it‚Äôs not hot inside, the brick is not as hot as a concrete slab.  In winter, the apartments remain warm. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="rvaloanofficer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which multi-story house is better than a brick panel" class="if uuid-2953304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2953304.jpg"></div><h2>  Disadvantages of multi-unit brick buildings </h2><p>  Finding out which house is better - brick or panel, it is worth stopping by the minuses of a brick building.  There are few of them.  We list some of them that are noted in the reviews by the owners: </p><ol><li>  Sound insulation is good due to the poor passage of sounds through the walls, but it is believed that all household noises are perfectly audible. </li><li>  The price of apartments in houses of this type is much higher than in others. </li><li>  Construction takes a very long time.  For those who have an acute problem with housing, waiting will not be a way out of the situation. </li></ol><h2>  Features of monolithic houses </h2><p>  In the nineties of the twentieth century, apartments in monolithic houses were in demand.  Nowadays, they also do not lose their popularity.  A feature of the construction technology of this type of house is the lifting of the formwork.  It is erected floor by floor around the metal frame of the building.  The formwork is simply assembled and just as easily it can be disassembled.  There is an opportunity to build a multi-story building.  The design can be made of any complexity. </p><p>  An interesting feature of this type of building is the individual design of each building.  The building is unique in design.  Professionals in the construction industry can distinguish the following types of construction of houses: </p><ol><li>  Monolithic or building with a solid foundation. </li><li>  Monolithic frame.  It consists of reinforced concrete columns.  The building also includes concrete floors.  It is possible to add brick components to the house. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.ehsmithclayproducts.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which multi-story house is better than brick or panel" class="if uuid-2953314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2953314.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits of Monolithic Buildings </h2><p>  Among the advantages of monolithic multi-storey buildings in the reviews are: </p><ol><li>  There are no time limits for the year.  Construction does not stop even in winter.  Work is in full swing at sub-zero temperatures.  Concrete is constantly heated.  As a result, the commissioning of the facility is faster than brick buildings are commissioned. </li><li>  It is permissible to build any number of floors. </li><li>  Many appreciate the fact that you can‚Äôt flood the neighbors.  Even if an accident occurs with pipes in the apartment, the water will not go down.  The one-piece building structure prevents water from seeping into adjacent floors. </li><li>  The walls when putting the house into operation are always flat and smooth.  In such apartments, it is easy to do repairs with your own hands. </li><li>  According to the project, the house should stand for at least 150 years. </li><li>  The ability to independently choose a housing plan. </li><li>  Advanced construction technology avoids cracks on the walls of the house over the years. </li><li>  Good insulation in the apartments. </li><li>  Sound insulation is good in terms of what is not audible what is happening with the neighbors. </li></ol><h2>  Cons of monolithic buildings </h2><p>  When the question is which houses are better - brick monolithic or panel, then it is worth paying attention to the minuses of monolithic houses: </p><ol><li>  Construction lasts a year on average. </li><li>  The cost of apartments in houses of this type is quite high. </li></ol><p>  There are practically no drawbacks; in many respects, monolithic structures are more advantageous than panel buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="libreshot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which multi-storey building is brick or panel" class="if uuid-2953292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2953292.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the secondary market </h2><p>  Often you can hear the question addressed to realtors: which house on the "secondary" is better - brick or panel.  It is believed that brick houses are better.  They have a higher indicator of acceptable life, up to 150 years.  Panel houses are mainly designed for 50 years.  Brick buildings have a high level of thermal insulation.  In prefabricated houses, over time, thermal insulation becomes worse, you have to insulate the walls. </p><p>  In the secondary market, the cost of apartments usually falls, although apartments in brick houses are not significant.  As a rule, they cost many times more than housing in panel houses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zielonagora.wyborcza.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which multi-story house is better than a panel" class="if uuid-2953298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2953298.jpg"></div><p>  The price of an apartment in a brick house or panel will depend on factors such as the territorial location of the building.  It is important in what area it is located.  The price is affected by the floor on which the housing is located.  Typically, apartments on the first and last floors cost less than on the fourth or fifth floor. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, most citizens prefer to buy housing in brick houses.  Many stay on a panel house based on financial capabilities. </p>
