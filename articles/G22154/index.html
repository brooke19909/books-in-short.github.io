The craftsmen learned to put everything into operation: plastic bottles, packaging from semi-finished products, egg containers and even old burnt out bulbs.  It is about the latter that will be discussed in our article.  Readers are presented with information on how to make toys from <span>light bulbs with their own hands.</span>  Photos of such products can also be seen in this article.  Such crafts can serve as souvenirs or <span>Christmas decorations.</span>  If your home has bulbs unsuitable for their intended use, we invite you to our workshops on "turning" them into interesting products.  If you plan to involve children in the process of making a toy from light bulbs with your own hands, then follow the safety rules, as the work uses a fragile glass object, adhesive materials and scissors.  So, what can you make from an old light bulb? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY light bulb toys" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/341132.jpg" width="381"></div>

Tie one part of it around the base.  Tie the second piece to the first.  Get a loop over the bulb.  Next, treat the glass surface with white acrylic paint and leave to dry.  From the napkin, cut out the fragments that you want to use in decorating the product.  Cut them to the size of the bulb.  In a bowl, dilute the glue with water.  Place a napkin on a dry glass surface and apply a solution to it with a brush.  Follow this procedure from the center to the sides, expelling air and excess fluid from under the paper.  Smooth folds with gentle movements.  When all fragments of a napkin are glued, leave the product to dry for several hours.  Then, with the help of colored glitters, select the contours of the drawings, optionally draw some elements.  After this material dries, sprinkle the work with varnish.  It remains to issue a base.  To do this, cut out a strip of corrugated paper whose width and length are slightly larger than the upper metal part of the bulb.  Wrap this workpiece around the base and tape.  Decorations made using decoupage technique are ready to go to the festive Christmas tree.

What is needed for this? </h2><p>  New Year's toys made of light bulbs, a confirmation of this, look very original and interesting.  In this article, we tell you how you can use them with their "golden" pens to perform them in a variety of techniques.  The next workshop introduces us to floristry.

The work ahead is not hard, but jewelry.  The first thing you need is to remove the cap.  The glass may burst during this procedure, so we recommend that you wear it with gloves.  With a knife, carefully tuck the metal part from the bottom around the entire circumference of the bulb and remove it.  Next, insert the knitting needle into the deepest cavity and push it down.  When all the interior filling of the lighting device fails, shake it out.  Now fill the glass pear with flowers.  Perform this action very carefully so that the petals do not crumble.  Using a knitting needle, lay the plant inside the bulb in the desired angle.  Glue grease the base and attach it to its place.  Tie a piece of braid or cord to it in a loop.  Spray this part of the product.  When the pendant dries, decorate it with a <span>ribbon bow.</span>  The souvenir is ready. </p><h2>  Muzzle toys </h2>

At least, many craftsmen saw just such a similarity and hastened to take it into service in the manufacture of crafts.  They learned to "turn" a glass lighting device into cute little faces.  An example of such a product you see in the photo.  How to make a toy out of a light bulb?  Prepare acrylic or gouache paints of different colors, brushes, water, sewing supplies and headwear (cloth, ribbon).

    <p>  On a light bulb with a pencil outline a sketch of a face.  Then paints complete the design.  If you work with gouache, then dilute it with a few drops of <span>PVA glue.</span>  This will give the product shine, and the paint itself will not be "picked up" in the future.  On the metal part of the product, form a loop from the tape.  Next, do a hat.  To do this, cut a rectangular part from the fabric, the width of which corresponds to the circumference of the upper part of the bulb.  Sew a hat from it and put it on the cap.  You can decorate a small accessory with a pompom, bow or bead. </p><h2>  And another version of the toy </h2><p>  Even a child will agree that the shape of the bulb resembles a penguin figurine.  So why don't we turn this glass item into a funny hero?  To work, you will need the same materials as in the previous section of the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas toys from light bulbs photo" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/341129.jpg?1393104997162" width="520"></div>
