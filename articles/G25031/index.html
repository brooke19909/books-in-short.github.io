However, not all modifications of the <span>technological process</span> or products can be attributed to this category, so it is worthwhile to dwell in detail on the types of innovations and give their classification. </p><p>  Depending on how the innovation is introduced into the technological process, innovations are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  grocery; </li><li>  process. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, new materials, semi-finished products and components are used, as a result of which fundamentally new products are obtained.  Process innovations provide for new approaches both to the organization of activities at the enterprise, and to the introduction of new high-performance technology. </p><p>  The classification of innovations may be based on the novelty of the market.  In particular, scientific developments that appeared for the first time in the world, in the country and at a particular enterprise are distinguished.  Obviously, the first view has the greatest value.  At the same time, depending on the coverage of the expected <span>market share,</span> they can be local, systemic and strategic. </p><p>  The classification of innovations can be based on the place of new development in the enterprise system.  Such scientific development can make changes to the structure and principle of operation of the enterprise itself.  Innovations are highlighted here: </p><ul><li>  at the entrance of the enterprise, which change the applied raw materials, materials, machinery, equipment and other important points at the initial stage of production; </li><li>  at the exit of the enterprise, they influence the final result of production activities; </li><li>  system structure of the enterprise, modifying the management, production and technological components </li></ul><p>  The classification of innovations depends on the degree of product change.  Here they allocate </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  radical (basic), which radically modify the quality of the services provided or the goods produced.  Here, in practice, discoveries and major inventions are introduced, allowing to launch a new generation of technology or introduce the latest technology; </li><li>  improving, for the implementation of which middle-level inventions are involved; </li><li>  modification (private) only slightly improve the individual parameters of the product or organization of production. </li></ul><p>  The classification of innovations can also be carried out according to the degree of prevalence of innovations.  In particular, single and diffuse scientific developments are distinguished.  Depending on the continuity, innovations can be substitute, cancel, return, open, retro-introductions. </p><p>  Of course, the listed <span>types of innovations</span> and their classification are not final and will be constantly expanded and supplemented.  However, it can be argued that no matter in what area the enterprise operates, it will always be possible to choose a high-tech product for it, which will increase its profitability. </p><p>  The classification of <span>innovative projects is</span> no less interesting <span>.</span>  They, as a rule, differ depending on the level of scientific and technical significance.  So, they highlight a modernization innovative project, during the development of which there is no fundamental change in the basic design or technology.  Innovative (or improving) <span>scientific activity</span> allows you to make significant changes to existing technologies and designs.  However, the greatest commercial benefit should come from the implementation of a leading and pioneering innovative project, which provides for the introduction of respectively leading technical developments and newly created materials, structures and technologies that are capable of performing new functions. </p>
