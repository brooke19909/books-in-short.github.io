  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bacteriological weapons and its types</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bacteriological weapons are a means of mass destruction of people and other living organisms.  Its effect is the use of bacterial agents.  These include various microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.). Sometimes, insects that destroy agricultural crops are used to undermine the enemy‚Äôs economic stability. </p><p>  Bacteriological weapons are divided into several types, depending on the means used. </p><p>  This means of mass destruction is a special munition or projectile based on a biological substance. </p><p>  To defeat the population, the following types of bacteria and viruses are used that lead to mass diseases: plague, <span>anthrax,</span> cholera, brucellosis, <span>smallpox,</span> Venezuelan horse encephalomyelitis, <span>typhus,</span> spotted fever, histoplasmosis, etc. </p><p>  In order to have an effect on animals, the causative agents of foot and mouth disease, plague, glanders, anthrax, false rabies, etc. are used. </p><p>  To destroy vegetation, pathogens of <span>late blight of potato,</span> rust of cereals, as well as insects, herbicides, defoliants, etc. are used. </p><p>  All <span>types of biological</span> weapons have a latent period of action.  That is, from the moment of infection until the onset of symptoms, a fairly long period can pass.  At this time, the carrier of the virus may not be aware of the danger that it poses to others.  So the spread of the virus and mass infection of people.  The latent period can last from several hours to two weeks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Chemical and biological weapons are delivered by the same methods that are used in any other type of weapon.  These can be aircraft bombs, mines, <span>aerosol generators,</span> shells and missiles.  In addition, this type of weapon is delivered by diversionary means. </p><p>  One of the most popular ways that bacteriological weapons spread is to infect a layer of air closer to the ground.  This happens when a shell explodes.  Generators are triggered that contribute to the formation of an aerosol cloud.  As this cloud advances, infection of living organisms occurs. </p><p>  Another way to spread <span>bacteria and viruses</span> is to use infected animals (mainly rodents, ticks, and insects). </p><p>  Recognize the fact of the use of bacteriological weapons is possible by the following signs. </p><p>  1. When a shell bursts, a cloud of smoke or fog forms above the surface of the earth.  The sound when the weapon is triggered is less sharp. </p><p>  2. If a streak of smoke appeared behind the enemy‚Äôs aircraft for a short time, this indicates that bacteriological weapons were used. </p><p>  3. In places where shells break, small droplets of liquid or plaque form on the ground, vegetation and objects. </p><p>  4. Shell fragments have unusual details in the form of pistons that allow you to create an aerosol effect. </p><p>  5. An unusually large accumulation of insects, rodents or ticks in a given area. </p><p>  To prevent the use of biological weapons and timely eliminate its consequences, it is necessary to carry out a number of measures.  This is, first of all, the implementation of reconnaissance operations in order to identify the intentions of the enemy to use this type of weapon.  This is followed by constant monitoring of the state of air, water and the terrain as a whole and the identification of signs of infection.  Monitoring the well-being of people and the implementation of preventive measures.  Timely identification of the extent of infection and the use of protective equipment. </p><p>  Bacteriological weapons and their use are under the control of the entire world community.  Some countries have signed an agreement on its non-application. </p>
