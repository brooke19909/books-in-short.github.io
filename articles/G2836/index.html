    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Askold is a ghost island.  So it is called for the lack of human civilization.  The island is a bird's eye view of a horseshoe due to the large bay.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island is over fourteen square kilometers.  The island landscape is represented by mountain peaks over three hundred meters above sea level, broad-leaved forests and meadows.  Freshwater resources consist of two keys and several watercourses.  Rocky shores abruptly break to the sea.  The climate on the island is notable for its unpredictability and is characterized by sharp changes (from calm and calm weather to rain with a harsh wind and fog).  In the southeastern part of the island, at the entrance to the Rider harbor, a natural window formed in the rocks called the ‚ÄúWindow of Peter the Great‚Äù.  On the opposite side of the island there is another bay - Southeast. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Before the arrival of Russian sailors on Askold Island in the 19th century, it was sparsely populated due to harsh climatic conditions.  The island came under Russian jurisdiction after the conclusion of the Aigun Treaty and the Beijing Treaty with China, which secured the transfer of Primorye to Russia.  However, a lot of time has passed from the legal assignment of this territory to the Russian Empire to the development of the island.  In 1855, during the Crimean War, he was visited by English sailors who carried out a hydrographic description of the coast of the <span>Ussuri Gulf.</span>  In a map published in 1866 in the UK, Askold Island appeared under the name Termination (translated from English - "final destination").  In 1859, a description of the island was made by the sailors of the Russian clipper ‚ÄúShooter‚Äù, who called it ‚ÄúLighthouse‚Äù.  The strait separating the island from the mainland was named after the Askold Russian screw frigate.  The island began to be called the Strait since 1863.  The bay was named after the Russian military clipper "Rider".  Most of the geographical names on the island are somehow connected with the Russian sailors.  The opposite bay, as already mentioned, is called Southeast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Robbery Times </h2><p>  In the 19th century, the island was a place of semi-legal gold mining controlled by the Hunhuz (Chinese robbers).  In addition to gold mining, they also engaged in poaching.  Thanks to their predatory actions, the local fauna was endangered.  This ended in 1892, when a military observation post was set up on the island.  He played an important role in protecting the approaches to Vladivostok during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905.  It was this post that in time discovered the approach of a detachment of Japanese ships of Admiral Kamimura. <br>  In Soviet times, fortifications (pillboxes and a coastal battery) were created on the island to protect against possible Japanese landing.  A weather station also functioned.  There is currently a lighthouse on Askold Island.  The population is its staff. </p><p>  Due to the harsh climate, Askold (an island in the Gulf of Peter the Great) is not suitable for living.  It completely lacks tourism infrastructure, which, however, is not an obstacle for visitors who want to be among the pristine wildlife. </p><h2>  The fauna and flora of Askold Island </h2><p>  Since the XIX century, spotted deer have been breeding on the island.  In times of gold mining and rampant poachers, deer were almost completely destroyed.  After an observation post was created on the island and an <span>artillery coastal</span> battery with a military camp was built, poachers stopped threatening deer and their population quickly recovered.  Currently, due to the lack of a large population, animals are also not at risk.  Tourists who come to the island have the opportunity to watch deer in their natural habitat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to <span>sika deer, the</span> island is home to numerous birds.  Tourists can also enjoy plenty of brightly colored butterflies fluttering among shrubs and trees.  There are rookeries of seals and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãlions</span> on the shore <span>.</span>  The flora is unusually rich.  Askold is a mysterious island with a rich nature.  Almost the entire territory is covered with deciduous forests.  Among the trees there are species of valuable mahogany and <span>Manchurian walnut.</span>  Meadows and woodlands are dotted with thickets of barberry and acacia.  The sea near the island is rich in fish; killer whales are found. </p><h2>  Lighthouse - the main attraction of the island </h2>

    <p>  There are two lighthouses on the island.  The old one was built in 1879 on Cape Yelagin.  The lighthouse has a height of eight meters.  Its base and tower are made of bricks, and the adjacent office buildings are built of rubble stone.  Lighthouse equipment was purchased in England.  In 1917, the lighthouse, which was destroyed due to the local harsh climate, had to be rebuilt.  The base was strengthened and the tower rebuilt.  In this form, he came to our days.  The Askold lighthouse is also currently operating.  The island is famous for other attractions. </p><h2>  Shore battery </h2>

    <p>  In Soviet times, military facilities were located on the island.  It was closed to the public.  The remnants of the barracks of a military town remind us of this, the old military equipment that had fallen into disrepair and the main local attraction was the coastal battery No. 26. It was built in 1936, during the aggravation of the military threat from militaristic Japan, to protect approaches to Vladivostok from the sea.  180 mm guns in the towers were capable of hitting targets at a distance of more than thirty-seven kilometers. </p><h2>  Secrets of the dungeon </h2>

    <p>  Underground was a complex of underground structures (warehouses, living quarters, command post, hospital).  The depth of the underground structures of the coastal battery is forty meters.  Until 1991, she was in a combat-ready state, and then, due to the reduction of the army, the military left these places.  There was a military garrison on the island.  Currently, the only island inhabitants are lighthouse keepers.  The coastal battery and fortifications around are desolate.  The most acceptable option would be to create a fortification museum on its basis, like the <span>Voroshilov battery.</span>  The rusty skeletons of anti-aircraft guns and other military equipment scattered throughout the island testify to the militaristic past.  People interested in military history and fortification will find a lot of interesting things for themselves here. </p><h2>  Tourism Features </h2>

    <p>  From the point of view of organizing tourism, the island has undeniable advantages in the form of a unique diverse natural landscape, the availability of places not affected by the destructive influence of modern civilization.  Due to the great depths, the abundance of marine life, this place is attractive for divers.  Of great interest is the island of Askold (Primorsky Krai) is for lovers of military history.  Tourism development is hampered by inaccessibility, gusty winds, often changing direction.  The most optimal tourist route is a boat trip around the island.  This tour allows you to appreciate the grandeur of gigantic rocks, which, like the warriors, rise vertically from the water, making the island resembles a fortress.  The lack of developed tourism infrastructure can not only be considered as a disadvantage, but also to some extent a virtue.  This will attract connoisseurs of pristine nature and romance to Askold Island. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2>

    <p>  The easiest option to reach the island is a boat trip from the cities of Vladivostok and Nakhodka.  Such a trip will bring a minimum of inconvenience and will be relatively comfortable.  However, the boat will have to be rented and paid for the trip on both sides, since there is currently no transport connection with the island.  You can also take a bus from Vladivostok to the village of Fokino, and from there - to the village of Danube.  Further in the Danube village you will need to find a carrier.  Thus, a trip to Askold Island (Primorsky Territory, Russia) becomes a very difficult task.  However, the road inconvenience is more than compensated by the impressions of meeting with the pristine nature of this unique corner of the Russian Far East.  Going to the island, you need to bring along a stock of food and travel supplies. </p>

You can wander around the island all day and not meet any of the people.  The only ones you can meet there are the same tourists with whom you can join together to jointly explore island attractions and explore the secrets of the island.
