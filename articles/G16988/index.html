    <h2>  Life insurance </h2><p>  Depending on how the savings are made, classic life insurance is divided into two varieties: funded and risk.  It should be noted that the normative definition of these concepts is extremely conditional and is based on the established practice of using these terms. </p><h2>  Risky </h2><p>  Life <span>insurance</span> is a financial protection for the family of the insured in the event that a person dies under certain circumstances, and this is clearly stated in the contract of the RGS company.  Feedback on this service is quite controversial, since many people either did not receive payments at all, or received them after quite lengthy proceedings, which is also far from the most pleasant moment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If necessary, such contracts may also include insurance against any diseases or accidents, disability, and the occurrence of fatal diseases.  In this case, there will not be any excessive savings, because all the money paid to the client ultimately goes to cover these risks, as well as all kinds of expenses from the insurance company.  At the same time, the fact that in this case any payments after the end of the insurance period through the CSG is completely excluded is equally important.  Reviews are often left by people who tried to get their money at the end of the term, despite the fact that this is not provided for by this type of insurance at all. </p><p>  According to employees of the UK, the most common option today is emergency insurance in case of death of the insured person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh offices" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/989894.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cumulative </h2><p>  Endowment insurance provides for the gradual formation of savings, and at the same time, it is worth noting that it constantly includes a risk component, which provides for the payment of the indicated amount of funds in the event of death or any other cases provided for in the drawn up agreement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, the most common option is the so-called mixed life insurance, when in case of death of the insured person or at the end of the term (if the insured survives to this point), in accordance with the agreement, the specified amount is paid by Rosgosstrakh.  Offices in Moscow and other cities most often offer just such agreements.  Judging by the reviews, this type of insurance has been popular since the days of the USSR, but it is worth saying that at that time it also provided for <span>compulsory insurance</span> against any accidents. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  For this insurance option, the following features are characteristic: </p><ul><li>  a fairly long period, which allows you to gradually form an impressive amount of savings in accordance with the contract, despite the fact that the contributions are relatively small; </li><li>  guaranteed accrual of a certain return on invested savings in accordance with the contract, as well as in certain cases, additional investment income may be provided. </li></ul><p>  Due to these characteristics, insurance reserves for this contract will constantly grow throughout the term.  Experts argue that if the contract is terminated on an ongoing basis, a person has the opportunity to get good money as a redemption amount - it is enough to come to the CSG.  Branches provide such payments, regardless of location. </p><p>  It is worth noting the fact that accumulative insurance includes any agreements that provide for survival payments, including also various pension insurance contracts.  But at the same time, lawyers advise to pay attention to the fact that lifetime death insurance in itself is also considered to be cumulative, although it does not provide for the inclusion in the contract of a case of surviving until a certain date.  Reserves, in accordance with such a document, will constantly grow throughout the entire insurance period, and they will reach their maximum only at its end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="RGS Moscow" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/989892.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The timing </h2><p>  With regard to timing classification, there is short-term and long-term insurance. </p><p>  In fact, there are no clear boundaries for this division, but the situation is somewhat different in the contracts of Rosgosstrakh. </p><p>  Offices in Moscow are located almost on every street, but, regardless of which one you turn to, they will tell you that short-term ones are policies that are issued for one year, but in fact it often happens that insurance life for three or even five years is also called short-term.  This is necessary in order to separate them from other types of agreements that are concluded for several decades. </p><p>  The funded option in itself is long-term, regardless of the features of the policy.  At the same time, risk insurance in the overwhelming majority of cases is short-term, but in practice there are often situations when it is issued in case of death for 10-15 or even 25-30 years. </p><h2>  Voluntary pension insurance </h2><p>  In the CSG, this type of insurance is an accumulation program, with which a person can completely independently form a future pension for himself. </p><p>  Such programs are part of pension systems in most countries of the modern world, providing citizens with the opportunity to independently provide for their old age.  It is worth noting that such systems already depend not on the financial capabilities of the state, but directly on the capabilities and desires of the citizen himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="RGS affiliates" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/989895.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  UK employees say that there are several options for how funds can be disbursed when applying for pension insurance: </p><ul><li>  one-time payment after a person reaches retirement age; </li><li>  lifelong allowance; </li><li>  lifetime pension with a guaranteed payment period. </li></ul><p>  The last option has one feature.  If a person dies before the end of the specified period, the payment of the amount continues in favor of his heirs until the time specified in the policy expires. </p><p>  It is worth noting the fact that in the CSG insurance of this type can have a very different cost, and it depends directly on a number of factors.  In particular, the price is determined by the person‚Äôs age, gender, pension accumulation time, the planned contribution size, the selected payment format and the procedure for making contributions.  At the same time, the client independently determines the amount of the received amounts, retirement age and the frequency of making insurance contributions. </p><h2>  What do you need to know? </h2><p>  If, for one reason or another, a person dies before the agreed age, all the contributions that he paid to the company, including the accumulated capital, will ultimately be returned to his heirs. </p><p>  Not everyone turns their attention to the fact that <span>payments</span> in the <span>CSG</span> provide for certain correction factors that allow you to protect your capital in case of inflation.  Agree, this is quite important for our country, given the rather unstable economy. </p><p>  If necessary, you can revise your pension agreement depending on certain situations in life.  Thus (and customers confirm this information), if desired, you can change the size of the payment or the age after which they begin to be made.  In addition, you can make additional contributions, which is also important. </p><p>  Quite often it happens that a pension policy is a standard combination of risk insurance and investment contribution.  That is, a certain part of the contributions goes to cover risks, while the other part becomes a kind of investment.  Thus, if the insured person dies or receives a disability, the company fully pays the amount to its heirs. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning that the minimum possible percentage of savings in accordance with such an agreement may be 4% per annum, and in the CSG the policy may include even a large amount of funds.  However, we note that reviews often mention the possibility of receiving money only in accordance with the minimum rate, which really upsets current and potential customers. </p><h2>  CASCO </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, to date, CASCO insurance policies are in great demand in Russia, as the economic situation is gradually stabilizing more and more, while banks are massively providing loans to citizens to purchase cars, but they obligate borrowers to compulsorily fill out the aforementioned contract. </p><p>  Some people mistakenly believe that this term stands for ‚Äúcomprehensive auto insurance, except liability‚Äù, but in reality this is not at all true.  This concept has migrated to us from European practice and is an international legal term that describes the procedure for registration of protection of any vehicles, including water or air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="RGS insurance" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/989891.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Despite the fact that initially CASCO provides exclusively <span>vehicle insurance</span> against all kinds of damage or theft, it is possible to protect a variety of additional equipment, as well as the health and life of both the driver and passengers. </p><h2>  What affects the price? </h2><p>  Experts note that the most crucial moment in the process of applying for a policy is choosing the best insurance option.  Thus, there are several main factors in accordance with which the CSG (‚ÄúRosgosstrakh‚Äù) sets the price for the issued policy: </p><ul><li>  Selected option.  Today it is possible to issue a partial or full policy.  Full insurance includes insurance against theft or damage, while partial insurance covers only the latter type of risk. </li><li>  Availability as well as franchise size.  The cost of the policy is reduced depending on how big the franchise is. </li><li>  The amount of insurance.  It can be aggregate or non-aggregate (irreducible).  The option of using the first ultimately leads to the fact that with each subsequent payment of insurance savings are reduced.  So, such a policy will be much cheaper than non-aggregate. </li><li>  Indemnification.  There are several options, ranging from repairs in a particular workshop to just a cash payment.  In the predominant majority of cases, the product of the CSG (CTP or CASCO) provides for repair in the service station of the insurer.  In addition, many dwell on this option, since it has the most affordable price.  In any other case, you will need to pay more for the policy. </li><li>  The procedure for calculating payments.  Money can be transferred with or without depreciation.  Prefer the second option?  Then be prepared for the fact that the cost of insurance will increase significantly.  This is confirmed by many people in their reviews of the CSG. </li><li>  Seniority and age of the driver.  The cost of the policy depends on how experienced the car owner is and how old he is. </li></ul>

    <p>  Recently, people are not so often apply for hull insurance in the CSG.  The rating of this company is gradually decreasing, and this is largely due to the fact that the network now has a lot of negative reviews regarding the lack of payments. </p><p>  The organization itself offers fairly affordable conditions for a standard policy, including programs such as CASCO Economy and Elementary CASCO.  Also, if a person did not get into any accident, but at the same time decided to re-issue the policy here, the RGS insurance company gives him a certain discount. </p><h2>  What should I pay attention to? </h2><p>  Considering that quite a lot of reviews contain information about non-payments by this company, lawyers recommend initially to get as detailed as possible familiar with the terms of insurance before drawing up a contract if you apply to the CSG.  Branches offer the same policies, but the calculated cost should not be a decisive factor for you.  You should study as much as possible all points of the document, discuss all the nuances and determine the possibilities that you may use in the future. </p>

    <p>  First of all, pay attention to the storage conditions of the car at night.  This item periodically appears or disappears from the policy, but if it is still present, you should immediately understand that not all parking lots have official protected status and provide their clients with supporting documents. </p><p>  In the contract that you intend to conclude with the CSG (branches often offer the same agreement), such concepts as ‚Äútheft‚Äù, ‚Äúdamage‚Äù, ‚Äútheft‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúcomplete death of the car‚Äù should be clearly noted, and they should not just be mentioned, namely disclosed in detail.  Experienced drivers emphasize: if you do not insist on this point, in the end, in the event of a dispute, you may be denied appropriate compensation for damage. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúObligations of the Parties‚Äù section most clearly regulates the relationship between the client and the company.  In particular, it says in what specific time frame a person must notify the company regarding an insured event.  It often happens that failure to comply with the requirements specified in this contract leads to a denial of payments. </p><h2>  Addresses in Moscow </h2><p>  The RGS company (Moscow) allows you to contact the branches at the following addresses: </p><ul><li>  Kievskaya, 7; </li><li>  Krasnaya Presnya, 38; </li><li>  Myasnitskaya, 43; </li><li>  Leninsky Prospekt, 23; </li><li>  Novoslobodskaya, 31; </li><li>  Leningradsky Prospekt, 33. </li></ul><p>  Regardless of the address at which you decide to contact the RGS branch (Moscow is <span>a megalopolis,</span> so there are a lot of SK branches in it), you will be provided with exactly the same conditions for cooperation.  That is why you can always go directly to the office that is nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cgs payout" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/989897.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Addresses in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Branches of the UK we are considering are in almost every major city.  It is quite natural that in St. Petersburg you can also find a fairly large number of RGS offices.  Addresses are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Kuybysheva, 23; </li><li>  Tambovskaya, 33; </li><li>  Cash, 40; </li><li>  1st Krasnoarmeyskaya, 13; </li><li>  Tchaikovsky, 8; </li><li>  Industrial Avenue, 25. </li></ul><p>  As in the previous case, all customers are offered exactly the same conditions.  And this in no way depends on which branch they want to use the services of the RGS company through.  We provide addresses solely so that each person can choose the department most suitable for him and draw up a policy of interest to him. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, if desired, today everyone can take out insurance, regardless of their place of residence (in Russia) or their own age.  At the moment, the offices of the company we are considering are present in almost every major city, and in large quantities sufficient so that each person can get to the representative office as conveniently as possible for an insurance policy. </p>
