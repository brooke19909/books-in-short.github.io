We will talk about this later. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  fabric (it is better to choose a dense material); </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  acrylic paint; </li><li>  brush (sponge); </li><li>  napkins; </li><li>  varnish; </li><li>  sandpaper. </li></ul><h2>  Making a beautiful pot: step by step instructions </h2><p>  Now we will tell you how to make decoupage of flower pots (photos of finished works are presented above for clarity): </p><ol><li>  Take the pot.  You can use any size.  If you plan to put the plant in a pot, then it should have a drainage hole below.  It would be nice to find a saucer suitable for him.  It will be necessary to work with him, so that it matches the decor of the flowerpot. </li><li>  Wipe the pot with a damp sponge.  Even if you bought a brand new flowerpot, it can still be covered with dust.  This can prevent paint and glue from sticking.  Wipe the entire pot inside and out with a damp sponge and then dry.  If it has any rough edges, sand them with sandpaper.  Be sure to wipe the pot again when done. </li><li>  Using a brush, coat the outside of the pot with two to three layers of primer.  Everyone should dry before applying the next.  How much is required for each coat to dry depends on the type of primer used. </li><li>  After that, paint the outside of the pot with 2-3 layers of acrylic paint.  Allow each to dry before applying the next.  Acrylic dries quickly.  Therefore, you will need to wait 15 to 20 minutes between the next staining.  When you finish painting the flowerpot, it needs to dry completely. </li><li>  You can use any shade of paint in the work, but so that it matches the background of the fabric.  Then the completed work will look your best. </li><li>  Choose a fabric (it is better to use cotton).  Choose material with shapes that are easy to cut.  For example, with birds or flowers. </li><li>  You can use any design you want, but something themed that will look beautiful on a flower pot. </li><li>  How much fabric you need depends on how big the flowerpot is and how you plan to cover it (pattern, pattern, or completely).  You can cover the entire pot with a cloth.  Or you can add only a few drawings. </li><li>  Before using fabric for decoupage, it must be washed and ironed in order to prevent sticking of creased material.  Then the finished pot will look amazing. </li><li>  Cut out individual shapes or patterns from the fabric.  For example, if there are birds on the material, cut them out. </li><li>  Apply glue to the pot.  You can use a brush or brush. </li><li>  Glue the fabric (picture). </li><li>  Press on the glued fabric.  Use your fingers or a clean brush to smooth the material.  Start in the middle and move outward to the edges. </li><li>  Apply some glue to the image.  Starting at the center of the picture.  The brush will help smooth the edges and fix them. </li><li>  Continue bonding images.  You can stick one picture on a flowerpot or several.  You can even overlap images with each other for a collage effect.  If you decide to combine the images, the main thing is that the first layer is dry. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="petiteplanet.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY decoupage flower pot" class="if uuid-2426819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2426819.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoupage with pansies </h2><p>  Decoupage pot with a floral pattern of pansies will add bright spring colors to the home decor.
