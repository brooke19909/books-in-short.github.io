It is hard to imagine how many secrets the <span>impenetrable forests</span> and mountains on our planet keep.  For a long time, scientists have been struggling to unravel the purpose of huge structures based on stones - megaliths.  These buildings are found all over the world, and archaeologists have put forward more than one version of how and why these amazing structures were built from immense boulders, which even simply cannot be moved.  Our country also boasts of such buildings.  Of course, the megaliths of Russia are not as famous as the English Stonehenge, but no less mysterious.  In our article, we have collected the most famous megalithic buildings located on Russian territory. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaliths of Russia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1730446.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Megaliths - what is it? </h2><p>  Any study of puzzles begins with terminology, so we also need to find out what megaliths really are.  In the mid-nineteenth century, an English researcher for the first time introduced a new term that was supposed to characterize an extensive group of buildings of the Late Neolithic era.  Translated from Greek, megalith means "large stone", which allows the use of this term in a fairly wide range. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Classification of megaliths </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the purpose of many megalithic structures is still being studied by archaeologists, they managed to classify these structures.  Conventionally, they are divided into two groups.  The first includes megaliths, which were built from almost raw stone blocks.  In them, one large stone was mounted on another, thus forming walls and a roof.  Such architectural monuments have been preserved in large quantities around the world, sometimes they are represented by labyrinths of stones or a group of blocks with petroglyphs applied.  The cultures that left such monuments, scientists called megalithic. </p><p>  The second group of megaliths is of great interest to archaeologists.  These structures cannot be called rough, and their purpose has not yet been determined.  Most often, ancient megaliths are a masonry of large blocks, in some cases weighing more than a hundred tons.  They are carefully crafted and have a clear geometric shape.  Each block is perfectly matched to the other, so even a knife blade is difficult to stick into the gap between them.  Surprisingly, usually quarries where such huge blocks of stone could be mined were located several tens of kilometers from the construction site.  How the ancient people moved them is still unknown.  Moreover, in written sources, there is not even a mention of megalithic processing technology and the purpose of the building itself.  In this regard, scientists are constantly pushing new versions. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Big Stone" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1730449.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The appointment of megaliths </h2><p>  Archaeologists and historians cannot come to a consensus in a dispute over the designation of megalithic buildings.  Most of them believe that the megaliths of the first group were used mainly as burial chambers.  Ritual ceremonies were often performed around such structures, and subsequently the first stone observatories appeared.  They conducted observations of celestial bodies, calculated the days of the solstice and conducted a lunar calendar.  In many megalithic buildings, archaeologists found various stone devices that helped make observations, and small blocks were painted with starry skies at different times of the year. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Scientists often argue about the second group of megaliths.  These buildings are already reminiscent of residential buildings, because sometimes such blocks were laid out some similarities of cities.  But what technologies allowed people to conduct such construction, scientists do not know.  They definitely know one thing - it was simply impossible for primitive tools to process stone blocks like this (many of them have an even angle of ninety degrees) and even more so to move them.  The megaliths of Russia are mostly represented by the second group of structures.  They are located in different parts of the country and are available not only for research expeditions, but also for those who are fond of the mysteries of the past and seek to join the secrets hidden in the depths of centuries. </p><h2>  Mysterious Devil's Hillfort: Description </h2><p>  For several decades, the <span>stone city</span> in the Perm region has been the main attraction of this region.  Nine years ago, it was recognized as a natural landscape monument and organized groups of tourists began to drive here.  What is the Devil's Hillfort? </p><p>  At the very top of the Rudyansky Spoi ridge, there is a whole city built of stones.  Here are huge squares, narrow streets and squat houses.  You can go from one part of the city to another through beautiful arches, and a wide avenue runs through the very center of the settlement.  The stone city is located at an altitude of 526 meters, from here an incredibly beautiful view of the taiga opens, which has crept up to the very foot of the ridge. </p><p>  In some parts of this amazing place, the rock massif is cut through with cracks up to 12 meters, many of them have a smooth structure and seem to be made with a laser.  The stones that became the basis of the Devil's Settlement are slabs of quartz sandstone.  For many years, under the influence of wind, water and the sun, many blocks took a bizarre shape.  Tourists examined here turtles, rats, seals and various idols, which now belong to the only inhabitants of the majestic Stone City. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can come to the Devil's Hillfort at any time of the year.  It is always amazingly beautiful here, especially tourists like to admire this place in autumn colors.  Then the city acquires a certain liveliness and seems quite inhabited.  It is particularly beautiful in winter, when snow caps hang over the streets and roofs of stone "houses". </p><h2>  Legend of the origin of the Devil's hillfort </h2><p>  Locals are happy to tell the legend of how the Stone Town appeared in the taiga.  Once it was a real and rich city, its inhabitants rejoiced in their ruler - the wise and just king.  But one thing saddened the hearts of all the inhabitants of the city - the king’s daughter was blind from birth and could not see the beauties surrounding her.  Once in the settlement appeared a sorcerer who promised to cure a young princess.  But as soon as she was able to see the first light through the veil of darkness, the whole city and its inhabitants turned into stone.  Since then, the Stone Town has stood in all its beauty - immovable and beautiful. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Mount Vottovaara located?" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1730463.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Stone Town Education: The Official Science Version </h2><p>  Of course, the legend of the Devil's hillfort is quite beautiful, but in fact the history of the formation of this natural monument is much more prosaic.  Scientists have discovered that several million years ago a riverbed was located on the site of the Stone Town.  It was she who did these magnificent arches, avenues and tunnels.  Unfortunately, for those who are looking for traces of the activities of ancient civilizations in the Perm Territory, the Devil's Settlement was not formed as a result of human activity.  But from this it is no less attractive and beautiful.  Every year an increasing number of tourists come here and even all-Russian mountaineering competitions are held. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaliths of Siberia riddle Mountain Shoria" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1730451.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Megaliths of Siberia: the riddle of Mountain Shoria </h2><p>  In the south of the Kemerovo region there are megaliths of <span>Mountain Shoria,</span> which are the subject of the most fierce debate of Russian scientists.  Researchers became interested in this place in Soviet times, but most of the roads leading to Mountain Shoria were then blocked by roadblocks.  There were places of detention in this area, and it was not possible to investigate megaliths.  In the early nineties, scientists made another attempt to study the mysterious boulders, but the collapse of the USSR for a long time cooled the ardor of the researcher.  After all, archaeologists did not have the financial opportunities to assemble an expedition. </p><p>  Two years ago, thanks to the enthusiast Georgy Sidorov, a research expedition was assembled, which simply came to sensational conclusions about the megaliths of Mountain Shoria. </p><h2>  Sidorov expedition data </h2><p>  Researchers have discovered megalithic structures of incredible size in different parts of the massif.  One of the walls was two hundred meters long, and its blocks weighed about one thousand tons.  Many blocks were twenty meters by seven meters, and the wall, made of them, is at a height of one thousand meters.  It is hard to imagine how megaliths reached such a height. </p><p>  Their processing caused a real delight among scientists, because almost all the blocks have a clear geometric shape, and many are ideally fitted to each other.  At the top of one of the walls, scientists noticed traces of melting rock.  A similar effect is caused only by thermonuclear reactions, which once again led archaeologists to the idea of ​​the extraterrestrial origin of the structures. </p><p>  At some distance from the wall, members of the expedition noticed another incredible building.  It is made on an extensive stone foundation and is a rounded structure of vertical megaliths.  Separate blocks are scattered next to the main building, this picture resembles the destruction that occurred as a result of a powerful explosion. </p>

    <p>  Surprisingly, all members of the expedition talked about how compasses near megaliths began to deviate from the stones.  This is associated with the action of a negative magnetic field.  But that's where it could come from, scientists are only speculating.  Georgy Sidorov himself adheres to the version that Siberia was the ancestral home of all human civilization.  And it was here that the peoples lived who possessed incredible technologies that disappeared as a result of a space catastrophe.  Many scholars believe that the megaliths of Russia may be more ancient than the pyramids of Egypt or the abandoned cities of Peru.  And by far the blocks in Mountain Shoria are the largest of the found on the planet.  According to preliminary estimates, some megaliths weigh more than four tons.  Such a finding could well turn scientists' ideas about the course of human history.  But, unfortunately, it is these facts that scare the modern scientific world.  Indeed, engineering megalithic structures do not fit into well-known historical milestones.  Therefore, no one is in a hurry to provide the general public with the data obtained by the Sidorov expedition.  In the future, enthusiasts plan to assemble several more initiative groups and continue exploring Mountain Shoria. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Pidan in Primorye" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1730465.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Place of Power - Mount Pidan </h2><p>  Mount Pidan in Primorye is one of the most <span>mysterious places in Russia.</span>  Many legends are composed about it, and so far none of the research groups have been able to explain the magical energy of the mountain. </p><p>  Pidan is two hours away by car from Vladivostok and rises one thousand three hundred meters above the sea.  Thousands of tourists come here every year, and in the season on the trail you can meet several hundred tourists at the same time, ready to spend the whole day on this difficult trip.  What attracts people so much here?  After all, it is known that having climbed Pidan once, many become "attached" to this mountain and strive here every year, or even twice a year. </p><p>  Historians say that in the fifth or seventh century AD, the Bohai civilization lived at the foot of the mountain, possessing incredible knowledge.  At the moment, there are several options for the origin of the name of the mountain, but scientists believe that it means the phrase "stones thrown by the gods."  According to legend, the gods threw a handful of stones at the Bohai warriors, competing in strength and dexterity.  But these are all legends, but in fact Pidan is filled with secrets of riddles that excite the minds of our contemporaries. </p><p>  Under the mountain, scientists found a large lake with healing water, it helps to gain strength and relieves fatigue.  Getting to the lake is quite difficult, but every tourist can take a dip in the mountain waterfalls and get drunk water from streams running down the slopes.  The water here is surprisingly clean and tasty, but it really adds strength (if you believe the tourists). </p><p>  Of great interest are the megaliths at the foot and on the slopes of Mount Pidan.  The Bohai legends say that a crystal was located at the top, to which only priests could rise.  This was clearly followed by the Maori - five-meter stone idols in the amount of twenty-seven pieces.  At an equal distance, they were located from each other and surrounded a wall of smooth stone blocks.  Each Māori had a guard man nearby, who was energetically attached to a stone idol and obeyed his will.  In cases where an outsider penetrated the mountain, the Maori began to glow and buzz.  At the same time, a guard went in search of the intruder; he had no pity and could fly a bird along the slopes.  Everyone who entered the mountain without permission was put to death.  To this day, the remains of the wall and one Māori at the foot of the mountain have been preserved.  The second idol is located on the way to the top, they say that before there was a crystal. </p><p>  Through him, the gods spoke with the Bohai priests, instructed them and helped.  But once they took the crystal and stopped talking with the priests.  The Maori were dead, and their energy was weakened.  The neighboring tribes took advantage of the situation and completely destroyed the ancient Bohai civilization. </p><p>  On the way to the top, many tourists are embraced by an unprecedented sensation - some experience fear, others are euphoric, and still others cannot climb the mountain at all.  Such cases happen very often, this suggests that the rise must be stopped.  Next time, perhaps the situation will change.  Those whom the "mountain accepts" are in for an incredible sight.  Around are large and small dolmens, and at the very top there is a sacrificial altar, on which you must leave some of your little thing in order to thank the gods. </p><p>  Each climb to Pidan gives a lot of emotions and strength, but it is not always safe.  Often, especially at dusk, tourists meet a flying person.  He is a rather large creature with hairy legs and webbed wings.  It does not bring harm to people, but causes a feeling of horror and panic.  Perhaps this is exactly what the ancient guards of Mount Pidan looked like. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone city in the Perm region" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1730466.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Where is Mount Vottovaara located? </h2><p>  Karelia is a favorite place for ufologists, historians and archaeologists.  This is a magnet for various adventurers who are ready to spend months in Karelian swamps to find some new mysterious place.  The most picturesque and mystical corner of Karelia became Mount Vottovaara.  It is part of a mountain range in the Muezersky district and is considered a place of mysterious power and witchcraft. </p><p>  When the ancient Sami tribes lived near the mountain.  Their Noida priests possessed supernatural abilities and helped their people survive in harsh environmental conditions.  It is known that the Noyds could subjugate large groups of people by force of will and force them to do anything.  Even the Soviet secret services sought to gain knowledge of the Noides, but they could not do it.  The priests performed their rituals on Mount Vottovaara with the help of seids - huge rounded boulders standing in the strangest places of the mountain.  Surprisingly, many megaliths have a weight of several tons and practically balance in the abyss.  But they have stood in their places for thousands of years. </p><p>  Scientists are surprised that birds and animals do not live on <span>Mount Vottovaara</span> , and numerous lakes are completely dead.  All the trees are curved and twisted in a bizarre manner, and after the last fire they look a little sinister.  Do not rely on grief and on technology.  She constantly refuses, and the most incredible things happen to people.  Many people hear the voices of spirits, gain paranormal abilities, and surprisingly begin to predict the past. </p><p>  The most interesting places on the mountain are the seids, a stone staircase of thirteen steps ending in a cliff, as well as an unusual black well surrounded by even blocks of geometric shape. </p><p>  Of great interest is the so-called amphitheater.  It is an almost regular shaped platform with a swampy lake in the middle.  The amphitheater is located on the top of the Vottovaara mountain, which tourists should definitely get to. </p><p>  The megaliths of Russia are amazing and, unfortunately, still little studied.  But thanks to enthusiasts, they become more and more popular every year.      ,    ,   .     ,         . </p>
