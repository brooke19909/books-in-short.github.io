Economy class apartments can be purchased on the outskirts of the metropolis, but more prestigious square meters are being developed in the city center.  So, in the Primorsky district of St. Petersburg, the Stockholm residential complex is being built, which the developer positions as premium housing.  In this regard, the cost per square meter is unlikely to be available to an ordinary resident of the Northern capital. </p><p>  Represents the Stockholm LCD Setl City - a construction and investment company, which already has a lot of original and very good projects.  Many complexes erected by the developer today are a real decoration of St. Petersburg.  Promises to become such and LCD "Stockholm".  In any case, the reviews available at the moment about him vividly testify to the unusual, if not uniqueness of the project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd stockholm" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1296628.jpg" width="600"></div>

Despite the fact that the plans include the construction of only two buildings of different floors (from 5 to 7), the project can be considered large-scale, since complex development involves not only the construction of residential buildings, but also a kindergarten, underground parking, as well as a complete arrangement of the territory in three more than a hectare in order to provide a truly comfortable living environment. </p><p>  The cases are arranged in the shape of a horseshoe, which not only protects the interior of the territory from cold winds and noise, but also makes the appearance of buildings very unusual and original.  About 270 apartments (from one to five-room apartments) will be put up for sale in houses.  Penthouses will be located on the upper floors, and commercial objects on the lower floors.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments is from 41 to 245 square meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd stockholm prices" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1296642.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  The construction of the Stockholm residential complex (St. Petersburg) began in 2014.  Construction is carried out in one turn, using brick-monolithic technology.  All facilities should be put into operation at the end of 2017.  The progress of construction work at this stage is fully consistent with the approved schedule, there are no lags. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Already today there is a sale of apartments on the basis of equity participation.  The developer gives completely transparent information on the progress of work and offers everyone to purchase apartments in the complex, as well as real estate investors to visit the construction site.  You can find the Stockholm residential complex at the address: Primorsky Boulevard, plot No. 46. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  According to experts, the environmental situation in the Primorsky region is favorable.  There are no industrial zones and hazardous industries in this region, but several large parks are located in the surrounding complex, including them.  Kirov.  The proximity of the river and the Gulf of Finland also contribute to improving the environmental situation.  In addition, the developer intends to carry out work on landscaping the yards of the complex, to create green areas and places for recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd stockholm spb" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1296643.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  When planning the location of any residential complex in <span>St. Petersburg, developers</span> are trying to maximally tie it to existing objects of social and retail-entertainment infrastructure.  In the case of the residential complex we are describing, it was not required to put special efforts at all.  The prestigious Primorsky district is literally crammed with all kinds of shopping malls, supermarkets, restaurants, bars and cafes.  So, next to the Stockholm residential complex there are several pharmacies, two clinics, four supermarkets, including Lenta and Auchan, three grocery stores.  Nearby there is a large <span>shopping and entertainment center.</span>  As for the <span>social infrastructure,</span> there is a complete order with its facilities in the region.  Near the complex there are three schools, there are two d / s (plus will also be built own), next to the houses there is a prestigious ballet school and art studio. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In this regard, the developer will not have to spend time and money on the construction of his own infrastructure, and therefore it was decided to spend all the money saved on landscaping, especially since it is planned to make it as safe and secure as possible and equip it with the most modern video surveillance tools.  Which, by the way, according to reviews, is very popular with future residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd stockholm reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1296644.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Transport infrastructure </h2><p>  A ten minute walk from the complex is the metro station "Old Village".  With public transport in the area also complete order, minibuses and buses are more than enough.  In addition, in the summer it is proposed to use the services of an aquabus, the stop of which is located opposite the houses.  Motorists will appreciate all the possibilities of Primorsky Prospekt, as well as the proximity of the <span>Western High-Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãDiameter,</span> which is only five kilometers away. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Stockholm LCD belongs to the premium class.  For sale are one-five-room apartments, in addition, you can purchase penthouses located on the upper floors of the buildings.  All living spaces have an ergonomic and functional layout.  Moreover, the developer also foresaw the possibility, if the client so desires, of changing the location of the partitions.  Which, by the way, if you carefully look at the reviews about the complex, buyers are extremely pleased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="housing estate stockholm" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1296635.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There are more than enough planning decisions, each potential buyer will be able to easily choose the right option for himself.  All living rooms have separate bathrooms, as well as spacious hallways and kitchens.  Each apartment has a glazed loggia.  The penthouses have panoramic terraces. </p><p>  <span>Finishing is</span> provided <span>,</span> which includes leveling the walls and screed floor.  As for the final finishing, it will be carried out only after agreement with the customer (the owner of the apartment) and on an individual design project by the developer.  In any case, it is clear that residents of premium class houses will not glue the wallpaper themselves. </p><h2>  LCD "Stockholm": apartment prices </h2><p>  In principle, the value of apartments follows from the segment to which they relate.  Premium property a priori cannot be cheap.  So, for a one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 45 "squares" will have to pay more than seven and a half million rubles.  Dvushka - from 51 to 65 square meters.  m - will cost in the amount of 9,300,000 to 12,900,000 rubles, three rubles (82 to 100 "squares") - 12,200,000 - 48,500,000 rubles.  For a four-room apartment (110-127 sq. M) you will have to pay from 29 to 97 million, a five-room apartment (200-245 "squares) - from 88 to one hundred million rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd stockholm set city" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1296646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The head begins to spin from zeros of already the minimum cost, what then to speak of the maximum.  Nevertheless, due to the fact that the complex is still under construction, these prices may well change by the deadline.  Which, incidentally, the builder honestly warns about and strongly recommends that anyone who is able to master such a purchase do it now. </p><h2>  LCD Stockholm: reviews </h2><p>  What say those who, perhaps, in the near future will become the owner of luxury housing?  On the quality of the living quarters themselves and their final finishing, of course, no reviews can be found.  The residential complex has not yet been commissioned, the result is therefore unclear.  Although, given the impeccable reputation of the developer, it is understandable.  All apartments from Setl City are a brand already tested by time, so, most likely, no complaints will arise.  Future residents are delighted with the layouts, as well as the ability to transfer internal partitions in accordance with their own tastes.  People also like the fact that the developer is concerned about the security issue, and therefore promises to establish a multi-level security structure.  And people are happy that there are as many parking spaces as there are apartments, most often they are usually not enough in new buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1296648.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ecology of the Primorsky region, the provision of infrastructure facilities and transport - everything is at its best.  Nearby is the resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Gulf of Finland - what else can you dream of?  In general, almost all unanimously declare that the project is really gorgeous in all respects, many would not refuse to live in such a place.  It is impossible to meet the negative in reviews at this stage.  People do not frighten even the high prices, since everyone believes that the project is thought out to the smallest detail.  Well, and how it will actually be - time will tell.  There is not much time left before the commissioning of the residential complex. </p>
