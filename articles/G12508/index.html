What crafts developed in Kievan Rus?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ancient crafts of Russia is one of the pillars on which the original culture of our state is based.  They begin in the primitive society, when all activity was collective, and the instruments of labor were the simplest.  However, already in those days, our ancestors were characterized by a desire for beauty.  Together, tools and household items were decorated with ornaments, they were given a special shape.  As a rule, all, as they would say now, decorative elements possessed magical properties: they protected, attracted luck.  The Eastern Slavs were similar in this respect to other tribes.  The ancient crafts of Russia were distinguished by special techniques and techniques, original motifs.  By the time of the creation of the Kiev state, our ancestors were already masters in many types of applied art. </p><h2>  The blacksmith - artisan and sorcerer </h2><p>  It is not difficult to understand which ancient crafts in Russia were especially honored by numerous legends, legends and sayings.  Often in the stories there is a blacksmith who makes a miracle sword for a hero, often he is endowed with magical abilities and wisdom. </p><p>  Metalworking in Russia was indeed one of the most sought-after skills.  She was one of the first to stand out in an independent craft.  The blacksmith was revered and respected, and iron was considered a safe material, capable of properly protecting and respecting him, protecting his master not only from evil people, but also from evil spirits. </p><p>  The development of craft in Kievan Rus reached amazing heights: almost all modern types of metal processing were known to our ancestors.  Most often, forging, filigree, niello, casting and embossing were used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Subtle art </h2><p>  Special mention worthy of jewelry.  In it, Russia also reached significant heights.  Favorite techniques were the filigree (filigree), black, as well as grain and enamel (enamel) already mentioned.  The creation of the masters of the times of Kievan Rus and later sometimes amaze.  For example, enamel resembled a mosaic with such a carefully prescribed pattern that in the eyes of the captured heroes one could distinguish a dark pupil and a light squirrel.  Similar paintings were created from pieces of colored glass.  They were crushed and mixed with a little water.  The resulting mass was filled in the details of the products and then they were baked several times.  As a result, the enamel was fused with metal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient crafts of russia" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/814597.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Metallic lace and spray </h2><p>  The fabric was an openwork ornament of the finest gold or silver wire.  In such a technique, various decorations, caskets and some other household items were made.  Filigree gave them airiness and special lightness.  Without exaggeration, such products can be called made of metal lace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient crafts in Russia" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/814599.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <p>  Mobile was an alloy of silver and sulfur.  In the manufacture of jewelry on a metal blank pattern was scratched.  Then they poured everything with black and sent to bake.  Under the action of high temperature, the alloys were combined, the pattern was filled with a mixture of sulfur and silver.  After the master only had to remove the excess sections of the mobile.  The resulting products were distinguished by the contrast of the noble shine of the metal and the matte surface of the pattern. </p><h2>  Clay work </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts in Russia photo" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/814600.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  The second time after appearance after metal processing in Russia was pottery.  Initially, dishes and other utensils were sculpted by hand.  However, crafts in Russia developed rapidly, and in the 9-10 centuries.  Slavs already used a potter‚Äôs wheel.  As a result, clay products spread throughout the state.  Pottery workshops are no longer a rarity.  Each of them created products that are something different from the creations of other artisans.  Masters adhered, in modern language, to their own style.  The differences could relate to technological issues: temperature and firing time, clay composition - or decor: colors used, shape features, various additional decorating elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Crafts in Russia with the adoption of Christianity began to develop according to Orthodox canons.  Potters, in addition to traditional toys and utensils, began to make various items necessary for the church, and tiles - decorative tiles that were used as decoration. </p><h2>  Living stuff </h2><p>  The ancient crafts of Russia is difficult to imagine without woodcarving.  It also arose among our ancestors a very long time ago.  Toys and furniture, home furnishings and dwellings were decorated with carvings.  Wood was considered warm, living material.  Like metal, it was able to protect, protect from disaster, so wooden products were found everywhere in the ancient state.  The availability of material played a huge role in this.  Dwellings were built from wood, spinning wheels and spindles, toys and cradles, sledges and arches were made.  At all times in Russia, he was treated with great honor.  The master tried to understand the soul, enclosed in a piece of wood, and, creating a common or sacred object, to reveal it as much as possible, without adding too much from himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts in Russia for children" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/814596.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Novgorodians were considered the most skilled carvers.  On the territory of the ancient city some time ago, an impressive monument of wooden architecture was found: an eleven-meter column dating from the 11th century.  A carving adorns its entire length, the motives of which are never repeated. </p><h2>  Forgotten tricks </h2><p>  As often happens, with the advent of new materials and technologies, obsolete knowledge fades into the background, sometimes completely lost, sometimes only in the form of rare products that have not been destroyed by time.  Many crafts of Kievan Rus impoverished in this way.  For example, today few people know that wood carving, having entered the service of Christianity, was used not only to create interior and exterior decoration of church interiors.  Masters made iconostases and icon cases - this is a fairly well-known fact.  In time, the art of wooden icon painting was lost.  Very little is known today about creating images of saints using woodcarvings. </p><h2>  Stone craftsmen </h2><p>  Crafts in Russia were associated with a wide variety of materials common in the territory of the <span>settlement of the Eastern Slavs.</span>  In addition to those already mentioned, the craftsmen used stone.  Products from it were not inferior in grace and beauty to wooden creations.  <span>Stone carvings</span> adorned buildings, most often built of white limestone, slate or marble.  Rarely, it was found on smaller objects.  In Russia, bone scallops were spread, as well as icons.  Masters worked on creating small images of saints.  Such icons could be worn around the neck by hanging on a strap.  Often, stone carving supplemented church tiles. </p><h2>  The position of the masters </h2><p>  Ancient crafts in Russia were valued unequally.  They were divided into two groups.  The revered belonged to jewelry (goldsmithing), icon painting and some others.  Among the "dirty" belonged, for example, pottery. </p><p>  In most cases, the craftsmen worked to order.  Artisans belonged to different strata of society.  In the cities one could meet free masters.  They were engaged in blacksmithing, jewelry, coinage and icon painting.  In princely and boyar yards, estates and estates, dependent artisans and slaves lived.  Various masters could be found in monasteries. </p><h2>  Creations of female hands </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts in Russia in the 16th century" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/814598.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  It was in the monasteries that such ancient crafts of Russia as sewing and weaving developed most of all.  They were engaged in women.  Products of craftswomen of that time and today amaze with their beauty.  Fabrics were made from hemp, linen or wool.  The fabrication process has become much easier after the advent of the horizontal loom.  It happened at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. </p><p>  A widespread type of female needlework was patterned weaving: branded, canvas embroidery, ‚Äúsilk hoop‚Äù (embroidery with hoop) and so on.  Craftswomen decorated <span>church utensils</span> and household items with various patterns.  Old Russian sewing was often exported by merchants to other countries.  There it also enjoyed universal admiration. </p><h2>  Temporary decline </h2><p>  The heyday in history is most often replaced by years, and sometimes centuries of wilting.  It was in this state that the crafts of Russia of the 14th century were located, during the most enduring rule of the Mongol-Tatar khans.  Many masters died during the battles, in an attempt to defend their hometowns.  During the existence of the Mongol-Tatar yoke in Russia, the development of jewelry was almost completely stopped, the production of enamel, filigree and grains stopped.  Other types of craft were no less affected.  However, the revival of applied art began in the next, 15th century. </p><h2>  Heyday again </h2><p>  The period from the 15th to the 17th century was a time of strengthening the new Russian state.  The center of the association of principalities was Moscow.  Ancient crafts, which existed in Russia <span>from time immemorial,</span> again began to gain strength.  She sought to surround herself with exquisite objects, luxury and wealth.  Craftsmen gathered in the court of the prince, and then the king, engaged in stone or wood carving, weaving and embroidery, and jewelry. </p><p>  The development of commodity-money relations.  As a result, crafts in Russia in the 16th century became the main source of income for residents of many cities.  Artisan crafts were gradually formed.  The oldest among them is considered to have arisen in the 16-17 centuries in the Trinity-Sergius Monastery.  Here the craftsmen were engaged in wood and bone carving, and a little later a toy craft also arose. </p><h2>  World star </h2><p>  After the 15th century, almost all crafts in Russia began to actively develop.  Khokhloma painting and Dymkovo toys are especially familiar among children.  These types of art crafts are still very popular today, not only here, but also abroad. </p><p>  Khokhloma enriched crafts in Russia in the 17th century.  This type of painting was used to decorate various <span>wooden utensils</span> and furniture.  Khokhloma is well recognized thanks to the traditional color scheme: red, black and green on a gold background.  The painting masters had their secrets.  For example, for the background, not a golden powder was applied to a wooden blank, but a mixture of tin and silver.  Then the product was coated with a special composition and baked several times in the oven.  Thus, the desired golden hue was achieved.  Khokhloma painting always completely covered the product: the tree was not at all noticeable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what crafts developed in Russia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/814593.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bright and unique </h2><p>  Another famous craft, originating, apparently, in this period, is a <span>Dymkovo toy.</span>  She got her name at the place of origin.  Kirov settlement Dymkovo was famous for its red clay.  All over the world there are no products like a bright and fun toy.  It is interesting that the production technology is quite simple, and if desired, such a figurine can be made independently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the ancient crafts in Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/814595.jpg" width="539"></div>

    <p>  The crafts of Ancient Russia are not forgotten today.  You can even say that they are going through a new stage of development.  The interest in folk traditions of ancient times is reviving: beliefs, costume, customs and art crafts.  Crafts are actively studied both in relevant specialties at universities and independently.  Needlework is in great demand today, and therefore craftsmen are happy to turn to traditional craft.  The technology undergoes various changes: new compositions, paints, bases and fixatives are used, in some cases - electrical devices.  On the other hand, in some cases, the <span>production method</span> as a whole remains unchanged. </p><p>  It should be noted that studying the question of what crafts developed in Russia is important for understanding the distinctive Russian culture and helps to imbue it with its spirit.  The revival of interest in this topic indicates the relevance of such processes.  We can say that crafts in Russia (photos of products that fill the Internet in many, only confirm this) are still alive and continue to develop. </p>
