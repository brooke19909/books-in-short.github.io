It was here that one could meet the service an order of magnitude higher than in domestic resorts, for example, on the Black Sea beaches of the Krasnodar Territory or on the <span>Crimean Peninsula.</span>  In addition, the main advantage of the Bulgarian coast is the finest golden sand, shining in the sun, like gold of the highest standard.  They say that it has life-giving properties and has a beneficial effect on the human body.  And in general, nature generously endowed this small Balkan country with beauties.  In addition to magnificent beaches, here you can find quite dense <span>mixed forests</span> with a predominance of conifers, beautiful flowering gardens, vegetable gardens, rose gardens, vast fields and meadows covered with lush green mountains of bizarre shapes, majestic cliffs, etc. In short, it‚Äôs a sin not to visit this an amazingly beautiful country, which, in addition to everything, is under our nose.  In addition, the prices here are just ridiculous.  For example, a weekly tour to the Sunny Varshava 3 * hotel (Golden Sands) today costs from 20,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunny varshava 3" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/667321.jpg" width="414"></div>

    <h2>  Golden Sands </h2><p>  The entire Bulgarian coast is divided into several resort areas, of which the most popular among Russians are Sunny Beach, Albene, and the famous Golden Sands, located near the largest port of Varna.  By the way, this resort got its name by no means for <span>advertising purposes</span> to attract more tourists, but in connection with an ancient legend.  In addition to the magnificent sandy beaches with modern infrastructure, Golden Sands is also famous for its lush vegetation.  Many of the local hotels, for example Sunny Varshava 3 *, are buried in the greenery of ancient trees that are part of the <span>national park.</span>  No matter what service you get at your hotel of choice, oxygen saturation and complete relaxation are guaranteed.  The climate of these places also contributes to a favorable rest: almost never there is a sweltering heat, and cold too.  But the water in the swimming season can warm up to 25-26 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunny varshava 3 golden sands" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/667319.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of rest in Golden Sands </h2><p>  The resort has many nightclubs, discos, cabarets, restaurants and cafes, so at night it is not quiet and peaceful.  Those tourists who are too annoyed by noise can buy tours to hotels that are either on the outskirts or high on a hill, like the Sunny Varshava 3 * hotel.  Guest reviews on this subject are positive.  Many who lived in the hotel indicate that it is quite calm in the evenings, since the building is located on a hill (800 m) in a park area, away from places where tourists gather, thirsting for noisy and fun entertainment.  In view of this, couples of retirement age, as well as families with small children, choose this hotel. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From Russia you can get to the Bulgarian resorts in different ways: by air, rail, and also the simplest - by road.  If you purchased a ticket to the Sunny Varshava 3 * hotel, then the best option for arrival is a flight from the capital and some major cities of Russia to Varna.  If you didn‚Äôt stint while making the tour and bought a transfer, then a representative of the tour operator or the hotel will meet you at the airport and take you to the hotel, which is located 18 kilometers from Varna, in the southern part of the Golden Sands resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunny varshava 3 reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/667323.jpg" width="500"></div>

It also includes a two-star hotel of the same name.  Compared with it, the conditions in the three-star building are improved, the rooms are more spacious and better furnished, but all the other amenities: a restaurant, a swimming pool, a fitness club, sports activities, etc., are common for guests of both buildings.  Nevertheless, tourists who have lived at this hotel for some time are not quite happy with Sunny Varshava 3 * (Bulgaria).  Their reviews on both 2 * and 3 * buildings are not the most positive.  In some of them, there are comments that the hotel does not even correspond to 2 * according to European classification.  From the comments it becomes clear that little has changed here since the time when Bulgaria was a socialist republic. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has only 45 comfortable rooms in the "standard" category, there are also rooms for the disabled and non-smokers.  By type of settlement there are double, triple and quadruple rooms.  In double rooms there is either a large double bed or two single beds, in a triple room there is one double and one single or three single beds, in a family room for four there is one double bed for adults and a bunk bed for children.  In addition, the rooms are equipped with a balcony, a bathroom, air conditioning, a TV, a kitchenette, a fridge, an iron and an <span>ironing board</span> , etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sunny varshava 3" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/667324.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Room Service </h2><p>  Rooms are cleaned and linen is changed once or twice a week.  So it is written in promotional materials.  However, guests claim the exact opposite about Sunny Varshava 3 * (Bulgaria).  The reviews and photos in the comments section are proof of this.  Some tourists report that very little attention is paid to cleanliness and order.  And this, of course, does not speak in favor of the professionalism of the staff, as well as the hotel administration. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and entertainment </h2><p>  In Sunny Varshava 3 * pretty good service.  Guests of both buildings can relax next to the outdoor pool, around which there is a sunbathing and relaxation area, as well as a pulbar.  The hotel also has parking and car rental, a doctor‚Äôs and masseur‚Äôs office, laundry service, currency exchange, internet cafe, bar, etc. For sports and outdoor enthusiasts, the hotel complex has billiards, table tennis, etc. There is also a nearby aquapark. </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2>

    <p>  As already noted, this hotel is perfect for families with children.  For kids there is a children's pool, a playground, etc. In addition, the restaurant has high chairs for the convenience of young guests.  When checking in, you can ask for a special bed for babies. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists who bought a tour to the Sunny Varshava 3 * hotel can choose one of two types of food: BB (breakfast only) or OI (all-inclusive).  Former guests are advised to choose the first option and be satisfied with the local breakfast.  And do not think that the food here is of poor quality or tasteless.  It's just that with a long stay at the hotel, everything becomes boring, and taverns and restaurants serving original dishes and drinks of local cuisine are located nearby.  In addition to the main restaurant, the hotel also has a cafe, bar, etc. And those who, contrary to advice, have chosen the all-inclusive system, have the opportunity to have breakfast buffet (local and international cuisine) from 7.30 to 10 in the morning.  Lunch is served from 12.00 to 13.00, and dinner is from 6 pm to 8. In addition, snacks can be enjoyed at the pool bar between 10 and 12 (until noon).  Fans of Italian cuisine - pizza and pasta - can enjoy their favorite food from 2 to 4 days.  From 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. tourists can enjoy tea, coffee and other drinks.  By the way, at the restaurant, local alcoholic drinks are served at dinner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunny varshava 3 bulgaria reviews and photos" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/667318.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel is on the second line - 300 meters from the beach area.  A picturesque descent path leads to the sea.  According to some vacationers, the path is completely tireless.  However, older people will need to spend a lot of energy to overcome it.  Since the beach is not the property of the hotel, tourists have to pay for sun loungers and umbrellas.  Here they can rent a scooter, a catamaran or master water rides. </p>
