    <p>  Today, there are several large companies that provide the best services on the market.  Among them, Rosgosstrakh is worth mentioning separately.  To date, the company offers to issue an insurance policy at half price.  Is it true?  Is there a catch?  Consider the features of this type of insurance. </p><h2>  Casco insurance calculator </h2><p>  Thanks to the Internet, you can perform most of the manipulations.  Therefore, before purchasing an insurance policy, it is recommended to go to the company's website and use an online calculator.  The same conditions apply in almost all UK.  In order to clarify the final cost of the service, it is enough to enter the make, model of the car, year of manufacture, average cost and the number of people who have the right to drive this vehicle. </p><p>  After that, you can get the approximate cost of the finished policy.  The company "Rosgosstrakh" also has such a casco calculator.  Payment of insurance is usually made in any convenient way.  To do this, you can use a plastic card, electronic money or other online payment systems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Casco "50 to 50" from "Rosgosstrakh": liability of the insurance company </h2><p>  Regardless of the selected tariff plan, SKs make payments in the following situations: </p><ul><li>  <em>In a collision with another vehicle.</em>  In this case, an accident can occur due to the fault of the owner of the insured car, or due to the negligence of another road user. </li><li>  <em>When running into residential objects or animals.</em>  In this case, the possible loss of vehicle control due to any technical malfunctions is also taken into account. </li><li>  <em>When a car capsizes as a result of a traffic accident</em> that occurred due to the fault of the driver or another road user. </li><li>  <em>As a result of the fall of any objects on the car</em> , including tree branches, snow, ice and much more. </li><li>  For ‚Äú50 to 50‚Äù comprehensive insurance, payments are made <em>when stones, debris, and debris are thrown out from under the wheels of other vehicles</em> that move along the side or front of the <em>vehicle</em> while on the road. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Features of the registration of an economical policy </h2><p>  Under the terms of the hull economy 50/50 from Rosgosstrakh, everything is clear from the name.  Obviously, in this case, the client pays only half the cost of issuing the certificate.  At the same time, he receives full protection and can count on payments, as with any other insurance policy, with full payment of the cost. </p><p>  However, it is worth considering an independent opinion.  According to reviews, the 50/50 insurance hull from Rosgosstrakh is beneficial for some drivers, but not for everyone.  In addition, the program differs not only in advantages, but also in some disadvantages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth paying attention to a rather obvious plus.  This proposal can really be considered very profitable and relevant, since in this case comprehensive insurance is provided that allows you to protect yourself from theft, theft and many other unpleasant things without additional surcharges. </p><p>  Also, the advantages of the ‚Äú50 to 50‚Äù hull from this insurance company include the fact that the concluded contract will be valid until the insured event occurs.  After that, the owner of the vehicle independently decides whether to use his insurance policy.  If the damage to the car is minor, then in this case it is much easier to make repairs yourself or to receive money on a voluntary basis from the violator. </p>

    <p>  If the amount of the surcharge does not exceed the specified figure in the Casco agreement, it is more profitable to apply for payment to the company. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  If we talk about the disadvantages of the ‚Äú50 to 50‚Äù hull from ‚ÄúRosgosstrakh‚Äù, then it is worth considering that in this case more stringent requirements will be imposed on the client.  Of course, no company wants to work at the expense of itself, so there is no point in issuing such profitable certificates to inexperienced drivers. </p><p>  In addition, there is a risk that the final cost of insurance will be higher than that which was paid before its execution.  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that if a person does not fully own a vehicle, that is, the car was issued on credit, which is still paid, it is impossible to obtain a policy under this program. </p><h2>  Why is it considered that Casco "50x50" is a franchise </h2><p>  Many people are very wary of this program, because it can be found not only in Rosgosstrakh, but also in other insurance companies.  Such cautiousness is quite justified, since when buying a certificate part of the damage is not compensated. </p>

    <p>  If we are talking about a franchise, then in this case a small discount is provided.  In this case, it is exactly 50% of the amount of insurance itself.  In addition, it is worth considering that franchised products include those programs in which there is a expectation that the company will deduct a certain part of the money in its favor in the event of an insured event. </p><p>  Based on this, it can be concluded that the second part of the payment is usually paid by the insurance holder himself.  Accordingly, by and large, he will pay all 100%.  The whole point of franchised products is that customers learn to report the occurrence of unpleasant situations with a vehicle only if there is a serious accident and the insurance policy holder can count on large payments. </p><p>  Accordingly, when applying for a ‚Äú50 to 50‚Äù hull from Rosgosstrakh, the applicant reports an accident only when the final cost of repairing the telephone exchange exceeds that ‚Äúhalf‚Äù that was agreed in the contract.  Again, on the basis of this, it is much more profitable to repair minor scratches yourself and contact the insurance company only in case of serious damage. </p><h2>  Features and design conditions </h2><p>  In order to receive the coveted discount certificate, the client of the insurance company must provide only the internal passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation, TCP and driver's license.  Based on these documents and data, the company manager makes the necessary calculations.  At the same time, he draws attention to the experience of the driver, the number of previous emergencies, what kind of machine he is driving, and even his state of health.  After that, the client pays half the <span>cost of the insurance</span> policy.  He will have to pay the second part only in case of a certain insurance event. </p>

    <h2>  What's the catch </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, by and large, the main trick is that in the event of an accident, a person in any case will have to pay the second part of the insurance.  Accordingly, this is only an illusion that only 50% is paid. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the rather stringent requirements that Rosgosstrakh makes in relation to customers who wish to receive a discount certificate. </p><p>  First of all, people who are at least 30 years old and with a driving experience of at least 10 years can apply for such insurance.  Based on this, young and inexperienced drivers cannot count on this program. </p><p>  Also in the contract you can find lines that are devoted to restrictions on the storage of vehicles at night.  If the insured event is recorded in the dark, then in this situation there is a big risk that the client will be denied payment. </p><h2>  Is it worth it to draw up </h2><p>  The 50-50 insurance policy from Rosgosstrakh will really be very beneficial for those who feel free to drive a car, that is, experienced drivers.  If a person has not had insurance claims for years, then this program will be more than beneficial for him.  In the event of a serious emergency, he can simply pay the remaining 50% and get his insurance. </p>

    <p>  Suppose that the owner of a telephone exchange issued a policy for a year worth 20 thousand rubles and at the same time for all 365 days he did not damage the car.  In that case, he spent the money only on maintenance.  If he draws up a policy at half price, then the benefit will be exactly 50%, as promised by the insurance company.  That is, the driver pays half as much for the year of insurance service, and at the same time remains confident that in the event of an accident he will receive a standard payment.  To do this, it will be enough to make only the second part of the cost of the policy. </p><p>  From this point of view, there is no catch, so everything depends only on the skills and confidence of the person himself. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  To issue or not to issue such a certificate is the business of each person.  Before making a decision, you should carefully weigh the pros and cons.  However, in any case, Rosgosstrakh is one of those companies that annually receive the maximum positive marks of most drivers.  In this case, you should not wait for the catch.  This company is interested in attracting new customers, which is why it offers this profitable program to car owners.  The franchise also extends to other well-known UK companies, therefore, before issuing securities, it is worthwhile to clarify the availability of such preferential offer. </p>
