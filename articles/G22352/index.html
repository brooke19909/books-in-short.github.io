It saves time, reduces the complexity of homework.  Sometimes the quality of washing in a machine is much better than with your hands.  The presence of additional functions allows you to use a balcony or bathroom, not only for drying clothes.  Sometimes after washing the clothes do not need to be ironed - if you have and start the program ‚Äústeam treatment‚Äù or ‚Äúeasy ironing‚Äù. </p><p>  Consumers choose the right unit among a huge number of devices for washing clothes.  Automatic machines can be classified according to a number of signs, one of them is the type of load.  There is the following division according to the methods of laying clothes - with the frontal and vertical way. </p><h2>  Reasons for choosing narrow top-loading washing machines </h2><p>  Before buying, consumers must determine the place to install this electrical appliance.  Keep in mind that when loading clothes, you must fully open access to the drum.  The usual depth for machines with horizontal laying of things is 45 cm. But opening the hatch adds another 40 cm. For many modern appliances, they have a larger diameter, so additional space is required for the full opening and distribution of clothes inside. </p><p>  Small-sized washing machines with vertical loading are chosen by those who do not have space on the sides of the washing unit.  Usually these are small bathrooms.  The opening of such devices takes place in the upward direction.  Therefore, the lid should always be free, do not put powder on it, put towels or other little things. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="thebrick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Standard view of a vertical loading model" class="if uuid-3023811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3023811.jpg"></div><h2>  Accommodation in apartments, houses </h2><p>  It is extremely rare to install top-loading washing machines in the kitchen.  Usually they place electrical appliances with a horizontal way of laying clothes.  In the latter case, the upper part is built into cabinets or covered with a worktop, can be used as an additional working area. </p><p>  Traditionally, appliances with loading laundry through the upper part are placed in bathrooms without cabinets and shelves above the covers.  They should open freely to gain full access to the drum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="toploadwasherastal.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washer Virpul" class="if uuid-3023807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3023807.jpg"></div><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  They produce and buy devices with vertical loading less than with horizontal ones.  The introduction of additional functions occurs later in comparison with machines that have a frontal way of laying things. </p><p>  The maximum load weight is traditionally 6-7 kg of laundry.  In a narrow machine, it is impossible to install a drum for laying 10-12 kg due to the small size. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The highest spin speed can be 1000-1200 revolutions in one minute.  In such periods, you need to be prepared for noise or vibration.  This is typical for any washing machine. </p><p>  The noise level during the washing process can reach 51-57 dB, depending on the brand.  During the spin cycle, this type of electrical appliance is capable of emitting sounds from 74 dB to 79 dB. </p><p>  All models of washing machines with vertical loading are produced in a freestanding design.  They can hardly be embedded in connection with the features of the opening. </p><p>  Modern cars have an energy class of A or higher.  Drying group - V. </p><p>  Many models have built-in leakage protection.  Almost everything is a child lock.  There is also a delayed start timer.  Some models have up to 24 hours.  There is an indication of error codes. </p><p>  Most models have an electronic scoreboard.  It reflects the amount of time until the end of the wash cycle, the phase of the work process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.washingday.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotpoint washing machine WMTF722H" class="if uuid-3023819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3023819.jpg"></div><h2>  Dimensions of top-loading washing machines </h2><p>  With a maximum load of 6-7 kg, the dimensions of the devices are almost the same.  The width is 40 cm, the depth is 60 or 61 cm. The height of the washing machine is usually 90 cm. Weight is 60 kg.  For example, Candy CVFTGP384TMH-07 has a depth of 60 cm, a width of 40 cm, and a height of 88 cm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Before buying, you should carefully study the dimensions of the washing machine with a vertical load, especially in confined spaces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ladyandtheblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open top loading machine" class="if uuid-3023816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3023816.jpg"></div><h2>  Main programs </h2><p>  Each model has a number of built-in washing cycles with preset temperature conditions, spin and rinse times.  Most models are equipped with pre-wash programs for heavily soiled items. </p><p>  Many narrow top-loading washing machines have an extra rinse.  In addition to the mandatory, programmed, at the end of the washing process, you can choose an additional one - to wash the remnants of synthetic detergents.  The function is required when laying baby clothes or things of family members with allergic reactions. </p><p>  Rarely are time-saving modes.  You need to carefully read all the programs.  The usual cycle can be 2 hours.  In some models you can find a ‚Äúquick wash‚Äù.  For example, Candy can offer fast for 14, 30 or 44 minutes. </p><p>  Some representatives of the Electrolux range can offer several special programs: Sportswear and Shoes, Jeans, Bed Linen and Steam Refreshment. </p><p>  The list of programs Indesit BTW D51052 (RF) - washing machine with vertical loading with dimensions of 40X60X90 centimeters: </p><ul><li>  Synthetics 40 ¬∞. </li><li>  Wool 20 ¬∞. </li><li>  Cotton 30 ¬∞. </li><li>  Cotton 40 ¬∞. </li><li>  Cotton 60 ¬∞. </li><li>  Cotton 90 ¬∞. </li><li>  Eco cotton 40 ¬∞. </li><li>  Eco cotton 60 ¬∞. </li><li>  Synthetics 30 ¬∞. </li><li>  Color 40 ¬∞. </li><li>  Delicate 30 ¬∞. </li><li>  Rinsing. </li><li>  Spin + drain. </li></ul><p>  Each model has its own set of wash cycles.  But sometimes it becomes necessary to set the temperature, spin speed, time saving mode.  Sometimes it is necessary to shorten the duration of the wash.  Therefore, it is important to be able to adjust an already selected program.  Before buying, you should consult your point of sale.  And also read reviews about the presence of the function of manual regulation of programs. </p><h2>  Trade marks </h2><p>  Only some manufacturers of washing machines produce top-loading appliances.
