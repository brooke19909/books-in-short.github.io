How to weave bracelets and voluminous figures from rubber bands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Weaving from gum has recently gained more and more popularity.  And this is not surprising, because thanks to this relatively new kind of art, you can make beautiful and original jewelry yourself, moreover, it will take a little time, but it will help to reveal your creative potential. </p><p>  According to legend, this type of creativity appeared by chance.  Its creator is a resident of China.  Once men found their daughters weaving jewelry from accounting gum.  This lesson caught the attention of the Chinese.  An idea was born in his head, which today is insanely popular among children and adolescents around the world. </p><h2>  The art of rubber weaving </h2><p>  Not only children and adolescents are fond of weaving, but adults are also not averse to passing the time for this fun activity.  In connection with the growing popularity, more and more new patterns of weaving from rubber bands began to appear. </p><p>  Thanks to them, it is possible to make bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings and a wide variety of figures that can later be used as key rings, or small toys. </p><h2>  How to weave from elastic bands </h2><p>  Many people wonder how to weave from rubber bands correctly?  Well, if you have experience crocheting, then the essence of weaving with elastic bands you will catch very quickly.  It is not much different.  After all, such a tool as a hook is also involved here. </p><p>  Weaving from rubber bands is a very fascinating activity, especially when everything conceived is obtained.  Use patterns to make jewelry and figurines easily and quickly. </p><h2>  Weaving kits </h2><p>  So, before you begin to learn all the basics of this creativity, you should purchase the necessary materials and tools.  Ready-made kits, you can find on the shelves of stores that offer goods for needlework. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The standard set consists of several sets of rubber bands of different colors, a slingshot, a machine tool and a hook.  Sometimes in a set you can also find all kinds of accessories for figures (eyes, ponytails, other elements). </p><h2>  Weaving technique '' French braid '' </h2><p>  As already stated, there are different patterns of weaving from gum.  One of the most suitable techniques for those who are just starting to learn the basics of weaving is considered to be a French braid. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail weaving from gum "French braid".  The scheme proposed below involves weaving on a slingshot.  This is much easier than working on the machine. </p><p>  You will need elastic bands in two colors.  You can take erasers from several colors.  For example, take white and blue. </p><h2>  Making a slingshot bracelet together </h2><p>  So, to understand how to weave from rubber bands, follow these recommendations. </p><ol><li>  On a slingshot (if it is not, you can use two pencils or fingers) put on a white rubber band, twisting it with an eight. </li><li>  Next, put the blue and white elastic bands on two columns, without twisting. </li><li>  Using a hook or fingers (this is not very convenient), throw off the first white rubber band in the middle. </li><li>  Pull another blue elastic band, on the left side, discard the lower blue elastic band, and on the right - white (it should be in the center) </li><li>  Add one more white elastic band and discard the lower blue loop on the right side, and the middle blue loop on the left. </li><li>  On the next blue rubber band, discard the white loops on both sides. </li><li>  Continue weaving this way until you get the bracelet you want. </li><li>  At the end you will have one elastic band on two columns.  Pass one loop into another and remove the bracelet from the slingshot.  Attach a clasp. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gum weaving patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1644692.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><p>  As you can see, there is nothing difficult in mastering these weaving patterns from rubber bands.  Practice making several bracelets this way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And you can also make different figures from rubber bands on a slingshot.  It can be funny animals, plants, geometric shapes (for example, hearts). </p><h2>  How to weave a doll on a loom </h2><p>  Now try to make a chrysalis.  This figure involves the use of a machine. </p><ol><li>  Pull one elastic band for every two columns in a row, combining them. </li><li>  On the last column, wrap the elastic three times.  Remove the bottom hinges and discard them in the middle. </li><li>  This will be hair, the length of which you adjust yourself.  Weave four such braids using the standard braiding method. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave from rubber bands" class="if" height="189" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1644689.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Proceed to the arms and sleeves of the sweater.  Two elastic bands (of the color that the clothes will be) pull on the first columns. </li><li>  Next, take flesh-colored elastic bands and put them on the columns, connecting them, as is the case with hair.  On the last column, wrap the elastic three times.  Continue weaving according to the pattern. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rubber braid french braid pattern" class="if" height="189" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1644684.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  You can start the skirt.  Two elastic bands of different colors pull on the columns according to the pattern: 1-2 2-3.  Weave further according to the pattern. </li><li>  Now you can begin to connect all the details.  Wrap silicone rubber bands connecting all three rows of the machine. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="figures of rubber bands on a slingshot" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1644690.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  In order to make eyes, take the gum of your choice and wind four times on the second columns of the extreme rows.  Connect the side columns to the eyes with the center column.  Remove the hinges so that they are in the middle. </li><li>  To get a neck, put on a pair of elastic bands on the central row. </li><li>  Connect the distant center column to the column on the right side, then on the left.  Thus, connect the workpieces of the hands with the sides of the body. </li><li>  For a skirt, pull two elastic bands in each row, doing three steps. </li><li>  Take three steps down with flesh-colored rubber bands.  On the last two columns, wind elastic bands of a different color three times to make boots.  Make the second leg with the boot in the same way. </li><li>  Now start weaving in the standard way, as already described.  Throw the loop first from the left row, then the right and, finally, the center. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rubber doll" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1644691.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  Here is a doll made of rubber bands.  If you wish, you can weave her various jewelry and accessories.  The doll can be used as a keychain or badge, attached to a bag. </p><p>  Weaving patterns from rubber bands are very different, but it is advisable to start with simple ones, so as not to be disappointed.  And gradually move on to more complex shapes and weaving on the machine. </p><p>  It is recommended to practice weaving techniques on bracelets.  So, you will immediately see the differences and catch the meaning.  Plus you will get a nice accessory. </p><p>  Try to weave both on a slingshot and on a loom.  Most figures can be made on two devices, but the machine allows you to make objects larger. </p><p>  Many people prefer to work on a slingshot, since it is faster, and besides, it can easily be replaced, for example, with Chinese chopsticks. </p>
