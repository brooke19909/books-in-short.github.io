  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ruself stabilizers: operation reviews and an overview of the best models</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The stabilizers "Rouself" is a fairly high-quality equipment, as evidenced by numerous positive reviews.  This device perfectly helps in cases where the owners of the house urgently need a device that will equalize the input voltage.  It is worth adding that it is appropriate to speak here about its alignment, and not about an increase, for example, since with an input indicator too high, the stabilizer will reduce it. </p><h2>  The main selection parameter </h2><p>  There are several parameters by which the Rouself stabilizer is selected, however there is one main - this is the type of network. </p><p>  In order to go to the store to purchase such a device, you must first measure the voltage in the network using a multimeter.  If the readings are significantly reduced - from 90 to 140 V, for example, in such cases it is recommended to purchase a stabilizer that is able to equalize the voltage, starting from 90 V. If, on the contrary, a strong voltage jump occurs quite often in the network, a single-phase stabilizer is preferred .  Such devices have a fairly high input indicator - up to 270 V. </p><div class="photo" data-original="0ground.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="auto stabilizer" class="if uuid-2897987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2897987.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional selection options </h2><p>  There are several other requirements that must be observed when buying a device such as the voltage regulator "Rouself". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, this is the total power.  The device must have a greater power indicator than all consumers in its network that are turned on at the same time.  Knowing this numerical value, you can easily purchase the right unit at an affordable cost. </p><p>  Secondly, like most other equipment, stabilizers have a coefficient of performance, it is also an efficiency.  In this case, the higher the efficiency, the less electricity the device itself will consume during operation at the maximum possible load.  The cost of such a stabilizer "Rouself" will be slightly higher, but in the future it will pay for itself. </p><p>  Thirdly, it is important to pay attention to such an item as the life of the device, subject to all the rules for its use.  It should be long enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="matsuyamapjs.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rusself stabilizer" class="if uuid-2897986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2897986.jpg"></div><p>  The last item on the list, but not in importance, is the accuracy of stabilization of the device.  Experts do not advise purchasing an aggregate whose operating error is more than 8%.  Most budget options have an error just in the range of 5 to 8%.  However, if there is any refrigeration, pumping, or other exact and expensive equipment in the home network, it is better to spend a little more money, but purchase a Ruself voltage regulator, the error of which is no more than 5%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  General description of models </h2><p>  There are several common features for all models of this manufacturer.  All of them have a built-in digital display, which is located on the front panel.  It is designed to be able to check the performance of the device at the moment and at any time.  In addition, there is an indicator available to help determine both the input and output voltage values. </p><p>  It should be noted that to purchase a voltage stabilizer "Rouself 1200" or any other model is necessary only high-quality and original assembly.  This is very important, since only in this case is it possible to guarantee that the ventilation openings on the case will cope with maintaining the optimal temperature regime of the device for a long period of its operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oceantechnic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Surge Protectors" class="if uuid-2897988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2897988.jpg"></div><h2>  Bypass Mode and Benefits </h2><p>  Bypass mode is an optional feature that is also available on almost all models.  It is intended so that the device can redirect the input signal bypassing the functional equipment at the time when a network malfunction occurs.  In other words, this is an auto power off function that protects the device from damage. </p><p>  As for the advantages of Ruself units, it is worth paying attention to the following properties: </p><ul><li>  the shape of the output voltage will completely repeat the shape of the input signal; </li><li>  high coefficient of performance; </li><li>  a sufficiently high level of protection against too high or, conversely, too low input voltage indicators; </li><li>  the range of regulation is wide enough; </li><li>  there is the ability to configure voltage parameters; </li><li>  The price-performance ratio of these devices is very acceptable. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.cccme.org.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stabilizer with display" class="if uuid-2897995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2897995.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about the products "Ruself" </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, reviews about the stabilizers "Rouself" are quite good and there are many, which indicates the high quality of the goods.  All those who purchased this product noted its various advantages.  If we talk about them in general, then we can make a small list of the advantages of these stabilizers according to owners' reviews. </p><ol><li>  It was noted that the equipment was assembled from quality parts, has a good design and at the same time low cost. </li><li>  Buyers responded very flattering that the manufacturer had actually proven the statement that the stabilizer can protect the electrical equipment connected to the network around the clock. </li><li>  The rear panel has two sockets, as well as a button - fuse against overload.  All this works quite adequately. </li><li>  Reviews about the voltage regulators "Rouself" and indicate that many people spoke quite well about its technical characteristics.  A fast response rate to a change in the input signal, low error was noted.  The steel case and the ergonomics of the device, as well as its convenient LED display, were appreciated. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.robot-italy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stabilizer components" class="if uuid-2897997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2897997.jpg"></div><h2>  Rouself 12000 </h2><p>  Quite good in all respects, the voltage stabilizer ‚ÄúRouself 12000‚Äù turned out.  The full name of this device looks like this - RUSELF SRWII-12000-L.  As for the characteristics of this device, they can be briefly described in this way: </p><ul><li>  like other devices, this one is a relay voltage stabilizer; </li><li>  the power of this device is 12,000 V * A or 10 kW, hence the name; </li><li>  the range of working input voltage is wide enough, 140 - 260 V; </li><li>  the output voltage varies from 212 to 228 V; </li><li>  very high stabilization accuracy - 3.5%. </li></ul><p>  The cost of the stabilizer "Rouself 12000" is in the range from 16,000 to 24,300 rubles. </p><p>  Among the advantages of this unit, the fact that during operation it is almost inaudible, especially when compared with other brands, stands out strongly.  In addition, a pleasant appearance and a convenient display are noted.  No serious shortcomings of this product were noticed by buyers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="generatorexperts.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple stabilizer circuit" class="if uuid-2898000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50398/2898000.jpg"></div><h2>  Other models of the company "Rouself" </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at the Ruself 10000 equipment.  Products also belong to relay voltage regulators.  It has a capacity of 10,000 V * A or 7 kW.  The input voltage range is even wider than that of Rouself 12,000 and ranges from 130 to 270 V. The output indicators are 207 - 232 V. However, this device is 2.5% inferior to the previous one in terms of stabilization accuracy, that is, the error is 6 %  At the same time, the cost of this model is much lower and ranges from 12,000 to 15,000 rubles. </p><p>  There are cheaper models with good indicators of input voltage, the same error, but at the same time their power is much lower.  This is the Ruself 1500 model.  The cost of this device is only 3000 - 4000 rubles. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If to summarize all of the above, then we can safely say that the stabilizers of this company are very common, and reviews speak of their high quality.  In addition, their cost is quite acceptable, and a wide range will allow you to choose the right model for your own needs. </p>
