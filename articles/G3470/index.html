How to recognize a fake bill "5000 rubles"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The bill "5000 rubles" is perhaps one of the largest bank tickets in modern Russia.  It is not so rare, but the trouble is that not every Russian is able to boast at least a minimum knowledge of the authenticity of banknotes of this denomination.  Such negligence sometimes leads to very sad consequences. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The bill "5000 rubles" was first developed in the history of Russia by the Provisional Government in 1917 and put into circulation in 1918 by the Government of the RSFSR.  She looked like the notorious "Kerenki" and had a two-headed eagle on the back.  At the time of its inception, this banknote was the most ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù banknote of the country and was issued as the general depreciation of money.  But in 1996 (as in 1920) this ‚Äúmoney‚Äù was already one of the smallest, which was the result of rapidly growing inflation. </p><h2>  How a banknote became a coin </h2><p>  The bill "5000 rubles", the photo of which is presented below, was put into circulation on 10/31/95 and did not last long enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bill 5000 rubles" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/710388.jpg" width="600"></div>  The <span>green</span> banknote on the obverse had an image of the Millennium of Russia monument, located on the background of one of the most ancient churches of Russia - St. Sophia Cathedral.  On the reverse side is a fragment of the Fortress Wall of the Novgorod Kremlin.  The size of the ‚Äú5000 rubles‚Äù banknote of the 95th year of issue is 137 x 61 millimeters, the serial number is put on the right and left on the white fields, the <span>watermark</span> is the image of the cathedral and the number 5000. The denomination on the back of this banknote is written three times, and on both sides there is an inscription words - "Five thousand rubles."

But this banknote did not last long - a little later, in 2001, it was replaced by a coin of the same denomination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="counterfeit notes 5,000 rubles" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/710387.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  At first it was like that </h2><p>  In modern Russia of the 21st century, the first ‚Äú5,000 rubles‚Äù bill was put into circulation at the end of July 2006 and became the largest of the ‚Äúurban‚Äù series (on the back of the bill are the views and memorials of several Russian cities).  Initially, its circulation was planned as insignificant, it was assumed that it would have the greatest circulation in regions with an increased level of wages among the population.  However, it quickly spread throughout Russia, which entailed the need for additional types of protection.  So after 5 years, the bank ticket was reissued again. </p><h2>  Images - where are they from </h2><p>  Few people know that the monument depicted in the "five thousand" has a difficult fate.  In the competition for the development of a sketch, three rather famous sculptors took part in it - M.M.  Antokolsky, M.O.  Mikeshin and A.M. Opekushin, who defeated the remaining applicants.  At the end of 1890, a finished statue was delivered from St. Petersburg to Khabarovsk, after only 35 years the monument was demolished and sent to the museum, where it lay for many years, and in wartime it was sent for re-melting.  Only at the end of the 80s, at the expense of caring people, the monument was restored, and in 1992 its grand opening was held. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The bill "5000 rubles" has a very beautiful back - it shows a bridge over the Amur River - a monumental two-tier structure with a separate road and railroad tracks.  The construction of this masterpiece began on July 30, 1913, and it was planned to finish it in just 26 months, which is simply unbelievable for such a huge.  In Warsaw, special <span>metal farms were made,</span> which were then transported through Odessa to Vladivostok (by sea), and there they were loaded onto special platforms and delivered by rail to Khabarovsk.  The bridge was almost assembled, 18 huge farms took their places, but the First World War violated the grandiose plan.  The German cruiser Emden in the autumn of 1914 sank a ship with the last two bridge farms in the Indian Ocean.  So the last two designs had to be re-ordered in Canada and shipped to Russia.  Already on October 5, 1916 this magnificent building was ready - the bridge was open for traffic.  Interestingly, at the time of opening, the <span>bridge across the Amur</span> was the largest railway construction in the Old World, and more than 13.5 million rubles were spent on its construction. </p><h2>  Size and Description </h2>

The banknote is devoted thematically to Khabarovsk - on the front side you can see the embankment, and in the foreground there is a monument to Muravyov-Amursky (governor general), the city emblem is placed on the right.  On the back is a panorama of the road-railway bridge across the Amur.

In addition, the proper protection of bank notes should provide an opportunity to distinguish between falsification of all categories of the country's population, including visually impaired citizens.  So "5000 rubles" is a bill, the signs of the originality of which can be determined not only visually, but also by touch: </p><ul><li>  the coat of arms of the city is applied with OVI paint with a variable optical effect - when the viewing angle is changed, the color becomes green or crimson; </li><li>  there is a field with hidden stripes MVC - if you look perpendicularly from a distance of 30-40 cm, this part of the banknote is perceived as plain, and when tilted, stripes are visible; </li><li>  the height of the digits of the serial number located on the right gradually increases; </li><li>  there are watermarks visible in the light: on the right is the head of the monument, and on the left is the number 5,000; </li><li>  the emblem of the Bank of Russia applied to the banknote has a polarizing effect; </li><li>  there is a digital value made by perforation; </li><li>  a certain element located to the right of the inscription ‚ÄúBank of Russia Ticket‚Äù is made by a print on an unpainted field <span>(embossed without embossing)</span> ; </li><li>  Microtext is applied - with a very close look, you can see continuously repeating signs "5000" and "CBRF 5000"; </li><li>  <span>a metallized thread of a</span> diving type, having a width of 3 mm, five times comes to the surface from the back of the bill; </li></ul>

    <h2>  "5000 rubles."  1997: bill modified </h2><p>  As you know, how much money exists, so much are those who want to fake it.  The same thing happened with the new ‚Äúfive thousand‚Äù - in just 9 months of 2011, a huge number of fakes totaling more than 100 million rubles were withdrawn from circulation.  A considerable share among them was occupied by five thousandth banknotes.  Therefore, it was decided to improve the protection of banknotes of such a high denomination according to the model adopted in 2010. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the cost of the new ‚Äúfive thousandths‚Äù was 24% higher than the previous ones, this step turned out to be quite justified - the number of fakes decreased several times. </p><h2>  What is the difference </h2><p>  The new ‚Äú5000 rubles‚Äù bill did not differ much in appearance, it even left the year of development of the previous sample on it.  The most noticeable difference was the inscription ‚ÄúModification of 2010‚Äù, which was applied in the lower part of the left field on the front side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bill 5000 rubles photo" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/710390.jpg" width="477"></div>  The differences are as follows:

But in order not to get into an unpleasant situation, you need to know some of them. </p>

What you need to do if you suddenly find yourself fake bank tickets: </p><ul><li>  if you are not able to independently determine the authenticity of the bill, you can take it for verification to the nearest branch of any bank, but be prepared for the fact that employees of the financial institution can call the police to conduct the proceedings; </li><li>  when you are sure that the banknote is false, you can take it to the nearest police station; </li><li>  if you find a fake before paying for purchases in the store, it is best to destroy it (burn, tear into small parts); </li></ul><p>  Since fake "5000 rubles" notes have recently become frequent, and losing such an amount is very unfortunate, many may want to get rid of it by buying goods, "slip them to their neighbors."  Doing this is highly discouraged.  Remember, if you knew that a banknote was fake and tried to pay it off, you become an accomplice in a crime and can be punished in accordance with the law. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2>

There are two opinions on this matter: if you take into account that 1 m <sup>2 of</sup> paper used to print money weighs about 96 grams, then, accordingly, a bank ticket measuring 157 x 69 mm will weigh about 1.08 grams.  According to another version, it is believed that since officially registered data on the weight of banknotes of the Russian Federation does not exist in nature, you can use some kind of averaged table, from which it follows that 5,000 p.  weighs 1.02 grams.  Of course, this applies only to new, freshly printed banknotes.  Thus, having made simple calculations, we can find out that, for example, a million rubles in five thousandth bills will weigh from 204 to 216 grams.  Not bad, right?
