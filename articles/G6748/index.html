    <h2>  short biography </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Kozyrev Nikolay</span> was born in a family of nobles.  In 1928, he graduated from Leningrad University and was admitted to the Main Astronomical Observatory of the USSR as a graduate student.  Subsequently, he was enrolled in it as a specialist of the 1st category. </p><p>  In parallel with his labor activity, <span data-mce-mark="1">Nikolai Kozyrev</span> gave lectures at the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute. </p><p>  In March 1936, he was dismissed from the observatory because of a conflict with the director, and in November of the same year he was arrested in the Pulkovo case.  In May 1937, <span data-mce-mark="1">Nikolai Kozyrev</span> was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Mother and sisters were sent into exile.  They were asked to abandon their relationship with Kozyrev, but they did not agree to this.  So did his wife. </p><p>  Until May 1939, Nikolai Kozyrev was in prison in Dmitrovsk-Orlovsky.  Subsequently, he was transferred to Dudinka (Norilsk).  In 1941, he was repeatedly sentenced to 10 years allegedly for hostile propaganda among prisoners. </p><p>  After the trial, he was transferred to Norilsk and appointed as a heat control engineer at a metallurgical plant.  In 1943, he was appointed a geophysicist engineer at the geological department of the Norilsk Combine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1946, the petition of fellow astronomers on the conditional release of Kozyrev was satisfied.  In 1958 he was completely rehabilitated. </p><p>  In 1947, Nikolai Kozyrev defended his thesis on the theory of the structure of stars.  Until 1958, he worked at the Crimean Observatory, and subsequently at Pulkovo.  In 1958, a small book by Nikolai Kozyrev was published, which actually became a continuation of the dissertation.  In this work, he outlined his concept of time. </p><p>  In the late 70s, his work was recognized as scientifically unacceptable.  As a result of a conflict with the leadership of <span data-mce-mark="1">astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev</span> , he was dismissed from the observatory.  A few months later, however, he was allowed to become a non-staff consultant. </p><p>  In 1983, February 27, the scientist died.  Kozyrev was buried in the cemetery of the observatory. </p><p>  In some sources you can find information that the scientist was sent to exile in <span data-mce-mark="1">Lukashkin Yar.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Nikolai Kozyrev</span> has never been there, this information is not true. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolai Kozyrev time mirrors" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2038035.jpg" width="364"></div>

    <h2>  Vulcanization on the moon </h2><p>  In 1958, <span data-mce-mark="1">academician Nikolai Kozyrev</span> managed to obtain a spectrogram of a volcanic eruption on the moon.  However, at that time his observations were not accepted by the scientific community.  Only 10 years later, Kozyrev was issued a diploma on the discovery of volcanism.  In 1970, he was awarded the nominal gold medal of the International Astronomical Academy. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Studying lunar volcanism, the scientist spoke <span data-mce-mark="1">about the stopping of time.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Academician Alexander Nikolaevich Kozyrev</span> connected processes on the Moon with the flow of time. </p><h2>  Experiences </h2><p>  The problem of time Nikolai Kozyrev dealt with for more than 25 years.  Of course, there were many people who did not believe in his theory.  To such skeptics, the scientist showed simple experiments. </p><p>  Nikolai Kozyrev used ordinary lever scales in experiments.  On one side of the beam, a gyroscope was fixed, which rotated clockwise.  At the other end was a cup with weights.  After stopping the arrow at 0, Kozyrev turned on the electric vibrator mounted at the base.  The massive rotor of the top absorbed the vibration. </p><p>  The arrow remained in place.  Then the scientist unwound the gyroscope in the other (opposite) direction and hung it again.  The arrow moved to the right, i.e. the weight of the gyroscope decreased. </p><p>  Kozyrev explained this phenomenon as follows.  The gyroscope on a scale with an electric vibrator is a system with a causal relationship.  The reverse rotation contradicts the natural course of time.  The additional forces that have arisen arose due to the pressure that the time had.  These forces can be measured.  Therefore, they really exist. </p><p>  Accordingly, time is not just the duration from one phenomenon to another, measured in hours.  It is a physical factor.  Time has properties that allow it to take an active part in natural processes and provide a causal relationship between phenomena. </p><p>  Nikolai Kozyrev in the course of his experiments was able to establish that the course of time can be determined by the linear speed of rotation of the cause with respect to the effect.  It is equal to 700 km / sec.  with a "+" in the left coordinate system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolai Kozyrev Astrophysicist" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2038036.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Space confirmations </h2><p>  Kozyrev correlated his experiments with the processes that took place in the Universe.  Very violent and powerful thermal processes occur both in the bowels and on the surface of stars.  Based on this, Kozyrev concluded that stars should allocate a huge amount of time, to act as its generator. </p><p>  If so, then time should be regarded as a physical factor.  It must obey the key laws of physics, namely, the <span>laws of reflection</span> and absorption. </p><p>  To confirm his guesses, the scientist conducted an experiment.  He directed a telescope with the substance placed in focus onto a bright star, covering the lens with thin gesture or black paper to prevent the influence of light rays.  Kozyrev noticed that the electrical conductivity of the substance in focus changed.  After that, he changed thin tin to thick, then to a very thick lid.  As a result, the deflection rate of the galvanometer needle decreased.  This is understandable.  If we consider time as a physical factor, then it can be screened. </p><h2>  Crucial experiment </h2><p>  Of course, every time there were people who were skeptical of Kozyrev‚Äôs statements.  To eliminate the contradictions, the scientist conducted a crucial experiment. </p><p>  In the process of preparation, he was guided by certain considerations.  As you know, usually people see a star not where it really is at the moment, but where it was when the radiation was emitted.  Light is considered the fastest flow.  However, it also has a finite propagation speed.  A slightly different situation with gravity and time.  They do not spread throughout the Universe gradually, but arise at different points at the same time. </p><p>  In other words, the properties of time allow you to receive information from any part of the space instantly.  You can also quickly transfer data to anywhere.  Only in this case there will be no contradiction with the special rule of relativity.  If we calculate the place where the star really is and point the telescope at this ‚Äúempty‚Äù part, then in case the gyroscope changes its weight, the assumption will be confirmed. </p><p>  The scientist did just that.  That was the position of Procyon.  Meanwhile, skeptics were not convinced by this either.  They agreed that it was impossible to explain such experiments using the known laws of mechanics.  However, skeptics said, this does not mean at all that this is how time manifests itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kozyrev Nikolay Lukashkin Yar" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2038037.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The second law of thermodynamics </h2><p>  In 1953, Kozyrev formulated a very paradoxical conclusion that there is no flow of energy from outside in the stars.  For this, the scientist had reasonable reasons. </p><p>  In 1850, R. Clasius (German physicist) formulated the postulate.  Subsequently, he received the name of the second law of thermodynamics.  Its essence is that heat itself cannot pass from a cold body to a warmer one.  This statement can be called quite obvious.  For example, everyone knows that the included iron is heating up.  But no one saw the appliance become warm by itself, taking heat away from the surrounding space. </p><p>  However, many prominent scientists opposed Clazius‚Äôs statement.  Even Tsiolkovsky called this postulate unscientific, since the inevitable thermal death of the entire Universe flowed from it.  If all objects cool spontaneously, then eventually all the stars go out.  Therefore, the end of the world, as they say, will come. </p><p>  Many scientists have tried to solve the mystery of heat distribution.  For example, Helmholtz and Kelvin formulated the following conclusion.  Stars, in their opinion, are huge accumulations of gas.  Under the influence of gravity, they contract, their temperature rises to millions of degrees.  Due to this, they heat the universe.  However, as the calculation showed, with such a model, the Sun would have consumed all the energy long before the appearance of the first signs of life on Earth. </p><p>  Subsequently, other points of view were put forward.  In particular, scientists first considered stars to be nuclear, and then thermonuclear reactors.  However, calculations and experiments have shown that the temperature inside the Sun is lower than necessary to maintain the reactions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolai Trump Time" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2038038.jpg" width="342"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, the missing energy enters the stars from the space in which they are located.  But in itself it cannot act as a source of energy, since it is too passive for this.  At the same time, space and time are inseparable phenomena. </p><p>  The principle of conservation of energy was formulated as a result of various experiments with different moving objects.  By the mid-19th century, the law was extended not only to exclusively mechanical, but also to other processes, including thermal.  It is no coincidence that this law was called the first.  As for the second postulate, it turns out that energy (heat) all the time flows somewhere.  Where does she go, what does she go to?  There are no answers to these questions today.  Meanwhile, this does not mean that the principle of energy conservation is violated in the Universe.  Accordingly, if a person does not know where the stream of time comes from and where it goes, then this does not indicate a violation of natural laws.  This opinion was shared by Kozyrev.  I must say that this point of view is shared by some scientists today. </p><h2>  Double stars </h2><p>  Such formations may include stars of various classes.  When paired, they acquire similar properties: spectral type, brightness, etc. It seems that the main star influences the satellite and gradually transmits to it something that changes the appearance of the latter. </p><p>  The distances between the stars are huge in order to exclude the influence of force fields.  Under such conditions, firstly, gravity will act, and secondly, time.  Gravitational forces hold bodies in one system.  Time, in turn, may facilitate the exchange of energy between them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kozyrev Nikolay Alexandrovich" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2038039.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Kozyrev decided to test his assumptions on a pair of Earth and the Moon.  So he derived the hypothesis of lunar volcanism, which he subsequently confirmed in practice. </p><h2>  Nikolai Kozyrev and the "mirror of time" </h2><p>  The effects that were obtained during the screening of space with the help of mirrors have not been explained so far.  Perhaps the exception to the theory of time, which was formulated by <span data-mce-mark="1">Nikolai Kozyrev.</span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">How to make time mirrors yourself</span> ?  These objects are aluminum (less often mirrored, glass or made of other metals) planes of a spiral shape.  According to the scientist, they are able to reflect physical time.  Like lenses, these planes can focus radiation of various types, including those emanating from a biological object. </p><p>  Kozyrev proposed the following mirror design.  Clockwise, a mirrored flexible sheet of polished aluminum folds 1.5 turns.  Inside was the test chair and measuring instruments. </p><p>  Such mirrors were actively used in the early 90s.  when conducting experiments on supersensory perception under the direction of Kaznacheev in the Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences.  In 1993-94  experiments were performed in Cosmopoisk. </p><h2>  The results of the experiments </h2><p>  People who were placed in cylindrical spirals were influenced by various abnormal psychophysical phenomena.  Some felt that they were leaving the body.  In other cases, manifestations of telepathy, telekinesis, and transmission of thoughts from a distance were recorded. </p><p>  The task of the experiments was, among other things, in the study and development of human clairvoyance abilities.  Such abilities were exacerbated inside chambers of metal mirrors 2-3 meters in size. </p><p>  In accordance with Kozyrev‚Äôs theory, the density of time changes indoors with mirrors.  Probably this is precisely what influenced the increase in supersensory perception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolay Kozyrev time mirrors how to make yourself" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2038040.jpg" width="238"></div>

    <p>  Subjects who spent several hours inside the cell began to feel like participants in past historical events.  Familiar paintings and completely unknown phenomena arose in front of them.  Meanwhile, it was not possible to establish whether people were really transferred to the past or whether it was the effect of chronomrage. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the course of the experiments, a certain risk was also established, arising from the use of an unexplained effect.  Therefore, in all cases, the experiments were interrupted.  People who visited Kozyrev‚Äôs mirrors complained of dizziness and bouts of fear.  Some saw themselves in childhood, etc. </p><p>  However, the value of these experiments is not in doubt. </p><p>  Modern scientists continue to study the effects that occur when using Kozyrev mirrors.  The experiments are associated with a danger to the health of the subjects, so the researchers approach the choice of candidates very carefully. </p>
