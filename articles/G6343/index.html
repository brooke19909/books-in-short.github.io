The honor of being called the prince of poets was disputed by many internationally recognized writers - after all, this title is already more than 500 years old, and it continues to be considered an honorary award not only in France but also abroad.  To the question of which Frenchman was recognized as the prince of poets in 1885, it is difficult to give an unequivocal answer due to the fact that this title was not official and was granted to the masters of the poetic genre only symbolically. </p>

    <p>  The future poet was born in the family of a French paramedic in the small town of Saint-Paul, who at that time was the capital of Fr.  Reunion, one of the many French colonies.  Years of study in Brittany instilled a taste for classical French poetry, in which <span>Pierre de Ronsard</span> was considered the legislator <span>.</span>  De Lille founded the Parnassus School, in which he proclaims the ideals of modern romanticism.  The Parnassians refused to sing the ‚Äúboiling of feelings‚Äù, their goal was to create a balance between sensations and reality, between the objective and subjective perceptions of the world. </p><p>  During the life of the poet, three collections of poems and translations of several ancient authors were published.  By the end of the 19th century, Charles Leconte was already known to all intelligent French readers.  Victor Hugo was so impressed with his work that he asked after his death to give Leconte a place in the French Academy.  Soon this request was granted.  The Frenchman, recognized in 1885 as the prince of poets, is Charles Leconte de Lille. </p><h2>  Paul Verlaine </h2>

    <p>  Almost simultaneously with the work of de Lille, the public gets acquainted with another poet who made up his name.  The Frenchman, recognized in 1885 as the prince of poets during the life of Leconte de Lille - Paul Verlaine. </p><p>  Verlaine's biography cannot be called simple and understandable.  But, according to the apt remark of <span>Anatole France,</span> poets cannot be approached with the same standard as judicious people.  Already in his youth, Verlaine was read by the poetry of Gauthier and Banville, in 1866 his poems were published in the journal Modern Parnassus.  Poems in the collection "Saturnic Poetry", published by the poet at his own expense, already demonstrate to connoisseurs the original Verlaine style - melancholy and the ability to transmit "soul music."  Symbolism and <span>impressionism in literature</span> were discovered precisely by Verlaine, for which this Frenchman, recognized in 1885 as the prince of poets, received the honorary title during the lifetime of the former maestro.  And after the death of Leconte in 1894, this title was finally assigned to Verlaine. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Interesting collisions with the award of the title of Prince of Poets did not pass the attention of the general public.  On the one hand, the title was given for life, and they had no right to take it from Leconte in 1885.  On the other hand, Verlaine's work was so large-scale and significant that it was impossible not to mark it.  Therefore, the answer to the question of what name the Frenchman, recognized in 1885 by the prince of poets, could serve two options, and both will be historically correct - Paul Verlaine and Charles Leconte de Lille. </p>
