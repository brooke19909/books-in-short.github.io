    <h2>  General description of the problem </h2><p>  For any electronic gadget, the most important power source is the battery.  If something happens to her, the phone (or tablet, whatever that is) just loses the ability to turn on, which is why you see the picture when the Lenovo tablet does not turn on.  What to do to determine exactly what the problem is? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Think logically first.  The connection between the device itself and the outlet consists of several elements that may fail.  Having correctly understood their condition, you will be able to diagnose where the error is and what needs to be done to eliminate it. </p><p>  In an extreme case, of course, you can contact the service center, but solving the problem on your own is much more interesting. </p><h2>  Incorrect battery operation </h2>

    <p>  There is an opinion that if you charge your tablet incorrectly (constantly bring it to a complete discharge), in the end, the battery will malfunction and cease to function at all.  For this reason, if you really did, it is not surprising that the Lenovo tablet does not turn on. </p><p>  What to do to solve the problem is understandable as well: you need to replace the battery.  Just contact a good service center with a request to install the original battery for your tablet and trust the specialists. </p><h2>  Dirty contacts </h2>

This can lead to the fact that over time, during operation, dust and dirt will get there, which will lead to problems with the conductivity of the contacts.  Because of this, the picture will be observed when the Lenovo tablet does not turn on at all.  What to do to get rid of such a problem?  That's right - clean your contacts! </p><p>  It sounds, perhaps, simply: eliminating dust and dirt is not some kind of super-difficult task.  But only if it is not the contacts of your mobile device! </p><p>  If you take on this business yourself, you can come to even worse consequences by simply damaging your contacts.  Therefore, doing this yourself is by no means impossible.  Give the device to specialists - and they will carry out cleaning with the help of special tools. </p>

    <h2>  Problem charger </h2><p>  Another reason that causes a problem with turning on the device may be charging (or the charger that you connect to your gadget by connecting it to the power network).  If you use a non-original accessory, we advise you to take a closer look at this problem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most often, copies of chargers (cheaper Chinese counterparts, to be exact) lead to the fact that the Lenovo tablet does not turn on suddenly.  What to do in this case?  Check the charging you use! </p><p>  This can be done using a USB adapter connected to a PC.  Connect them and see for yourself whether the adapter had a problem or not.  We recommend immediately if such a problem is detected, change the accessory to a new, original one for your device. </p><h2>  Connecting the board to a battery or display </h2><p>  If none of the problems described above is suitable for your situation, perhaps the reason lies in a more serious malfunction - loss of connection between the board of your device and the display or with the battery.  As you understand, this means that you need to carry the device to the service center so that this connection is re-soldered and forced to work.  This can happen, for example, if you hit the gadget by dropping it.  Then the Lenovo A3000 tablet does not turn on.  We have already described what to do - you are unlikely to be able to get rid of this malfunction yourself. </p><h2>  Power line damage </h2>

    <p>  In order for the gadget to charge, the entire network that powers the device with electricity must be operational.  In the event that this complex connection is broken and any of the elements fails, an error occurs.  What should I do if the <span>Lenovo</span> Yoga Tablet 10 <span>tablet does not turn</span> on for this reason?  It is necessary to diagnose in which place the contact is removed (or burned out), which a specialist can easily do using a special device that checks the circuit.  Once the problem area is found, it will become clear what needs to be done and how to get rid of the malfunction. </p><p>  A problem can occur, for example, due to a network jump or an overly powerful charging adapter that is not designed to work specifically with your device model. </p><h2>  Another problem </h2><p>  As you can see, we presented you with several different options for what to do if the Lenovo A3500 tablet (or any other) does not turn on.  However, as you understand, any of these solutions is not a panacea.  You must be prepared for the fact that, by taking any steps, you will find that the problem was completely different.  Therefore, we recommend that you try to change as little as possible in your device so that these changes can subsequently be eliminated and everything can be returned.  Indeed, in fact, the error can be caused by other processes.  The simplest example is some kind of software malfunction of your device.  Perhaps, to turn it on, it would be enough to reset the system settings to the factory settings. </p>

    <p>  Another good advice on what to do if the <span>Lenovo A3300</span> tablet does not turn on is aimed at diagnosing a problem of a different nature, not related to the power system.  For example, it may be that water has got into your device, and you are trying to charge it with another charging adapter, hoping that the whole problem is in it.  This, of course, is the wrong tactic.  In such situations, contact specialists - they will tell you which components of the gadget need to be replaced, what should be cleaned, and so on. </p><h2>  Network problems </h2>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Finally, why do you immediately blame your device?  Why are you looking for what to do if the Lenovo A 1000 tablet does not turn on, thinking that the whole problem is in it?  Have you checked the voltage in your electrical network?  Maybe the whole thing is in it? </p><p>  There is such a chance that your house simply dropped its voltage as a result of some local problem.  As a result, the gadget refuses to charge, because it has special protective mechanisms that prevent it from working with such a problem network.  Try to determine how well the network works by connecting another electronic device to it.  If the latter is all right, then it really is in the tablet. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Our recommendations, of course, are not exclusive.  In real life, there are different options for what causes the malfunction.  This may be, in particular, and several different problems that simply crossed by pure chance.  And, on the contrary, the problem with your Lenovo (or any other device) may be something else.  Just think logically: after which the problem started, what additional signs are present, what has changed in the functioning of the device, and so on.  If you think in such a pattern, believe me, you will very soon establish the cause of the malfunction of the electronic device and, if possible, find a way out of this unfavorable situation.  I wish you success! </p>
