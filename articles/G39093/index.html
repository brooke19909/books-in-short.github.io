  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How did the evolution of the universe</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are two views on how the material world came about.  Religions ascribe to God a leading role in world order.  In particular, the Bible speaks of several days for which God created first light, then water, then firmament, followed by living beings - down to man.  Now the Churches say that ‚Äúsix days‚Äù is a metaphorical term, where the day is not equal to the day, but lasts much longer.  Another, radically opposite view of the origin of the visible, material world is scientific.  According to scientists, the evolution of the Universe began with the Big Bang (it is also called the Big Bang term), which occurred 10-15 billion years ago. </p><p>  What happened before everything that existed?  Modern astronomy believes that it was a sphere shrunk to a minimum size, inside which free <span>elementary particles</span> moved under the influence of the highest temperatures and pressure <span>.</span>  Everything material that the vast space now fills with itself was squeezed within the limits of the point tending to zero in size, from which the origin and evolution of the Universe began.  It is still unclear what caused the Big Bang.  However, this explosion itself led to the expansion of the Universe, and this process continues today.  What does it mean?  That the same amount of material particles over time takes up a larger volume. </p><p>  Will the material world expand forever, or someday its growth in volume will slow down, stop altogether, like the way we observe a grenade?  Perhaps, after this, the evolution of the Universe will stop, and will be replaced by the stage of ‚Äúfolding‚Äù, narrowing to the initial point.  We are not yet ready to answer this question with certainty.  But the picture of the world created by scientists can already describe successive phases in the growth and transformation of matter.  The first era, the hadron one, lasted only one millionth of a second, but during this time there was a process of annihilation of antibaryons and baryons, protons and neurons formed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second and third stages of the evolution of the Universe ‚Äî lepton and photon ‚Äî also lasted only a few seconds.  At the end of the second era, a neutrino sea formed, and the era of photons ended with the separation of matter from antimatter (which happened due to the annihilation of positrons and electrons).  The universe was expanding, which led to a decrease in the energy density of particles and photons.  The photon stage has been replaced by a stellar one, which continues now.  However, the formation of stars, galaxies and groups of galaxies occurred (and is happening) unevenly. </p><p>  Millions of years have passed since the Big Bang, when the simplest particles turned into atoms - mainly hydrogen and helium (these atoms are the main component of the Universe), atoms joined together into molecules that entered into compounds and formed crystals, substances, and mineral rocks.  During the stellar era, which at this stage ends the evolution of the universe, galaxies, <span>star systems,</span> planets were formed, life was born on our Earth.  Is it possible to say that the ‚Äúepic fireworks‚Äù is over and we are standing on cooling coals amidst the scattering smoke? </p><p>  Scientists have concluded that the evolution of the universe continues.  The turbulences of a giant accumulation of hydrogen flatten matter, transform these accumulations into whirlpools.  Thus spherical, elliptical and flattened galaxies are born (depending on the speed of rotation of a colossal - in a hundred thousand light-years - cycles).  Our Milky Way belongs to the last type of galaxies.  Stars form inside galaxies under the pressure of hydrogen clumps.  They also go through long stages of evolution: from incandescent supernovae to the ‚Äúred giants‚Äù, ‚Äúwhite dwarfs‚Äù and <span>black holes.</span>  The same processes occur with our Sun, while Cosmos continues to expand. </p>
