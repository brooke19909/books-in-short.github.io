All participants in the events could be presented for the award - Red Army men, military navy, NKVD officers, as well as civilians.  The basis for the award were documents confirming the actual participation in the defense.  Corresponding papers were issued by the commanders of units, the leadership of hospitals, as well as representatives of the executive branch, which included the councils of people's deputies.

    <h2>  External design </h2><p>  The medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Soviet Arctic‚Äù, the photo of which is presented in the article, was smelted from brass.  In diameter, the award reaches 3.2 centimeters.  The obverse depicts a half-chested soldier with his right shoulder pointing forward and his head slightly turned to the right.  He is dressed in winter uniforms - a cap with earflaps with an attached badge of the Red Army star and short fur coat.  In the hands of the soldier is holding a PPSh machine gun.  A part of the naval ship is engraved to the left of it, and images of combat aircraft are located on top of both sides.  In the lower part on the front background are the silhouettes of two tanks.  The name of the award is engraved from left to right around the circumference of the medal; below, between the first and last words of the inscription, there is a ribbon with a <span>five-pointed star</span> on top of it with the image of the <span>coat of arms of the USSR</span> in the center. </p><p>  On the reverse, in large letters in three lines, words are engraved, a kind of motto: ‚ÄúFor our Soviet Motherland‚Äù.  Above the phrase is the Soviet coat of arms - crossed hammer and sickle. </p><p>  The tape has a width of 2.4 centimeters, blue, made of silk.  In the middle of the tape is a green strip 6 millimeters wide, which divides the entire field into three equal parts. </p>
