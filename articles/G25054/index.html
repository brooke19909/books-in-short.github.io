On its territory there are many lakes, rivers, seas and other bodies of water.  They play an important role not only for man, but also for the environment. </p><p>  There are about two thousand lakes in the Leningrad Region.  By the method of formation, water bodies belong to both artificial and natural.  In this article, we will consider the Upper Svir Reservoir, which is more commonly known as the Ivinsky Spill.  It is the largest artificial reservoir in the region, second only to <span>Lake Onega.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Briefly about the reservoir </h2><p>  In the Podporozhsky district of the Leningrad region, on <span>the Svir River,</span> there is a beautiful reservoir.  The reason for its formation was the construction of a hydroelectric station, due to which almost all the wetland areas located in this region were flooded.  According to some reports, the territories of the villages were not affected, since the river bed passed relatively far from them. </p><p>  Ivinsky spill has no stable coast.  Wetlands form along the coast.  The level in the reservoir is constantly fluctuating, this leads to the fact that water often goes beyond its borders. </p><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  The spill has an elongated shape.  The bottom is muddy, flooded islands are found throughout the reservoir, and their sizes are completely different.  The largest accumulation of such sites is in the central-eastern part.  The coastline is indented, in places there are even torn sections.  The pond is very large, its length is about 20 km.  And in width it reaches even larger sizes - up to 24 km.  The depths of the Ivinsky spill are different.  The average is not more than <span>3 m,</span> in some places it reaches 8 m. But in the area where the riverbed is located.  Sviri, the depth reaches 17 m. The bottom is uneven, there are constantly pits that alternate with shallow areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Spill - flowing body of water.  The water in it is very clean and clear.  In summer, it quickly warms up.  Many streams and small rivers flow into the reservoir.  These water streams flow from the swamps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing in the Leningrad region" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1378341.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fishing in the Leningrad region </h2><p>  In this region there are many people who prefer to spend time in nature.  For them the best pastime is fishing.  What could be better than sitting in the early morning with a fishing rod in a pond in peace and quiet?  And when does the catch exceed all expectations?  Is it worth it to go very far in order to please yourself?  Residents of the Leningrad region can not find a better reservoir than the Ivinsky spill.  A lot of fish live here.  Experienced fishermen can catch pike, zander, bream.  And for those who are less professional in this matter and do not like to sit waiting for a long time, it is better to put fishing rods on perch, roach, and rudd. </p><p>  Nibble in these places is great!  You can go on a small fish with a fishing rod or mormyshka.  It is better to fish from a boat, since the coast is very swampy.  Worms, bloodworms, bread or semolina are ideal as bait.  Those who prefer to catch predators should use spinning.  As a rule, pike love the place where the largest number of algae.  There were cases when individuals over 20 kg came across.  So everyone will like fishing in the Leningrad Region and leave a lot of pleasant memories. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The surroundings of the pond </h2><p>  The coastline of the reservoir is very overgrown with vegetation.  Here you can find small bushes that are located right next to the water.  Deciduous and coniferous forest stretches a little farther wide.  There are no equipped beaches.  The spill is completely unfit for rest.  The places here are very wild, not developed.  Unfortunately, good roads are also missing.  It is this fact that makes it difficult for vacationers and fishermen to come to this reservoir.  However, this can be called a plus, since there are few people here, as if no one would hinder rest.  In the forest there are many different representatives of the flora.  You can often watch the birds hunt fish, dropping very low to the water. </p>
