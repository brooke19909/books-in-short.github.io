    <p>  The hotel by the sea Hellinis Hotel has earned some complaints from tourists for having a nearby airport.  The roar of the engines of take-off and landing aircraft can prevent residents from relaxing in their rooms.  Many vacationers, of course, do not like it.  But some tourists consider this characteristic noise even a certain highlight of the hotel.  The rumble from the planes in the hotel is actually not heard too much. </p><p>  Unfortunately, none of the hotel employees speaks Russian.  Only employees understand English.  This, of course, in some cases may not be particularly convenient.  But in any case, to understand what the Russian tourist is asking for, the workers of the complex are always trying very hard.  And in most cases they do it. </p><h2>  Hellinis Hotel 3 *: nutrition reviews </h2><p>  Rooms at this hotel can be rented with breakfast or a guest house.

Mostly only cuts, fried sausages, omelets, toasts, bacon, cottage cheese are served here.  There is almost never fruit in the dining room.  In addition to the buffet, the hotel also has a bar.  It is located by the pool.  Here, tourists can purchase various drinks - both alcoholic and alcohol-free. </p>
