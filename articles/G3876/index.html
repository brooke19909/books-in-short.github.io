And this is a merit not only of the processor, RAM and other hardware.  Without universal mobile operating systems, smartphones would remain simple ‚Äúdialers‚Äù.  At the moment, there are three of the most popular OS for mobile devices: Android, iOS and Windows Phone (Mobile).  All of them are capable of much.  However, the choice of OS is the prerogative of a particular user.  Here a man is guided by his tastes. </p><p>  The most popular OS is Android.  But a Windows-based phone can be found quite often.  iOS is not so common because of the high cost of the product.  If Android is even a little bit known to the majority, then Windows Phone OS is a dark horse for many.  Let's talk about this wonderful system.  Did Bill Gates manage to create the perfect mobile OS? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A brief history of the system </h2><p>  If Windows is installed on your mobile gadget, this does not mean that it automatically turns into a computer.  This is beyond the power of even Bill Gates, coupled with Steve Jobs.  The very first versions of the Windows system were installed on devices such as Sony Ericsson P1 or HP.  Although the functionality of those devices (respectively, the OS) was very limited, but against the background of the ‚Äúhandsets‚Äù of the beginning of the 2000s, they looked like real computers.  Having a Windows phone was considered really cool.  However, around 2007, Microsoft decided that the system had become obsolete and began to actively develop a new OS, which came out with the release of the controversial Windows 8. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="windows phone" class="if" height="141" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/7/1/6/7/2/4/1716724.jpg" width="600"></div>

They abandoned the system, proven over the years in favor of a raw product that upset a bunch of users.  Microsoft could bring the OS to a sane look only after a couple of years.  Phone based on Windows 8 has become a real punishment for users.  But over time, the situation has improved.  However, one problem remained.  This refers to the scarcity of the app store.  If the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù Play Store has hundreds of thousands of applications and games, then in the Windows Store there are only a couple of hundred. </p><p>  After the release of Windows 10, the company decided to upgrade the mobile platform.  However, only in the form of insider updates (Technical Preview).  Those unfortunate people who ventured to upgrade to the top ten got terrible problems with their gadgets.  And some generally got a "brick" after the update.  There was nothing more stupid than installing an ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù system on a normally working device.  But after some time, phones based on Windows 10 began to work very adequately.  Microsoft has fixed its mistakes.  However, the share of WP devices compared to the same "Android" is negligible.  Consider the most popular devices on the Windows platform. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Microsoft Lumia 640 </h2><p>  This flagship from the creators of the legendary operating system.  The Microsoft Lumia 640 runs on a Qualcomm quad-core 1600 MHz processor.  It has everything that a modern gadget needs.  The most important thing is that Windows Phone 8.1 (installed in the factory) is installed on its board.  But the smartphone can be updated to the latest version of the OS.  It is worth noting that the system feels great on this device.  Everything works quickly, smoothly and clearly.  There is only one problem: very few applications for this platform.  But by 2016, the situation has improved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microsoft lumia 640" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/7/1/6/4/2/0/1716420.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Microsoft <span>Lumia 640 is</span> suitable for those who are fan of Bill Gates and his operating system.  There are models with support for one SIM card, as well as ‚Äúdual SIM cards‚Äù.  The characteristics of the smartphone are very impressive.  There is even support for LTE (4G) and an NFC chip.  This is a very modern device on the Windows platform. </p><h2>  Microsoft Lumia 550 </h2><p>  The device is manufactured in 2015, which immediately has Windows 10 installed in its arsenal. Although something is good, you won‚Äôt have to upgrade.  No jokes, but the Microsoft Lumia 550 is a very decent smartphone.  Of course, he does not shine with flagship characteristics, but he will cope with all everyday tasks with a bang.  For this he was created.  The "chip" of the gadget is a very high battery life indicator.  According to the manufacturer, the device is able to work on a single charge for 16.5 hours of talk time (with 3G on).  This is an impressive result.  Also, the user has 86 hours of music playback.  And in standby mode, the device is able to work 864 hours.  The absolute champion! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microsoft lumia 550" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/7/1/6/4/1/8/1716418.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Meanwhile, Microsoft Lumia 550 is the same Nokia, but with a new name.  And legends still circulate about this Finnish producer.  And they were the first to use Windows in their gadgets.  So this device can be called a continuation of tradition. </p><h2>  <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 730 Dual Sim </h2><p>  One of the few devices on Windows, released under the Nokia brand.  Despite the old name, the device combined all the latest achievements of the mobile industry.  But most of all users were attracted by Carl Zeiss optics on the camera.  This made it unique even with 6.7 megapixels.  The last bastion of the old era is the <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 730 Dual Sim smartphone.  Reviews about this gadget were extremely positive.  So far, users have not upgraded to the top ten.  Then the mess went.  But with updates, the situation has improved.  It‚Äôs only a shame that Microsoft has followed in the footsteps of Samsung and does not provide updates to old devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone nokia lunia 730 dual sim reviews" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/7/1/6/4/2/1/1716421.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A wonderful gadget and now has not lost its relevance.  Its performance is at the level of mid-range smartphones.  And if you take into account the original appearance, then this device generally has no price.  And not only the "oldfages" will be happy to possess it. </p><h2>  Nokia Lumia 1020 </h2><p>  At one time, this smartphone made a whole revolution.  Even before its appearance, the Internet was flooded with rumors about the unrealistically powerful camera of the upcoming flagship.  And the rumors did not deceive.  According to the manufacturer, the 1020 is equipped with a module with a record number of megapixels - 41. This has not happened before.  However, upon closer examination, it turned out that the module has only 16 physical megapixels.  Everything else is achieved programmatically.  But this was a breakthrough.  The cameraphone began to be snapped up by mobile photography enthusiasts.  A Windows-based phone that takes quality pictures!  Who will miss this? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc mozart 7 firmware windows phone 8 1" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/7/1/6/4/2/2/1716422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the factory, Windows 8.1 was installed on the device.  But soon, Microsoft made it possible to upgrade to the top ten.  Some problems, of course, had a place to be, but they were fixed by subsequent updates.  After that, the hype around 1020 subsided.  The smartphone was not as good as we would like.  But by discounting the fact that it was developed specifically by Microsoft, and not Nokia, one can forgive such a thing.  After all, the brainchild of Bill Gates has a habit of spoiling everything he touches.  Remember the epic with Skype. </p><h2>  HP Elite X3 </h2><p>  This unit is relatively "fresh."  It was released in 2016.  The company that produces mainly laptops and PCs introduced a smartphone.  This is already interesting, since there has certainly not been such a decade.  The gadget did not disappoint.  It has everything you need for comfortable work.  And the docking station allows you to turn a mobile device into a full-fledged computer.  If Elite X3 will top the rating of phones with Windows Phone on board, then no one will be surprised.  Its power is so transcendental that the "ten" installed on it is not able to unleash all its huge potential. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="windows mobile phone" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/7/1/6/4/1/7/1716417.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Although to call this creation "telephone" is a terrible sacrilege.  Before us is the CCP in all its glory.  It differs from a regular computer only in size and the ability to call.  But in the camp of smartphones, he is considered an overgrowth.  Still would!  With a screen diagonal of 6 inches, it easily stands out from other mobile gadgets.  HP is always on top.  Her PDA could always hit users.  It affects the experience in the production of full-sized PCs and laptops. </p><h2>  Alcatel POP2 Windows </h2><p>  A gadget that was announced back in 2014.  However, its release is scheduled for 2017. The device is a <span>budget phone</span> based on Windows 8.1.  Its capacities are enough to solve all everyday tasks.  It‚Äôs also possible to play, but not in the coolest games.  For them, the apparatus is rather weak.  But there is support for the latest generation of cellular networks.  And to imagine a modern smartphone without this is completely impossible.  The gadget will appeal not only to students.  Many will find it attractive.  And given the fact that at the price it will not be particularly burdensome, then POP2 in general can be a bestseller. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="windows 10 phones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/thumb/a/1/7/1/6/7/4/9/1716749.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <p>  Alcatel has been known for its phones since the early 2000s.  However, in the era of smartphones, the manufacturer remained overboard and could not get into the mobile device market.  Perhaps POP2 Windows will somehow change the situation?  I would like to believe in this, because the company is not bad.  Her devices have always been of high quality. </p><h2>  Acer Liquid Jade Primo </h2><p>  Affordable smartphone with almost flagship features.  The advantage of Acer is that they managed to create a phone based on Windows Mobile 10, which stands out against the background of hundreds of the same devices.  The company has always been distinguished by its original design.  And this gadget is no exception: its appearance is impressive.  But the characteristics are even more striking.  Few Windows phones boast a FullHD screen, a powerful camera and 3 gigabytes of RAM.  It is worth noting that this is not the first experience of the company in the production of mobile devices.  It can be seen that Acer has not lost dexterity.  Her devices, as always, are at their best. </p><h2>  Archos 50 Cesium </h2><p>  Little is known about the mobile devices of this company.  She never broke into the leaders of the mobile industry, so her devices did not differ at unattainable prices.  All the more interesting is their novelty from the category of "windscreens".  The smartphone has average performance and a standard appearance.  But at a price it is closer to state employees.  Even the monsters of the mobile industry fail to create a cheap and powerful enough gadget, because they all want to get a rollback for the brand.  But Archos does not need this.  Therefore, her latest creation may well lead the ranking of the best-selling. </p><h2>  Acer Liquid M220 </h2><p>  Another offspring from Acer.  The company tried to make a high-quality, inexpensive and productive Windows-based smartphone.  Did they succeed or not?  Solve for users.  But outwardly the device looks very worthy.  There are no complaints about performance: we have a confident "average".  And for the price it is very pleasant.  It is worth noting that Acer is one of the few that provides all its devices with timely updates.  And this is another plus in the track record of the company.  Choosing Acer products, you will always be in trend, despite the "antiquity" of your smartphone. </p><h2>  Dexp Ixion W5 </h2><p>  A smartphone from a little-known and not entirely understood manufacturer.  According to some reports, Dexp is a Russian office that sells equipment of the "left" Chinese manufacturers under its own brand.  Knowing this, you need to be extremely careful.  However, the device looks very tempting.  For a frankly low price, the user is offered a gadget with average characteristics.  This alone should be alarming.  And reviews about the manufacturer as a whole, and about the model in particular, are not encouraging.  Owners complain about clumsy assembly, constant firmware glitches and a complete lack of updates.  Though on it and Windows. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners of the equipment of this company, it does not deserve confidence.  However, smartphones from this manufacturer can be bought by those who value the price of the device, and not its quality.  If you are guided only by this principle, then Dexp products are very, very attractive.  But no more than that. </p><h2>  HTC Mozart 7 </h2><p>  The next device from the category of "windscreens" is <span>HTC Mozart 7. There is</span> Windows Phone 8.1 firmware on it.  Although the factory comes version 7.5.  So no need to breed a panic.  The device is positioned as "musical", although there is nothing musical (by modern standards) in it.  In general, a device from the category of "ancient".  But some will like it.  Due to appearance.  Gadgets from the NTS from the past have a unique design.  Their appearance stands out among the faceless modern "soap dishes". </p><p>  The smartphone, meanwhile, can be successfully used as a regular ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, a GPS navigator and an MP3 player.  But for surfing on the Internet it is not suitable.  The screen is small.  But for the money that is now being asked for for this gadget (naturally, it was second-hand, because it has already been discontinued), the set of functions is quite adequate.  What what, and beautiful and functional gadgets have always been the "skate" of HTC.  Windows Phone 8 on board (after the upgrade) is also a nice bonus. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Few manufacturers can please the user with a wide range of <span>Windows smartphones,</span> but they are available.  Although in a much smaller number than devices on the "Android".  Meanwhile, this mobile platform (with adequate ‚Äúcompleteness‚Äù) manifests itself as a very stable, reliable and stylish operating system.  There is only one catch: a very small number of applications in the store.  Some developers do not even want to release applications for this platform.  However, the situation is improving.  Soon the store will be put in order.  But this platform will never be able to fully compete with the "Android".  Although she is good. </p>
