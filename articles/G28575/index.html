All-inclusive hotels in Morocco: photos, prices and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The small North African state of Morocco as a tourist region compares favorably with its neighbors in Magrib and Egypt.  The heat in these tropical latitudes, due to the cold ocean currents, is not debilitating.  The original interweaving of different cultures, authentic Arab cities, picturesque mountain landscapes and chic beaches annually attract up to 10 million tourists from all over the world.  This is facilitated not only by an active marketing campaign, but also by a top-level hospitality industry.  The number of guests from Russia increased by 60%. </p><h2>  The Pearl of North Africa </h2><p>  Over the past decade, with the help of investors from Western Europe, the number of rooms in the country has increased significantly.  Several hundred hotels in all regions of the country offer their services to customers with any budget and requests.  The quality of service is constantly improving.  Morocco 5-star hotels are located in all major tourist centers: in the capital, Rabat, as well as in Marrakesh, Casablanca, Agadir, El Jadida, Essaouira, Fes, Saidyi, Varzazate, Tangier. </p><p>  For the stay of guests 233 hotels of the highest level of service offer not only chic apartments, but also comfortable bungalows.  As a rule, all 5 star hotels are located on the first coastline and have their own beaches.  Travelers, however, need to keep in mind that although local establishments are ranked according to European standards, the classification in some cases is very arbitrary.  Five-star rooms may not have basic toiletries.  But few <span>Morocco hotels</span> are distinguished by this peculiarity <span>.</span>  "All inclusive" as a type of service, not all hotels of the highest, first and second categories <span>(5, 4</span> and 3 stars) offer.  The staff is highly professional and friendly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
