    <h2>  Where is the fabulous residence </h2><p>  The exact address of Belovezhskaya Pushcha (Santa Claus) is 225063 Kamenyuki, Kamenetsky district, <span>Brest region,</span> Republic of Belarus.  I chose a fabulous Grandfather for a house to match.  The primeval, untouched nature of the Pushcha is already a gift to humanity, which must be protected and protected.  The vast territory of the forest falls on the border with Poland.  This is a unique place, the only one in the entire territory of the former Soviet Union, with centuries-old trees and many forest inhabitants living throughout the largest European national park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The residence of Santa Claus in Belovezhskaya Pushcha is located in a protected forest, in the largest meadow, where a huge spruce 40 meters tall grows.  Bison used to come here to feed, and perhaps now they drop in when there are not too many tourists.  The territory of the reserve is protected so that <span>forest animals are</span> disturbed as little as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="address of Bialowieza Forest of Santa Claus" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/674838.jpg" width="563"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to visit fabulous characters </h2><p>  Since the residence of Santa Claus in Belovezhskaya Pushcha is located on the territory of the protected reserve, you can only come with a guided tour.  It is impossible to pass independently and breathe air.  However, such a schedule does not cause much inconvenience, because the residence works all year round, daily from 9:00 to 18:00.  On weekends, this time is extended to 20:00.  Do not forget that the place here is quiet, reserved, and you need to behave appropriately. </p><p>  An organized excursion with delivery can be ordered in Minsk, but the journey is far and you will get tired on the road.  From the capital to the forest about 5 hours drive, then a walk and the return trip.  It is much better to get to Brest, have a rest here and book an excursion.  About an hour or a half on the way - and you will be there.  The most comfortable option is to get to Belovezhskaya Pushcha by personal transport and stay at a hotel in Kamenyuki.  Having rested from the road, you can go to the Pushcha and buy bus tickets to the residence on the spot.  Departure here at 11:00, 13:30 and 16:30.  On weekends more often.  If you arrived at the wrong time, you can easily pass the few hours by taking a walk in the park or renting a bike.  After all, before you is the famous Belovezhskaya Pushcha, the estate of Santa Claus will wait a bit.  A delightful experience is guaranteed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bialowieza Forest letter to Santa Claus" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/674837.jpg" width="480"></div>

The house of Santa Claus, covered with a snow cap, snow-white snowdrifts and ate in silver - all this complements the picture of a magical forest.  It‚Äôs good in the summer here, but something is still missing.  From the central entrance to Belovezhskaya Pushcha to the residence about 10 km, you can easily get there by bicycle, but without an excursion, access is still impossible. </p><p>  The bus takes you from the main entrance and takes you directly to visit the characters of winter fairy tales.  At the entrance, he stops and leaves, promising to return for tourists in two hours.  There is no guide on the bus, but it is not long to go.  Along the way, you will listen to the story of the creation of the residence in the recording.  Here are the main gates of the estate, around are gazebos, children's attractions, souvenir shops. </p><p>  Near the gates miracles begin - the wooden knights do not open until the tourists say the magic phrase three times.  Now you are visiting Santa Claus.  You are greeted by a "wooden" family.  Here Snow White and her faithful retinue live - the seven dwarfs.  Next to the grandfather‚Äôs tower, and the old man is called with a special bell.  About 30 minutes he entertains the guests.  In summer, in a light outfit and without a granddaughter, in winter in a traditional robe with the Snow Maiden.  In summer, you don‚Äôt get into the tower itself, but in winter they let it in, only on holidays the flow of tourists is such that grandfather has no time to listen to poetry.  The estate is very large and beautiful.  You can safely enjoy your vacation and do not forget to receive gifts.  Nearby in the house you exchange your tickets for a festive treat.  This is valid only in the summer, in winter the Snow Maiden will give you presents near the Christmas tree. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where dreams come true </h2><p>  Further the guide guides you through the estate and shows you the economy.  There are places where you can make wishes and perform holiday ceremonies.  For example, the Magic Mill.  She grinds all the bad deeds into dust.  It is enough to touch her and remember everything that was bad.  Everything, you start the New Year from scratch. </p><p>  There is a clearing of twelve months.  Here, as in a fairy tale, all the brothers gather near the fire.  You need to find the month of your birth and make a wish.  Stunning sculptures of fabulous inhabitants adorn the entire territory of the estate. </p><p>  After passing through a clearing of signs on the <span>Eastern calendar,</span> you find yourself on the Magic Bridge.  At every step on it, you need to remember your family and friends and wish them good health.  <span>Here is the Snegurochka tower.</span>  Passing by it, you must definitely look into the window and try to see your reflection in the mirror.  And then comes the most cherished tower - all letters from children get here, and gifts and drawings sent by the guys are stored here.  Having walked around a lot, the group goes to the bus.  The last minutes can be spent in a cafe, here they feed tasty and inexpensive.  That's all, now the next group is in a hurry to visit the estate of Santa Claus.  Belovezhskaya Pushcha, especially on holidays, is constantly flooded with tourists.  Everyone wants to see an animated fairy tale with their own eyes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Santa Claus Belovezhskaya Pushcha cost" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/674834.jpg" width="357"></div>

    <h2>  Travel cost </h2><p>  Now you know <span>where Santa Claus lives</span> (Belovezhskaya Pushcha).  The cost of such a rich excursion is very small - $ 7.5 for an adult ticket and 6 for a child.  This trip is especially recommended if you have children.  Just choose any time except the peak of the New Year holidays.  It is better to go in mid-December than to jostle in lines and try to reach out to the tortured Santa Claus.  This is not the only residence of New Year's characters, but in the luxurious setting of a fabulous forest, it is the best. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bialowieza Forest manor of Santa Claus" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/674836.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <h2>  New Year celebration </h2><p>  Mass festivities here begin around mid-December, and tourists do not decrease until January 10th.  Only then the life of the residence enters the usual rut.  It is especially solemn and beautiful here on holidays after 16 hours.  At this time, the evening Christmas lights up.  All the trees sparkle with silver, and the fluffy beauty, the Christmas tree, shines with colorful garlands.  There is a bright theatrical performance with the participation of many fairy-tale characters.  A traditional round dance around the Christmas tree, songs and dances, the solemn presentation of gifts.  Two hours in a fabulous monastery among miracles and children's dreams.  No matinees and Santa Claus and Snegurochka summoned to the house can replace a trip to his forest monastery.  Here, every adult begins to believe that they are real. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bialowieza Forest house of Santa Claus" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/674831.jpg" width="332"></div>
