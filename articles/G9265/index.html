If the main difference between the first two is the diameter, the size of which in millimeters is displayed in the model name, then there are almost no differences between the last two.  Some users and even sellers of GS Air components sometimes call this Eleaf GS 16 Plus clearomizer, but the manufacturer wanted to highlight this particular device, and he gave it a different name. </p><p>  The equipment of these devices is standard, there are no unnecessary details in it.  The package contains the device itself fully assembled, ready for use.  There is a gift option that differs only in the beauty of the package. </p><h2>  Popular manufacturer from China </h2><p>  ISmoka Electronics was established in 2008 and is located in China, in Shenzhen.  She has an excellent reputation, which was ensured by a high level of product quality and an excellent customer support system.  Currently, the company has many followers in Europe, America, Russia and other parts of the world. </p><p>  iSmoka Electronics is trying to become a leader in the market of electronic cigarettes, specializing in the production of elegant products of modern design with personalized color solutions.  The company provides world-class devices at a competitive price and provides good customer service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Production focuses on four areas: battery batteries, atomizers, accessories and kits for beginners. </p><p>  In the European and American markets, the Eleaf GS series of atomizers is popular, a review of which follows. </p><h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  Standard configuration includes: </p><ul><li>  mouthpiece; </li><li>  atomizer tube; </li><li>  a head; </li><li>  base. </li></ul><p>  The mouthpiece is metal, consists of two components.  The part in contact with the liquid container is made of special plastic that is resistant to high temperature and has heat-insulating properties.  This prevents the heating of the metal part. </p><p>  The mouthpiece included in the Eleaf GS kit, customer reviews are called very convenient and ergonomic, but note its size is too large.  Since it is interchangeable, a part of a suitable size can be installed in its place. </p>

    <h2>  Power, traction and volume </h2><p>  Eleaf GS14, GS16 and GS Air are very similar to each other both externally and internally.  Fundamental functional differences between the last model and the first two are that: </p><ul><li>  the Eleaf GS Air clearomizer (2.5 ml) supports the ability to regulate propeller traction from below, and in the GS Air 2 modification, the air flow is adjusted using a silicone ring; </li><li>  GS16 is designed to work with low-power double-spiral heating elements; </li><li>  The replaceable evaporator iSmoka Eleaf GS Air BDC is capable of holding 20 watts of power. </li></ul><p>  This makes the GS Air a streamlined and improved GS16 clearomizer.  Therefore, when using a 20-watt evaporator, it is better to opt for the GS Air, and with an eGo battery, it is advisable to choose GS14 or GS16. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Eleaf GS16 clearomizer is slightly larger and has less performance, and the GS Air is more compact, but can be used with larger batteries.  For example, as an ideal complement to S16, the manufacturer recommends a 20-watt iStick. </p><p>  The GS14 is exactly the same as the GS16, except that it is thinner and holds 1.8 ml of refueling.  This clearomizer goes well with the D14 battery, which, in fact, was calculated.  The quality of work is fully consistent with the larger model GS16. </p><p>  The new addition to the series stands apart - the GS-Tank atomizer.  22 mm in diameter with a volume of 3 ml require a maximum power of 30-40 watts.  The head is compatible with many batteries, but iStick TC40W is most suitable for it. </p>

    <h2>  Connection types </h2><p>  The GS series clearomizers have a 510 internal thread and an external eGo.  The thread diameter of the first joint is 6 mm, the pitch is 0.5 mm, and the depth is 4 mm.  Although they look best with D14 and D16 batteries, they can also be used with other Eleaf devices or other manufacturers.  According to user reviews, the GS16 goes well with, for example, a Spinner 2 battery and a little worse with Spinner 1, but better appearance and performance, however, is achieved with native D-batteries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Housing Features </h2><p>  Eleaf GS electronic cigarette of all models is made of Pyrex glass and stainless steel.  This combination of materials ensures the neutrality of the tank, so the mixture has no aftertaste.  In addition, glass is resistant to prolonged exposure to aggressive flavors and does not tarnish over time.  To prevent leaks, the parts are carefully tuned.  The tightness of the connection of glass with steel is ensured by silicone glue, which increases the reliability of the tank.  In addition, the presence of glass allows you to instantly control the volume of liquid, which, according to customers, eliminated the problems during pouring.  The case is smooth, seamless. </p>

    <h2>  Evaporator and heating element </h2><p>  An evaporator with the required resistance can be purchased separately.  In addition, there are heads, the design of which allows you to independently wind a spiral with the required parameters.  For example, for the Eleaf GS Air model, rewinding the evaporator will reduce the standard resistance value of 1.5 Ohms, which will increase the efficiency of vaporization.  The standard GS atomizer heads do not support the ability to replace coils by the user, although many customers confirm this possibility. </p><p>  The replacement coil on the GS16 is available with 1.8 and 1.6 ohms.  The design in the form of a double helix provides the release of a large amount of steam at low voltage, which avoids leaks and smack of fumes.  The GS-Tank introduced a nickel 200 heating element in the GS Air TC head with a resistance of 0.15 Ohms. </p><p>  For the GS16 and GS Air, the location of the evaporator is at the bottom, which allows steam to be generated when the liquid level is extremely low.  According to users, this greatly improves the taste, since the upper position of the device due to insufficient wettability of the spiral can give the taste of burning.  In atomizers of the GS series, there is enough liquid in the evaporator even when it only covers the bottom of the tank. </p><p>  According to consumer reviews, the replacement of the evaporator should be done at least once a week, a maximum of three weeks, as the taste transfer is significantly impaired. </p><p>  The clearomizer refueling is convenient, there is no need to pour out the residues from the tank.  To do this, simply unscrew the base and replenish the supply. </p>

It is only necessary from time to time to replace the used evaporator with a new one.  When replacing, let it soak for several minutes.  This will prevent the evaporator from burning. </p><p>  To replace the atomizer head, it is necessary to unscrew the base of the device, remove it and replace it with a new one. </p><p>  Only Eleaf GS Air needs tuning, as the GS14 / GS16 does not have a <span>traction control</span> function.  To e-cigarette lasts less, you should tighten the screw located on the base of the device.  At the same time, the air supply decreases, and the evaporation goes worse, the draft becomes similar to regular smoking.  This is often used to facilitate the switch to steam.  If you release the screw, it will be easier to draw in air. </p><p>  <span>The</span> clearomizer <span>tank is</span> refilled by unscrewing the base of the device.  Then the liquid for electronic cigarettes is poured into the tank.  In order for it not to get into the duct, users are advised to use a special bottle with a thin nose.  Otherwise, during operation of the device, the cigarette will seethe, and liquid may enter the mouth.  Do not fill the tank completely, the optimal level is in the region of 90% of the maximum. </p><p>  GS-clearomizers allow changing coils on the fly, which indicates the absence of solution losses when replacing coils with a fully filled tank.  You can purchase 1.8 or 1.6 ohm heating elements.  Eleaf GS coil quality customer reviews are exceptional.  When the voltage increases above the usual settings, a burned taste does not occur, which allows you to enjoy a warmer steam than usual. </p><p>  When installing a <span>heating element with a</span> resistance of 0.15 Ohms, it is necessary to use battery packs with temperature control.  The technology of thermal control will relieve the smack of burning, since with insufficient supply of liquid the power supply will decrease automatically. </p><p>  According to user advice, the wick material should be replaced with Japanese <span>organic cotton,</span> which will provide the maximum transfer of taste. </p><p>  In order to achieve maximum steam quality after purchasing a new Eleaf GS series device, user reviews agree on the need for several preliminary break-in cycles.  With each dressing, the taste characteristics will become better and better, reaching a maximum value after three cycles. </p><p>  To facilitate disassembly of the device, notches are made on its base.  All connections are sealed with seal rings. </p>
