    <p>  Recently, many people are interested in working on the Internet.  And this is not surprising, because we spend most of our free time on the computer every day.  So why at this time not to occupy yourself with something really useful, that which will bring income.  One of the types of profitable activity is the game on the stock exchange.  For beginners, it looks like exciting fun, a kind of gamble.  But with such an attitude, you can‚Äôt even dream of big profits, rather the opposite: you will lose all your savings. </p><p>  In fact, the game on the stock exchange for beginners requires an investment not only of start-up capital, but also a thorough study of the basic terms.  Ideally, an understanding of the basic economic processes is necessary.  But do not be alarmed, because you can learn everything if you have a desire and desire.  On many "inviting" sites, exchange trading is presented as easy work (by type: you do nothing, and the profit itself is transferred to your account).  The purpose of such <span>an advertising activity</span> is to lure money out of unaware people, because they invest modest means by the standards of experienced specialists and, of course, immediately lose them. </p><p>  So, for starters, it‚Äôs worth understanding that trading on the <span>foreign exchange market</span> or exchange is a kind of struggle between the parties to the transaction, as there is a clash of interests, and each side seeks to get the maximum benefit from the current situation.  As a rule, participants in operations are experts in financial matters, therefore, playing the stock exchange for beginners requires preliminary preparation.  First of all, you should familiarize yourself with the basic terms.  Then you have to make a choice of a specific type of securities with which you will work later.  Only after that you can open an account with a specific broker. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently, there are many articles and books that describe how to make money in the stock market.  They fully reveal all the intricacies of this business and help a beginner to navigate this difficult game.  Only literature should be selected wisely, do not be tempted by articles about easy money, this is just an advertising move.  And you need to get the maximum knowledge.  There is a special program on the exchange, the so-called demo version, which allows you to try your skills and abilities in practice.  Its essence is that it allows you to place bets without first investing start-up capital.  If you win, you won‚Äôt get profit, but you won‚Äôt lose your own money either. </p><p>  Playing on the stock exchange for beginners seems too complicated, and many surrender already at the first steps.  But this is work and hard mental work.  An effective working strategy comes over the years, with experience, so the first couple should not be surprised at the losses.  But if your desire is stronger than failure, then sooner or later you will feel the sweetness of success.  And most importantly: you need to remember that only constant development will lead to a high level of income.  First you need to focus not on profit, but on attracting customers and minimizing losses. </p><p>  A person who decides to connect his life with exchange activity must meet certain qualities: self-control, endurance, calm, quick reaction to changes that take place.  In no case should you take starting capital on loan from friends or on credit.  Only the presence of personal savings, because the amount of income can be too insignificant to pay off debt, and in some cases it is not at all.  Then you lose money and owe it to someone.  This is an irrational approach.  A real trader always first assesses the degree of risk and possible consequences, and only then acts. </p><p>  Believe in your strength, and everything will work out.  Good luck to you! </p>
