The ancient corner, where everything breathes history, is unusually rich in architectural monuments. </p><p>  Nestled between Madrid and Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãit differs from the bustling metropolises with an unhurried lifestyle and peaceful atmosphere.  A city with ancient history carefully preserves its cultural heritage, and therefore no one will argue that its main attractions appeared many years ago.  Zaragoza, in the form of which medieval monuments peacefully coexist with modern buildings, is the capital of the autonomous <span>Spanish region of</span> Aragon. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The settlement was founded by Iberian tribes, and later Roman soldiers came to the fertile land.  From the year 24 BC, the story begins of the history of the charming Spanish pearl shared by Arabs and Christians.  Called Cesaraugust, the city was the capital of the independent kingdom of Aragon. </p><p>  With the advent of Napoleon, who was trying to conquer Zaragoza, the inhabitants withstood a heavy siege, displaying fierce resistance to the enemy.  The feat of 54 thousand Spaniards is immortalized in the obelisk to fallen soldiers, located on the main square.  A righteous war was sung by descendants, and the local population still keeps a memory of this event. </p><h2>  Cultural heritage </h2><p>  Now about 700 thousand inhabitants live in the capital of Aragon, welcoming all tourists who are in a hurry to see the most famous city sights.  Zaragoza, taking care of its heritage, deserves the attention of all connoisseurs of architectural masterpieces, giving the village a special flavor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zaragoza attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1397302.jpg" width="500"></div>
