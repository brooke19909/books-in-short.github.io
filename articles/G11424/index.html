This is a beautiful resort town, representing a long street stretching along the Mediterranean coast. </p><h2>  A bit about Beldibi </h2><p>  Beldibi is a small Turkish village located near the Kemer resort, a 30-minute drive from <span>Antalya</span> International <span>Airport.</span>  This is one of the large villages adjacent to the resort territorial zone of Kemer.  In Beldibi, everything is designed for lovers of a relaxing, scenic holiday.  There, climbing the neighboring mountains, you can observe the course of life below from above, admire the beauty of the Mediterranean Sea and banana groves.  And sitting in a secluded cove, you can enjoy the tranquility, the sea and the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ege montana hotel 4 beldibi" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/724145.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Once a small settlement Beldibi was the residence of sheep farmers and peasants engaged in the cultivation of citrus fruits and bananas.  Thanks to German investors who ventured to invest heavily in a picturesque quiet place, Beldibi turned into an excellent resort.  Now there are about 60 hotels of various levels, including the Ege Montana <span>Hotel 4 *.</span>  <span>Kemer,</span> located 15 kilometers from the village, will provide tourists with all the delights of nightlife.  Conducting quiet hours of relaxation in the village on the beach can easily be compensated for by activity on the dance floors of Kemer or on river rafting in the Taurus Mountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Beldibi, hotels are divided into two categories: fashionable, with chic, loose sandy beaches and a large number of pools with an additional service structure, and budget ones, with rocky beaches and some restrictions on comfort.  There is a municipal beach in Beldibi, which has deservedly received the Blue Flag award.  This beach and several wild, inaccessible <span>white sand beaches</span> are especially popular among vacationing youth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ege montana hotel 4 kemer reviews" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/724148.jpg" width="600"></div>
