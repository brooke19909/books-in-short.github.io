Then began a kind of restructuring within the Finnish company.  The manufacturer decided that we should listen to the concept of touch screens and prepare for its further development and expansion.  Although in the model line of Nokia phones, push-button devices have always occupied a prominent place.  Well, today we‚Äôll talk about the phone under the name ‚ÄúNokia 300‚Äù, which has become one of the devices that combine a push-button solution with a touch. </p><h2>  Some characteristics </h2>

    <p>  The Nokia 300 Asha was placed in the mid-range category.  One of the features of the device is a screen with a diagonal of 2.4 inches, as well as a camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels.  She does not have an auto focus function on the subject.  It is possible to record video in the so-called VGA quality.  To connect a wired headset or computer headphones, a 3.5 mm standard jack is provided, there is a special slot for integrating an external drive.  Well, as a hardware filling, a processor is installed that works with a clock frequency of one gigahertz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The device comes in several colors on the mobile phone market.  Usually it is gray and black, but the device is also present in red design.  Well, as we see, the choice is not very rich.  Probably, initially instead of gray it was planned to release a phone in white design.  However, this happened more than once: when the white color did not settle down to the case and looked much worse on it than the other, the Finnish manufacturer made the appropriate decision.  Meanwhile, the release of the device in red made at least some variety. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Production material </h2>

    <p>  The phone case is completely made of some strange plastic.  "Why is it incomprehensible?"  - you may ask.  Everything is very simple.  The Nokia 300 phone seems to fit well in the hand, securely, at the same time, conveniently, without causing discomfort.  But this is only at first.  Immediately after the purchase of the device and its initial operation, it seems that everything is assembled simply perfectly.  Yes, perhaps partly it is.  But over time, you begin to notice that the plastic of which the back cover of the device is made is very, very thin.  Very often it bends inward.  You don‚Äôt need to press too hard, just enough to increase the pressure on the wall, and you will instantly see the results of the corresponding action. </p><h2>  Another controversial decision </h2>

    <p>  It is impossible to say unequivocally that the plastic insert, which accommodates the control buttons (and it is made in the form of a transverse shiny flat figure), has taken root in the design of the device.  For example, we can grasp at the discussion of this problem for the glossy gloss that was used to make the front panel.  It seems to sparkle under light.  You might even think fleetingly that this is not plastic at all, but the most real metal plate.  And at the same time, such a composition probably looks not so dignified, but really strange in the conditions in which the design of the device was developed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In general, this time the designers of the Finnish company were trying to make something up, but they went beyond the scope of authority.  And phone buyers will now have to pay for such an incorrect decision.  However, let's still not forget that the phone is not so expensive, so it‚Äôs not very correct to particularly complain about the mismatch of some appearance elements with expectations.  Probably, the Finnish manufacturer of mobile phones voted in favor of this decision by designers only because he wanted to present the device more expensive to potential buyers than it actually was. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  The dimensions for such a phone are very, very average.  You can even say that they are standard or typical for most devices of the same class or the same niche.  Well, now more specifically.  The height of the device is almost 113 (112.8) millimeters with a width of 49.5 and a thickness reaching 12.7 mm.  With a mass not even exceeding 85 grams, you can already begin to talk about what turned out to be a miniature brick.  This is what users often call this model of mobile phone.  At the same time, the device cannot be called a real shovel.  Yes, the phone in my hand, of course, is felt.  But not so much as to speak of him so.  If we talk about transporting the device, then it is convenient to do this with ordinary pockets on clothes.  Even if you put the device in jeans, you are unlikely to notice any discomfort when carrying it. </p><h2>  Front panel </h2>

    <p>  On the front side there is a shiny trim.  A small hole was made in it.  If you look closely, you can find a conversational speaker in it.  And the block of keys is already under the screen of the phone.  The buttons for sending a call, accepting it, and rejecting it are made of silver plastic.  Even though they are made in a narrow form, using the keys is quite convenient.  The left button is for sending a voice call, the right one interrupts it.  You can also turn off the phone using this button.  The central navigation key enables the user to open the text message typing menu when using absolutely any application on the phone. </p><h2>  Keyboard Details </h2><p>  In general, the keys are made soundly.  They are large in size.  Only the width of a single button is about one and a half centimeters.  Thus, we get a device that offers real comfort when exchanging text messages.  It is convenient and easy to type text; it is practically impossible to press the wrong key by chance.  The progress of the buttons is small.  Keystrokes are confirmed by a dull click, soft.  By the way, both the phone case and buttons are made of the same material.  This is a matte plastic. </p><h2>  central part </h2><p>  The keyboard block in this place is slightly raised.  This is done so that it is even more convenient for the phone owner to work with the keys, typing text messages, taking notes or printing small text excerpts for himself.  The symbols on the keys are painted in white.  Speech that designations are not visible on them, and can not be.  When they call you on the phone, the keypad will flash.  Thus, the keys play in parallel the role of an event indicator, which is made in a peculiar manner of the Finnish manufacturer. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  The Nokia 300, the sensor of which occupies most of the front panel, has three different ports on the upper end.  One of them is a charger socket.  It is called ‚Äúthin‚Äù, because the cable really has non-standard sizes today in this corresponding projection.  At the same time, there is a MicroUSB standard port on the top end, which is designed to synchronize the phone with a personal computer or laptop.  In principle, using it, it will be possible to charge the phone from the corresponding device, but it will be much slower than when using an ordinary electric network.  Well, the whole picture is completed by the 3.5 mm standard jack, which is present in this part of the device for connecting to it a wired stereo headset (including the one that is included in the delivery set), as well as the most ordinary computer headphones. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  Here we have a thin key, the purpose of which lies in adjusting the volume of the device.  The button has a fairly short stroke.  For ease of use, the engineers decided to divide it into two halves, but the situation only worsened.  As a result, we got a key with a minimum stroke, it is pressed very, very tight, which leads to inconvenience and discomfort when trying to turn down or turn up the volume.  After looking a little below, we can find an element that allows you to lock the screen.  However, an inverse symmetric action cannot be performed.  To remove the phone from the lock, you will first need to use this button, and then click on the touch screen of the Nokia 300 device, the price of which is currently almost four thousand rubles (to be more precise - 3 800). </p><h2>  Left side </h2><p>  On the opposite side there is a special mount in which you can pass the strap.  To remove the back cover, a recess is provided here.  This is what you need to use if you need to perform an operation, for example, with a battery. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  She made all of the same material.  Recall that it is matte plastic.  A camera can be found at the top left corner.  It has a resolution of 5 megapixels.  Below there are holes cut specifically for the main sound speaker.  Here, in principle, all that can be said about the location of the controls in the phone. </p><h2>  Comment </h2><p>  We remind readers that you can always find games on the Nokia 300 using the official website of the Finnish manufacturer.  Very often, device buyers are faced with one interesting and annoying problem that occurs in this model due to some design flaws.  The fact is that the screen sometimes stops responding to touch.  If the ‚ÄúNokia 300‚Äù does not have a sensor, just restart the phone to get started.  Work will have to stabilize.  If this does not happen, then you should probably contact the service center. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  So, what can customer reviews tell us who have purchased the phone model we are reviewing?  Among the advantages, users highlight the quality of the device‚Äôs communication.  In general, in the grocery ranks of the Finnish manufacturer it is difficult to find devices that would suffer from such a disadvantage.  Nevertheless, the call is not so good, you can miss it in a noisy environment.  There are no complaints about the vibrating alert, it is felt through the pocket. </p><p>  Buyers of the phone in their reviews call a good camera as a plus, which takes pictures in sufficient resolution.  They also have case material.  The keyboard is generally comfortable. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings can be identified primarily unstable operation of the touch screen.  Some time after the start of operation, it begins to behave at least strangely.  Freezes begin in the display, the sensor does not respond correctly to clicks.  At some point, he may stop responding altogether.  If this happens, restarting the phone saves, but over and over such operations are not very fun, right?  The second drawback is not very loud call.  But in general, the device was not bad. </p>
