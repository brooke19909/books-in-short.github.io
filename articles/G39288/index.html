    <p>  An example of such a successful association was the card "Corn" ("Euroset").  How to get it, you can find in the salons.  It allows you to store both your own and credit funds and is a convenient payment tool. </p><h2>  How and where to draw up a card </h2><p>  It must be emphasized: a credit card is only possible if the customer has a bonus of the same name.  We will briefly review the Euroset map of Corn.  How and where to issue? </p><p>  After payment of goods for a total amount of not less than three thousand rubles, a "Corn" card can be issued on the Euroset. </p><p>  Requirements for a potential card holder: </p><ul><li>  the presence of a passport; </li><li>  age must be more than 18 years; </li><li>  the presence of registration in the Russian Federation; </li><li>  the presence of one hundred rubles to transfer to the card. </li></ul><p>  If the client received such a card, then he can use it as a credit card, having passed all the required procedures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to draw up a card in the cabin </h2><p>  Once again, we note that, first of all, the Corn card is issued in the Euroset salon.  How to get borrowed funds as part of a bonus card?  Banks cooperating with Euroset within the framework of the proposed banking product provide an opportunity to receive credit funds.  In the cabin, the usual "Corn" bonus card can be converted into a credit card.  An application for obtaining borrowed funds is filled out, which is then considered by authorized specialists of the financial organization.  If the decision is positive, then the procedure for signing the contract occurs, then the money is transferred to the card. </p>

    <p>  The terms of the joint Euroset program with these organizations vary depending on the conditions under which a particular bank operates.  Consider the most common conditions for providing funds through these programs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Basic conditions: </p><ol><li>  <em>The amount of the loan is</em> almost the same for all banks: Home Credit - 10-50 thousand rubles, Russian Standard Bank - from twenty thousand rubles, Alfa Bank - 10-40 thousand rubles. </li><li>  <em>List of required documents.</em>  Here it is the same for all institutions - only a passport is provided. </li><li>  <em>Interest rate.</em>  The home loan is the most disadvantageous, it offers borrowed funds at 69.9%, Alfa-Bank has a lower percentage of 14%, which makes it the most advantageous option. </li><li>  <em>Loan terms.</em>  Here, Home Credit is already the most profitable; it offers borrowed funds for a period of six months to 36 months.  Alfa-Bank sets a period from six months to 8 months, Russian Standard - from six months to a year. </li></ol><p>  If the client wants to increase the credit card limit, he will have to fulfill the special conditions of partner banks.  Below is a list of these conditions, it was compiled on the basis of reviews of people who managed to increase the card limit. </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to provide a certificate confirming the income of the borrower. </li><li>  The presence of a salary card of the bank, which will be a potential lender. </li><li>  Availability of open contribution. </li><li>  Surety. </li><li>  The presence of liquid collateral. </li><li>  Positive credit history. </li></ol><p>  A positive credit history is the main condition for increasing the limit.  Also, the decision of a partner bank may be affected by the presence of a deposit, a salary account.  Surety of close relatives can rarely help, but banking institutions ‚Äúlove‚Äù when a potential borrower provides liquid collateral. </p><p>  Reviews on the "Corn" card are almost exclusively positive.  At first glance, it may seem impossible to accumulate enough funds for a good discount.  But if you are an active user of this card, namely, you regularly pay with it when purchasing goods via the Internet, then you will soon accumulate the necessary amount for the discount. </p>

    <p>  Also, card users noted that replenishing it is very convenient and simple.  After all, Euroset salons are now in almost every city.  They were also pleasantly surprised by the lack of a fee for annual card maintenance, as well as for its restoration in case of loss.  In addition, Corn card holders felt it was convenient to use the site with an operations tracking office.  So, using your account you can find out the current balance, the number of bonuses earned, as well as pay for various services (utilities, mobile services, etc.). </p><h2>  bonus program </h2><p>  If the client is not suitable under any conditions for the issuance of his loan funds, he can simply take advantage of the offer with the "Corn" card.  The Euroset bonus program allows you to return an amount of one to three percent of the value of the purchased goods when making a purchase.  The accumulated points can be spent on paying for goods at Euroset stores.  In addition, you can take advantage of discounts and promotions offered by bank partners. </p><h2>  Card replenishment through the salon </h2><p>  How is the Corn card replenished in Euroset stores?  How to get advice on this issue?  You need to contact any salon and transfer funds to the card using a cashier.  The client needs to have the card and passport with him. </p><h2>  How to withdraw cash </h2><p>  Does the Corn card allow you to withdraw cash in the Euroset salon?  How to get cash through an ATM? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Overview of the map Euroset corn how and where to issue" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32473/734581.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><p>  There are ways with which you can carry out operations with money on the card: </p><ul><li>  use payment terminals present in Euroset stores; </li><li>  through ATMs; </li><li>  at the offices of the partner bank that issued the loan. </li></ul><h2>  Card closing </h2><p>  Before closing the Corn card, it is necessary to check if there is a loan debt.  Then you must complete the following steps: </p><ul><li>  visit the bank that issued the loan with a request to terminate the relationship regarding the use of the card; </li><li>  expect termination of the contract and further closure of the account, as a rule, the deadline for these procedures is set to 45 days; </li><li>  get confirmation from the bank of the card closure and lack of debts. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The "Corn" ("Euroset") card was studied in detail above, and how to get it was also considered.  So, having studied all these subtleties, we can say that, like any product, it has its pros and cons. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  allows you to make purchases via the Internet; </li><li>  registration does not require much time; </li><li>  no commission is charged for its service; </li><li>  accrual of bonuses for shopping; </li><li>  there are many ways to replenish it (it has been examined in detail how to replenish the Corn card through the Euroset salon); </li><li>  free recovery in case of loss of a card; </li><li>  easy to use. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  It is not possible to make online purchases in all stores; </li><li>  cash withdrawals are charged; </li><li>  when replenishing a card with a third-party client, a commission is charged that is higher than the average value; </li><li>  with regular use of the card, it may become unusable; </li><li>  Transferring money from another card to the "Corn" card does not occur instantly. </li></ul><p>  Having appreciated all the pros and cons of this card, a person has the right to make a choice himself - to use it or choose another product. </p>
