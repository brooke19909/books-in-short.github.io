For example, in the Moscow Region there is a microfinance organization in the following settlements: </p><ul><li>  Volokolamsk; </li><li>  Voskresensk; </li><li>  Dmitrov; </li><li>  Dubna; </li><li>  Zelenograd; </li><li>  Istra; </li><li>  Kolomna; </li><li>  Sergiev Posad and others. </li></ul><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.925605" data-lng="37.997118" data-type="hybrid" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/7/2/3/8723.png"></div><p>  For example, in Shchelkovo, Moscow Region, the office address is: ul.  Talsinskaya, 2. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the offices of the company Centrofinance, the work schedule is usually very convenient.  For example, in Zelenograd, the office is open both on workdays and weekends.  From Monday to Saturday, you can apply for loans from 10 to 19 hours.  On Sunday, the work schedule is from 10 to 18 hours. </p><p>  If you have any questions, you can get answers to them when calling the Centrofinance hotline (calls and calls are not charged by mobile operators, that is, they are free in Russia).  A convenient online chat was also created for borrowers on the official website, a group was opened in the VKontakte social network.  In the group, by the way, you can ask various questions, leave feedback, learn about promotions in a timely manner, and participate in contests. </p><h2>  "Simple" loan </h2><p>  People who need a small sum of money to quickly solve their financial problems can apply for a “Simple” loan.  This is one of the microfinance services from Centrofinance.  The conditions for providing money are as follows: </p><ul><li>  the period during which you can use the money - from 1 to 32 days; </li><li>  the amount that can be issued to the borrower is from 1 thousand to 15 thousand rubles; </li><li>  interest rate - 1% per day. </li></ul><p>  Getting a “Simple” loan is easy enough.  Only a passport is required from the client and compliance with several requirements: </p><ul><li>  you must have at least 3 months work experience at the last place of work; </li><li>  the client must be in the age group of 21–75 years; </li><li>  the borrower must have a registration at the place of registration of the loan. </li></ul><p>  A “simple” loan can only be obtained in cash.  When approving an application, they are issued at the offices of Centrofinance.  Additionally, the borrower is required to be interviewed with the company manager. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="konturmos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of loans at &quot;Centrofinance&quot;" class="if uuid-2810437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2810437.jpg"></div><h2>  "Long-term" loan </h2><p>  When a company offered loans for a maximum of a month, many customers in their reviews of Centrofinance expressed their wish that they would like to see any long-term options in the list of offers.  "Centrofinance" decided to meet the needs of borrowers and developed a "Long-term" loan.  Today he has the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  term - from 3 to 6 months; </li><li>  allowable amount - from 10 thousand to 30 thousand rubles; </li><li>  interest rate - 0.77% per day. </li></ul><p>  A “long-term” loan is not available in all regions of Russia in which there are company offices.  You need to know in advance about the possibility of registration.  This can be done by visiting any nearby office.  If an employee of "Centrofinance" reports that it is possible to get a "Long-term" loan, then it is not necessary to immediately apply.  This can be done in a relaxed atmosphere at home by filling out a special online form on the official website of the microfinance network. </p><p>  When filling out an online application, the client must provide basic information about himself (surname, name and patronymic, date of birth, phone number) and confirm his agreement with all the rules and conditions of the site.  Some time after sending such information, an SMS message with a preliminary decision will be sent to the specified phone number.  Next, you will need to come to the office, because only in it can the corresponding contract be drawn up.  Only a passport is required from the borrower. </p><p>  The company "Centrofinance" warns that the maximum amount may not be issued to all people who want to receive it.  For example, new customers when they first contact the microfinance network can only rely on an amount in the amount of 10 thousand to 20 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Pension loan </h2><p>  Centrofinance has taken care of its retirement age clients.  A special loan product was created for them - the “Pension” loan.  To obtain it, only a passport and a pension certificate are required.  This microfinance service from Centrofinance is offered on attractive terms: </p><ul><li>  effective interest rate - from 0.65% per day; </li><li>  a possible period is from 2 weeks and almost up to a month (to be more precise, up to 32 days); </li><li>  affordable amount - from 5 thousand to 30 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  Preferential "Pension" loan is available to persons under the age of 75 years.  The process of registration of this loan product is as simple as possible, because it includes only 3 steps: </p><ul><li>  sending an online application from the official website of the company; </li><li>  receiving an SMS message with a positive decision and making a visit to the office with the prepared documents; </li><li>  Signing an agreement and receiving cash in cash. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that the “Pension” loan is available not only to people who have received a pension certificate by age or length of service.  A preferential loan product is also offered to persons with disabilities, combatants receiving a pension, and persons who have lost their breadwinner. </p><p>  If desired, pensioners and all those people who have access to the “Pension” loan can borrow money for a shorter period (less than 2 weeks).  However, in this case, you will have to lose such a favorable condition as the interest rate.  When applying for a short term loan, it is 1%, and not 0.65% per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wwfcu.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension loan at Centrofinance" class="if uuid-2810485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2810485.jpg"></div><h2>  Silver card </h2><p>  For customers who have earned the trust of the company, LLC MCC “Centrofinance” offers a silver card.  Its advantages: </p><ol><li>  The possibility of obtaining a more significant amount compared to that offered on a “Simple” loan is up to 20 thousand rubles.  The minimum allowable amount is 1 thousand rubles. </li><li>  More favorable interest rate.  It is 0.9% per day. </li><li>  Receiving funds in a convenient format.  At the first registration of a loan product, a plastic card is issued to the client with the loan amount already credited to it.  On subsequent appeals, the borrower can simply come to the office and present a card or name its number. </li></ol><p>  You cannot receive a silver card of your own accord, because it is included in a special loyalty program.  To participate in it, it is necessary to meet the conditions stipulated by the company (LLC “Centrofinance Group”).  Firstly, a silver card can be issued only to those borrowers who have never violated the terms of repayment.  Secondly, the total amount of loans under any 2 agreements should be at least 10 thousand rubles.  Thirdly, the total actual period of any closed contracts should be at least 30 days. </p><p>  To obtain a silver card, you do not need to apply to Centrofinance.  Subject to all established requirements, company employees independently offer this loan product.  Customers can either agree to issue it or refuse it. </p><h2>  Gold and Platinum Cards </h2><p>  A silver card is just one of the levels in the loyalty program.  The second level is a gold card.  She offers even more favorable loan terms.  The available amount is from 1 thousand to 30 thousand rubles, the period of use is from 1 to 35 days, and the interest rate is 0.8% per day. </p><p>  Gold card is available to some holders of a silver card.  Participants at a higher level of the loyalty program are people who often use the services of a microfinance organization and who repay loans in good faith, avoiding delays.  An application to “Centrofinance” for a gold card is not necessary.  It is only required to wait for the appropriate proposal from the company employees. </p><p>  Silver card holders should know that access to the golden card is open: </p><ul><li>  with a total amount of 5 under any contracts not less than 25 thousand rubles; </li><li>  with a total actual period of use of any closed contracts not less than 90 days. </li></ul><p>  The last level in the loyalty program is a platinum card.  It has the most privileged conditions.  The maximum possible amount is up to 50 thousand rubles, the term for using borrowed funds is up to 92 days, and the interest rate is 0.7% per day. </p><p>  Platinum card available: </p><ul><li>  Centrofinance clients with an impeccable reputation; </li><li>  after registration and return of loans in the amount of 25 thousand rubles; </li><li>  after receiving and repaying loans lasting more than 180 days. </li></ul><p>  At first glance, all the conditions that are set for loyalty program cards may seem complicated.  It is actually easy to achieve compliance with these requirements.  It is enough to regularly take loans from Centrofinance and repay them on time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zaim.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plastic cards from &quot;Centrofinance&quot;" class="if uuid-2810422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2810422.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of obtaining loans </h2><p>  A rate of 1% is considered basic.  It is offered to people choosing a “Simple” loan.  However, it can sometimes be different, which is confirmed by customer reviews of Centrofinance.  Firstly, in some regions of Russia the interest rate is set at 1.5% per day.  Secondly, often a microfinance company holds promotions to attract customers.  The minimum interest rate may be 0.5% per day. </p><p>  The microfinance network "Centrofinance" has age limits.  You cannot become a borrower immediately after adulthood.  The minimum age limit is 21 years and the maximum age is 75 years. </p><p>  Do I need to have an official job and do I need to confirm my income - questions that customers often ask.  Formal employment is not a prerequisite.  To obtain approval for the application, the borrower only needs experience at the last place of work.  Verify your income is not required.  No guarantors are also needed.  All information about the borrower that is required to make a decision on the approval of the loan, the company can independently obtain. </p><p>  A cause for concern for borrowers is often the credit history, because far from all people it is positive.  However, when contacting Centrofinance, you can simply forget about all delays that were in the past.  Even with a bad credit history, a company can approve a loan.  The decision for each client is taken individually. </p><p>  When arranging loans, the employees of Centrofinance offices offer customers financial protection (insurance).  It is optional.  It is made out at will.  The positive side of insurance is that with the help of it the borrower can protect himself and close relatives from problems in case of unforeseen circumstances.  For example, at death relatives will not have to pay debts.  All funds stipulated by the loan agreement will be paid by the insurance company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ksiegowosc.infor.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features of processing loans at &quot;Centrofinance&quot;" class="if uuid-2810462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2810462.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of repayment of loans </h2><p>  There are 3 ways to pay loans at Centrofinance.  You can return the money when you visit the office of the microfinance organization.  For those people who cannot do this due to lack of time or for any other reasons, there is a very convenient way to pay using a plastic card.  To make a payment, you need to go to your personal account.  To enter it you need to specify a phone number and password. </p><p>  Another way to repay a loan is to pay at any bank with the details of Centrofinance.  They are recommended to be specified either at the company’s offices or on the official website.  When choosing this method, it is recommended to deposit money under loan agreements in advance.  The bank can process the payment 3-5 days.  Customers making payments in advance exclude the possibility of delays. </p><p>  One of the advantages of applying for loans at Centrofinance is the possibility of extending the loan term.  The company is well aware that in life financial problems can arise suddenly.  For the convenience of customers, a renewal function was provided, according to which only interest on the use of funds can be paid.  The main loan amount will need to be returned later. </p><p>  If the client does not repay the loan on time and does not renew it, a delay arises.  The contract provides for penalties of 20% per annum of the outstanding principal amount.  The client, without paying money, spoils his credit history.  The company does not work with collectors, but it can appeal to the court.  The onset of such consequences can be prevented.  <span>A microfinance organization is</span> always ready to make concessions.  For clients who find themselves in a difficult life situation, Centrofinance offers installments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creditar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan repayment to &quot;Centrofinance&quot;" class="if uuid-2810491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2810491.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about "Centrofinance" </h2><p>  Firstly, it should be noted that this company is included in the register of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  She works in accordance with the law.  Loans are issued on transparent terms without any hidden fees.  People leave mostly positive reviews about Centrofinance.  Customers say, for example, that you can contact the company without fear.  These are not scammers. </p><p>  It pleases many customers that the company strives to make its services more interesting and profitable.  In "Centrofinance" there are various promotions for both beginners and regular customers.  People who applied for a loan for the first time are offered the first week without interest on condition that they borrow money for a period of 21 to 32 days.  Judging by the feedback on Centrofinance, for regular customers, there are the following promotions: </p><ol><li>  "For friends".  If the borrower brings a new client (acquaintance or friend) to the company, then both will be offered a reduced interest rate from 0.5% to 0.75% per day (it depends on the region). </li><li>  "Birthday".  You can participate in this promotion in the absence of a not yet closed loan agreement with the company.  You also need to be a bona fide payer and have an SMS message from the company.  It usually comes shortly before a birthday.  It reports that the company is specially prepared for such a significant holiday to issue a loan on favorable terms.  The interest rate is either 0.5% (in those offices in which the base rate is set at 1%), or 1% (in offices with a base rate of 1.5%). </li></ol><p>  The disadvantages of the company can only be attributed to the fact that it does not work in all regions of Russia.  In those regions of the country where “Centrofinance” is not functioning, people cannot arrange loans.  In other regions where there are offices of microfinance organizations, those who wish, too, can not apply.  There is one condition in Centrofinance.  Its essence - money in debt can be issued only if there is a residence permit in these regions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prokmlm-official.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about &quot;Centrofinance&quot;" class="if uuid-2810472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2810472.jpg"></div><p> «»       10 .    .       ,         .  «»  –       ,    ,      .       ,    ,   - . </p>
