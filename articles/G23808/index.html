Today we look at the device from the Finnish manufacturer - "Nokia 5250".  In general, the model can be called the logical result of the work of the company.  The device was created in order to compete in some ways with other touch devices.  Moreover, it was assumed that the smartphone will give odds to the Korean-made models.  Nokia managed to implement this or not, and we will try to find out during the article. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2>

    <p>  The 5250 Nokia has become a worthy alternative to devices based on a 2.8-inch screen.  Recall that the presence of such a display is typical for a large number of products included in the S60 lineup.  Of course, there are some differences.  For example, not only the Nokia 5250 product is characterized by the presence of a mirror substrate.  It is needed to stabilize the behavior of the screen in natural light. </p><p>  On the other hand, the decision to switch to 2.8-inch displays became quite logical.  Among the practical reasons - reducing costs, bringing the device closer to its Korean counterparts in its characteristics.  Meanwhile, Nokia 5250 is unlikely to compete successfully with the giants of the corresponding market.  First of all, we are talking about companies such as Samsung and LG.  But after all, real miracles sometimes happen in life.  And it remains to rely on the Finnish manufacturer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If Nokia is still able to catch up with the above suppliers of mobile (and not only) equipment, then it will bite off a fairly large piece of the pie.  In any case, we have no choice but to watch the struggle in this segment of smartphones.  By the way, it is still necessary to take into account internal competition.  Although Nokia 5250 models obviously have nothing to worry about: today it is <span>the cheapest phone of the</span> company equipped with a touch screen.  In general, the positioning of the device at this point becomes transparent and understandable. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  To argue that the screen size, in comparison with other models, is reduced, is simply impossible.  But you don‚Äôt need to be an outstanding scientist to understand that such a step requires a reduction in the dimensions of the device‚Äôs case.  In our case, the dimensions of the phone in all three planes are 150 by 50 by 14 millimeters.  In this case, the mass of the device does not exceed 106 grams. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Convenience </h2>

    <p>  The Nokia 5250, reviews of which you can find at the end of this article, lies comfortably in your hand.  It can be noted increased reliability.  Nevertheless, a similar step provoked an increase in the mass of the apparatus.  Only due to this, the engineers managed to achieve reliable retention of the device.  I would like to feel a slightly smaller smartphone in my hand, you can‚Äôt argue with that either. </p><p>  In addition to this, there are hardware delights.  So, it is easy to notice that the materials of which the device board is made are clearly not spared.  It, in comparison with similar elements of other devices, looks quite massive.  Unambiguously explaining such a move becomes simply impossible.  But in terms of convenience, the Nokia 5250, whose characteristics can be found in the article, will not please everyone, as, in principle, it was expected. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2>

    <p>  The device was assembled very, very tightly.  Even if the user grips the smartphone tightly in his hand, he is unlikely to be able to hear a creak or a crunch.  What can not be said, by the way, about some competitive devices.  The phone on this parameter is very different from them.  In general, the Nokia company knows a lot about the assembly of devices.  The possibility of backlash is minimized, although, of course, there is. </p><p>  The phone case is made of plastic.  But it should be noted that this material is used on practical grounds.  It is not smooth, but rough.  That is why you will not soon notice fingerprints or scratches.  On corrugated surfaces (which our model is equipped with) they appear extremely rarely. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  When buying a new device, users often resort to such a method as choosing a smartphone by parameters.  If you are a supporter of this method, then perhaps you will pass by this smartphone.  Is the device really different in its functionality from other products that occupy a niche in the corresponding segment?  Let's see what the smartphone owners think about it. </p><p>  Nokia 5250, the price of which is about three and a half thousand rubles, shows itself in terms of communication devices as a good device.  It demonstrates the high volume of a voice call, it is almost impossible to miss it even in the noisiest places.  However, there are some drawbacks in this regard.  With the progress of how the speaker volume increases, the sound quality of the melody will deteriorate in parallel.  In contrast, there is a weak vibrating alert.  Here it is easier to miss when finding the device in your pocket. </p><p>  Of course, at the present time there is absolutely no reason to buy a device for such a price.  Now on the smartphone market there are a sufficient number of devices that surpass this smartphone model in many characteristics.  The device can not boast of any super-original design.  But everyone is waiting for his own choice, and perhaps someone will like this smartphone. </p>
