Tourists reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Cyprus <span>Park Beach Hotel</span> 3 * <span>hotel</span> (Limassol) is an excellent budget "treshka" with the first-class European service, which is located near the sea, in a forest-park zone.  Tourists who come here are pleasantly surprised by the opportunity to combine high standards of relaxation with beautiful nature, clear sea and some elements of oriental luxury.  It would seem that you should not expect from this coastal hotel the exclusivity of a five-star resort like the MC Beach Park <span>Resort Hotel</span> in Turkey, but some tourists compare these two hotels, and it happens that they conclude in favor of a Cypriot hotel.  After all, the service of the Cypriot treshka is not inferior to the Quartet and even the Quintuple of neighboring countries.  And in this price category it is one of the best hotels in Limassol.  But you'd better draw your own conclusions. </p>

    <h2>  Limassol </h2><p>  This resort is considered one of the most fun on the island.  Yes, and it is located very well.  If you have a car, you will immediately understand all the benefits of the location of Limassol.  To any sights of the island from it is almost equal distance.  Closer to the city center, young people like to relax - there are night clubs and discos even here in winter.  And on the outskirts - romantic couples and families with children.  For young tourists, Limassol is a real paradise.  There are many attractions, an amusement park, as well as a water entertainment palace.  There is even a zoo, the only one on the island.  There are many tourists from Russia in Limassol, one might say more than in other areas of Cyprus.  Get here from the <span>airports of Larnaca</span> or Paphos.  This can be done by taxi, minibus or ferry.  The beaches at the resort are excellent - sandy or with small pebbles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mc beach park resort hotel" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1007906.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Park Beach Hotel 3 * (Limassol) is located almost in the forest, where pines and eucalyptus trees grow.  And this is the only thing that separates it from the magnificent sandy beach.  Such features make the hotel very attractive both for relaxation and for health improvement.  The resort center is only three kilometers away.  It is about forty minutes on foot.  If it is too hot and you do not want to go on your own, then buses and minibuses stop right next to the hotel.  Drive to the center for about ten minutes.  But it cannot be said that the hotel is completely divorced from civilization.  One has only to go beyond the territory, and you find yourself in the bustle of boutiques, shops, coastal taverns.  And the nearest Papas supermarket is ten minutes away.  Thus, the hotel is ideally located: on the one hand - city bustle, on the other - the measured calm of the park area.  From Larnaca Airport, get here for about forty minutes, no more. </p>
