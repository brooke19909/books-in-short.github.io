And if two years ago every fifth resident of Russia could afford to buy the latest model of the best mobile phone - the Apple iPhone, now everything has changed dramatically.  Now the domestic buyer, often sacrificing quality, acquires Chinese devices, which are of low cost.  Unfortunately, excellent work is also not necessary. </p><p>  However, what to do for those who still want to purchase a high-quality device, but at the same time not pay fabulous money?  There is a solution - the iPhone 6 is restored!  Svyaznoy is an official retailer of such gadgets.  They receive products directly from the manufacturer, so fakes are completely excluded. </p><p>  Currently, not everyone knows the difference between a restored phone and a new one.  This and other equally interesting points will be discussed in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refurbished iphone 6" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1570718.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <h2>  Briefly about iPhone 6 </h2><p>  Just two years ago, in 2014, a new gadget was introduced - iPhone 6. This is the brainchild of the famous Apple company.  This is not the first time that Yablochka has been surprising its customers.  Two modifications of the model were released: with the index 6 and 6 Plus.  They belong to the eighth generation of the popular phone.  Externally, gadgets are quite similar.  Both work on the iOS 8 platform. Their thickness is 7 mm.  But the screens are a little different.  On iPhone 6, it has a resolution of 1334 √ó 750 pixels (4.7 "), while the modification with the Plus index has a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 pix (5.5"), type - RetinaHD.  Accordingly, the devices differ in size: the first - 138.1 √ó 67 √ó 6.9 mm, the second - 158.1 √ó 77.8 √ó 7.1 mm.  Models are equipped with a proprietary processor - Apple A8.  What is unique is that used phones do not differ in characteristics from the new ones, provided that they were repaired at Apple service centers.  iPhone 6 restored externally exactly the same as the original. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6 refurbished connected" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1570742.jpg" width="507"></div>

Therefore, buyers want to know real reviews about this model.  It should be said right away that 90% of owners are completely satisfied with their acquisition.  The sensor works perfectly, high quality pictures and videos, good technical specifications.  The updated design immediately fell in love with everyone.  The rounded edges made a rather big smartphone in size quite neat in appearance. </p><p>  However, shortcomings were discovered.  Some iPhone 6 Plus devices had problems with body rigidity.  According to the company, there were no more than 10 such situations. However, competitors immediately took advantage of this, calling this model fragile and unreliable.  Of course, it was a simple factory marriage, which Apple employees quickly eliminated.  Therefore, acquiring the iPhone 6 Plus restored, you can not worry: such a problem will not arise. </p><p>  Another important point is that nickel was found in these devices.  This metal belongs to strong allergens.  It is capable of causing severe complications.  Therefore, people are advised to be extremely careful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple iphone 6 refurbished" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1570739.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Restored iPhone - what does it mean? </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the description of this model, you need to understand what the expression means: " <span>i</span> Phone 6 16Gb restored."  Since last year, such devices have filled store shelves.  Now let's look at the main points that will help to understand what these smartphones are. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Products referred to as ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù are certified.  What this means will be told a little later. </li><li>  The cost of such models differs significantly from the price tag of new ones and varies within 17,000 rubles. </li><li>  Appliance repair is done at Apple Authorized Service Centers. </li><li>  The refurbished iPhone 6 16Gb is packed in special boxes on which there is relevant information.  It is equipped with everything necessary (charger, USB-cable, headphones).  The serial number on the box and phone may not match.  Why?  Read below. </li><li>  During the repair, all parts, including the case, are replaced with new ones, therefore, as a result, a new device, which has passed all the necessary checks and tests, goes on sale. </li></ul><h2>  How to distinguish iPhone 6 from restored? </h2><p>  Many buyers care about the question: "What are the differences between the original and refurbished phones?"  Now the main criteria will be presented that will help to quickly determine the version of the smartphone. </p><ul><li>  <em>Serial number.</em>  All devices are sold in company boxes, which have a <span>serial number.</span>  It is also duplicated in the phone itself and on the case.  If the number in all three cases matches, then you have a new model.  However, there are inconsistencies.  This means that the machine is restored.  During the repair work, the manufacturer changes the case and other details.  The phone is also packed in another box. </li><li>  <em>Cost.</em>  As a rule, original Apple TM gadgets are sold at a high price (16Gb - about 37 thousand rubles, 64Gb - within 42 thousand rubles, 128Gb - 55 thousand rubles).  If it is significantly underestimated - this is the first bell in order for the buyer to think.  Refurbished phones cost a third cheaper, but sometimes there are some that cost less than 15,000 rubles.  As a rule, these devices are fake and do not have RosTest certification. </li><li>  <em>Warranty period.</em>  The manufacturer gives a guarantee for a restored period of only one year.  However, this is quite enough to check the phone‚Äôs performance.  Some sellers offer an extension of the warranty period by two years.  For this, a contract is drawn up and a small fee is charged.  If the phone is not purchased in a mobile phone salon, it is recommended to check with official suppliers whether the warranty applies specifically to this unit.  Such simple actions will help not become a victim of scammers. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Types of refurbished phones </h2><p>  Refurbished iPhone 6 can be of two types.  The first is factory-repaired.  That is, the device has been fully replaced parts, housing, battery.  All used items are original.  The kit includes branded headphones that are packaged in a special box.  Such models, before going to store shelves, are certified by RosTest.  It is she who is proof that the device was being repaired at an Apple service center. </p><p>  The second type includes telephones, which are usually repaired by Chinese firms.  They buy broken devices for almost nothing.  After carry out repairs using cheap parts.  From the original iPhone 6, only the motherboard and processor remain.  Such gadgets will not work for a long time. </p><h2>  How to distinguish a fake on a complete set? </h2><p>  If the restored iPhone 6 is certified by Apple, then the charger, headphones, cable will be only original.  Before buying, it is recommended to check the complete set.  Why is this necessary?  If the device is a Chinese fake, then the charger will be significantly different from the original.  It is also worth paying attention to the packaging of the headphones.  There is no company logo on it.  With the naked eye, another nuance is noticeable - the difference in font.  He printed on some elements much brighter than on the original models. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6 plus refurbished" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1570730.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Health Check </h2><p>  Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone 6, you need to check its performance.  This is necessary in order to immediately detect obvious defects. </p><p>  The main problem of this model is the speaker.  He is very quiet.  It will not be superfluous to immediately check the microphone volume.  To do this, you need to turn on the phone and insert a SIM card directly in the store and call any subscriber.  In this conversation, volume problems will be identified.  It is also recommended to pay attention to the screen.  The image should be clear.  You can take a couple of shots, whereby check the camera. </p><p>  Important: the outwardly restored iPhone 6 is like new, so there‚Äôs no point in looking for differences. </p><p>  This model is a functional smartphone equipped with a large number of different applications.  Sometimes it‚Äôs they who help to check the condition of the device.  For example, in Chinese fakes, the compass does not work.  His arrow rotates in an arbitrary order, without defining the cardinal points. </p><p>  It is worth considering that in such devices there are hidden defects (problems with the battery, spontaneous shutdown / inclusion, etc.).  In order to identify them, it takes time.  For this, the manufacturer gives a one-year warranty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to distinguish iphone 6 from restored" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1570724.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Backup copy </h2><p>  Many owners of TM TM smartphones are interested in how to restore a backup to iPhone 6. Despite the fact that these phones are reliable enough, a failure may occur.  In this case, the developers have provided options for quick recovery of existing data.  To do this, you must first create an iCloud backup.  You can save it both on the phone itself and on the PC.  To create a copy, you need to go to "Settings", find the iCloud item there.  It will have a submenu ‚ÄúStorage and copies‚Äù.  Having come into them, it is necessary to click "Create a copy".  After successful creation, you can proceed to the second stage.  It will depend on which phone, new or old, will undergo recovery.  Let's look at both options. </p><ol><li>  <em>Restoring a copy on a new device.</em>  When setting up your phone, you must use the option ‚ÄúRestore from iCloud copy‚Äù.  Before installation, you will need to log in to your account.  After starting the recovery process and wait for it to finish. </li><li>  <em>Restore a copy on an old phone.</em>  To do this, you need to reset the current settings.  You can do this by going to the following menu items: ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù, ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúReset‚Äù, ‚ÄúErase content and settings‚Äù.  The phone will ask for confirmation.  You must click "Yes" and wait until the device reboots.  After that, you can restore the backup in the same way as in the new phone (via iCloud). </li></ol>
