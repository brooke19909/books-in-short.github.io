    <p>  According to the FSSN for 2012, the group took 2nd place among Russian firms.  The Expert RA Agency has been assigned the highest reliability position.  Many Russians turn to this company for help. </p><h2>  Terms and price </h2><p>  To take out voluntary medical insurance from Sogaz, you need to know the conditions and programs of the company.  This determines the price of the policy.  The company works with corporate insurance.  The cost of the policy depends on the size of the company, the number of insured, selected programs and conditions. </p><p>  How much will Sogaz voluntary health insurance cost?  The price is determined by the types of services that are supposed to be performed.  The cost may vary in each region and from the number of people for 1 insurance.  For 1 service, you can insure up to 6 people.  If you select the ‚ÄúEconomy‚Äù program, then the price will be from 1500 rubles, and if ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù, then - 3500 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What affects the cost? </h2><p>  Voluntary insurance protects the health of the client.  But the price of a policy can be determined by several factors: </p><ol><li>  In each company, the cost of the document may vary.  Amounts are affected by status, reliability and scope of services.  It should be borne in mind that a lot of scammers work in this area, so before paying you need to check the activities of the company. </li><li>  All organizations have several programs that differ in cost.  The cheapest includes a minimum of services.  If any help is not included in the policy, then you will have to pay for these services yourself.  It‚Äôs not so easy to get payments, you need to go through an examination.  The most expensive equipment includes many services. </li><li>  Payment depends on the level of the clinic.  An insurance company usually has many partners of different statuses.  For example, if you choose a regular clinic, then even a wide range of services is provided at a bargain price. </li><li>  The price is affected by the list of services.  It may include examination, first aid and prescription of medicines.  Sometimes the list is supplemented by analysis, massage and acupuncture. </li><li>  The cost is influenced by the characteristics of a person: age, gender, nationality.  This is determined by the program. </li><li>  An important factor is the type of activity, for example, the risk of injury to an office employee is less than that of a builder. </li></ol><h2>  Services </h2><p>  To be sure of timely assistance, you must choose "Sogaz" - voluntary medical insurance.  The list of services in each case may be different.  The policy serves as protection against diseases and injuries.  For example, a company implements the Antiklesch program.  According to it, a person receives help in case of disability after a tick bite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  If narrow insurance is required, the Antiklesh program will be the best choice.  It is ideal for those who frequent the forest.  For urban residents, the service is unlikely to be useful.  The conditions are similar to the Econom program, only it has a narrowly targeted effect.  An insured event is disability or death. </p><p>  For customers, the product "Special" is available.  There is no freedom of choice for it.  Standard services are provided, and costs and payments are fixed.  Within the framework of the ‚ÄúUniversal‚Äù program, it is possible to modify the conditions and risks. </p><p>  Regular customers are offered discounts and bonuses.  Often a company holds bonus promotions for various programs.  All customer promotions are notified by phone.  This affects the price of the policy.  The minimum cost is set for children.  At an economical tariff with a minimum amount of 10 thousand rubles, the price of the policy will be 110 rubles.  If you select the maximum amount of 500 thousand rubles, you will have to pay 5.5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  For foreigners </h2><p>  Now there are no special programs for foreigners.  But in the future they are planned to be created, since many people from other countries come to Russia to work.  Today, all those products that are intended for citizens of the Russian Federation are available to foreigners. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  You can insure up to 6 people with Sogaz-honey.  <span>Voluntary health insurance</span> involves a policy for the whole family.  A discount is available to customers during the extension of the contract.  There is no separate program for children.  But there is a product "Universal" with which you can choose a specific list of services for a particular person. </p>
