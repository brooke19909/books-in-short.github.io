Even though every day you have to go on a harsh job, but once or twice a year you can allow yourself to relax for good and completely relax.  It is for this reason that you need to plan your vacation in advance, and choose a hotel carefully. </p><p>  To help conscious travelers - all kinds of sites where you can get acquainted with genuine reviews of vacationers and make a good choice.  If you plan to go abroad, then you can consider Turkey as one of the budget options.  The climate there is subtropical, akin to Sochi or Crimea, the prices can also be quite compared.  In May, you can already swim, especially if you choose the Mediterranean coast as a vacation spot.  This post will be about the Club Ares Hotel, located in Kemer, Turkey. </p>

    <h2>  What to expect </h2><p>  Before telling about what awaits you in the Ares Club Hotel room and restaurant, a few words about the institution itself - so that there are no unnecessary expectations and further disappointments.  So, this hotel has three stars, but their status is not certified.  Therefore, do not expect three-star standards if you are a seasoned tourist.  On the other hand, this establishment can be easily classified as a three-star hotel.  Club Ares is ideal for those who are not going to study the interior and the quality of cleaning with a magnifying glass, demanding appreciation of the taste of the served dishes, and who do not expect anything grand from this place. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If your goal is to travel along the Mediterranean coast, explore along and across Kemer, Ares Club is what you need.  A cozy room with simple furnishings, unlimited edible food, good location ... What else is needed for an active pastime?  And now all this can offer its guests Club Ares.  Reviews about this hotel are mostly positive.  Let's figure out why. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  In Turkish hotels, unlike Russian, you can check in at 12 noon.  But <span>do not worry</span> if you will be delivered to the hotel earlier - in any case, you will be populated and not taken too much for an early check-in.  Regarding the language, you should not worry at all - you will not need either Turkish or even English.  Kemer is partly similar to the Crimean Yalta, only smaller, where everyone is fluent in Russian. </p><p>  If the hotel has several free rooms upon arrival, you will be asked to look at them so that you can choose your favorite.  In this case, it is best to focus on the sunny side, otherwise you risk all your rest in raw clothes.  Internet is present, but this service at Ares Club Hotel costs five dollars for the whole vacation, and the connection is very mediocre - in some rooms the Internet doesn‚Äôt catch at all. </p><p>  Holiday Club Ares also has a shallow pool with sun loungers.  In the summer season, it makes sense to take them early, since not all vacationers go to the beach. </p><h2>  Interior </h2><p>  Hotel Ares rooms will not impress you with luxury, but you are unlikely to expect this.  In the room you will find two beds or a combined one of the two, a table, a mirror, a minibar, a paid safe, and a TV that properly displays all Turkish channels.  A few words about cleanliness.  The linen will be clean, you will not find insects, but the maids are cleaned every two days without a tip or requests from you.  People who have already stayed at Ares say that if you leave a dollar on the bed, then all towels and bed linen will change, and swans will be rolled up on the bed.  And one moment.  Do not forget about the hotel rule, which applies worldwide: if you want towels to be changed, they should be left on the floor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Regarding cleaning, the reviews vary: some vacationers praise the economic service of the institution, others not so much.  There is a sign in the room with a request to get out, and so you are guaranteed to be ‚Äúcleaned up‚Äù, you can hang it out after leaving the room. </p><h2>  Dining at Club Ares </h2><p>  Reviews about the cuisine of this institution are quite positive - unless, of course, you are waiting for lobsters with <span>oyster sauce</span> or French bouillabaisse soup.  For breakfast, you will be offered boiled eggs, quite acceptable sausages to taste, several types of cereal and milk.  Lunch and dinner will delight you with an abundance of vegetables, all kinds of greens (more than ten types), various sauces with which you can abundantly dress the vegetables and greens mentioned.  As for meat dishes, wait for stewed or fried chicken, soy cutlets - however, according to tourists, it‚Äôs quite edible.  For dinner, fish can also be served. </p>

    <p>  Sweets are served in the evening, very richly saturated with honey and similar to baklava.  But there are practically no fruits on the table - you will have to be content with cut slices of apples and oranges. </p><p>  Summarizing, we can say that unpretentious guests will definitely not stay hungry, but ‚Äúmeat eaters‚Äù and people who are more demanding can visit cafes and restaurants, which are more than enough in the vicinity of Club Ares. </p>

    <h2>  Bar </h2><p>  Of course, this question cannot be ignored.  So, what is poured and how much?  The bar is open from 10 am to 10 pm nominally, but at 21.30 it closes.  During lunch and dinner, the establishment is open, but the bartender himself helps the waiters, so you will not be treated to alcohol.  There is no beer, but white and red wine, gin, and vodka are available. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Does Ares Club have its own beach?  Turkey in general and the Mediterranean coast in particular are good because there are no paid beaches.  Therefore, if the hotel does not have its own piece of coast, you can stay for free on any beach - on your towel or for 2-3 dollars on a sun lounger.  Club Ares has its own seating area.  The beach is sandy (while most of them are pebble in Kemer), however, according to tourists, it is inconvenient, and without a shuttle you can walk to it for a long time.  Therefore, you can not be limited only to this coast, but choose any corner to your liking.  The sea is very clean at any time of the year, in May the water warms up well, and you can swim until October. </p><p>  On the private beach of the hotel you can use a sun lounger and an umbrella. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Kemer is not a large city, and therefore almost all establishments are located almost within walking distance.  If you want to purchase any of the products, you can visit the market or the Migros store.  If you came not only to drink, eat and wallow on the beach, but also to travel, then at your service are travel agencies Maskveltur and HiroTur, the points of which are located within a five-minute walk.  These tour operators will offer tours of equal cost and quality, and only Russian-speaking guides work in the team. </p>

    <p>  Where to go while in Kemer?  You will explore the town in two to three days, and most likely you will quickly get bored of the cozy cobbled streets.  Experienced travelers recommend: go on an excursion to Demre, to Mount Chimera, to <span>shopping in Antalya</span> or to swim in a paradise bay in the neighboring village of Camyuva.  You can and even need to rent a car - rental is inexpensive, but you can see much more.  At first, the movement will seem somewhat chaotic to you, as if everyone is going wherever he wants, but you will quickly get used to it, no matter how experienced the driver. </p><p>  Many are wondering if Kemer has nightlife.  Since spring, three clubs have been operating every night, the most famous of which is Aura.  At night, guest stars constantly perform, including representatives of Russian pop music. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Ares Club is a hotel for discerning travelers who need more than a place to relax, but emotions and impressions from exploring new places.  Judging by the reviews of the guests, in the institution you can comfortably spend your vacation for more than a moderate fee.  What can be guaranteed for sure - you won‚Äôt stay hungry, you will sleep on clean linen with home comfort.  But do not expect a holiday of life.  According to people vacationing at the Ares Club, this is not exactly the place that will surprise you with luxury and rich opportunities for hanging out. </p>
