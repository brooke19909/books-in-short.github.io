    <p>  Each major metropolis is divided into many areas: central, fashionable, elite, sleeping.  Thanks to the name, it immediately becomes clear to everyone what is located there.  For example, a sleeping area appeared when housing in the city became scarce, and a decision was made to build multi-apartment buildings away from the financial center.  People who received housing in this place were forced to get up early and get to work for a long time, and return late in the evening.  Most spent most of their lives traveling from home to work and back.  It just so happened that they were only sleeping in the apartment.  Hence the name came from. </p><p>  At first, the sleeping area was not equipped with a sufficient amount of infrastructure, or entertainment facilities, or retail outlets.  All offices and enterprises were far away.  Among the indisputable advantages of this area is the low cost of housing.  For many visitors from the hinterland this is a real chance to gain a foothold in a large city.  Also, people like local landscapes, a large number of parks for walking with children, and the lack of an intensive flow of transport, as in the central part of the city.  Here you can feel like a resident of a small quiet town. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Fortunately for the townspeople, the sleeping areas of Moscow have changed significantly in recent years.  Large amounts of money are invested in the development of local infrastructure, the revival of old buildings and cultural objects.  Strogino, Yasenevo and Troparevo-Nikulino were recognized as the most promising among the rest.  The specialists of the company, which issued such a verdict, evaluated applicants according to several criteria: the number of green spaces, entertainment facilities, the availability of plans for the future development of the area.  But the most expensive sleeping area was called Krylatskoye.  You can buy housing here on average for 20 million rubles.  People are attracted by green parks, which occupy a third of the entire area, and well-developed infrastructure in this place.  Also in special demand are apartments in luxury residential complexes, of which there are many. </p>

    <p>  The sleeping area has retained its name, but not the essence.  Now you can not only spend the night in it, but also purchase the necessary goods, visit an entertainment club, go to a salon or dine in a restaurant.  This is a full-fledged place not only for life, but also for relaxation.  Shops in residential areas grow like mushrooms after the rain: food supermarkets, shopping malls.  Now you do not need to drive far from home to make the necessary purchases.  Very often, such establishments are located directly in residential buildings.  Perhaps this is somewhat uncomfortable for residents of lower floors, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of other comforts. </p><p>  What will the sleeping area turn into in the end?  The answer is simple: it will be a comfortable and environmentally friendly corner for living with a good infrastructure.  Does this mean that he will lose his status?  Partially, because it will obviously not be a place only for an overnight stay.  New areas are coming in, which are built up by high-rise buildings and become really sleeping. </p>
