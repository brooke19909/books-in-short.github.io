  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Globex Bank: reviews of employees and customers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Globex is a major metropolitan bank, which was founded in 1992.  The main founder of the credit institution was Rosgosstrakh.  During the 2008 crisis, there was a massive <span>outflow of capital from</span> large companies and individuals.  The bank was on the verge of bankruptcy, so its capitalization fell sharply.  Vnesheconombank overbought a financial credit organization and became the sole owner.  In 2012, the National Trade Bank was merged with a credit institution. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Today, Globex Bank is a part of Vnesheconombank's group and has a strong position in the credit market.  The Bank has its own network of branches located in 8 regions of the country.  The main office of the credit organization is located in Moscow.  The financial crisis of 2008 created the prerequisites for the fact that Globex Bank became one of the first sanitized organizations, the salvation of which cost the state 80 billion rubles. </p><h2>  Financial difficulties </h2><p>  The unbalanced credit policy of the bank has led to serious financial problems.  Almost all loans were directed to transactions with real estate.  The credit institution has repeatedly intended to reduce the volume of non-core assets, but this could not be done.  As a result, a conflict of interest occurred, since 100% of the loan portfolio accounted for the financing of objects that belonged to the owner of the credit organization.  Globex Bank allowed an excessive concentration of risk on its debtors; the remaining 6 borrowers accounted for 100% of the loan portfolio of the credit institution.  The assumed obligations and risks exceeded all the possibilities of the capital base, which acquired negative values.  Globex ceased to comply with the standards established by the Central Bank, since the risks from investments significantly exceeded the bank's capital base.  In this regard, there was a decrease in the financial performance of Globex Bank.  The revocation of the license in 2017, which many financial market experts spoke about, did not happen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.beckgallery.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank financial problems" class="if uuid-2670633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670633.jpg"></div><p>  Management had to file financial statements with misstated results.  <span>The Central Bank of Russia</span> has repeatedly demanded that the structure of assets of a credit institution be brought in line.  The main problem of Globex Bank was that the credit institution attracted deposits and placed them for the implementation of its own projects.  The bank also actively used the funds of non-state pension funds.  The management of the credit organization operated on the fact that all actions were performed within the framework of the law, since the legislation in the field of pension regulation was rather weak.  Vnesheconombank, which outbid Globex, created an effective control system and sound financial policy, which allowed to bring the credit organization to a new level.  Today, the credit institution is operating as usual, despite the fact that many spoke about the revocation of the license in 2017. </p><h2>  The main activities </h2><p>  The main activity of Globex Bank is lending.  Customers can also use the following services: </p><ul><li>  acquiring </li><li>  provision of express guarantees; </li><li>  placement of free cash; </li><li>  currency exchange operations; </li><li>  accounts receivable financing; </li><li>  rental of safe deposit boxes; </li><li>  overdraft; </li><li>  <span>salary projects</span> ; </li><li>  factoring services; </li><li>  operations with securities; </li><li>  currency exchange. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.tutorialspoint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stable bank" class="if uuid-2670642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670642.jpg"></div><p>  Globex Bank has launched a website where customers can choose the most convenient service program.  He also developed a special loyalty program for his customers who are owners of plastic and salary cards.  Wealthy clients can take advantage of trust management strategies from a partner of the bank <span>UK TKB Investment Partners.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  In order to form an objective idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe activities of this credit institution, you should familiarize yourself with customer reviews.  Globex Bank reviews are diametrically opposed, since there are negative and positive comments on the specifics of the activity of this credit organization.  Many note that the financial institution has an outdated system for protecting personal data, so unauthorized persons can gain access to clients' funds.  Negative reviews about Globex Bank indicate that a credit institution can unilaterally write off funds from an account in favor of government agencies without notice of the transaction to the account holder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.vanillaforums.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer reviews" class="if uuid-2670644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670644.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Customers also talk about how to deposit money and interest on it only at the branch in which the contract was drawn up.</span>  <span>Therefore, customers can perform deposit operations only at a specific bank branch, even in Moscow.</span>  Globex <span>Bank</span> receives mostly negative feedback on deposits because customers cannot receive cash and accrued interest.  <span>Among the positive aspects, customers distinguish the operational work of specialists and the friendly staff of the bank.</span>  <span>Also, some reviews of Globex Bank note good conditions for the placement of foreign currency deposits.</span> </p><h2>  Employee Reviews </h2><p>  Negative reviews of employees indicate that the bank does not provide the opportunity for development and further career growth.  Many reviews of Globex Bank report that bureaucracy is flourishing in the organization, and the team lacks cohesion and integrity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="managementjournals.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best solution to overcome the crisis" class="if uuid-2670638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670638.jpg"></div><p>  Employees talk about non-compliance with labor laws by the employer, because they constantly have to stay at the processing facilities, which are not paid for in the future.  Some openly talk about the lack of career growth within the Globex Bank.  There are positive reviews of employees, which note a decent salary and a loyal attitude on the part of management.  Former bank employees say that the company has developed a competent system of material motivation. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  The credit organization Globex has implemented many successful projects and special programs that are in demand among legal entities and individuals.  The bank offers an individual approach to each client. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.business-standard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank financial difficulties" class="if uuid-2670618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2670618.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the financial condition of the bank was undermined, the credit structure is actively developing and is steadily increasing its technical, personnel and financial potential.  Today, the bank is focused on building long-term relationships with its customers.  Therefore, Globex has a strong position in the financial market. </p>
