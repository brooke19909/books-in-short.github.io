    <h2>  Who is eligible? </h2><p>  You still do not know what you can rent out?  Before you think about this issue, you need to figure out who, in principle, has such a right.  Not everyone is given the opportunity to receive passive income in this way.  The fact is that the rental of real estate or property for rent is carried out by: </p><ul><li>  Owners of certain objects. </li><li>  State (in the case of municipal property). </li><li>  Intermediaries (realtors, real estate agencies). </li></ul><p>  It turns out that only the owner of a property, as well as proxies have the right to lease certain objects.  It is an obvious fact.  But what makes it possible to receive passive income? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Apartment </h2><p>  You can rent an apartment <span>.</span>  <span>This is the</span> most common scenario.  It quite often helps people in different countries make a profit to one degree or another.  The procedure for concluding a tenancy agreement is usually carried out with the participation of real estate agencies.  Or personally the owner of the apartment.  It can be both an individual and a state.  It is best to rent an apartment officially.  Yes, then you will have to give 13% of your profits to the country.  But at the same time, the landlord and tenant will have rights and obligations.  Making such an operation is not as difficult as it seems. </p><h2>  Making an apartment for rent </h2><p>  Can I rent an apartment?  Yes.  This, as already mentioned, is the most common scenario in different countries.  Rented housing is a unique <span>source of passive income.</span>  Making a lease for an apartment is not so difficult.  It has already been mentioned that a person can bring an idea to life either by contacting a real estate agency, or on his own.  But for the last scenario, you will have to pay a visit to a notary.  The contract of employment is executed only in this way.  What documents may be required?  The following papers are distinguished among them (regardless of the method of renting the apartment): </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Documents on property rights to real estate. </li><li>  Lease / hiring agreement with detailed conditions. </li><li>  Identity cards of the parties. </li><li>  Extract from the Housing Office from the personal account. </li></ol><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that there are two types of contract: rental and hire.  The second option is suitable for cases when the apartment is rented to an individual.  Mandatory registration is not required.  But a direct lease agreement is subject to registration if it is concluded for more than 12 months.  Signed at the conclusion of an agreement with legal entities. </p>

    <h2>  Room </h2><p>  What can I rent?  The next scenario is renting out part of the apartment.  Or rather, the room.  A common way to make small profits.  The procedure for drawing up the relevant contract is similar to the previously defined action algorithm.  It is only necessary to register in the agreement which room they are renting. </p><p>  If there are several owners in the apartment, in addition to the previously listed list of securities, it is necessary to report the consent of all people to the transaction.  But when the owner has one apartment, then renting a room is not such a big problem.  Profits from such a source of passive income are less than from renting an apartment.  But he does have a place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Land </h2><p>  Is it possible to lease a land plot?  Or part of it, for example?  This issue also often worries owners.  For example, a house was built, and there is a small plot nearby.  Can I pass it?  Yes.  There are no special restrictions on this subject.  It is recommended to immediately decide whether the entire plot is planned to be commissioned or only part of it.  The complexity of the conclusion of the agreement, as well as the text of the contract, will depend on this.  For legal entities, this feature is extremely important. </p><p>  If a person does not act through realtors or relevant agencies, then he will have to sign an agreement with a notary without fail.  Otherwise, the transaction may be declared invalid.  And this is important to understand.  Special problems may arise if the land plot has several owners.  However, a similar picture arises when renting any property.  Additionally, it will be necessary to obtain the consent of the remaining owners to carry out the transaction.  Without these documents, the lease or rental agreement will be invalidated. </p>

    <h2>  Not housing </h2><p>  You can rent a room that is not residential.  For example, a basement, pantry, utility room.  This is a less common scenario, especially among those who live in apartment buildings.  But this is only if the lessor is an individual.  In addition, non-residential premises such as offices are for rent.  Just such situations are found in everyday life constantly.  It should be noted that in any of the transactions under consideration, citizens will have to pay income tax.  At the moment, it is 13%.  This is a required item for every taxpayer. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear that you can rent non-residential premises.  It is not as difficult as it seems.  The algorithm of actions for the owner of the property will be exactly the same as in all other cases.  It is enough to collect a similar package of documents.  Only the certificate of ownership of a particular property changes.  Then you should conclude a lease / rental agreement in the prescribed manner.  We will talk about all the features of this process, regardless of the property being rented out. </p><h2>  House / Cottage </h2><p>  Is it possible to lease a plot?  Yes, especially if the owner of the property is one.  But what other objects can be considered by a citizen?  For example, at home or cottages.  You can also rent them out if you wish.  In practice, this is quite difficult.  And individuals rarely deal with such cases.  Typically, houses and summer cottages are rented along with land by the city administration.  But ordinary property owners have the right to do so. </p><p>  Is it possible to lease a land plot, but at the same time not to rent the house located on it?  Yes, this is also possible.  But only in the case when the contract indicates the specific territory to be surrendered.  If there is a place on the site exclusively under the house, then you will have to specify the structure in the agreement. </p>

    <h2>  Other </h2><p>  What can I rent?  In fact, as already mentioned, almost all property can be rented.  Accordingly, rent, for example.  If you do not take into account real estate, you can still identify a lot of ideas regarding this question.  Among the most common rental objects are: clothes (mainly suits and dresses), garages, boats, bicycles, sports equipment, utensils, furniture, appliances, construction equipment, books, pets (for example, for promotions). </p><p>  This is not all that you can rent.  The list goes on and on.  In the modern world, it is limited mainly by the imagination of the owner.  And this must be taken into account.  Only after receiving money from the tenants, the owner of the leased property may have problems. </p>

    <h2>  Underwater rocks </h2><p>  It's about taxes.  It has already been said that with each transaction 13% of the profit will have to be paid.  It would seem that the problems end there.  However, not everything is as simple as it seems.  The fact is that in Russia there is such a thing as <span>illegal entrepreneurial activity.</span>  This is a systematic profit from the same occupations.  True, in order for criminal liability to occur, the income must total 1,500,000 rubles.  Therefore, up to this point, it is possible to rent this or that property without problems. </p><p>  What's next?  Much depends on the type of rental property.  To pay taxes and sleep peacefully, some recommend opening an IP.  And choose STS.  Then as taxes per year will have to give 6% of the profits.  Legally and safely.  In some cases, it is recommended to buy a patent for this type of activity.  In Russia at the moment, it is proposed to all citizens who rent housing or property to work under the <span>patent taxation system.</span>  How to proceed?  It is up to the citizen to decide.  But in any case, tax must be paid.  Especially when it comes to renting out offices, as well as working with legal entities. </p>
