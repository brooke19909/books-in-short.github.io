Despite the fact that its mass production began a long time ago, it is still actively used in many countries.  It is indispensable not only in military transport, but also in civil aviation.  There are many modifications of the An-26.  The plane received the nickname "Ugly Duckling." </p><h2>  Creature </h2><p>  After the Second World War, the USSR badly needed an airplane capable of fully satisfying the needs of not only the Ministry of Defense, but also civil aviation.  In the middle of the 20th century, the country's leadership decided to begin its creation. </p>

    <p>  This work was entrusted to the Antonov Design Bureau, which had rich experience in the design of transport aircraft.  The corresponding decree was signed in 1957, after which the creation of the An-26 began.  The aircraft made its first flight in 1969, and already in 1973, it was put into operation in the USSR. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Due to the many unique design solutions used in its creation, its characteristics, at the time of commissioning, were first-class.  An-26 aircraft, the detailed technical description of which was much superior to similar aircraft. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An-26 airplane, technical specifications: </p><ol><li>  Crew: 5 people. </li><li>  Payload: 5.6 tons. </li><li>  Normal take-off weight: 23 tons. </li><li>  Maximum take-off weight: 24 tons. </li><li>  Amount of fuel in internal tanks: 7.0 tons. </li></ol><p>  Number of passengers: 38 military personnel, or 30 paratroopers, or, in the sanitary version, 24 wounded on a stretcher. </p>

    <p>  In its fuselage there is one entrance and four emergency doors.  In addition, there is an operational and cargo hatch.  For better sealing of the An-26 cabins, doors and hatches, special sealant and a rubber profile are used. </p><p>  The aircraft skin is made of duralumin sheets, the thickness of which is from 0.8 to 1.8 mm.  Their fastening is done using electric welding, special glue or rivets. </p><h2>  Wing </h2><p>  An-26 has a free-standing, highly located wing of a rectangular shape.  It includes a center section, a detachable and a middle part.  Their docking is performed using butt squares, connector profiles and fittings. </p><p>  By its design, the An-26 wing (the photo of the aircraft confirms this completely), belongs to the caisson type and includes stringers, skin and 23 ribs.  There is heating on the toes of the wing, which prevents its icing.  The thickness of the skin is different depending on the site.  On the rear parts there is a thrust control ailerons and flaps. </p><h2>  Stabilizer and elevator </h2><p>  The An-26 stabilizer includes two consoles, each of which has a tail section, a toe, an end fairing, and a lower and upper panel.  Fastening to the casing of the stringers is done using special electric welding, and they are simply glued to the side members and ribs.  The stabilizer is connected to the fuselage with fittings and bolts. </p>

    <p>  Trimmers are installed on each part of the An-26 elevator, and they are controlled by moving the steering wheel away from you or towards yourself.  Due to the fact that control is duplicated and can be carried out by both pilots, the reliability of the aircraft increases.  The elevator is equipped with an autopilot, which allows pilots to relax during the flight.  You can control the elevators manually after the autopilot is turned off. </p><h2>  Chassis </h2><p>  <span>The landing gear</span> consists of one front and two main legs.  The latter are located in the engine nacelles and, after takeoff, are cleaned in special compartments.  Each of the main legs has disc brakes and two wheels equipped with inertial sensors. </p><p>  Cleaning and release of the aircraft landing gear is due to the presence of hydraulic power cylinders.  In the event of a malfunction, the release can be done manually, due to the headwind and own weight. </p><h2>  Power point </h2><p>  An-26 is equipped with two <span>turboprop engines,</span> each with a capacity of 2829 horsepower.  They are installed in gondolas located on the center section.  Engines are attached to the farm using a frame. </p>

In addition, it allows you to power the aircraft while stationary or when the generators fail. </p><p>  It is also indispensable in case of failure of the main engines.  Its presence allows you to reduce many of the risks that An-26 aircraft can accompany in flight.  The maintenance manual provides comprehensive information on the benefits of the tail engine. </p><h2>  Coloring </h2><p>  All An-26s that were part of the USSR Air Force were gray.  Aircraft used in civil aviation were painted in the colors of Aeroflot.  In modern Russia, civilian An-26s (you can see the airplane photo in the article) are color-coded depending on the wishes of the company that owns them.  These aircraft, which are operated abroad, are most often camouflaged. </p>
