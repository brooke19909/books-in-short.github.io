It is always sunny and warm enough, and the sea is simply gorgeous - what else is needed for an unforgettable vacation away from the hustle and bustle of civilization?  Even the rainy season, which lasts from April to October, does not scare potential tourists.  If you are a nature lover, want to find yourself in a paradise with white sand, crystal clear sea water and magnificent palm trees, you should definitely choose the island of Phuket for your trip.  Fly to it a little longer than to the most popular Thai resort - Pattaya, but it's really worth it.  The Baramee Resortel 3 * hotel is quite often offered to Russians by leading tourist operators.  How comfortable is this option, what can reviews of real tourists and vacationers say about it? </p>

    <h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  Before the review, I want to say a few words about the specifics of local hotels.  All <span>beaches of the coast</span> are municipal, that is, public.  It is foolish to assume that you will find a hotel located on the first coastline, as, for example, in Turkey.  Most often it is located 500-1000 m from the sea, which does not make it less comfortable.  Most often, breakfast is included in the price, and its variety and quality depends on the class of the hotel.  Well, of course, choosing such an exotic place for yourself, you need to be prepared for insects and rare animals that can become uninvited guests in your room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hotels in Thailand, Phuket in particular, for the most part can not boast of impeccable interior.  Quite often, tourists see old furniture, poor-quality plumbing - this is the norm here.  In principle, everything works, the furniture is functional and comfortable, so the rest will definitely not be spoiled.  Of course, you can pay attention to luxury hotels, but the cost of living in them will be much higher.  If you do not have such an amount, pay attention to the 3-star hotels - they often fully correspond to their price. </p><h2>  About Baramee Resortel 3 * </h2><p>  Hotel Baramee Resortel 3 * is a good option for tourists and vacationers who prefer to save money on housing so that there are more funds for excursions and other interesting things.  The administration offers visitors to stay in large enough and comfortable rooms with views of the coast.  The hotel is small, only 51 rooms, but precisely because of this, it can offer first-class service.  Baramee Resortel managed to get a lot of positive reviews, gaining a good rating on the most popular sites and tourist portals. </p><p>  The hotel was open for first visitors and vacationers for a long time, no repairs were made, nevertheless, many consider this place to be ideal for beach and tourist vacations.  You will find friendly and friendly staff, comfortable rooms and impeccable service. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  If you are primarily guided by its location when choosing a hotel, you will definitely like Baramee Resortel 3 *.  Reviews of tourists and vacationers emphasize that the hotel is located near the coast in a picturesque area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can have lunch and dinner at local restaurants - there are plenty of them.  Across the road there is a quite popular place among tourists where you can taste dishes of national cuisine - they cook here amazingly.  In principle, there are no food problems in Phuket - not only national Asian cuisine is represented here, but also European, and even Russian.  You can purchase fruits and dairy products at the nearest store. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Some tourists pay little attention to rooms, their area and interior, believing that on vacation a room is needed exclusively for sleeping.  But we want to dispel the prevailing stereotypes and offer a great hotel with amazing rooms.  Baramee Resortel 3 * (Thailand, Phuket) offers premises of several categories.  Each has a balcony with stunning views of the coast - you can enjoy the sunsets and meet the sunrises, enjoy the sound of the surf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baramee Resortel 3 reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/1479955.jpg" width="600"></div>  If we touch on the topic of shortcomings, I would like to mention what some tourists and vacationers complained about, namely, the proximity of rooms and balconies with respect to each other.  Agree, if the neighboring balcony is just a meter away from yours, you definitely won‚Äôt be able to feel peace and solitude.  If this drawback of Baramee Resortel 3 * does not bother you, then the hotel will suit you.  On the balcony there is a dryer for things, which is quite practical and convenient.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All rooms are equipped with air conditioning, creating a comfortable indoor microclimate.  In the tropics this is a prerequisite.  As in most other hotels in Thailand, each room has a safe where you can store valuables, documents and money.  In addition, you can appreciate the quality of wireless Internet, satellite TV, use the minibar and utensils. </p><p>  From the amenities in the room there is a small bathroom, more precisely, a toilet and a shower.  Plumbing is not the strongest link in local hotels.  Many tourists note that each reception of water and hygiene procedures for them ended in a flood, and all because the hotel did not have a traditional shower, but a trawl, which implies the presence of a watering can and a drain mounted on the floor.  If you prefer to wash yourself with hot water, it is better to turn it on in advance, otherwise you will have to rinse with cool water.  In the conditions of hot tropics this defect can hardly be called significant, here and so you always want to cool. </p>

    <p>  Baramee Resortel (Patong Beach) 3 * is a rather old hotel, so it's silly to rely on new furniture and appliances in the rooms.  However, the rest is old, but high-quality furniture does not interfere at all, it remains still comfortable, so there is no point in attributing this fact to the significant shortcomings of the hotel. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  If you are fastidious in food, the Baramee Resortel 3 * hotel will definitely suit you.  Guest reviews emphasize that the breakfasts here are wonderful.  At the first visit to the restaurant, tourists simply need to inform the staff of the room number.  Breakfast time is from 6:30 to 10:30.  The menu is quite varied, the products are always fresh: chicken, rice, toasts, cheese and meat slices, sausages, potatoes, aromatic coffee, freshly squeezed juices, tropical fruits.  You certainly won't be hungry. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The hotel area is small, but literally immersed in the greenery of tropical plants.  If you do not want to go to the sea, you can always sit by the pool.  It is located on the second floor and is almost always free. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Baramee Resortel Patong Beach 3 * boasts a clean coastal area.  White sand, clear sea water will justify the expectations of any tourist.  The beach here is relatively sparsely populated, which makes beach vacations amazing.  The sun is quite active, so it is better to stock up with sunscreens with a high protection factor - otherwise the probability of sunburn is maximum. </p><p>  Surely all those who go to Thailand for the first time want to learn about the sea, as there is a lot of information that swimming here is not always comfortable and safe due to the presence of any "evil spirits" in the water.  The main disadvantage of this beach at the hotel is the presence of "biting" jellyfish.  No matter how neat and careful you are while swimming, their bite is unlikely to be avoided.  The affected area then hurts quite a lot, burns, so stock up on special means in advance or purchase it at a local pharmacy for 250-300 baht. </p>

At the Baramee Resortel 3 * hotel <span>(Phuket, Patong) a</span> doctor is on duty around the clock, who will provide first aid if necessary.  Quite often, guests overdoing tanning turn to a medical worker here - the tropical sun is sometimes ruthless to the delicate skin of tourists and vacationers. </p><p>  Now for the cleaning of the rooms.  This point is beyond praise - it is cleaned here daily.  For an extra 20 baht you will receive a magnetic key and you can leave the air conditioner on for the duration of your absence in the room - upon return you can enjoy the coolness and freshness.

At the reception you can get acquainted with the tour program, rates, choose the most suitable options for yourself and soon go on a long-awaited trip. </p><p>  The hotel administration will tell you which excursions are worth taking, which are better to refuse.  By the way, contrary to popular belief, acquiring excursions at local agencies is profitable and safe.  Thais are more sensitive to their work, providing first-class service and amazing returns.  You will find a Russian-speaking guide and a very interesting and rich program. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  So, Baramee Resortel is fully consistent with its 3 stars.
