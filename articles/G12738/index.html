    <p>  Aquacenter instructors offer guests the opportunity to learn the basics of water sports.  Hotel guests can visit the gym, Finnish bath, jacuzzi, play tennis, volleyball, futsal, table tennis, darts, billiards, shoot archery. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Club Zigana 5 * (Kemer, Turkey) (photos are given in the article) is located on the Mediterranean coast.  The hotel's beach is covered with bulk sand, pebbles can be found only at the entrance to the sea.  Sun loungers, towels and umbrellas are provided free of charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  As we have already mentioned, Club Zigana 5 * HV (Turkey, Kemer, Beldibi) is located near the village of Beldibi, which is currently a popular beach resort in Turkey.  The town is an elongated coastal strip, which is built up with hotels, shops and restaurants. </p><p>  The village received its name in honor of a small rivulet.  Archaeological excavations have shown that the settlements in this region were still in the first century BC.  However, later the town was going through hard times.  The situation changed in the eighties, when the first hotels began to be built here.  And ten years later, the resort also acquired luxurious high-class hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club zigana 5 kemer turkey tours" class="if" height="488" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1988681.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Beldibi is located just 25 kilometers from Antalya.  The coast of the resort is very unusual.  It stretches in a thin strip between the slopes of the mountains and the sea.  Therefore, the town consists of several streets stretched along the coast. </p><p>  The beaches of the resort are quite large pebbles.  But some of the hotels for their vacationers covered the beach with fine sand and built bathing piers.  This also applies to Club Zigana 5 * HV (Turkey, Kemer). </p><p>  It is worth noting that Belbidi is a beach resort, and therefore the main attraction here is the beach and the sea.  And you will not find other attractions here.  Not far from Beldibi are the ruins of ancient Phaselis.  At one time, it was founded by colonists from Rhodes.  Later, the city survived the heyday and was considered a very large trading and seaport, and a military center.  From the past, only ruins remained in the city. </p><p>  Nearby, near the village of Goynuk, there is a canyon, which only trained people can walk on.  A pedestrian walk is quite long, and in some places the road leads through shallow water. </p><p>  To see something else interesting, you should go to Kemer. </p><h2>  Club Zigana 5 * (Kemer, Turkey): reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to discuss the reviews of tourists who rested in it this year.  Immediately we want to note that the experience of the hotel among the spa guests is very different: from complete enthusiasm to discontent.  The main advantage of the complex is its large and beautiful territory, surrounded by greenery and flowers.  Cottages are scattered throughout the territory of Club Zigana 5 * (Kemer, Turkey).  The hotel rooms are very different and are in very different conditions.  Some of them frankly "tired" and have long been in need of repair.  The situation is saved by very high-quality furniture made of natural wood, which is still in good condition.  Air conditioning and plumbing in the rooms working.  In general, the rooms are in good condition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club zigana 5 kemer turkey reviews 2017" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1988685.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for cleaning, there are complaints about its quality.  Controversial reviews suggest that some maids are not very responsible for their duties, and the tip in no way encourages them to improve the service.  According to regular customers of the institution, a couple of years ago, the level of service was an order of magnitude higher.  Now, in many matters, the situation has fundamentally changed, and not for the better.  Most likely, this is due to the fact that there was a change of ownership, which led to such consequences.  At one time, Club Zigana 5 * (Kemer, Turkey), confirmation of this, was one of the best hotels in the resort area of ​​Beldibi.  However, time has passed, and the number of rooms needs to be updated, and the level of service has significantly decreased.  Currently, tours to Club Zigana 5 * (Kemer, Turkey) are popular since old times, as they say, the complex rests on its former authority.  Couples previously chose this hotel because of the good kids club and excellent food.  But now the situation has changed a bit. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  What about food in Club Zigana 5 * (Kemer, Turkey)?  Reviews in 2017 indicate that the food in the restaurant is quite monotonous for a five-star establishment.  On the tables there is a very small selection of meat dishes.  This is usually chicken.  As for fruits and desserts, they are also very few.  Grill dishes are prepared every day, but little by little, there is always a line for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club zigana 5 turkey beldibi kemer reviews" class="if" height="487" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1988687.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel positions itself as an institution that accepts couples with children.  This means that the restaurant should have a special menu.  But in fact, on the children's table there is usually french fries (not at all baby food), mashed potatoes and nothing more.  Ice cream is given only once a day - in the evening, after dinner.  Unfortunately, at this time the kids are rushing to a mini-disco. </p><p>  As for drinks, the concept includes only local alcohol.  The restaurant staff is fast enough, so there are no complaints.  But as for food, tourists consider its quantity and quality to be inappropriate for the five-star level of the hotel. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Reviews about Club Zigana 5 * (Turkey, Beldibi, Kemer) are quite contradictory.  According to tourists, the hotel has a large and spacious pool with very clean water.  It is cleaned daily.  Even if there are trees near it, there is never foliage in the water.  During the day, animators arrange good entertainment programs for guests by the pool and on the beach.  There is a mini club for children in the complex.  Kids are happy to rush into it, because there they expect fun.  And in the evenings for the youngest tourists organize a mini-disco.  In general, the kids are delighted with the entertainment. </p><p>  As for evening programs for adults, they are organized exclusively by local animators.  Unfortunately, there are no visiting artists, so the repertoire of show programs is limited to the Miss and Mr. Hotel contests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel club zigana 5 kemer turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1988686.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Special attention deserves the hotel's beach.  It is strewn with fine sand, so it is very good for relaxation.  Pebbles are found only at the entrance to the sea.  For those who do not like it, made approaches from sloping plates, as well as a pier.  For kids there is a gentle pebble entry, convenient for swimming.  The beach is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, there are always free places.  The sea in this region is clean and transparent due to the pebble bottom. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there are several shops with things and children's goods, where you can buy everything you need.  However, the quality of products in them is very low, and prices are high.  Therefore, tourists recommend, if necessary, walk to the nearest supermarket. </p><p>  The hotel has a very low quality Internet, it seems to be in the rooms, but it often disappears, so it is not always possible to chat with relatives. </p><p>  Summing up the conversation, we can say that the hotel is still not bad for a family vacation.  But, according to tourists, he needs to update the fund and staff, since there is no trace of the former service.  Vacationers still come here, remembering what the establishment was like a couple of years ago.  In general, you can have a good rest in the complex if you are not picky and are ready to turn a blind eye to numerous flaws.  The beautiful nature of the resort can overshadow the many shortcomings. </p><h2>  Excursions and trips </h2><p>  Resting in the hotel, of course, it is worth allotting time for all kinds of trips.  A mandatory item in the program should be Kemer, which has a lot of interesting things.  And in the immediate vicinity of it there are many attractions.  You can get to the city on dolmushi, which regularly run between villages. </p><p>  Almost all vacationers seek to buy gifts and souvenirs in Turkey.  From Kemer, as a rule, painted robes, hookahs, and homely pointed shoes are brought.  Handmade carpets, fur and leather products are especially popular with tourists.  Ceramics, tea sets and world famous sweets can also be brought from Kemer.  Textiles, souvenirs and desserts are most profitable to purchase in the markets. </p><p>  The largest number of shops in the city is located on the main pedestrian street - Ataturk Boulevard.  Here you can buy gold jewelry, fur and leather products in stores. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club zigana 5 kemer turkey photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1988695.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Each tourist, relaxing in Turkey, seeks to visit the local market, since it is here that you can feel the real oriental flavor.  On the main street of the city there is a grocery market.  It sells the freshest fruits, vegetables, olive oil, nuts, spices, coffee, honey.  Also in the center on Tuesdays you can visit the textile bazaar.  On it you can buy carpets, bathrobes, shoes. </p><p>  For those who are interested in historical monuments, there are a lot of interesting things in Kemer.  One such place is Phaselis.  The ancient city was founded in the seventh century BC.  Throughout his long history, he experienced a variety of times - from falls to take-offs.  Phaselis was once a major port.  His prosperity lasted more than 300 years.  Later, the city lost its significance.  The ruins preserved on the site of Phaselis belong to the Byzantine and Roman periods.  Another historical monument is the ancient Olympos, which now became part of the National Park. </p><p>  No less interesting is the historical park called Yoruk.  It is located near Kemer.  The ethnic village provides an opportunity to see how a nomadic tribe lived, how people's dwellings, clothes and household items looked.  Once in the village, as if transported for centuries into the past, everything looks so realistic. </p><p>  An interesting place to visit is Mount Yanartash, which is always shrouded in fire and smoke.  Currently, scientists believe that this phenomenon is due to the fact that the earth's surface has accumulated gases, which, when exiting to the surface, ignite.  However, local residents prefer to believe the legend, which says that the fire spews out the defeated monster, locked in the mountain.  The fire on the mountain does not go out day and night.  Of course, in the dark, the sight looks simply amazing and bewitching. </p><p>  Not far from Olympos and Kemer is a complex of Beldibi caves.  A stunningly beautiful place is surrounded by coniferous forests, and somewhere in the depths a river flows.  Having crossed it, you can reach both the caves themselves and the waterfall.  In ancient times, caves were a reliable shelter for animals and people.  In the middle of the last century, they were well examined by experts who made many amazing finds - household utensils, cave paintings and tools.  Here you can feel the spirit of antiquity and feel like a real explorer. </p>
