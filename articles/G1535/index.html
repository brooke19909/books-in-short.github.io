He is the right back of the Roma club.  This article will present a brief biography of the athlete. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Micon Douglas Sizenando was born in Novo Amburgo (Brazil) in 1981.  The boy‚Äôs parents were very fond of American cinema, so they named the born son in honor of the American artist <span>Michael Douglas.</span>  But the registrar made a mistake, and the future footballer received the name Micon.  His twin brother was also named after the famous artist Marlon Brando.  Children were born in the hospital named after Darcy Vargas.  Their father took the umbilical cord and buried them in the center of the Santa Rosa Stadium.  At the same time, he asked God that at least one of his offspring become a great football player. </p><p>  When the boys turned two years old, the whole family moved to the city of Krisiuna.  At the age of 10, Micon Douglas (photo presented in the article) got under the car and almost died.  Parents were shocked, because that's how they lost their firstborn, Elton Louis. </p>

    <h2>  Getting to know football </h2><p>  Soon the boy was identified in the club "Criusima".  There Micon Douglas played under the guidance of his father.  At age 13, he moved to the position of midfielder in the school of FC Gremio.  Douglas spent only two months there.  The team coach said that the boy is too weak in physical terms.  After that, Micon returned to Kriushima.  At one of the matches, due to a shortage of players, Douglas was placed on the right flank.  Subsequently, he spent his entire career in this position. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transition to Professionals </h2><p>  In 2000, Micon Douglas made his debut in the main team of FC Cruzeiro.  Three years later, the athlete helped him win the Brazil Cup.  In 2004, the footballer signed a four-year contract with the French club Monaco.  For the transfer of the Brazilian leadership had to fork out 3 million euros.  Micon took the number 13, which other team players categorically refused to wear.  As part of the ‚ÄúMonaco‚Äù Douglas played two seasons.  Basically, Micon acted in the attack, paying little attention to his duties as a defender.  As a result, head coach <span>Didier Deschamps</span> transferred the athlete to midfield. </p>

    <h2>  Contract with Inter </h2><p>  In 2006, Micon Douglas moved to another club.  The footballer bought Inter Milan for 7 million euros.  Micon signed a 5-year contract with an annual salary of 1.5 million euros.  The main reason for the purchase of Douglas was the request of Javier Sanetti (Captain Inter).  A few days after joining the club, the hero of this article helped the team win the Italian Super Cup.  Then he successfully spent the first season, winning the national championship. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Jose Mourinho (Inter's mentor) called Maicon the best defender of the right flank in the world.  Under his leadership, Douglas significantly improved defensive skills.  Micon himself called Jose a fantastic coach.  The athlete spent most of his career at Inter. </p><h2>  "Manchester city" </h2><p>  This football club became interested in Douglas in the summer of 2012.  Also, "Real" claimed to be Maikon, who was ready to pay about 8 million euros for him.  On August 31, a Douglas transition announcement appeared on the Manchester City website.  Transfer conditions were not disclosed.  The footballer made his debut in mid-September in a game against Stoke City (1: 1).  Serious competition to the Brazilian was Pablo Sabaleta.  As a result, the athlete played only nine matches for Manchester, and at the end of the season the contract with him was terminated. </p>
