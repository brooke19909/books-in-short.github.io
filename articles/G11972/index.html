The answer to this question is not so simple.  The course of the history of the development of the lunar plains was influenced by some circumstances, which should be considered in a certain sequence.  It is necessary to understand what is reality and what is fiction.  Do not forget that the lunar program was developed not only by Russians, but also by Americans.  Both projects were abruptly interrupted without specific explanation.  Naturally, this caused a lot of questions, and the most important of them - <span>why did they stop flying to the moon?</span>  The reasons for such a quick refusal to develop a strategically important project are due to mysterious circumstances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why don't they fly to the moon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1106444.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  NASA Success: Moon Race </h2><p>  To better understand why people no longer fly to the moon, you should carefully study the history of the development of this Earth satellite.  First of all, it is necessary to mention the race that the two superpowers staged for excellence in this world. </p><p>  Everyone knows that in that period of history the priority of space exploration was fixed precisely for the USSR.  Naturally, the Americans were well aware that their rivals had advanced far ahead in space exploration and it was not so easy to get ahead of them.  To reduce the distance, NASA needed to make some kind of breakthrough in space exploration.  At this time, the lunar program was created.  About 40 thousand employees worked on its development for eight years.  Do not forget that about 110 billion dollars were spent on the lunar program.  But if there was good funding, then why stopped flying to the moon?  The facts were silent for a long time.  Until now, some moments of the history of the development of lunar spaces remain incomprehensible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the development of Americans in this area were successful.  After all, the key link here was Vernen von Braun.  This man worked for Adolf Hitler during World War II.  It was this specialist who created the legendary V-2. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why did people stop flying to the moon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1106443.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  American Apollo </h2><p>  After the long labors of a large team of specialists, the Americans achieved tremendous success.  Werner von Braun created a carrier with sufficient power.  However, in finished form, the product possessed simply huge dimensions.  It was not possible to transfer it by land.  Therefore, the carrier was delivered to the spaceport using water transport.  It is worth noting that the Saturn engine had a capacity of 180 million horsepower.  When the carrier was launched in nearby buildings, the ceilings showered and all the windows were knocked out. </p><p>  Before the first landing on Earth‚Äôs satellite, NASA launched 10 Apollo launches.  In 1968 (in October) Apollo 7 was launched into low Earth orbit, and in December - Apollo 8, on board of which there were pilots.  They were the first to fly around the moon in orbit. </p><p>  In 1969 (in March), Apollo 9 conducted space tests of the lunar module, and in May Apollo 10 rehearsed the landing on the moon, descending to a height of 15 kilometers from the surface of the Earth‚Äôs satellite.  There was no full landing.  On July 2, 1969, a crew was delivered to the surface of the moon in Apollo 11.  After that, six more expeditions were carried out with the crew disembarking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why don't people fly to the moon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1106446.jpg"></div>

At that time, a team of specialists led by S.P. Korolev and V.N. Chelomei worked on the development of a flight to the moon.  However, for a long time, Russian scientists did not succeed in creating a carrier that would have sufficient power. </p><p>  Some time later, S.P. Korolev died.  But it was he who was the key link in the project.  As a result of the sad event, the situation was greatly aggravated.  It is worth noting that the USSR spent all its forces on a space exploration program.  Therefore, the lunar race of opportunities and finances was simply not enough.  Of course, the situation improved over time.  However, it still remains unclear why they are not flying to the moon now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why no longer fly to the moon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1106442.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The closure of the lunar programs </h2><p>  Why don't they fly to the moon and why were all lunar programs closed?  At the end of 1972, NASA stopped conducting research.  The lunar program was closed.  It is worth noting that the Soviet Union also curtailed all its projects related to the <span>exploration of the moon,</span> without having landed its crew on the surface of the Earth's satellite.  After that, no one else tried to resume flights.  During this period, a huge number of multi-billion dollar projects were closed.  So why did people stop flying to the moon, and why was there such a rush? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, many assumed that the Russians simply lost interest in the program.  But to understand the cause of the Americans is very difficult.  After all, they were able to achieve success in their developments.  Also, many suggest that the reason for the high cost of such programs is contrived.  Indeed, at that time, most of the allocated funds was spent on the creation of missiles and launching pads.  The cost of one launch was equal to the cost of one bomber.  In addition, it is not entirely clear why they are not flying to the moon now.  After all, technology has stepped far forward.  This suggests that the reasons are more significant than lack of funding or lost interest. </p><h2>  Anomalies on the moon </h2><p>  After the first flights to the moon, it became known that something strange was happening on the Earth‚Äôs satellite.  This was known not only to Americans, but also to Russians.  Around the world, dozens of astronauts have reported that on the moon you can see many inexplicable and inexplicable things. </p><p>  From the stories it became clear that quite bright flashes appear in different places near the surface of the Earth‚Äôs satellite, which have different shades, differ in length, as well as in directions.  In addition, it was reported that on the moon you can see strange shadows that are constantly moving.  Also, from the surface of the Earth‚Äôs satellite, some luminous points with impressive dimensions come into orbit.  They fly around a part of the orbit along the chord, and then make a landing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why don't fly to the moon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1106430.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition, Professor N. A. Kozyrev, who was an employee of the <span>Pulkovo Observatory,</span> reported in 1958 that for several hours the central part of the Alphonse crater was closed by a large cloud of red.  Such anomalies were difficult to explain without research.  Maybe this is the answer to the question of why people do not fly to the moon. </p><h2>  Lunar Anomaly Studies </h2><p>  Of course, anomalies on the moon could become the main reason for the closure of programs to study its surfaces.  But first of all, it was necessary to study all incomprehensible and <span>inexplicable phenomena.</span>  Therefore, in the United States in 1965, a whole scientific society was created, which was engaged in the study of lunar anomalies.  At that time, only highly qualified specialists were part of the team.  Over the entire period of the work of this scientific community, many anomalies on the moon have been identified.  Many of them were difficult to explain.  For this reason, in 1968 a document was created, called the "Chronological catalog of reports of lunar events." </p><h2>  What did they find on the moon? </h2><p>  About 579 unexplained anomalous phenomena occurring on the surface and in the orbit of the moon were indicated here.  Among such phenomena, there were: </p><ol><li>  Disappearing craters. </li><li>  Geometric figures. </li><li>  Gigantic domes that can change color. </li><li>  Colored trenches that can lengthen at a speed of 6 kilometers per hour. </li><li>  Luminous objects and so on. </li></ol><p>  Such phenomena could not be explained, but neither the Americans nor the Russians wanted to stop the lunar race.  As a result, spacecraft launches began, as it was decided to fly and see everything with my own eyes.  At that time, no one paid attention to the presence of anomalies.  But why not fly to the moon even after exploring many phenomena? </p><h2>  Messages from the moon </h2><p>  To establish the exact reason why they do not fly to the moon is not so simple.  You can build a lot of guesses, but getting to the truth is very difficult.  It is enough to analyze the first reports of astronauts who went to conquer the lunar spaces.  When the Americans launched the Apollo, on board of which there was a crew, many radio enthusiasts watched the course of events around the world.  After all, at that time broadcasts of communication with the Houston astronauts were conducted.  It was after the first reports that it became clear that the crew was not negotiating something.  Years later, it became clear that the guesses were correct.  Radio amateurs from Australia and Switzerland were able to catch astronaut talks at a different frequency immediately after landing.  They talked about strange and strange things.  What was there and why now they don‚Äôt fly to the moon?  After all, it is much closer than Mars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why no one flies to the moon" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1106424.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Confession </h2><p>  So why don't they fly to the moon even after so many years?  In the negotiations of the astronauts with Houston, there were a lot of flaws.  Of course, many things are difficult to explain, especially if you see them for the first time.  10 years after the first flight to the moon, Maurice Chatlen, who was one of the creators of the radio equipment intended for the lunar program, made a statement that he was present at the communication session when Neil Amstrong spoke about several objects of unknown origin that landed at some distance from Apollo. </p><p>  After that, messages from the moon spoke of some stone blocks that were located near the landing block.  At the same time, some of them, as <span>Edwin Aldrin</span> claimed <span>,</span> emitted a glow from the outside, and some inside.  It was almost colorless and insignificant. </p><p>  Similar messages declined to comment not only at NASA, but also crew members.  Some time later, the commander of the Apollo 11 expedition reported some phenomena.  But he could not tell in detail, since he had given a non-disclosure subscription.  After the Earth satellite exploration program was closed, NASA admitted that about 25 astronauts personally saw the presence during the UFO expedition.  Maybe this is the reason why they no longer fly to the moon and are not developing new programs for its development? </p><h2>  UFO evidence </h2><p>  Nevertheless, it is not completely clear why they do not fly to the moon, if there is an opportunity for this?  Many ufologists claim that life exists on the surface of the Earth‚Äôs satellite.  In addition, there is evidence that the Apollo 12 expedition was accompanied by unidentified flying objects.  This fact has been established from Earth observatories.  Two UFOs flew near the American shuttle and winked at the lights.  One <span>unidentified flying object</span> was located behind the Apollo, and the second in front. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why stopped flying to the moon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1106418.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the moment, it is clear only that the Americans knew perfectly well that on the surface of the moon there was something inexplicable and unusual.  Perhaps new expeditions were carried out to solve this mystery.  To prove this, just look at the pictures taken with the telescope about 10 years before the first launches.  They were made by astronomer Jess Wilson.  A chain of many bright objects that stretch from outer space to the moon is perfectly visible on them.  Scientists could not give an objective explanation of this phenomenon.  Perhaps UFOs exist.  And it is precisely this fact that gives a complete answer to the question of why no one has been flying to the moon for many decades. </p><h2>  Obscure objects on the moon </h2><p>  Why do not they fly to the moon, and what was discovered by the Americans on its surface?  These questions concern many lovers of inexplicable phenomena.  As some documents show, the latest Apollo expeditions have discovered many interesting objects on the moon.  At that time, astronauts managed to remove obscure vehicles, boulders of sufficiently large sizes, which independently rolled out of the craters.  Of course, this is not all objects that are worthy of attention. </p><p>  Near the landing site, pictures were taken of cars, as well as pits with straight and right angles that exclude their crater formation, and canyons that are simply lined with stone blocks.  There are plenty of similar inexplicable phenomena on the moon. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Scientists suggest that there was once life on the moon, and perhaps it exists there today.  After all, astronauts were able to partially study only what is on the surface of the Earth‚Äôs satellite.  The mystery is all that is inside the moon.  Of course, all the facts cited do not provide an exhaustive answer to the question of why people do not fly to the moon.  Perhaps, after another 10 years, everything will fall into place, and humanity will finally find out the truth. </p>
