For an acceptable amount, tourists can stay in a good hotel, fully equipped with everything necessary for a first-class holiday on the sea.  If you are planning a vacation in Phuket, pay attention to the inexpensive hotel Marina Phuket Resort 4 *, which is located near the popular Patong Beach.  It is about this resort complex that will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Location Details </h2><p>  The location of this hotel is ideal for tourists looking for a place to relax in Phuket.  The complex is located in a quiet area, entirely planted with tropical vegetation.  It is noteworthy that The Marina Phuket Patong 4 * is built on a high hill 200 meters from the coast, so it offers amazing views of the sea.  But there are some drawbacks: the road to the public beach will take about 10-15 minutes.  At the same time, returning to the hotel, tourists will have to climb the hill.  The distance from the beach is compensated by developed infrastructure.  Near the hotel there are many restaurants, cafes, shops and souvenir shops.  In addition, nearby is a large entertainment complex "Dinosaur Park", which is a favorite vacation spot for tourists with young children. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="7.829226599999998" data-lng="98.29517050000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/6/6/8/11668.png"></div><p>  This is not to say that the hotel is very far from the airport.  An international terminal accepting flights from Russia is located directly on the island of Phuket.  The distance to it is about 50 km.  You can overcome it in 30-50 minutes.  Tourists can take a taxi to the hotel or book a paid shuttle in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Important information </h2><p>  This hotel will be a great place for a relaxing stay.

It is worth noting that usually they are not significant and do not spoil the impression of rest.

The connection is constantly breaking. </li><li>  Poor housekeeping.  You can see stains on the furniture, and dust and hair on the floor.  In addition, linen and towels are changed extremely rarely. </li><li>  Monotonous and tasteless breakfasts that do not match their value. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.co.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room features" class="if uuid-2958727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2958727.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, the complex Marina Phuket Resort Karon 4 * will be an excellent option for tourists who prefer a relaxing holiday at sea.  If you like tropical gardens, then be sure to come to this hotel.  At the same time, travelers seeking active entertainment may feel bored in this place. </p>
