  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Company "Airplane Development": reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years, among Russian consumers there has been an increase in interest in buying real estate.  This is especially noticeable in Moscow.  Young families, despite the economic crisis, are actively taking a mortgage and settle in their own long-awaited apartments.  Most Russians are interested in buying housing in a new building, because at the construction stage, the cost per square meter is much lower than after putting the finished object into operation.  However, many potential buyers are afraid of falling into the hands of scammers, and therefore lose the rare opportunity to become owners of their own apartments at a very reasonable price.  Today we will tell readers about the company "Airplane Development".  Reviews about it will become the basis for conclusions about the reliability of the developer and his position in the real estate market.  We hope that this information will be useful to you, and you can make the right choice for the developer of your future comfortable apartment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1951482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1951482.jpg?1546627763"></div><h2>  Company Brief </h2><p>  “Aircraft Development” (we will devote a whole section of the article to reviews of this organization) has been working on the real estate market for five years.  During this time, the company brought to completion several new buildings and fully complied with its obligations to build the promised infrastructure on the territory of new microdistricts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of “Airplane Development”, the head office of the company, where meetings with customers take place and the main work is carried out, it is located on Ivan Franko Street in house number eight.  The office is located in the business center and has a fairly large area, where there is a place for several meeting rooms, children’s corners and other premises necessary for the work of a reputable company.  All this indicates that the organization takes its activities very seriously and wants its customers not to experience discomfort while communicating with the office staff.  It should be noted that the entire staff of “Airplane Development” (reviews about them are devoted to many forums on the Internet) are always very polite and attentive to visitors to the company.  The prospective client will be promptly answered with questions of interest to him, specially for him they will conduct a virtual tour of the future apartment, they will also tell in an accessible language about all the features and nuances of the transaction.  Professionals from “Airplane Development” will not hide from the customer the existing pitfalls in the contract, which is very important for home buyers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1951869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/1951869.jpg?1546627763"></div><h2>  The main directions of work </h2><p>  “Aircraft Development”, reviews of which are posted in large numbers on the official website of the company, confidently declares itself as a major developer who independently performs all stages of construction - from designing to interior decoration.  This allows customers of the organization to purchase new housing with excellent and <span>modern repair.</span>  This approach provides the company with great interest in its activities from potential customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Basically, “Aircraft Development” is engaged in the following stages of construction: </p><ul><li>  drawing up estimates of projects; </li><li>  work on the architectural plan of houses and the design of important infrastructure; </li><li>  vigilant control over all stages of the construction of buildings; </li><li>  advertising company and promotion of housing in the real estate market; </li><li>  administration of commissioned houses. </li></ul><p>  The company is actively engaged in the following activities: </p><ul><li>  housing for sale in new buildings in the most prestigious areas of Moscow and the Moscow region; </li><li>  attraction of investments; </li><li>  creation of tenders for contractors and cooperation with them at different stages of construction. </li></ul><p>  Many buyers call in their reviews “Aircraft Development” a unique company that managed to quickly occupy its niche in the real estate market thanks to an integrated and responsible approach to construction at all its stages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1951485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1951485.jpg?1546627763"></div><h2>  Company goals </h2><p>  The main objective of Aircraft Development is the construction of affordable housing for all segments of the population, while economy class apartments are offered in premium and comfort houses.  If we compare the prices on the real estate market for one square meter, it immediately becomes clear that the company offers its customers very attractive conditions that allow it to successfully compete with other similar organizations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  “Aircraft Development” (reviews of employees and customers confirm this) is trying to constantly improve the technologies used, to the extent possible, automates the work of workers, and also uses the most modern building materials. </p><p>  The company pays great attention to the choice of places for development.  She prefers to build new buildings in ecologically clean areas with an abundance of greenery, near park areas or where open water bodies are available.  In addition, “Aircraft Development” never leaves new neighborhoods without the necessary infrastructure; not only socially sought-after facilities, but also various entertainment facilities are being built on the territory of residential areas. </p><h2>  Company reputation </h2><p>  Everyone who, before buying an apartment, tries to get as much information about the developer as possible, are very surprised by the fact that the company is considered one of the most reliable in Moscow.  She works with many banks, which is a guarantee of the timely delivery of her facilities. </p><p>  It’s nice that all the previous projects of the organization were delivered on time, but reviews of “Plane Development” contain information that the best prices per square meter are offered only in the first month after the start of sales.  With each subsequent day, the cost of housing is growing, in addition, the developer almost instantly sells the most successful apartments in terms of layout and location.  Therefore, happy homeowners from this construction company advise potential buyers not to delay the conclusion of the contract. </p><p>  To date, the developer has about nine projects in progress, of which you will definitely find something interesting for yourself and your family. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1951443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1951443.jpg?1546627763"></div><h2>  Terms of delivery of the developer </h2><p>  As we said earlier (reviews about LLC “Airplane Development” fully confirm this), the company always complies with the deadlines set by contractual obligations for the commissioning of facilities.  Therefore, buyers do not even have to worry about this topic, they will receive the long-awaited keys to the housing on the date specified in the contract. </p><p>  For the current year 2017, the completion of the following residential complexes is planned: Lesnoye, Murino and Vnukovo.  Next year, housing will be acquired by equity holders in the residential complex “Tomilino”, “Khimki” and “Lyubertsy”.  In 2019, the company plans to complete the large-scale construction of a whole complex of apartments near the village of Myakinino.  This LCD is called "Sputnik" and its prices, at the moment, are more than attractive to customers. </p><h2>  “Airplane Development”: employee reviews </h2><p>  Since the developer is a dynamically developing company, he constantly needs qualified personnel ready to become part of his friendly team.  What can be learned from reviews of the construction company “Airplane Development” as an employer?  Let's try to clarify the situation. </p><p>  As in any work, here you can find the pros and cons.  The advantages of the employer include the following points: </p><ul><li>  friendly and highly professional team; </li><li>  proximity to the metro and stops of other public transport; </li><li>  social package; </li><li>  good dining room for employees; </li><li>  white wages; </li><li>  An interesting approach to corporate events, the organization of which management does not skimp. </li></ul><p>  All of the above nuances characterize the company as a conscientious employer, but do not forget about the disadvantages of cooperation with “Airplane Development”: </p><ul><li>  inconvenient parking; </li><li>  insufficient space in outer wardrobes, which forces employees to look for a suitable place for their boots and coats in the office itself; </li><li>  poor ventilation system; </li><li>  frequent on-site presentations for clients planning to take a mortgage; </li><li>  not fully thought out system of evaluations of labor productivity. </li></ul><p>  Is it worth it to work for this company?  Many employees definitely recommend it, because here you can quickly gain experience in the field of real estate and move up the career ladder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1951491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1951491.jpg?1546627763"></div><h2>  Project "Lyubertsy": description and features </h2><p>  The company has been operating in Lyubertsy for several years.  She managed to build several residential neighborhoods, the last of which will be commissioned next year, the first complex was completed two years ago.  This allows you to talk a little more specifically about this project, because there are already quite a lot of reviews on the Internet.  So what is the Lyubertsy LCD? </p><p>  First of all, buyers should understand that Lyubertsy is not just a group of residential complexes, but an unprecedented project for the mass development of the territory.  Here there will be a real mini-town with everything you need for a comfortable life. </p><p>  The houses are located in a very beautiful place bordering Lake Black.  Nearby is a park area and a forest, the felling of which is strictly prohibited.  Therefore, residents of the area can be sure that they will always be surrounded by a real sea of ​​greenery. </p><p>  It's nice that near the <span>residential complex</span> there is a new metro station Nekrasovka.  Its opening is planned for early 2019.  In addition, the LCD can be easily reached by public transport - there are bus and minibus stops near the new buildings.  The distance to the Moscow Ring Road from the LCD is about seven kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1951457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1951457.jpg?1546627763"></div><h2>  Apartments in residential complex "Lyubertsy" </h2><p>  Reviews of apartments from “Plane Development” allow us to form an opinion on the area of ​​housing and its interior decoration.  In the houses there are one-, two- and three-room apartments, their area is quite different - from twenty-seven to eighty squares.  The ceiling height is two meters eighty centimeters, buyers received all apartments with a good fine finish.  Many did not even start repairs, but with pleasure drove into their new and ready-to-live-in apartments. </p><h2>  Developer "Aircraft Development", "Lyubertsy": customer reviews </h2><p>  Most buyers were satisfied with the quality of housing from this company.  Considerable joy is the fact that all objects are delivered on time.  Not all Russian companies can boast of such an attitude to their work.  It is pleasant that for each client in “Plane Development” they find an individual approach and are always ready to help with the choice of an apartment.  Many buyers in their comments noted a well-equipped office, as well as competent transaction support. </p><p>  Some customers have identified and disadvantages in the company: </p><ul><li>  defects in the call center system; </li><li>  preliminary reservation of the apartment; </li><li>  sale of housing by buildings; </li><li>  poor finish. </li></ul><p>  The few disadvantages noted by buyers, the developer is gradually correcting.  However, it should be borne in mind that among clients there are always individuals who are dissatisfied with the quality of the services provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1951458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1951458.jpg?1546627763"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Summarizing all the information given in the article, we can say that of the many modern companies involved in housing construction, “Airplane Development” stands out with a lot of positive characteristics.  Therefore, you can safely conclude an agreement with this developer and gradually acquire furniture in your new apartment. </p>
