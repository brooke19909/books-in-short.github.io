Blanes is a small resort town, and many consider it a province of noisy and cheerful Barcelona (it is 60 kilometers from the metropolis), but this does not prevent it from having beautiful architectural monuments, bewitching nature and clear sea, to which millions of tourists come every year . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain blanes" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/285513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the old days, the mighty Romans owned most of the territory that is today known as Spain.  Blanes was a village, then still nameless, in which a noble Roman family settled.  Gradually, the map of Europe took on the usual shape for us, and the races mixed up.  But that ancient clan remained to live in this Catalan town.  It was he who gave him the name.  Their last name sounded like that - Blanes.  Since then, this place has served as a haven for many fishermen, but most importantly, the tourist business has been developing here since ancient times.  And how could it be otherwise?  Natural beauties, large picturesque beaches and incomparable monuments of architecture cause constant interest, they attract people.  All these riches are fully given to them by Spain. </p><p>  Blanes is famous for its stone rock, which divided its territory into two parts - northern and southern.  The first settled locals, so there are many residential areas, hypermarkets and markets.  But the tourist paradise is located in the southern part of the town.  It was here that hotels and luxury villas were built, souvenir shops and beach cafes were opened.  On the narrow old streets, chic restaurants and fashion boutiques flaunt.  There are also many children's entertainment centers, windsurfing schools and other typically resort establishments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Like all of eastern Spain, Blanes abounds with wide and clean beaches.  In this city, they are divided into two types - sand and pebble.  A feature of local coastal zones can be considered white sands.  In Catalonia, most of the beaches are yellow, and in this region, it can be said, nature has provided an exception.  The pearl of the resort is the S'Abannel relaxation area, where you can rent equipment for windsurfing or diving, or rent a yacht. </p><p>  The ideal country for those who like to travel by car is Spain.  Blanes (a map of the city and its environs is sold at any kiosk) is 60 km from Barcelona, ​​and Santa Susanna is also nearby.  There is a giant water park “Marineland”, in which both children and adults can have fun.  Not far from it there are many cafes, which are definitely worth a look and taste local dishes.  Among the national culinary masterpieces, paella is most famous. </p><p>  The most ancient heritage of the city is the tower of San Juan.  It was built in 1022, and in subsequent centuries it was completed, restored.  Nevertheless, the design preserved the primordial <span>Romanesque style</span> , therefore, having risen to it, you can go back to the Middle Ages, full of sacred secrets.  Several centuries later, all architectural masterpieces began to be erected in the spirit of Gothic.  One of them appeared on the territory of Blanes - this is a monastery, which is currently a museum.  Also noteworthy are the gates of the Virgin Mary, the Viscount Palace of De Cabrera, the fountain, the chapel of <span>St. Barbara, the</span> Hospital of St. Jaume and the deep well of São João.  All these architectural monuments were erected in the Gothic era. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain blanes map" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/285512.jpg" width="600"></div>
