They dreamed of going here to look at another life.  This seven-kilometer-long beach strip is all built up with hotels and apartments.  The resort is remote from industrial areas, metropolitan areas and railways.  Therefore, the water here is clean, and local beaches have earned their Blue Flag.  Nearly 800 hotels await guests at this resort each season.  Families with children love to come here, because Slenchev Bryag boasts a huge number of playgrounds, shallow pools, and the hotels have animations and discos for young guests.  Young people also like this ‚Äúparty‚Äù resort, because all the conditions are created for fun.  But let us go through the parks and promenades of the Bulgarian Riviera, look at its hotels and see how tourists respond to holidays on these beaches. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  <span>Sunny Beach</span> (Bulgaria) is located between two large cities - Varna and Burgas.  And since railway and air communication is possible only with them, in order to get to the resort, you must first get to these transport hubs.  Tourists write that from Belarus or Ukraine to Burgas and Varna can be reached by train, but from Russia it is more convenient to travel by plane.  Drive closer to Sunny Beach from Burgas, from the South Bus Station.  From there minibuses to the resort leave 3-5 times per hour in the season, from six in the morning to eleven in the evening.  The same buses pass near the airport (three hundred meters), but often they are already full.  Therefore, travelers say that it‚Äôs better to get to the city after all, and already there take the minibus to Sunny Beach.  It‚Äôs more difficult to go from Varna.  First you have to get to the central bus station of the city.  From there, only three flights go to Sunny Beach even in season.  They follow to Nessebar and Burgas, but stop on the road to different resorts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="debati.bg" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather Sunny Beach Bulgaria" class="if uuid-2320271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2320271.jpg"></div><h2>  Best time to visit </h2><p>  The climate of this area is almost Mediterranean.  This means that the weather in Sunny Beach (Bulgaria) is clear for almost a year.  No wonder the name of the resort sounds appropriate.  Tourists claim that the season here lasts for half a year.  You can swim and sunbathe at the resort already from the May holidays, and the last vacationers leave at the end of October.  Of course, most people in Sunny Beach in July-August.  But this is not at all connected with the fact that these months are the best for relaxation.  It's just that most people have a vacation schedule.  But to go here sunbathing and swimming is best in May and September.  The first month of autumn is especially good - a real "velvet season".  April and October are more suitable for sightseeing.  The weather is warm and sunny, but there are practically no people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imperialgroup.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunny Beach Bulgaria Hotels" class="if uuid-2320217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2320217.jpg"></div><h2>  Expensive holiday complexes </h2><p>  The entire resort of Sunny <span>Beach (Bulgaria) is</span> fully built up with hotels, restaurants and shops.  The price of accommodation is affected only by the location relative to the sea.  Beautiful modern complexes with amenities were built in the areas of "The Seagull" and "Frigate".  Especially a lot of expensive hotels in the north of the city.  This is mainly the "Seagull" quarter.  Despite the fact that the hotel fund is quite large, they book places for six months.  Therefore, if you decide to go on a vacation to Sunny Beach (Bulgaria), it is better to book 4 and 5 star hotels in advance.  There are not so many ‚ÄúFives‚Äù in the resort.  Among them, vacationers mainly distinguish the Victoria Palace.  This hotel is located right on the beach, and even has two luxurious pools - indoor and outdoor.  Around the latter are umbrellas and sunbeds.  The hotel of the Barcelo line is also very good - 70 meters from the sea.  Tourists appreciate it not only for service and amenities, but also for the fitness center.  Good reviews also about the Royal Palace. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="victoriaholidays.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria Sunny Beach hotels 4" class="if uuid-2320218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2320218.jpg"></div><h2>  Sunny Beach (Bulgaria) Mid-Range Hotels </h2><p>  The most comfortable and profitable accommodation option is mainly represented by the ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  In total there are several dozen of them.  The highest ratings are at Strandja and Globus.  Inexpensive hotels are mainly located in the city center.  These hotels belong to the development of the Soviet period, so you can not expect much from them.  Basically, these are holiday complexes for three stars.  They are most of all in Sunny Beach.  Some of these hotels, located on the outskirts, but not too far from the sea, even offer guests an all inclusive system, such as Pomorie, Riva, Juno.  In addition, there are still two-star hotels.  This category belongs to the cheapest hotels in Sunny Beach (Bulgaria). </p><h2>  Budget options </h2><p>  For very unpretentious tourists and backpackers, the resort has hostels and guest houses.  They are usually located on the opposite side of the sea from this resort.  Guest houses are private mini-hotels.  Quite often, they differ from large recreation complexes only in that they have a very small territory, or even not at all.  But in terms of convenience and quality of service, this type of tourist accommodation is not much inferior to classic hotels.  The hosts often offer accommodation with food, and the cuisine in such places is usually homemade and very tasty.  It is best to come to guest houses with large families or companies, then the cost of living will be divided by all guests.  But in any case, tourists write that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãrooms in guesthouses is larger than in standard hotels, and pay less for it.  It is clean, comfortable, few people and there are all conditions for relaxation.  A good option for a student vacation is a hostel.  Complexes such as Tundzha offer guests rooms for 2-5 people.  The price includes breakfast.  From the beach a little far, but here you can stay with pets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments Sunny Beach Bulgaria" class="if uuid-2320256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2320256.jpg"></div><h2>  Long term rental </h2><p>  Recently, it has become very popular to rent apartments in Sunny Beach (Bulgaria).  Sometimes they are special rooms in hotels, but most often these are apartments for rent, sometimes built in special houses or recreation complexes.  This is a very good option for a long stay - for a month or all summer.  Sometimes such apartments are not much different from the rooms of three or four-star hotels, only with great amenities and, of course, a kitchen.  Among tourists, the Kaskadas complex (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria) enjoys a good reputation.  It consists of twenty buildings over several floors.  The territory is huge, green and very well-groomed, completely closed.  The complex has its own park, 9 swimming pools with children's areas.  Walk to the beach for about a quarter of an hour.  On the territory there are shops, cafes and restaurants, and one of the exits directly opens directly at the Action water park.  A lot of entertainment for children - the "Scandinavian park" with rope "climbers", playgrounds, water slides and even a mini-disco in the evenings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skandal.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunny Beach Restaurants Bulgaria" class="if uuid-2320262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2320262.jpg"></div><h2>  How and where to eat </h2><p>  There are many restaurants in the resort, and the cuisine is very diverse.  You can try on the Sunny Beach dishes and Bulgarian, and European, and oriental, especially Indian.  There are even establishments with Russian cuisine.  There are many cafes and restaurants along the beach, but tourists write that prices here are usually two times more expensive than away from the sea.  Bulgarians, like the inhabitants of the Caucasus, are very fond of fish, meat and vegetables cooked on the grill or on the grill.  Yes, and dairy products here are very good.  Of the first dishes, tourists recommend trying the soup "tarator."  It is prepared on the basis of whipped sour milk, nuts, cucumbers and spices.  Of the second courses, ‚Äúmoussaka‚Äù breaks all records for popularity - a vegetable casserole with minced meat or cheese and various sauces.  Very fine small fried whole fish - ‚Äúswell‚Äù.  <span>Puff cakes</span> with cheese - "banits" also go "with a bang."  And the Bulgarian desserts are almost the same as the Turks - halva, various dough drowning in honey, and, of course, all kinds of jams. </p><h2>  What and how to look in the district </h2><p>  Tourists are unanimous in one thing: the resort is a solid beach and related entertainment.  If you want excursions, then you should pay attention to other cities.  Moreover, some attractions are very close.  So, the southern region of Sunny Beach in Bulgaria - Sutdion - is literally two kilometers from the famous old Nessebar.  But from any quarter of the city you can leave there without problems.  The fact is that along the main street of Slenchev Bryaga there are all the routes following to Nessebar.  And you can catch them at any of the eight bus stops.  Traveling by taxi, travelers are not advised to get involved.  It‚Äôs not very cheap, and drivers can drive in circles to ‚Äúwind up‚Äù a large amount on the counter.  A little further Nessebar is located another, no less beautiful city - Sozopol.  Well, of course, on the streets of the resort you will find a lot of travel agencies that will offer you trips to Veliko Tarnovo, Sofia and even Istanbul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bgelectronic.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunny beach bulgaria reviews" class="if uuid-2320260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2320260.jpg"></div><h2>  How to have fun </h2><p>  Since holidays in Sunny Beach in Bulgaria are often aimed at young people, there are various night clubs and discos in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis resort.  But most of all entertainment is still concentrated in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcentral beaches.  There is a water park and mini golf courses.  Free Wi-Fi at the resort is almost everywhere - in any hotel, store, cafe or just on the beach.  All Slenchev Bryag is equipped with good access points.  You can ride ATVs and jeeps around the resort.  Bowling clubs, as well as 5D cinemas with virtual reality, are in great demand here.  The famous Platinum casino throughout the district attracts tourists even from neighboring resorts.  Tourists also praise fishing with an instructor and a mini-spa for legs with garra rufa fish. </p><h2>  Where to take the children </h2><p>  Sunny Beach has long positioned itself as a family-type resort.  Therefore, for little vacationers there is a lot of entertainment.  Many attractions are right on the beach.  This is a Ferris wheel, and giant trampolines, and water slides.  By the way, there are small water parks at many hotels.  But if your children think these slides are not enough, it does not matter.  Not far from the resort center is a huge water park "Action".  There are children's and adult areas.  The latter will appeal to adolescents.  There are as many as 13 slides, including very extreme ones - ‚ÄúFree Fall‚Äù or ‚ÄúKamikaze‚Äù.  But smaller visitors will be pleased.  In addition to children's slides, there is also a themed pool with different slopes and a whole multilevel game water complex "Adventure Island".  Tourists are also advised to take their children to amusement park.  It is located next to the South Beach.  After all, parents there will also not have to be bored.  In addition to carousels, cars and a room of fear, there are attractions for adults.  For example, a roller coaster. </p><div class="photo" data-original="riagor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Bulgaria Sunny Beach" class="if uuid-2320219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2320219.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The coast of the resort stretches for ten kilometers.  Tourists claim that the widest beaches of the country are located in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSunny Beach (Bulgaria).  Photos taken in different parts of the resort with the promenade show that the size of the sand strip between the promenade and the sea is from 60 to 100 meters.  For families with children, these places are perfectly suited.  The descent into the water is shallow, the sand is shallow, no pebbles.  Everywhere is clean and safe.  Near the shore it is shallow, so those travelers who like to swim even complain that they need to get away for this.  The beaches are public and admission is free.  But tourists in reviews write that if you want to use umbrellas, sunbeds, deckchairs, then you will have to fork out for a rental.  Toilets are also paid.  It‚Äôs much cheaper to buy an umbrella and get your own towel.  But be aware that some stretches of beaches that are near hotels are completely lined with sun loungers.  Therefore, a free area, in order to lay your towels, you will still need to search.  Moreover, in the season there are usually quite a lot of people.  The beaches at the resort are equipped, there are many types of different water activities.  ‚ÄúBananas‚Äù, ‚Äúbuns‚Äù, paragliding, kitesurfing are all that your heart desires.  And in the evenings, foam discos and parties are held there. </p><h2>  What to buy </h2><p>  If you are interested in shopping, it is best to go to the center of the village.  Bulgarian clothes and shoes are sold here, as well as all kinds of souvenirs.  Local wines are also appreciated, especially Khan Krum.  The well-known Bulgarian cosmetics based on oil from the Valley of Roses back in Soviet times.  Local lace and knitwear, especially handmade napkins and tablecloths, as well as silver, are in demand.  Tourists claim that even in the resort it is cheaper than in Russia.  If you arrive in September, you can get to the honey festival.  And also from Bulgaria it is advised to conduct brandy - local vodka in the Turkish manner - and the Pliska brandy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotelviand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunny Beach Bulgaria photo" class="if uuid-2320267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2320267.jpg"></div><h2>  Sunny Beach (Bulgaria): tourist reviews </h2><p>  This resort is very popular among vacationers from different countries: both from Europe and from Russia.  Almost everywhere close to the sea, safe, not too expensive, fun and beautiful.  Very good reviews about hotels in Sunny Beach in Bulgaria, both expensive and not too expensive.  The rooms are spacious everywhere, and the balconies are often so large that they give the impression of another room.  Well-developed tourist infrastructure, many cafes for every taste, as well as entertainment.  And, by the way, many hotels on the beach offer menus in their restaurants not only to their own guests, but also to ‚Äúpeople from the street‚Äù.  So, staying at a hotel, you can eat every day in a new one, and even use its services. </p>
