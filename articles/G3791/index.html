Tourists come here for impressions all year round, at any time. </p><p>  And before thinking through their program, they need to decide on the place where they will stop.  It's good that there is an impressive choice - the number of hotels in Pattaya is in the hundreds.  But now we will focus only on one of them.  And this is the 4 star Rabbit Resort Pattaya. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.902546" data-lng="100.86426699999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/0/8/5/12085.png"></div><p>  The hotel is located on Dongtan Beach.  It is not crowded, calm, and a beautiful promenade runs along it.  Tourists like to relax here, because the beach is located in the Pratamnak district, considered to be elite in Pattaya. </p><p>  Pretty quickly from Rabbit Resort Pattaya you can get to Water World Park, Jomtien Beach, the famous race track, Pattaya Park Tower with an observation deck, Bali Hai Pier and many other famous places. </p><p>  The international airport is also located relatively close - 30 kilometers from the hotel.  True, there is another one, and it is a little further.  We are talking about Suvarnabhumi Airport, located 90 kilometers away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.siamzone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rabbit Resort Pattaya 4 *" class="if uuid-2976061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2976061.jpg"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  She deserves special attention.

The hotel is literally surrounded by greenery.  What is important: it is located on a very quiet street, stretching along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand.

This can be seen in the photographs. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  On the territory of the hotel complex Rabbit Resort Pattaya, the photo of which is presented in the article, there are all necessary services: </p><ul><li>  24 hour reception. </li><li>  Luggage office. </li><li>  Free high speed wifi. </li><li>  Private parking. </li><li>  The provision of personal baby sitter services. </li><li>  Laundry. </li><li>  Small business office. </li><li>  Transfer from the airport and back. </li><li>  Car rental. </li><li>  Providing guests with packed lunches on the road. </li><li>  Delivery of drinks and food to guests directly to the apartment. </li><li>  Outdoor swimming pools. </li><li>  Sun terrace </li></ul><p>  If guests are interested in something, they can simply ask their administration question.

The restaurant competently combines modern cooking concepts with an individual approach to each guest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also impossible not to note the fact that it is located on the seashore, but because each meal takes place with a view of the wonderful landscape. </p><p>  People vacationing in Rabbit Resort Pattaya 4 * assure: you should not even look for any alternatives in the city.  In terms of service, food quality, variety of menus and prices, the hotel restaurant is magnificent.  Each dish is a real work of art.

Rabbit Resort is a popular place, and therefore there are many reviews.  Most often, travelers note the following nuances: </p><ul><li>  The beach is really gorgeous.  What is important: the hotel on it has its own territory on which only guests rest.  There are excellent sun loungers, umbrellas, massage corners, shops, and they also give out towels to everyone. </li><li>  The atmosphere is amazing.  We have already talked about the features of the hotel, but this can not be omitted once again.  Guests feel as if they are somewhere in the jungle, and not in Pattaya.  On the territory, by the way, there are a lot of tame squirrels and birds. </li><li>  The staff is friendly, friendly and helpful.  Administrators are always interested in whether everything suits the guests. </li><li>  You can call a taxi directly from the reception.  Ordering a car directly from the hotel is profitable: they arrive quickly even at rush hour.  And besides, there are more favorable rates for guests. </li><li>  There are no problems with the Internet.  It is important for many people to stay in touch, and therefore they note this with attention.  Wi-Fi is everywhere - from the reception to the exit from the hotel. </li><li>  Daily cleaning, just like changing towels and linen.  Cosmetic supplies as well as tea and coffee are regularly replenished. </li><li>  The apartments are just as good in reality as in the photographs.  Furniture and plumbing are in excellent condition. </li><li>  The pools are deep and clean.  It is very well thought out that one is for relaxation, and the other is for families vacationing with children. </li><li>  Restaurant is a separate issue.  The food in it is excellent, and let breakfasts sometimes be repeated, but everything is tasty.  And the hotel (owners, more precisely) grows greens and vegetables on its own.  Almost all the guests who had a rest here and recognized this fact came in surprise. </li><li>  The infrastructure is excellent.  There is where to walk, and close to shops, there is a small night market, as well as many restaurants and cafes around.  And just a 1-minute walk from the beach sector is an excellent institution where you can eat tightly and tasty for only 200-300 baht. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.hoteles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbit resort pattaya 4" class="if uuid-2976047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2976047.jpg"></div><p>  If you examine in detail the reviews left about Rabbit Resort Pattaya 4 *, you can see that there are practically no negative comments.  The guests who were here assure: this hotel is a real romantic oasis in the middle of the noisy Pattaya.  Ideal for people who want to combine outdoor activities with relaxation and solitude. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The approximate price for a trip for two people to Pattaya with a stop at the Rabbit Resort Pattaya is 120-135 thousand rubles.  This amount includes: </p><ul><li>  Accommodation in Silver Forest Room Forest View category apartments (8 days, 7 nights). </li><li>  Breakfast </li><li>  Return flights. </li><li>  Group transfer. </li><li>  Medical insurance. </li><li>  Fuel surcharge. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.kaidee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbit resort pattaya photo" class="if uuid-2976055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2976055.jpg"></div><p>  There are vouchers both cheaper and more expensive.  The exact, final cost depends on the tour operator, number, airline and other nuances chosen by travelers. </p><h2>  Terms of Accommodation </h2><p>  They should be considered at the end of the topic.  It is useful to familiarize yourself with the conditions of accommodation for those people who decided not to buy a tour, but to plan their upcoming trip on their own.  You can select them in the following list: </p><ul><li>  Registration of guests starts at 14:00. </li><li>  Check out lasts until noon. </li><li>  If guests come with children aged 0 to 4 years, then a cot for the baby will be provided for free. </li><li>  All additional guests over 4 years old will have to pay extra.  The daily rates are as follows: child from 5 to 11 - 300 TNV;  all who are older than 12 - 1200 TNV. </li><li>  Pets are welcome at the hotel.  But it is necessary to notify the administration in advance about this, inform which guest the guest will arrive with. </li><li>  When reserving a room, you must provide your personal credit card details.  The hotel accepts JCB, Master Card, Visa and American Express.  A certain portion of the funds may be blocked by the administration until the arrival of travelers as a guarantee. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="rabbit-resort.tophotelspattaya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbit resort pattaya reviews" class="if uuid-2976048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2976048.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, one more nuance.  Accommodation with children under 8 years old is possible only in those apartments that are located on the ground floor, this is the rule of the hotel. </p>
