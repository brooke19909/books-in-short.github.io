Delicate modest flowers, like little suns, cause a smile and warm you.  Chamomile beads will help preserve a piece of summer.  A boutonniere of these flowers will decorate a festive outfit or bag, and a bouquet will enliven the room.  They are simple to execute, so even a beginner can do the job. </p><h2>  Materials for work </h2><p>  There are several techniques for the execution of daisy beads.  For any of them you will need the same set of materials. </p><p>  Beads of white, yellow and green colors.  You can take a small caliber or a larger one - at will. </p><p>  Thin wire for beadwork.  She should keep her shape well.  Additionally, you need a thicker wire for the stem.  It can be replaced with knitting needles, bamboo skewers, used pens from ballpoint pens and other improvised materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="daisies from beads master class" class="if uuid-2537848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2537848.jpg"></div><p>  For winding the stem you need a green floral ribbon.  You can replace it with threads of the same color or a thin strip of corrugated paper.  In order for the winding to hold well, it must be glued at the beginning and at the end with PVA glue. </p><p>  You will also need tools: nippers and scissors. </p><h2>  The easiest way </h2><p>  The easiest way to make daisies from beads is looped.  Even a child can easily cope with it.  It is suitable for making small flowers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  String 25 beads of white color on a 40 cm long wire.  Leave the tip for 5 s, and pass the long end of the wire through the first bead.  Pull the loop.  The first petal turned out.  String 25 beads again and thread through the first bead again, forming a second loop.  They should be as close to each other as possible.  So make 7 petals. </p><p>  For the core, take the yellow bead.  String it on a wire 15 cm long and, having located in the middle, twist the ends. </p><p>  Insert the core in the middle of the workpiece with the petals, evenly surrounding it to make a flower.  Fix the ends of the wire and twist to the very end. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chamomile bead" class="if uuid-2544949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2544949.jpg"></div><p>  Now you need to make a sepal.  String 9 beads of green color on a 40 cm length of wire and make a loop similar to the petals, threading into the first bead.  Continue along the pattern.  Form 6 such loops.  Fix the sepals under the flower and twist the ends of the wire. </p><p>  Leaflets will give the stem volume.  They can be made in the same looped way.  On a 30 cm wire, dial 9 green beads, fold a loop five centimeters from the edge.  Scroll a couple of times one way.  Make the next loop at a distance of 0.5 cm from the first.  Form an odd number of leaflets.  Fold the wire in half, leaving the center loop in the center.  Start twisting, distributing leaflets in pairs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now it remains to finish the assembly.  To a flower already gathered from the core, petals and sepals, start wrapping green thread in tight rows.  Do not forget about the leaflets. </p><p>  Such simple daisies can be used for summer jewelry, making greeting cards, decorating jewelry boxes and gifts. </p><p>  These bead daisies do not make large because they deform quickly. </p><h2>  Bright and simple </h2><p>  Another simple option based on the loop technique looks very impressive.  The following is a step-by-step guide.  Chamomile made from beads and sequins.  This method is simple, but the product is more voluminous. </p><p>  String 15 beads of sequins on 15 cm of wire.  The beginning and end of each row is 2 beads.  Screw the wire into the ring, leaving the end 5 cm. Dial in the same way another 13-15 pairs.  Around the first loop, distribute the second and lock.  It turns out a petal, consisting of two rows.  Thus, 5-7 individual petals are made. </p><p>  Leaflets are formed in the same way.  You can make 2-3 rows, sequentially increasing the number of beads. </p><p>  The core is made of yellow beads.  In this case, the sepals are not required, because the product is already voluminous.  To assemble the flower, connect the petals to the core, twist the wire and attach the leaves.  Make out the stem. </p><p>  Having collected such a bouquet, you can install it in a small vase.  Or ‚Äúplant‚Äù in a pot and pour in a gypsum mixture.  Such a bouquet will be a pleasant gift and a lovely interior decoration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chamomile bead" class="if uuid-2537863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2537863.jpg"></div><h2>  Parallel weaving </h2><p>  Chamomiles made using the <span>parallel weaving</span> technique can be made larger than the option described above.  Their height can reach 45 cm. It is better to choose larger beads. </p><p>  The flower consists of two rows of petals that differ in size. </p><p>  Scheme for the bottom row: on the 35 cm wire, dial 5 beads.  Distribute them in the center.  Thread one end through the last 3 beads towards the other.  It turns out two rows of 2 and 3 beads, and the tails of the wire look in opposite directions.  Next, at one end, collect 4 beads and thread the other end to the meeting.  Up to 9 rows, collect 4 pcs., 10 row - 3 pcs., 11 row - 2 pcs., 12 row - 1 pc.  Twist the ends.  The result is a petal.  9 need to be made of such. </p><p>  Cut off 35 cm of wire.  Pass it through the last bead (12 row) of each petal, and collect them all in a ring.  The ends of all wires to collect in a bundle.  But do not twist. </p><p>  The upper row consists of smaller petals.  They are made according to the following scheme.  1 row - 2 beads;  2 row - 3 pcs.;  3, 4,5, 6, 7 rows - 4 beads each;  8 row - 3 pcs.; 9 row - 2 pcs.;  10 row - 1 pc.  String all the petals over the last bead onto 35 cm of wire and fold into a ring.  Leave the wire bundle untwisted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="simplebeads.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chamomile bead" class="if uuid-2537910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2537910.jpg"></div><p>  The core of chamomile from beads, a master class is given below.  To make it, you will need 40 cm of wire and yellow beads.  Need to make a loop.  To do this, wrap the wire around the finger, leaving 5 cm from one end. String 3 beads on a short tail and 5 on a long tail. Attach the rows tightly to each other and make two turns with wire.  String another 5 beads and screw under the bottom bead.  It turns out that the first row is as if in a ring of two arcs.  For the next row, collect 9 beads for each arc and fix.  Slightly bend the resulting circle to give it volume.  The loop, which was made first, connect to the end of the wire and twist under the core. </p><p>  Make sepals in a looped way, as in daisies made of beads, the master class of which is described at the very beginning. </p><h2>  Leaflets </h2><p>  Leaflets can be done like this.  On 45 cm of wire, collect 5 green beads, arrange them in the middle.  Pass one end through 2,3,4 and 5 bead.  It turns out a "wand."  On one end of the wire, collect 5 beads and pass them through 4 beads, on the other end do the same.  It turns out three branches.  Connect the ends of the wire and collect 5 beads on them.  Again, divide and dial into each of 6 beads.  So repeat several times.  When the central stalk is recruited, it is necessary to string 5 pieces, and each time add one bead to the branches.  Twist the ends.  It turns out a leaf that looks like a flat spruce twig.  For one chamomile, 3 leaves are enough. </p><p>  In order for the flower to keep its shape well, you need to make a small blank.  Cut a circle with a diameter of 2 cm from a plastic bottle. At a distance of 2 mm from the edge, make holes with a hot awl at an equal distance from each other.  The number of holes is equal to the number of petals.  In the center, make another hole for the core.  Insert the prepared petals and the middle, passing the wire from top to bottom.  Smoke the stem under the plastic circle.  From the bottom, screw the sepals, and even lower - the leaves.  To prevent the chamomile from bending, the stem must be reinforced with thick wire.  Wrap a floral tape or thread on top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="step by step daisy bead" class="if uuid-2537857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2537857.jpg"></div><p>  Such flowers are good in a vase. </p><h2>  French daisies </h2><p>  Another option for daisy beads is French weaving.  They can be made both small and large.  String an even number of beads (30) onto a piece of wire.  Leave one end 5 cm. Form a loop, giving it an elongated shape.  On the long end, string half the number of beads (15), secure them with a wire exactly in the center of the previous row, making a couple of turns.  Then dial another 15 pcs and secure at the bottom.  One petal is ready.  The rest are done in the same way.  A flower needs at least 7 pieces.  Connect all the petals into a ring by twisting the wire ends.  You can slightly bend the workpiece, giving the desired shape. </p><p>  For the core, you can use any of the previous options or braid a yellow bead with a bead or carnal button.  A sepal of 6-7 leaves is looped. </p><p>  Leaflets can be made in the same way as the petals, or by any of the options described above. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hobby-country.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="daisy bead master" class="if uuid-2537900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2537900.jpg"></div><h2>  camomile field </h2><p>  It's so simple to make different daisies from beads.  Photos of colors are for inspiration.  You can try each of the options.  Flowers can be made both small and large.  It all depends on the chosen method of weaving and wishes.  Of these flowers, you can make not only bouquets and buttonholes, but also stylish jewelry. </p>
