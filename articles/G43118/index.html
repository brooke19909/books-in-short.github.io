And in recent years, it has become popular again.  People are happy to discover the world of needlework, are fond of this ancient craft. </p><p>  Thanks to new <span>glass processing</span> techniques, it became possible to create a huge number of all kinds of bead options.  The result is truly unique things. </p><p>  Beadwork does not require special tools.  In order to do amazing things, just needles, threads, scissors and, in fact, beads. </p><h2>  Round beads </h2><p>  This is the most common form of beads, which is convenient to use in any type of product.  The main exporters are the Czech Republic and Japan.  There are other manufacturing countries.  The beads from Japan are large, with a wide hole, in shape more like a square.  The Czech is smaller, it is flattened, has a small hole, and in shape it is an oval. </p>

    <p>  Someone prefers to work with one <span>type of beads,</span> someone with another.  Each craftswoman decides for herself what kind of beads she likes.  Nevertheless, it should be remembered that the beads differ in shape and size, which means that they cannot be used in one product. </p><h2>  Bead Coating </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the beads can be of different sizes, textures and colors, it has become so popular.  With it, you can embody all kinds of fantasies, create incredible things. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Beads happen: </p><ul><li>  transparent - it transmits light well and is made of transparent glass; </li><li>  translucent - light is partially transmitted, this type is made of milk glass; </li><li>  opaque - does not transmit light. </li><li>  with a silver line - the hole of such a bead is coated with a mirror coating, which can be either completely silver or silver plated, copper, bronze or gold; </li><li>  with line - the hole is covered with a different color; </li><li>  silk - the glass of such beads is covered with grooves;  it is compared to the "tiger's eye" or silk fabric. </li></ul><p>  The coating gives the beads uniqueness and certain features that emphasize the advantages of the manufactured item. </p><p>  Well, the color.  He can be anything.  Now in specialized stores you can find a huge number of beads of various colors.  And the range is constantly updated.  You just need to choose the best option and start your creativity. </p><h2>  Composition "Lilac" </h2><p>  A variety of beads promotes creativity.  Today we will see how you can make lilacs from beads with your own hands. </p><p>  For the composition you will need: </p><ul><li>  two options for the color of green beads - 100 grams each; </li><li>  two color options for lilac beads - 100 grams each; </li><li>  0.3 mm wide <span>copper wire</span> ; </li><li>  thick wire frame aluminum wire; </li><li>  floristic ribbon; </li><li>  two colors of acrylic paints - black and brown;  can be replaced with gouache; </li><li>  acrylic lacquer;  can also be replaced with any varnish for wood; </li><li>  gypsum or alabaster; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  ordinary paint brushes; </li><li>  art stacks;  but ordinary sticks will do. </li></ul><p>  The main thing is your own desire and great patience.

Even a novice craftswoman can cope with the task. </p><p>  So, to make twigs, you will need beads of two colors of a lilac shade and thin wire.  First you need to mix the beads.  In a random order we string it on a wire. </p>

    <p>  First you need a few beads.  So it will be more convenient to weave.  It is better not to cut the wire from the coil.  If desired, a piece of wire of the desired length can be cut from the coil.  So that the beads do not crumble, a loop is made at one end before starting work. </p><p>  String the right amount of beads onto the wire.  Now you need to retreat from its end by about 3 centimeters and disconnect from the total number of 10 beads.  At this point, twist the wire.  It turns out a loop with beads.  Similarly, we make another 6-8 stitches on the wire.  In total, it should turn out from 7 to 9 pieces, always an odd amount.  The distance between them should be the same, approximately 1.5-2 centimeters. </p>

    <p>  So, we have from 7 to 9 loops of 10 beads in each wire.  Cut the wire from the coil or remove the excess.  Now twist the workpiece into a twig.  The central loop will be the top, the rest are connected in pairs. </p><p>  If you intend to make a large tree, approximately 150 such branches will be required.  And if you want to make a bush of lilac from beads, then 70 pieces are quite enough.  If the first few branches were given with difficulty, then the next ones will work fine. </p><h2>  Make leaves </h2><p>  We continue weaving lilacs from beads.  The patterns for creating leaves are diverse.  Consider a couple of options.  Which one to choose for your composition, decide the craftswoman. </p><p>  In any case, you should first take the beads of two green shades and mix it.  Of course, a thin wire is required. </p><p>  The first version of the leaves is done similarly to branches of lilac.  For a lilac bush, approximately 70 such branches will be required, for a tree - less, somewhere around 50. </p>

    <p>  We continue to weave lilac from beads.  Master class on the second version of the leaves.  First, a loop of 5-6 beads is made.  Then one more loop should be applied on top of this loop.  It will already have about 15-17 beads.  A leaf is a loop in a loop.  Having departed from this leaf 2 centimeters, just twist a few more leaves in the same way.  In total, they should turn out 5-7 pieces on one branch.  It is twisted similarly to the first option. </p><p>  For a bush you need about 100 of these branches, and for a tree - 50 or 60 pieces. </p><h2>  Making lilacs </h2><p>  So, we continue weaving lilacs from beads.  Production patterns are very simple.  It is necessary to take one green and two lilac branches, twist their bases together.  We do the same with all branches. </p><p>  From these branches you can make a bouquet of lilacs.  From beads you can do anything, any composition.  How much fantasy and desire. </p><p>  We will form a tree.  You should twist several branches together.  Be sure to ensure that the direction of twisting coincides.  Otherwise, the branch will be skewed.  On average, 30 branches come out. </p>

    <p>  We continue to weave lilac from beads.  A workshop on making wood suggests that you can not do without scissors, floristic ribbons and wire frame. </p><p>  A sprig of lilac is <span>wrapped with a floral ribbon</span> to the end of the wire.  To form one large branch, 2-3 branches of lilac are attached to the frame.  Similarly, we form the remaining large branches of the future tree. </p><p>  Now you need paint.  It should be remembered that it is better to paint the branches separately, before the formation of the tree itself. </p><p>  When the branches have dried, they are gently twisted together, forming a tree.  The branches need to be connected in a spiral, additionally using a floral ribbon.  It will give us the relief of the trunk, make it more realistic.  We try to eventually get a branchy bush. </p><h2>  Trunk formation </h2><p>  As you can see, there is nothing difficult in weaving lilacs from beads.  Schemes for making a gypsum trunk are also not particularly needed.  You will need some kind of plastic container, gypsum and PVA glue.  Gypsum is diluted with water, add glue to the mixture and stir until a homogeneous mass is obtained.  Consistency should resemble cottage cheese. </p><p>  The formed bush is placed in a container and poured with a gypsum mixture.  Now it will be necessary to hold it in this state until dry.  After making sure that the tree is firmly on the stand, we form the trunk with a plaster mixture.  Using art stacks, draw a bark on a tree. </p>

    <p>  And the finishing touches.  Again we paint the finished barrel, cover it with varnish and decorate as far as imagination is concerned.  These are the ones we get using beads, trees.  The lilac pattern is not the only one.  Similarly, you can create many other compositions. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Beads - an amazing material that allows you to translate the most daring fantasies into reality, you only need to show a little patience and dexterity.  You can weave flowers, bouquets, trees.  Whether it's lilacs or other plants, everything looks amazing. </p>
