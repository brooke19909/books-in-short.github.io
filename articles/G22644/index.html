It is located in the historical region of Bohemia.  It is located in the mountains, not very far from Karlovy Vary.  There are many healing springs in these places. </p><p>  In the 16th century, they were discovered by monks of the Tepla monastery.  And now there are about a hundred different types of healing waters. </p><p>  Usually they get here in this way: by train or by plane to Karlovy Vary.  And from there you can take a taxi or take the bus. </p><p>  In this article we will tell you what hotels there are in Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ and where to stay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Marianske Lazne" class="if uuid-2636933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2636933.jpg"></div><h2>  Marianske Lazne - hotels, general description </h2><p>  Most of the hotels in this resort are located in very beautiful buildings of the nineteenth century.  Many of them are built in the style of the so-called Neo-Renaissance. </p><p>  In 1899, a picturesque colonnade was created in the center of the resort.  All hotels are concentrated around it. </p><p>  Actually, the historical center of Marianske Lazne consists of them, as well as from sanatoriums and hospitals. </p><p>  In total, the resort has about 35 hotels that accept vacationers and those who come for treatment at any time of the year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Caroig, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marianske Lazne Hotels" class="if uuid-2636919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2636919.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels in the center </h2><p>  Choosing a hotel in Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ, you will naturally proceed from your budget and needs.  Many tourists, whom the price is not too embarrassing, pay attention to hotels that are built along Hlavni Trida Street.

Most of the rooms have a view of the colonnade.  In such hotels the European aristocracy loved to stay.  But since they were built over a hundred years ago - and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãamenities then was very different from ours, then they are more amazing in appearance than in comfort. </p><p>  The most interesting and popular among tourists among these hotels is the three-star "Paris".  This hotel is located in a small palazzo, 50 meters from the Colonnade and the singing fountains.  It has a wellness center, spa, a good restaurant and fast wireless Internet, which is included in the price. </p><p>  And the best among hotels of this type is considered to be the Palace Zvon.

For procedures and for medical and sanatorium services, their guests turn to other complexes. </p><p>  Such, for example, a small "Wanted Speedway."  It has simple rooms, delicious breakfasts and a free car park.  What else do backpackers need? </p><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  Prices at Marianske Lazne hotels vary greatly, depending on the class, location of the hotel and the services provided.  As a rule, the price includes both medical procedures and meals. </p><p>  Therefore, traditionally, the price in such hotels is indicated not per room, but per person.  So, a place in Danubis and Frankenstein starts from 5 thousand rubles.  The cost of living and services in the Gallery Suites starts at 6 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Esplanade is even more expensive - from 8,000 rubles.  per person.  The price in the central hotel "Paris" starts from 3 thousand rubles.  The cost per room is indicated, as a rule, in those hotels where there are no spa centers and medical procedures. </p><p>  So, in ‚ÄúSpeedway Hotel‚Äù rooms and for two will cost 1600 rubles per day.  Parking at hotels is also usually paid, although this depends on the administration of the resort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zivykraj.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marianske Lazne Hotels: reviews" class="if uuid-2637023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2637023.jpg"></div><h2>  Marianske Lazne Hotels: reviews </h2><p>  Most of the tourists who came here to relax and be treated like the atmosphere of the resort, as if you are plunging into the ‚ÄúSilver Age‚Äù.  Time flows quietly and imperceptibly. </p><p>  Many noted as a huge plus that most hotels are located in historic buildings and near the center.  Tourists write that almost everywhere employees are very friendly and sympathetic to all requests.  Nurses and doctors are professionals.  Almost everyone speaks Russian. </p><p>  The procedures have a convenient schedule, which allows you to plan excursions.  The food is delicious, the quality of the food is good.  Smiles, silence, clean air and greenery surround you everywhere.  There is the opportunity to take walks, and this is important for people whose price includes a buffet, and they want to monitor their health. </p><p>  The only negative - according to the unanimous opinion of travelers - is that holidays in the Czech Republic end so quickly. </p>
