And children are happy to watch cartoons about people with superpowers.  Only a few years ago, only Batman and Superman were known.  And now the children are asking for the <span>costumes of Spider-Man,</span> Captain America, Wolverine and many others.  Heroes emerged from the shadows, about which until recently, no one had heard.  Among them is Deadpool with a mask completely covering his scarred face in a red and black suit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deadpool mask" class="if uuid-2239473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2239473.jpg"></div><h2 aria-level="1">  Who is Deadpool </h2><p>  This character has already appeared on a wide screen, in several animated series and computer games.  He was once an ordinary man named Wade Wilson.  His past is foggy enough.  He invented the pseudonym Deadpool after he was able to escape from the hospice, where illegal cruel experiments were conducted on him and other patients.  Although it was thanks to these experiments that Wade gained his strength. </p><p>  After the escape, he put on his red suit and Deadpool's mask, under which Wade's disfigured face was hidden, and became a mercenary. </p><h2 aria-level="1">  Deadpool Costume </h2><p>  After receiving superpowers, Wade got involved in many alterations.  Deadpool's red suit and mask appeared after he began working for various crime bosses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many note the similarity of the costumes of Spider-Man and Deadpool.  They even have a very similar color scheme.  Together they can be seen in one of the series of the animated series about Peter Parker. </p><h2 aria-level="1">  DIY Deadpool Costume and Mask </h2><p>  If you or your child want to try on the image of Deadpool, then it is not necessary to go to the store for expensive game paraphernalia.  You can make a completely realistic Deadpool costume and mask yourself. </p><p>  To do this, you will need a red tight-fitting suit, black fabric, scissors, threads, a couple of plastic pistols and swords.  We put on a red tight-fitting suit.  It can be replaced with a red turtleneck and red leggings, the mask can be sewn separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a deadpool mask" class="if uuid-2239477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2239477.jpg"></div><p>  According to Deadpool's photo, we mark with black marker those places that should be painted over with black.  From the black fabric, we cut out the corresponding paired details so that the suit is symmetrical, we carefully sew the elements.  Katanas can be bought at the store or made from cardboard. </p><h2 aria-level="1">  Fabric mask </h2><p>  To make a Deadpool mask, you will need: </p><ol><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  The fabric is red and black. </li><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Tailor's ribbon. </li><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Calibri" data-listid="3" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Scissors, threads, needles. </li></ol><p>  Making a mask yourself is very simple.  Measure the width and height of your head and build patterns in accordance with the measurements.  For a mask, you will need a well-stretched fabric so as not to sew in zippers or buttons. </p><p>  Cut out two elements of the head from red cloth.  Sew them together, leaving a slit of sufficient width at the bottom so you can wear a mask.  Try on the product and outline the places where you want to cut your eyes. </p><p>  Cut out two pieces of black fabric that will be located near the eyes.  Sew them carefully, make slits of a sufficient size.  Your mask is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself deadpool mask" class="if uuid-2239479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2239479.jpg"></div><h2 aria-level="1">  How to make a deadpool mask out of paper </h2><p>  Materials: </p><ol><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Colored cardboard in black and red. </li><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  PVA glue. </li><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Scissors. </li><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Black ribbon or elastic band. </li><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="4" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1">  Pencil. </li></ol><p>  The easiest option is to make a mask out of cardboard.  We take red cardboard, draw a silhouette of the face corresponding to your circumference.  Cut out the mask. </p><p>  On black cardboard we draw the same elements for the eyes, cut out and glue them to the mask. </p><p>  With a pencil, draw the mouth, nose and eyes of the hero.  All lines are outlined with a black marker. </p><p>  We carefully cut out the eyes with scissors.  Turn the mask over and glue the ribbon or elastic band on the back so that the mask rests on the face. </p><p>  It‚Äôs very simple to make a costume for any character in the movie.  Enough to show imagination and try a little! </p>
