Almost half of the world's population wants to be there, and all because in this place is always fun.  Glittering neon signs have already become a real symbol of Las Vegas. </p><h2>  What is Las Vegas famous for? </h2><p>  Once upon a time, the locality received the unofficial status of the largest tourist center in the United States of America.  In Las Vegas, an atmosphere of luxury, excitement and a unique atmosphere has always reigned.  So it was, it is, and most likely it will be for many more years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visittheusa.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Evening city" class="if uuid-2457796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2457796.jpg"></div><p>  The casino in Las Vegas works around the clock, and almost every minute someone becomes a millionaire here, and someone leaves with nothing.  This is precisely the law of the unique Las Vegas. </p><p>  Nevertheless, there is something to do besides the casino.  The city is just an endless stream of noisy shows, alluring entertainment and more.  They say that it is in Las Vegas that you can forget about everyday routine, escape from reality and completely indulge in real unbridled fun. </p><p>  Many are attracted by the brilliance of sparkling luxury hotels, including the most popular of them - the Luxor Las Vegas casino hotel.  Millions of tourists are attracted by this wonderful place.  Las Vegas is not just a city in America, it is a kind of miracle giving endless ease. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic information about the city </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thrillist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Las Vegas from a height" class="if uuid-2455846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2455846.jpg"></div><p>  The city was founded at the beginning of the twentieth century, to be more precise, on May 15, 1905.  For a long time it was a fairly large railway junction, as well as the main point for stopping trains.  Basically, these trains went from west to east.  In modern times, it is very difficult to imagine, since in this place there was only a casino with the name "Main Street Station".  Now all communication here is carried out on cars as well as airplanes. </p><p>  <span>The state of Nevada</span> has long been popular in that there was a lot of freedom, as well as opportunities.  More than a hundred years ago, the most fun weddings were held here, as well as fierce battles.  It was with this that the first gambling began.  But later, such games were banned and this greatly affected the state economy.  In 1931, the decision was quashed and from that moment Las Vegas became a center of luxury and fun. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  All the attractions of Las Vegas are quite modern, but this is no less famous.  In this article, we would like to tell you about those places that are definitely worth seeing, if there is such an opportunity.  After all, many travelers are attracted by the historical sights of the village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sign "Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The famous sign &quot;Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas&quot;" class="if uuid-2455842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2455842.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps, this attraction of Las Vegas wants to see almost every inhabitant of our vast planet.  This famous sign is the first thing a person observes when entering a city.  After all, it is located in the southern part of the Las Vegas Strip.  But this part does not belong to the city limits, it is still necessary to drive about six kilometers to the settlement. </p><p>  The height of the structure is a little more than seven and a half meters.  In the evenings, the sign flashes brightly and hints to future visitors that it is fun in Las Vegas. </p><p>  The sign on this post was installed in the late fifties of the 20th century.  This googie style design was very popular in the forties and sixties in southwestern America.  The author of the sign is Betty Willis, and the local trader Ted Rogich is the customer.  After the construction was completed, it was sold to Clark County, located in the southern part. </p><p>  It is interesting to note that the mark was not registered as copyright, therefore it belongs to the public domain.  Therefore, it could be reproduced around the world on souvenirs and so on. </p><h2>  Las vegas strip </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.reviewjournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Las Vegas Strip from a height" class="if uuid-2455896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2455896.jpg"></div><p>  This is the heart of Las Vegas, the city‚Äôs central mall.  It is here that the most famous hotels, as well as casinos, are located.  The street includes about a seven-kilometer stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  With all this, the street is located outside the city and belongs to the suburbs of Paradise, as well as Winchester.  In addition, it is on this street that the famous sign ‚ÄúWelcome to the fabulous Las Vegas‚Äù is located, which was discussed above. </p><p>  Previously, the casino building in Las Vegas was allowed to be located only on the main street of Fremont Street.  That is what many entrepreneurs have forced to start doing such a business outside the city limits.  The choice fell on the Las Vegas Strip.  The first casino was opened here in 1941, having existed for more than twenty years.  Then the street developed very rapidly in this direction, more and more gambling establishments began to appear here, and there were no parishes from visitors. </p><p>  Currently, there are many different hotels located on the avenue, combining immediately a casino, a shopping center, and an amusement park.  Some of the most popular are the Las Vegas Hilton, as well as Luxor Las Vegas. </p><h2>  Hotel Bellagio </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.roblox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountains at the Bellagio Hotel" class="if uuid-2456892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2456892.jpg"></div><p>  And here is another popular casino hotel located on the Las Vegas Strip.  It was erected on this site at the end of the twentieth century.  It has more than four thousand comfortable rooms.  It is for this indicator that the hotel ranks eleventh in the world. </p><p>  The hotel is currently owned by the famous company MGM Resorts International.  Of course, this place attracts a lot of travelers from different points of our vast planet.  The main reason for this is the beautiful musical fountain located in front of the hotel itself.  It is capable of producing more than a thousand jets, also the fountain is equipped with a huge amount of light.  Every day, tourists, as well as locals, watch the light and music show, it usually starts at lunchtime, and ends around midnight. </p><p>  Since the hotel is quite popular in the United States of America, it is often involved in many Hollywood films.  For example, it can be seen in such popular films as "The Hangover", "Rush Hour 2", "Ocean's Eleven Friends" and this is not a complete list. </p><h2>  Hotel-casino "Luxor" </h2><p>  Hotel-casino "Luxor Las Vegas" is considered one of the most spacious in the whole city.  There are almost 4,500 rooms.  It is built in the style of a thirty-story pyramid.  The height of the building is more than one hundred meters in height.  Tourists are very impressed by the powerful beam breaking out of the top of the pyramid.  It is visible even from the orbit of the earth.  Also in front of the building is an impressive figure of the sphinx. </p><h2>  Fremont Street </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fremont Street in Las Vegas" class="if uuid-2456902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2456902.jpg"></div><p>  Fremont Street is just one of the fantastic sites in Las Vegas.  It is located in Downtown (the old city center).  The street is famous for the presence of a large number of casino hotels, as basically all the central avenues of the village. </p><p>  Fremont Street in Las Vegas appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century, to be more precise, in the year the city itself was founded - 1905. The street was named after the famous inventor, scientist, as well as the military and politician John Charles Freemont.  He once had the nickname "ranger."  John is also known throughout the country for crossing the Las Vegas Valley in 1844. </p><p>  For a long time, Fremont Street was a kind of center of excitement and entertainment.  The mall became less popular after mass construction began in the nineties of the twentieth century and a few miles from downtown towards the Mccaran airport terminal, the tourist center moved to the Las Vegas Strip. </p><p>  Of course, there have been many attempts to attract travelers and citizens in this quarter.  The success was crowned with the construction of Fremont Street Experience.  This is truly a unique system that implements while video on a huge screen.  This screen covers almost the entire street, since it has a fairly impressive size.  Its length is more than 450 meters.  The main sponsor of the construction of this dome is considered to be LG. </p><h2>  "Venetian Las Vegas" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="itaclochard.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Venetian Las Vegas" class="if uuid-2457766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2457766.jpg"></div><p>  As you know, in Las Vegas there are quite a few hotels decorated in the style of European cities.  One of them is decorated in the style of a Venetian palazzo.  This Las Vegas landmark was built at the end of the twentieth century and spent more than one and a half billion dollars on its construction. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there are a lot of restaurants, swimming pools, as well as shops. </p><p>  Here, real gondolas move through artificial canals, and almost real gondoliers float in them.  Usually tourists from this place are always delighted. </p><p>  The hotel lobby is painted with copies of Italian painting.  There are also many interesting columns.  The whole interior looks as if it is already more than a hundred years old, it can hardly be distinguished from the original. </p><h2>  Hotel-casino "Stratosphere" </h2><p>  Las Vegas Stratosphere is another popular attraction.  The casino hotel is built in the form of a tower, which has a height of more than three hundred meters.  The observation deck on it is considered the highest in the whole country.  This complex was built in 1996.  Initially, he did not enjoy much popularity, but later became famous due to its central location.  Due to the fact that competent marketing was conducted here, the hotel quickly gained success.  And now the hotel-casino "Stratosphere Las Vegas" - one of the most popular places in the state. </p>
