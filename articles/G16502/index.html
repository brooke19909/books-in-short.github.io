    <h2>  When did the city appear? </h2><p>  Pittsburgh really has a rich history.  To begin with, it must be said that people lived here even before the settlement of Europeans.  Since ancient times, various <span>Native American tribes</span> lived in this area <span>.</span>  After a long period of time, Europeans began to move to the area where modern Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) is located.  This process began in the 18th century.  Mostly the French were sent to Pennsylvania, who lived in Canada.  They had a goal - to attach this territory to their lands.  Noticing this, the British demanded the withdrawal of French troops.  For some time the confrontation between them continued, but in 1758 the British still prevailed.  In honor of such an important event, a fort called Pitt was laid.  This year is considered the moment of foundation of the city, it is from this time that its age is counted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Now you can go directly to the history of the city itself.  After the construction of the fort, a settlement was formed nearby, which was called Pittsboro.  Initially, the village was called so, it got its modern name a little later, in 1769.  Then part of the territories where the settlement was located was acquired by the heirs of William Penn.  Then there was a constant increase in the population of the village, due to which it quickly developed, and after a short time its scale was already much larger. </p><p>  During the war of 1812, many goods that were previously shipped from England were no longer imported here.  In this regard, glass, bronze and many other materials began to be produced in the city of Pittsburgh.  Pennsylvania, through these military operations, also began to develop rapidly.  At this time, a large number of industrial enterprises were opened. </p><p>  Thus, by the 40s of the 19th century, it had become one of the largest cities in its area.  In 1875, steel began to be produced in Pittsburgh.  The production that was opened here was carried out using the converter process.  The results were simply amazing: by the beginning of the XX century, the city was producing (according to various sources) from one third to half of all steel manufactured in America. </p>
