  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a recorder? Most popular model</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many videographers use audio recorders to record audio tracks, since in most cases they are cheaper and better than professional directional or lavalier microphones.  This article will focus on recorders for recording sound.  You will learn about the most popular models used in videography.  So what is a recorder? </p><h2>  Audio recorder </h2><p>  In the modern world, there are many professions for which you may need an audio recorder.  Among them are musicians, videographers or announcers.  The question of what a recorder can be answered is: this is a device that allows you to record high-quality sound for video.  In addition, recorders can help you record music or songs.  Simply put, a recorder is a voice recorder that records high-quality sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theblog.adobe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Audio Track Example" class="if uuid-3093846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/3093846.jpg"></div><h2>  Best recorder </h2><p>  One of the best on the market are the recorders zoom.  This manufacturer produces many different models.  But one of the most popular recorders for recording sound in terms of price / quality ratio is Zoom H1.  It is a compact, inexpensive and high-quality tool.  Its price does not exceed 10 thousand rubles, which is an excellent value for the market of audio recorders.  The sound received directly from the recorder does not even require additional processing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Technical equipment </h2><p>  The Zoom H1 recorder has two directional microphones in its arsenal, which allows it to record stereo sound.  These microphones have good sensitivity, so the recorder can even be used to record musical instruments.  It can record audio in MP3 or WAV format.  Here, as in any other technique, there are two options: either you record a rather mediocre sound, but save space on the memory card, or you get high-quality sound, but the memory goes away very quickly.  Two gigabytes of memory card are included with the recorder, the volume of which is quite small for recording high-quality sound.  But this issue can be easily resolved by installing a 32 gigabyte memory card on this recorder.  Zoom H1 is powered by a finger battery or battery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cinema5d.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="On-camera microphone" class="if uuid-3093841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/3093841.jpg"></div><p>  He records his voice in a very high quality, minimizes the effect of the volume of the room (when the audio track sounds with an echo), which cannot be said, for example, about some lavalier or directional microphones that require good audio preparation. </p><p>  It also has a function called the "limiter".  It limits the sound volume.  For example, if you set the sound level to not more than 6 decibels, then even if you speak directly into the microphone, the sound volume level will not exceed the value that you set on the "limiter".  Thus, the sound level will always be approximately the same, which will allow you to spend less time on the subsequent processing of the audio track. </p><p>  It can also be used as an on-camera microphone, like a USB microphone, that is, use it for talking on Skype, stream or simply place it on a tripod, connect via USB and use it as a home condenser microphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inta-audio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Computer microphone" class="if uuid-3093848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/3093848.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, you can connect other instruments to this microphone, such as lapel or directional microphones.  You just need to connect the loop to the recorder, put it in your pocket and use it to record sound.  What is the main advantage?  It lies in the fact that for relatively little money you get a quality comparable to expensive radio tags. </p><h2>  Final part </h2><p>  So, in this article, you learned what a recorder is.  We reviewed the best model in the market of audio recorders and figured out the advantages of such a compact device.  Now you can easily talk with friends or acquaintances about what a recorder is and which model is worth paying attention to. </p>
