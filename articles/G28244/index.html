  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Caribbean crisis</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Caribbean crisis is a difficult situation on the world stage that developed in 1962 and consisted of a particularly tough confrontation between the USSR and the USA.  In this situation, for the first time, the danger of war with the use of nuclear weapons loomed over humanity.  The Caribbean crisis of 1962 was a grim reminder that with the advent of nuclear weapons, war could lead to the destruction of all of humanity.  This event is one of the brightest events of the <span>Cold War.</span> <br>  The Caribbean crisis, the reasons for which are hidden in the confrontation between the two systems (capitalist and socialist), the US imperialist policy, the national liberation struggle of the peoples of Latin America, had its own background.  In 1959, the revolutionary movement in Cuba won.  Batista, the dictator who pursued pro-American politics, was overthrown, and a patriotic government led by Fidel Castro came to power.  There were many Communists among Castro's supporters, for example, the legendary Che Guevara.  In 1960, the Castro government nationalized American enterprises.  Naturally, the US government was extremely dissatisfied with the new regime in Cuba.  Fidel Castro declared that he was a communist and had established relations with the USSR. </p><p>  Now the USSR has an ally located in close proximity to its main enemy.  In Cuba, socialist transformations were carried out.  Economic and political cooperation between the USSR and Cuba began.  In 1961, the US government near Playa Giron landed troops consisting of Castro's opponents who emigrated from Cuba after the victory of the revolution.  It was assumed that American aircraft would be used, but the United States did not begin to use it; in fact, the United States threw these troops to their fate.  As a result, the landed troops were defeated.  After this incident, Cuba turned to the Soviet Union for help. <br>  At that time, N. S. Khrushchev was at the head of the USSR. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Upon learning that the United States wanted to forcibly overthrow the Cuban government, he was ready for the most drastic measures.  Khrushchev suggested Castro to deploy nuclear missiles.  Castro agreed to this.  In 1962, Soviet nuclear missiles were secretly deployed in Cuba.  US military reconnaissance aircraft flying over Cuba spotted missiles.  Khrushchev initially denied their presence in Cuba, but the Caribbean crisis was growing.  Reconnaissance planes took pictures of missiles, these pictures were presented to the <span>world community.</span>  From Cuba, nuclear missiles could reach the United States.  On October 22, the US government announced a naval blockade of Cuba.  In the USSR and the USA, options for using nuclear weapons were being worked out.  The world is practically on the brink of war.  Any harsh and rash actions could lead to dire consequences.  In this situation, Kennedy and Khrushchev managed to agree. <br>  The following conditions have been accepted: the USSR removes nuclear missiles from Cuba, the United States removes its nuclear missiles from Turkey (Turkey had American <span>nuclear weapons</span> that could reach the USSR) and leaves Cuba alone.  This is where the Caribbean crisis ended.  The missiles were taken away, the US blockade was lifted.  The Caribbean crisis had important implications.  He showed how dangerous the escalation of a small armed conflict can be.  Mankind clearly began to understand the impossibility of having winners in a nuclear war.  In the future, the USSR and the USA will avoid direct armed confrontation, preferring economic, ideological and other levers.  Countries dependent on the United States now realized the possibility of victory in the national liberation struggle.  It has now become difficult for the United States to carry out frank intervention in countries whose government does not align its interests with those of the United States. </p>
