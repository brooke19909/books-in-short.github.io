Its main feature is the use of ultra-thin film made of durable plastic.  The main effect here is to minimize the impact on key properties of the screen matrix (brightness, contrast, visibility at large viewing angles, etc.).  In addition, as many experts note, this film weighs very little, due to which, in fact, the device itself has become lighter. </p>

    <h2>  Control </h2><p>  The device is controlled by four main buttons located just below the display.  The gadget is turned on by the button located at the bottom end of the case.  Four buttons are endowed with a variety of functions: they can be used to ‚Äúflip‚Äù virtual pages, to work with menus, and to move between different windows of the interface. </p><p>  You can also control the device using the touch screen.  Despite the fact that this option is standard for devices of this type, experts and users who have left feedback on the fact of studying PocketBook 624 talk about the quality of the on-screen control exclusively in a positive way. </p><p>  According to experts, the display is very sensitive to touch, "multi-touch" works fine.  In particular, you can easily change the font size in a book by making a corresponding ‚Äúpinching‚Äù gesture across the screen.  Owners of PocketBook 624, reviews of which can be found on many specialized portals, generally share the experts' positive assessment regarding the screen quality. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Positive feedback in the user and expert environment has also received display specifications.  The diagonal of the gadget screen is 6 inches.  The resolution is relatively small - 800 x 600 pixels.  However, no practical difficulties in the work, as noted by the owners of the device and specialists, this nuance does not predetermine.  In their opinion, these indicators are optimal for a gadget such as PocketBook 624 e-book. User reviews and experts describe the screen resolution as sufficient for comfortable reading of virtual literature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the Film Touch coating, which we already mentioned at the very beginning, the screen implements a number of other high-tech solutions (for example, the E-Ink Pearl concept, which provides the highest quality color gamut and picture detail).  Both experts and users respond extremely positively to the device‚Äôs screen.  The font in virtual books is rated as smooth, nice looking, neat. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Reader is equipped with a battery with a capacity of 1.3 thousand mAh, which is an excellent indicator for devices of this type.  The battery, as noted by experts who tested the device, is able to provide autonomous operation (with an average intensity of use) for about a week.  If you do not use the gadget very actively, the battery charge may last for a month and a half.  Many users who left reviews on the capabilities of PocketBook 624 managed to achieve similar results both in intensive use of the device and when observing it, without active use.  Experts also note that battery performance is largely dependent on the intensity of use of Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  Work with books </h2><p>  There are several ways to load virtual literature into the reader.  Firstly, you can connect the device to a PC via a USB cable.  The reader is defined as an external flash drive.  Many users of PocketBook Touch 624, whose reviews are found on specialized portals, note that the structure of the device‚Äôs disk directories is built logically, and it‚Äôs convenient to use it.  The reader, they note, is endowed with a useful function in the form of automatic recognition of the types of files in which virtual books are usually published. </p>

    <p>  Another option - you can download books via the Internet in specialized directories, going online through a Wi-Fi-module.  Both channels, as noted by users who have studied the functionality that is endowed with the PocketBook 624 e-book (reviews on specialized resources), work reliably. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The main element of the program interface of the reader is the menu on the main page.  It displays books that have just been downloaded, as well as those that have been recently opened.  It is possible to structure their display in the most convenient way for the user.  Book titles, author names, cover (if available) are displayed.  There is a convenient function to search for the desired works.  Among other useful applications preinstalled in the reader, there is an interface for viewing photos, a dictionary, an Internet browser, a scheduler, a note service, a calculator, several games.  Users of the PocketBook 624 Basic Touch, whose reviews we examined, call a large number of preinstalled programs an extremely positive property of the device. </p><p>  Reader owners have the opportunity to work with the popular "cloud" service Dropbox.  All that is needed is to enter your login and password, after which the ‚Äúreader‚Äù will create disk space designed to synchronize files with the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù via the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pocketbook 624 gray reviews" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/527370.jpg" width="564"></div>
