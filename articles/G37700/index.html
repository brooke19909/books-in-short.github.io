  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Marneuli (Georgia): is it worth it to go</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Marneuli (Georgia) - the district center of Marneuli region.  The town is located at a distance of about 30 kilometers south of Tbilisi.  From the center of Tbilisi can be reached by minibus.  The distance from Marneuli to Bolnisi is 22 kilometers, and from the Sadakhlo border crossing - 33. This is the region of Kvemo Kartli, Georgia.  Regular buses from Tbilisi to the Samgori metro station go there from Tbilisi.  Ticket price for 2018 is 2 GEL. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  Economy </h2><p>  The economy of the town of Marneuli (Georgia) is represented by factories and a haberdashery factory.  It produces its own canned food, cheese, butter, reinforced concrete products.  You can get to the city by <span>the Tbilisi</span> -Vanadzor railway.  There are shops, markets, cinemas, shopping centers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="feedyeti.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="marneuli, street" class="if uuid-2539154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2539154.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  Marneuli in Georgia is not considered a tourist town, as its location does not attract travelers to natural attractions, which can not be said about its surrounding villages.  Historically, this city had a different name - Sarvani.  It was renamed in 1952.  The Algeti River flows near the town.  Nearby is the Khrami River.  It was the point of the Georgian offensive in the 1918 Armenian war.  In 2008, the airfield, which survived the bombing, became a modern historical monument. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another attraction of the city was located a little north.  This is the Marabdin field and a memorial to those who died in the battle of Marabdin in 1925, which took place between Georgia and Persia.  This place is famous in history as the place of death of Teymuraz Mukhranbatoni, the brothers Khekheulidze and 9 standard bearers.  The Georgian town of Marneuli is an almost entirely Azerbaijani region.  The rest of the population is Armenians and Georgians.  The population of 20 100 people.  This Muslim city is famous for tomatoes.  From afar, it can be ‚Äúconfused‚Äù with Turkey - there are also teahouses, they drink tea everywhere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marneuli road" class="if uuid-2539150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2539150.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Architectural monuments in Marneuli are few in number.  Sights as if hidden in the area.  Here, near the village of Akhkerpi, an ancient Armenian temple of the 12th century is located.  There is also a monastery of the same time built.  And in the village of Tsopi is a castle.  A special celebrity is the village of Sadakhlo.  Historically important and memorable is his border crossing. </p><h2 aria-level="2">  What else to see? </h2><p>  Tourists will be interested in excursions to places of the Georgian-Armenian war of 1918.  Those who like to plunge into the depths of centuries will be curious to visit the village of Shulaveri, (now Shaumyani).  It remained in history as a place of fighting on December 25-28, 1918.  And in 1921 there were fights of the Soviet 11th army.  Near the city of Marneuli is a small ridge of Yalguja.  They were going to carry out the bombing of Tbilisi from him during the distant battle for the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The era of the Middle Ages did not leave its mark in this city.  However, in the X-XI centuries, this land historically belonged to the Armenian kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget.  Since then, the fortress of Gaga has been preserved. </p><p>  In the town of Marneuli (Georgia) you can get on two routes.  They are both strategically important.  One to Armenia from the Sadakhlo checkpoint, the other to Azerbaijan from the Red Bridge checkpoint.  To the east of the village of Akhkerpi you can visit the remains of the monastery of the 11th century Khoranashat.  This is a rare example of ancient architecture.  These places can be reached by minibus.  The monastery is located on the border with Armenia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ka.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="marneuli building" class="if uuid-2543512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2543512.jpg"></div><p>  A new mosque was opened in 2010 near the town of Marneuli, it is a monument of modern architecture and local pride and attraction. </p><p>  The fortress of Gaga is dilapidated.  She remained a legacy from the Armenian kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget.  Once upon a time there was a whole ancient city.  In the center of this Marneuli there is a fountain.  A few years ago, a modern police building was built.  The city of Marneuli is famous for its tea house.  A few years ago, he became a gift from Azerbaijan.  Tea House is a cultural center.  Nearby is a monument to Nizami and Rustaveli. </p><p>  Reviews about holidays in Georgia, namely in Marneuli, are completely opposite.  Some travelers say that this is a great place where there are not many attractions, but magical nature.  Others - that it‚Äôs not worth going there, it‚Äôs boring for youth.  But one thing is for sure: you need to go, see and draw your own conclusions. </p>
