    <h2>  Signature trains - an interesting ride in comfort </h2><p>  Branded trains run in many directions.  The Moscow-Vologda direction (a distance of about 465 km) was no exception.  The difference between <span>branded trains</span> is that they have a lot of additional services and convenient little things.  The time of their departure and arrival is selected in accordance with the most convenient timetable for passengers. </p><p>  So, now it‚Äôs worth discussing how exactly the branded train Moscow - Vologda differs.  Its full name is Vologda Dawns.  This train has been carrying passengers for many years.  For his long existence, he fell in love with many people and earned their trust due to the comfort and quality of the services provided.  You can even say that he is a kind of symbol of Vologda.  Recently, many innovations have been added, for example, the composition has increased by 13 new cars, including several reserved seats, several transformer cars, and also there is one SV car. </p>

    <h2>  Train timetable </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth knowing what time he leaves and arrives.  As already mentioned, this time in branded trains is selected so as to best meet the needs of people.  Therefore, the Vologda Dawns train leaves daily in the evening.  At 20:20, he begins his journey from the Yaroslavl station and arrives in Vologda early in the morning, at 05:13. </p><p>  Of course, you can choose another option - a regular train, not a branded one.  In this case, the trip may not be as comfortable, however, the timing becomes a little wider.  The first train usually leaves at around 10 a.m., the last at 21:50.  On average, 5-6 trains leave from Moscow to Vologda per day. </p><h2>  Ticket categories and their price </h2><p>  After deciding to hit the road, the question usually arises: which ticket to choose?  When traveling from Moscow to Vologda, it is possible to choose the most suitable option.  There are several categories of tickets: common <span>carriage, reserved seat,</span> coupe and luxury.  At the beginning of 2016, the fare in a common carriage is 600-800 rubles, in a reserved seat - 1100-1700 rubles, in a compartment - 1700-3000 rubles, in a suite - 3900-7000 rubles.  Thus, everyone can choose for themselves the most convenient way to travel. </p>
