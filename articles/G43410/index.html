She was one of the first to develop and develop the resorts of Egypt and Thailand.  In this regard, ‚ÄúSheraton‚Äù is chosen by those tourists who prefer a mixture of retro and modern styles.  But network representation on Koh Samui in Thailand is an exception to the rule.  The hotel was erected in 1987 by another owner and for a long time it was called "Samui Beach Imperial."  In 2006, the Sheraton network bought it and carried out a major reconstruction there.  And the former "Imperial Beach" has become incredibly popular with tourists. </p><p>  Sheraton Samui Resort's overall rating is 8.5 out of 10.  According to some indicators, such as location, staff work, room comfort, hotel rating is even higher - 9 and 9.5.  Let's get to know this hotel better.  Below you will read not only a description of the hotel's services and reviews of tourists about it, but also see real photos of the Sheraton Samui Resort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Samui Resort (Samui)" class="if uuid-3214513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3214513.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Sheraton Samui Resort 5 * is administratively located in Chaweng.  This is the largest settlement on the island of Koh Samui.  He is not well-known because of the large number of cereal establishments.  But the area in which the hotel is located is called Chaweng Noi.  It is a quiet and peaceful area.  No noise from nightclubs reaches here.  Nevertheless, you can get to the hotel from the city on foot - only three kilometers along the beach, a few minutes drive to the songteo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The location of the Sheraton representative office in Koh Samui cannot be described as "on the outskirts."  Nearby there is a grocery store, scooter rental, tour desk.  Chaweng Noi differ from the lowland Chaweng relief.  Here the road goes up and breaks off to the sea with rocky ledges.  All tourists say that the landscape of Chaweng Noi resembles Lamai - the same smooth boulders hewn by the sea, water, reminiscent of cream in color.  It takes about 10 minutes to get to Samui Airport (in the north of the island) from the hotel. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="9.504824" data-lng="100.05519400000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/3/3/7/17337.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Sheraton Samui Resort Hotel is located on the slope of one of the coastal hills.  But do not worry that you have to overcome several hundred steps to get to the sea.  As tourists assure of the reviews, from the topmost building (where the entrance is from the highway) to the beach is only 200 meters away. Along the slope there are paths along which it is a pleasure to walk.  The entire territory of the hotel is a tropical garden, with flowering exotic plants, a complex of cascades and ponds with goldfish.  With all this riot of greenery, the guests did not notice the mosquitoes. </p><p>  If it‚Äôs really difficult for you to overcome the distance from the beach to the room, then you can use the free golf car service.  The territory is conditionally divided into Upper Hill and Lower.  There is a building, almost standing by the beach.  The hotel has two swimming pools, a kids club, a spa complex, a tennis court, 4 restaurants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms.  Room Categories </h2><p>  The Sheraton Samui Resort has 141 rooms.  Premises are divided into eight categories.  The lowest price is deluxe garden garden. "  The balconies of these rooms overlook the garden, and there are rooms in the buildings on the Lower Hill, not far from the kids club and fitness center.  Deluxe Ocean View is next to the reception and the Coco Spice main restaurant.  Also nearby is a garden pool.  The disadvantage of this room is the distant location from the beach, on the Upper Hill.  But these rooms have an undeniable advantage - a panoramic view of the Gulf of Thailand. </p><p>  But the sea view is not only in this category of premises.  Premium Ocean View rooms also have panoramic views of the expanse of water, only they are closer to it - on the Lower Hill.  Junior suites are also located there.  On the ground floor of the upper building, with direct access to the garden pool, are Garden Retreat rooms.  Do you dream of living right on the beach?  The hotel has such a two-story building.  Beachside studio rooms are located on the lower level, while oceanfront suites are located on the upper level.  These latter are divided into one and two bedroom apartments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Samui Resort (Thailand)" class="if uuid-3214516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3214516.jpg"></div><h2>  Sheraton Samui Resort: room description </h2><p>  The technical equipment of the rooms fully complies with the requirements of the "five". All rooms have either balconies or terraces.  They have armchairs and a coffee table.  In the suites on the balconies there was a place for a jacuzzi.  It is interesting - and in reviews of this it is repeatedly mentioned - that there are light-protective curtains not only on the windows, but also on the outside.  That is, you can close the curtain and the balcony to enjoy privacy.  The bathrooms in the hotel rooms have both a shower cabin and a bathtub. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The bedrooms are stylishly decorated.  In them you will find not only a comfortable bed, but also a TV with a LCD screen, a DVD player, air conditioning, a coffee maker or an electric kettle, a safe, a minibar and a telephone.  All rooms have free Wi-Fi.  But about this service, some tourists were unsatisfied.  To connect to the network, they had to go to the lobby on the Upper Hill.  As additional services, you can recall the hairdryer, bathrobes and slippers, an umbrella.  The suites have a small patio, as well as a living room with upholstered furniture.  An iron with ironing board and even a fumigator are provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.makemytrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Samui Resort - room description" class="if uuid-3214505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3214505.jpg"></div><h2>  Catering establishments </h2><p>  Sheraton Samui Resort has 4 restaurants on site.  Three of them have a la carte service.  One of these restaurants, Long Talai, specializing in seafood, is located right on the beach.  But breakfast, which is included in the price, is served at Coco Spice on Upper Hill, in the reception building.  This should be considered for those who want to walk less on the slopes. </p><p>  This restaurant has a spacious terrace near the garden pool.  So you can have breakfast both in the air-conditioned room and in the open air.  In addition to restaurants, you can have a snack in the bars.  Especially in the lobby, where professionally brewed coffee and pastries are served.  And in the beach bar (which is part of Long Talai), you can enjoy cocktails and various dishes throughout the day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marriott.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Samui Resort - Restaurant" class="if uuid-3214523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3214523.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  All tourists praise breakfast at the Sheraton Samui Resort.  There are three kinds of croissants alone!  Vacationers with children claim that for breakfast they also gave dietary dishes - cereals, cereals, yoghurts.  The chef makes eggs or scrambled eggs with various additives according to your desire.  Tourists were struck by the fact that here they give soup for breakfast.  In a word, you can eat up to the dump and not feel hungry until the evening.  Sweet tooth praises pastries, and healthy food advocates praised a wide variety of fruits and fresh vegetables. </p><p>  Some tourists left reviews about the beach restaurant.  Visitors liked the romantic atmosphere, impeccable service, seafood dishes.  The beach bar serves excellent cocktails.  But the prices in hotel restaurants "bite."  Therefore, guests appreciated the availability of a kettle in their room.  Drink bags and water bottles are replenished daily.  A few meters from the hotel there are food shops "7/11" and "Family Markt".  In them you can buy both products (as well as basic necessities) and ready-made dishes.  There are microwave ovens right in the store where you can warm up your bought food and containers with ice for drinks. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The beauty of the local water area is best conveyed by the photo.  Sheraton Samui Resort is located between Chaweng and Lamai.  Excursions are specially brought to the beach of the latter to look at the "grandmother" and "grandfather" - boulders polished by the waves.  The color of water due to sand is pale azure.  So - Chaweng Noi beach is no worse than Lamai.  Only he is less.  The beach strip stretches for about a kilometer, and the width of the coast reaches 40 m. And the same snow-white sand, as in Lamai! </p><p>  What do tourists say about the features of the water area?  Low tides in this part of the island are weakly expressed.  Depth does not come immediately, there is the opportunity to wallow in shallow water.  But the kids need to carefully walk around the boulders.  Large stones come under the water.  They create a problem when a storm at sea - can hit a wave on a boulder.  Then it‚Äôs worth moving a few dozen steps towards Chaweng, where there are no stones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Samui Resort - photo" class="if uuid-3214521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3214521.jpg"></div><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  In reviews of Sheraton Samui Resort, tourists mention that there are two swimming pools in the hotel, except for the one owned by the Spa.  The first pool, with hydromassage elements, is located on the Upper Hill, near the main restaurant.  It is surrounded by a beautiful garden and filled with fresh water.  But most of all, the lower, or the beach pool won praise.  It is filled with sea water.  The pool is located in such a way that when you swim in it, you get the impression of swimming in the ocean. </p><p>  Hotel guests praised the fact that beach towels here are issued not on deposit and not in exchange for cards.  As soon as you approach the lounger, a special employee immediately appears, laying the bed for you.  And this great practice works both at the pools and on the beach.  For children, both tanks have a shallow water area.  There are several bali troubles on the shore, but their use is paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Samui Resort 5" class="if uuid-3214500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3214500.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  For the youngest guests Sheraton Samui Resort (Thailand) provide cots and high chairs in the restaurant.  There is a playground on site.  For a fee, you can donate your child to the care of animators from the mini-club.  At the Glow Spa, guests can use the sauna and hammam free of charge.  The reception desk is open around the clock, and its staff speak several languages.  At late check-out you can put things in the left-luggage office. </p><p>  Bring racquets and balls with you - there is a tennis court on site.  It is only necessary to pay for using it in the evening hours.  But you can freely work out in the gym.  Of the games available are table tennis and darts, volleyball, non-motorized water sports.  For a fee, the hotel provides a shuttle service to the airport and Tesco Lotus Shopping Center in Lamai. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Samui Resort (Thailand, Samui)" class="if uuid-3214520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3214520.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Several iconic sights of Koh Samui are located near the hotel.  Sheraton Samui Resort 5 * is located near Silver Beach (Silver Beach), which can be reached on foot.  Lamai is also a very interesting place.  You can go to the Hin Ta Hin Yai Temple, where the mummy of a Buddhist monk is located.  And if the spirituality of the East does not tempt you, to come off at a foamy party at the full moon of Full Moon Party on Rin Beach.  Elephant farms, monkey nurseries, waterfalls, a fishing village, a statue of the Big Buddha - in Koh Samui there is something to do for an inquisitive tourist.  If you would like to wander around the neighboring islands, and, first of all, visit Koh Phangan, then Nathon Marina is located 14 km from the hotel. </p><h2>  General reviews of Sheraton Samui Resort 5 * </h2><p>  Those who stayed here were not disappointed with the choice of hotel.  Guests loved the spacious rooms and the quality of cleaning.  Everyone was impressed by the lower seawater pool.  Tourists have a double opinion about the beach.  Many people like him very much.  But there are those that prevented boulders from entering the water, especially when the sea is rough.  The location of the hotel was highly rated by all guests.  All the party places of Chaweng are close, but at the same time there is no noise-din and does not stink of sewers (a long-standing problem of this city). </p>
