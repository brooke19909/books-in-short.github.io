    <h2>  What are the shortcomings of the hotel noted by tourists? </h2><p>  Hotel Ola Club Maioris 4 * reviews get not only good.  Some of them talk about significant shortcomings of rest in this place.  Tourists highlight the following disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  The beach is very far away.  If you walk, then on the way back you need to climb the high stairs.  It is very difficult for children and elderly people to go this way every day. </li><li>  The bottom of the sea is uncomfortable, there are a lot of stones and large boulders, so it‚Äôs worth swimming only in shales.  In the presence of large waves, children can injure themselves on stones. </li><li>  The nearby infrastructure is poorly developed.  There are several shops and cafes, but all the entertainment is removed from the complex. </li><li>  Small rooms that need repair.  In some of them, plumbing in the bathroom does not work well. </li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Hotel Ola Club Maioris 4 * will be a good option for relaxing in Mallorca.  It offers accommodation at low prices, while providing a high level of service.  Its only significant drawback is its location.  The complex is located at a considerable distance from the beach and the resort center.  Nevertheless, it can be recommended to those tourists who are looking for a relaxing holiday or who wish to save on it. </p>
