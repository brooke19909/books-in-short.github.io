And this is despite the fact that the Internet is very popular.  Meanwhile, television technology also does not stand still. </p><p>  Once it all started with black-and-white broadcasting, then it was replaced by color televisions, in fact, which we still use.  The usual kinescope TVs have not disappeared from store shelves, although they have long been out of fashion, as they have been replaced by modern LCD TVs.  A few years ago they were in short supply, only rich people could afford to buy them.  Today, everything has changed: pleasing is the abundance of TV models and affordable prices. </p><p>  Such <span>well-known brands</span> as Samsung, LG, Philips, Toshiba, Sharp and others are engaged in the production of <span>LCD TVs</span> . True, the choice of an LCD TV requires some knowledge, so that later you do not have to be disappointed with the purchase.  What parameters should I pay attention to?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><p>  <strong>LCD TV diagonal</strong> </p><p>  If you are planning to buy such a television receiver, be sure to think about where you will have it.  The size of the screen diagonal you need will largely depend on this.  Today on sale you can find LCD-TVs with a diagonal of 14 inches.  Until recently, its largest size was 42 inches, but models with a figure of 50 inches have already been released.  You should not chase large-sized LCD TVs if the room where you are going to install it is small.  You can determine the size as follows: while watching your favorite shows, the distance between you and the picture should be about 2.8 meters.  The choice of 32-inch LCD TV is one of the best for apartments, but for a private house in which there is a spacious living room, you can choose a TV with a much larger diagonal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Screen format</strong> </p><p>  There are currently two main LCD screen formats.  The first - 4: 3 - is used to broadcast conventional programs.  The second - 16: 9 - is used to watch DVD movies.  If the TV model does not support a wide format, while watching a movie, the picture will be stretched to full screen, cutting off along the edges.  You can buy a TV with the largest format, but be aware that in the case of watching ordinary programs, their picture will be somewhat cropped from the bottom and top. </p><p>  <strong>Resolution</strong> </p><p>  The choice of an LCD TV must necessarily affect this setting.  Television broadcasts are broadcast in 720x576 resolution.  But if the use of a TV in your case is not limited to watching analog broadcasts, for example, you are going to watch DVD movies, digital broadcasts, then the resolution should be 1920x1080 pixels. </p><p>  <strong>Contrast and brightness</strong> </p><p>  Both of these indicators are important, since it depends on them how high-quality the image on the screen will be.  Choosing an LCD TV will allow you not to regret your purchase later.  The screen contrast should be at least 800: 1.  True, in modern models it is already higher, but it's still worth paying attention.  But the brightness should be at least 450 cd / m2.  You can learn about these parameters from the technical characteristics of the model. </p><p>  <strong>Response time</strong> </p><p>  To make the right choice for an LCD TV, be sure to find out how long the response time of <span>liquid crystals is.</span>  The faster it is, the higher the quality of the picture.  But at the same time, the response time should not exceed 8 ms. </p><p>  <strong>What else to look for</strong> </p><p>  Of course, the sound.  It must be of high quality.  And for this, a 2-cavity <span>speaker system</span> based on four speakers should be built into the TV.  Also find out what viewing angle in the model in question.  It depends on what the picture quality will be if you watch TV not from the center, but from the side.  Feel free to take the TV if its viewing angle is about 178 degrees. </p><p>  And the last - the choice of an LCD TV consists in inspecting the outputs that are available in one or another model.  There must be connectors for connecting digital devices.  It's about DVI and HDMI.  Well, it is mandatory to have standard outputs: SCART, composite and component output, S-Video. </p>
