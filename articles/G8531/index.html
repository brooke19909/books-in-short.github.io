  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Organic substances their characteristics and classification</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong>Organic substances</strong> are those compounds that incorporate a Carbon atom.  Even at the early stages of the development of chemistry, all substances were divided into two groups: mineral and organic.  In those days, it was believed that in order to synthesize organic matter <strong> </strong>  it is necessary to have an unprecedented ‚Äúvitality‚Äù, which is inherent only in living biosystems.  Therefore, the synthesis of organic substances from minerals is impossible.  And only at the beginning of the 19th century F. Weller refuted the existing opinion and synthesized urea from ammonium cyanate, that is, he received organic matter from mineral.  Then, a number of scientists synthesized chloroform, aniline, acetate acid and many other chemical compounds. </p><p>  Organic matter underlies the existence of living matter, and is also the main food for humans and animals.  Most organic compounds are raw materials for various industries - food, chemical, light, pharmaceutical, etc. </p><p>  Today, more than 30 million diverse organic compounds are known.  Therefore organic matter <strong> </strong>  represent the most extensive class of <span>chemical compounds.</span>  A variety of organic compounds is associated with the unique properties and structure of Carbon.  The adjacent Carbon atoms are bonded to each other by single or multiple (double, triple) bonds. </p><p>  <strong>Organic <span>matter</span></strong>  <strong><span>Chemistry.</span></strong> </p><p>  <span>Organic compounds are</span> characterized by the presence of C ‚Äì C covalent bonds, as well as polar C ‚Äì N, C ‚Äì O, C ‚Äì Hal, C ‚Äì metal, etc. covalent bonds.  Reactions taking place with the participation of organic substances have some features in comparison with mineral ones.  Inorganic compounds usually involve ions.  Often such reactions pass very quickly, sometimes instantly at the optimum temperature.  In reactions with <span>organic substances</span> , molecules <span>are</span> usually involved.  It should be said that in this case, some covalent bonds are broken, while others are formed.  As a rule, these reactions proceed much more slowly, and for their acceleration it is necessary to increase the temperature or use a catalyst (acid or base). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How are organic substances formed in nature?  Most of the organic compounds in nature are synthesized <span>during photosynthesis</span> from carbon dioxide and water in chlorophylls of green plants. </p><p>  <strong>Classes of organic substances.</strong> </p><p>  <span>The classification of organic substances is</span> based on the theory of O. Butlerov.  Systematic classification is the foundation of the scientific nomenclature, which makes it possible to name organic matter based on the existing structural formula.  The classification is based on two main features - the structure of the carbon skeleton, the number and location of functional groups in the molecule. </p><p>  The carbon skeleton is a part of the molecule of organic matter that is stable in various <span>chemical reactions</span> .  Depending on its structure, all organic substances are divided into groups. </p><p>  Acyclic compounds include substances with a straight or branched carbon chain.  Carbocyclic compounds include substances with cycles, they are divided into two subgroups - alicyclic and aromatic.  Heterocyclic compounds are substances whose molecules are based on rings formed by Carbon atoms and atoms of other chemical elements (Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulfur), heteroatoms. </p><p>  Organic substances are also classified by the presence of functional groups that are part of the molecules.  For example, classes of hydrocarbons (exception - their molecules do not have functional groups), phenols, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, amines, esters, carboxylic acids, etc.  It should be remembered that each functional group (COOH, OH, NH2, SH, NH, NO) determines the physicochemical properties of this compound. </p>
