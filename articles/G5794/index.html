And one of such quiet and comfortable places on the sea coast can be the picturesque resort of the Republic of Abkhazia - New Athos. </p><h2>  New Athos Resort </h2><p>  Due to some remoteness from the border with the Russian Federation, the number of holidaymakers here is much less than in many resorts in Abkhazia.  The tourist infrastructure in New Athos is just developing.  There are no huge shops and hypermarkets, numerous annoying entertainment on the beach, already a long time familiar city bustle.  But in abundance there are natural pebble beaches, clear water in the sea, located within walking distance of architectural and religious attractions and unique landscapes with amazing vegetation, waterfalls and small ponds. </p><p>  But in order not to spoil your vacation with unpleasant trifles, it is very important not to make a mistake with the choice of your place of residence.  Many Abkhazian hotels were built in Soviet times, and at the moment they need to improve the condition of their housing stock and the level of services provided.  They should not be considered for placement. </p><p>  First of all, you need to pay attention to new hotels and mini-hotels, which in recent years have appeared in resorts in connection with the active development of the tourism industry.  Here tourists are offered comfortable rooms, quality food, wonderful service.  A worthy option for a good rest can be the hotel "Villa Owl." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Many tourists who visited the 3 * Villa Sova hotel are even ready to assign a lot more stars to it.  But, as vacationers also write, there is no need to dwell on the results achieved, since there are still moments that are worth working on. </p><h2>  Cons of the hotel (according to some vacationers) </h2><ol><li>  Poor soundproofing in the room. </li><li>  The TV shows 2-3 channels. </li><li>  Unstable and weak Wi-Fi signal. </li><li>  In the dining room, hot dishes happen to be served already cooled. </li><li>  On the beach, it happens that the shower does not function.  The reason for the inoperability is not explained. </li></ol><p>  Hotel ‚ÄúVilla Sova‚Äù (Abkhazia) is the best option in terms of price and quality for families with children and people who want peace and quiet.  Here guests will pay only for those services that they really need on vacation.  The hotel can be safely recommended to your relatives and friends. </p>
