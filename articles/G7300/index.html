    <h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  The construction of the first Moscow City building was started in 1996.  It became the ‚ÄúTower 2000‚Äù, which was commissioned in 2001.  After it, the new buildings of the Expocenter and the Evolution skyscraper were also built.  Finally, in 2006, the foundation was laid for a multifunctional business complex.  The new skyscraper was called the tower "Empire" ("Moscow City").  After 5 years, with the participation of officials holding important posts in the capital's city hall, a grand opening ceremony of this building was organized, and in 2013 construction of the second stage of the project also began, completion of which is expected in the near future. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Empire Tower (Moscow-City) is located in convenient transport access from all areas of Moscow, on Presnenskaya Embankment.  There is direct access to it both from the Moskva River and from the pedestrian zone of the MIBC.  Due to this circumstance, the Imperia skyscraper has an advantage over other objects in the Moscow-City district.  The Empire Tower is a five-minute walk from the Bagration pedestrian bridge and from the Vystavochnaya metro station.  In addition, from there you can easily get to the Afimol shopping center and further to other objects of the Moscow-City district without having to go outside, which is important, especially in the cold season. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Moscow City Empire Tower stands out architecturally from neighboring structures, although its dimensions are not as impressive as, for example, the height of the Mercury City Tower or Eurasia.  It is made in hi-tech style and is an ellipse inscribed in a rectangle with mirror glazing.  The skyscraper is slightly tilted north to provide better daylight inside the building.  Most of the common areas are finished with expensive materials such as precious wood, metal, marble and other natural stones. </p>
