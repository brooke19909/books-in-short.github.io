This specialist is developing software for a wide variety of types of computer equipment.  You can engage in such activities on your own (working alone) or as an employee of a specialized company. </p><p>  Now almost every enterprise is faced with the question of automation of management.  This specialist is a kind of connecting link between a leader who has his own plans for the development of production and the modern world of computer technology. </p><h2>  What are the programmers? </h2><p>  Usually, experts are divided into two large-scale categories.  The first are application programmers.  They develop programs, debug software mechanisms.  The second - system, engaged in the full development of software. </p><h2>  How did you get it? </h2><p>  The term ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù itself arose with the advent of the first computing mechanism.  Such a computer novelty was Mark-1.  It was developed in 1944.  For several decades, the profession managed to become very popular and well paid.  Programmer salary <strong> </strong>  already then was one of the highest.  It is not surprising, because then computer knowledge was available only to the greatest chosen minds. </p><h2>  What <span>personal qualities</span> should possess? </h2><p>  A programmer must be a very mobile person.  In the world of high technology, new items often come out, hardware and software specifications are updated.  A good specialist should always be aware of these changes.  That is why the ability to grasp everything on the fly, to quickly learn and self-improve is one of the main personal qualities of a programmer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The salary of such a specialist may be different.  The average salary of a programmer <strong> </strong>  calculated on two factors: place of work and qualifications.  But sometimes, even with the same qualifications of employees, the difference between a good and a bad job can be quite significant. </p><p>  According to estimates, on average in cities with a population of more than a million, a programmer receives 20% more than the same specialist from the province.  Specific Amounts: $ 2,000 per month - salary for a good employee.  A person working directly with customers has about twice as much, respectively, newcomers to the field - less.  Western companies that focus on the international market tend to pay more.  Remember that the programmer‚Äôs salary <strong> </strong>  and its increase depends on your ability to develop. </p>
