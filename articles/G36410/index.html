DIY crafts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Incredibly much you can think of for your children interesting fun and educational games.  Plain stationery is an excellent craft material.  All it takes is a little time. </p><p>  How to make a puzzle out of paper?  Is it difficult for primary school children?  Here are some examples of folding puzzles for children. </p><h2>  Paper jigsaw puzzle </h2><p>  It is important to interest the child in crafts from an early age.  The world of virtual games is not very useful for development.  But work with paper and scissors will develop both the imagination and motor skills of fingers, and the desire to do something with your hands, and not just watch cartoons.  Also, engaged in such creativity, children develop memory and neural connections that will help them continue to learn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="art-b-c.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts scheme" class="if uuid-2235951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2235951.jpg"></div><p>  Many interesting things are made of paper.  Various kusudamas, toys and puzzles.  But, of course, before you teach a child, you have to learn how to make crafts yourself. </p><h2>  Types of puzzles for primary school children </h2><p>  Let's move on to practice.  How to make a puzzle out of paper?  We always start by choosing the scheme you like. </p><p>  Serious origami kusudamas for younger children are difficult, but puzzles such as tangrams, flexagons, various folding paper transformers for children can do.  Let us describe a few simple paper puzzles, schemes, and methods for constructing them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Miracle triangle </h2><p>  So how to make a puzzle out of paper?  Grade 4 will cope or not with the task?  For a child, it doesn't matter how much the puzzle costs.  He will be interested to think with you about the task that you will give him.  Cut a regular triangle out of hard cardboard and ask the child to divide it into 4 sectors so that a square is formed from these parts. </p><p>  The task has a name - "haberdasher's puzzle", because the author of the puzzle first cut such a triangle from a piece of fabric, and then he himself did not know whether the square would form or not.  But still, the quadrangle can be folded quite realistically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gamejulia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the triangle turns into a square" class="if uuid-2235964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2235964.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a haberdasher puzzle out of paper?  This is pretty easy.  Using a stencil, draw a triangle on the cardboard and draw it as shown.  This is the solution to the problem. </p><p>  An adult needs to cut the pieces and decorate them with any colored paper so that the details look more interesting for the child.  And then ask your child to assemble from these parts first a triangle, and then a square. </p><h2>  Puzzle toy </h2><p>  How to make a puzzle out of paper that can be assembled, glued and turned into a toy?  Try together with your child to collect 12 elements of different colors or 4 elements of 3 color shades.  And let the little know-it-yourself make a circle out of them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="slplkids.wordpress.com" data-author=": KAREN Y, "><img itemprop="image" alt="puzzle farrevorks" class="if uuid-2235842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2235842.jpg"></div><p>  If you can‚Äôt put the parts together so that they hold tight, you can glue the corners together.  However, it will be ugly if spots of glue are visible.  All parts must have exactly the same dimensions - millimeter to millimeter, otherwise the elements will turn out curves and it will be difficult to fold them. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="p9xKxEV1FkY" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9xKxEV1FkY" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/5/6/256.jpg"></div><p>  And the craft turns into a wonderful color puzzle toy called fireworks origamy.  The circuit is very simple. </p><p>  The child, perhaps, after you put the first craft with him, the rest will already be added on his own.  You only need to interest the baby. </p><h2>  <span>Hexaflexagon.</span>  <span>How to make a</span> paper puzzle with your own hands? </h2><p>  A puzzle such as hexaflexagon is made from cut ordinary stripes of paper.  This is also very interesting for students 3 or 4 years of study.  How to make a paper puzzle with your own hands?  To work, you need to print a sheet with a graphic design blank or, by example, make the same. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": Shari Collins‚Äè, "><img itemprop="image" alt="flexo circuit" class="if uuid-2235843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45296/2235843.jpg"></div><p>  How to make this type of puzzle out of paper?  The selected workpiece is folded into a polyhedron.  Sectors, united together, make up a certain pattern when the toy is turned out. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="WOGJS0ln-bc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&amp;v=WOGJS0ln-bc" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/7/0/270.jpg"></div><p>  Each puzzle surface consists of 6 triangular sectors.  There are schemes according to which they carry out a puzzle for 9 and even 12 drawings.  But more often they make the simplest one - on 3 or 6 planes with drawings. </p><p>  Hexaflexagon is a polyhedron with 6 patterns.  Since paper erases quickly, it is best to use hard cardboard. </p><p>  The drawing should be interesting for your child.  Think about which characters he likes and draw them.  Then you need to cut each into 6 triangles and stick on those planes that will make up a separate picture. </p>
