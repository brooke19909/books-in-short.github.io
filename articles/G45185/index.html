You can spend time with family, and you can also with friends.  The main thing is to find a place where you can find peace and harmony.  It can be some kind of entertainment complex, cinemas, museums, a luxurious restaurant or just a country party in a cottage in the country.  But nothing compares to relaxing in a sauna or a bathhouse.  What are such procedures good for?  The fact that here you relax not only with your soul, but also with your body.  The human body is completely freed from all unclean things: dirty thoughts, sweat, and so on.  Consider what a sauna is. </p><h2>  Cleansing the whole body </h2><p>  Sauna is a certain room with dry and wet steam.  The high temperatures allowed for the human body allow you to sweat, as a result of which pollution and dust come out from the surface of the skin with sweat.  Due to this, the pores open and the epidermis is cleansed. </p>
