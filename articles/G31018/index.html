For example, if we are talking about a situation in which several plastics are tied to one number.  This is not the most common, but practical option. </p><p>  The previous instructions will not help.  It is suitable only for cases when only one card is attached to the number.  Therefore, you have to act differently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onlinevbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer through Internet banking" class="if uuid-2361228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2361228.jpg"></div><p>  The algorithm of actions will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Start writing a message on the phone. </li><li>  Form according to the following principle: "the sum is the last 4 digits of the plastic." </li><li>  Send SMS to the short number already known to us. </li></ol><p>  So quickly and without problems, a person will be able to write off money for a specific phone from the selected plastic.
