This region has a great tourist potential, and it is far from being fully utilized.  Not far from Yekaterinburg, the capital of the Ural region, the Volchikhinsky reservoir is located.  How to get to him, no one needs to explain.  Most residents of the largest industrial city of the Urals have recognized the road to its picturesque shores since its inception.  This is one of the favorite vacation spots for several generations of citizens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="volchikhinskoe reservoir how to get there" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/246235.jpg" width="496"></div>  Volchikhinsky reservoir.

    <p>  This is an <span>artificial reservoir.</span>  It was formed in 1944 as a result of the construction of a dam on <span>the Chusovaya River.</span>  Its purpose was purely practical - to ensure uninterrupted water supply to the largest industrial center of the Urals.  But the dam was built on the famous Ural river in a very beautiful place.  And the reservoir was concluded between very picturesque shores.  So, in many ways, this tourist attraction, popular in the Middle Urals, arose - the Volchikhinsky reservoir.  How to get to it?  The answer to this question has become relevant for many citizens and residents of neighboring areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="volchikhinsky reservoir fishing" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/246238.jpg" width="480"></div>  You can get here from several directions.  From the capital of the Urals, you should go along the Moscow highway and, without reaching Revda, turn according to the signs in the direction of <span>the</span> Green Cape <span>recreation center</span> .  Volchikhinsky reservoir stretches more than twelve kilometers.  You can get to him from Yekaterinburg by train by train, which stops in several places right on its shore.  And there is also a place to rest here, you can do it on different beaches and islands.  In total, there are more than a dozen diverse <span>recreation centers</span> and permanent tourist camps.  In former times, these were recreation areas owned by various departments.  And now they operate on a commercial basis.  But, if you want to just stay on the shore in a tent, this can also be done without any problems. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green cape volchikhinskoe reservoir" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/246236.jpg" width="498"></div>  Volchikhinsky reservoir.

    <p>  The water area and coast of the reservoir have official status of a hydrological and botanical natural monument.  Fishing here is allowed only by amateur means.  In the whole middle Urals, it is difficult to find another place as favorable for fishing as the Volchikhinsky reservoir.  How to get here fishing and where to throw fishing rods, it is best to ask those who are here constantly.  But on the shores of such places are many.  And in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir there are more than a dozen islands of different sizes.  Fish pecking on them, as a rule, is even better than on the shore.  Most successfully caught here are pike, perch, ide, roach and bream.  The local bream is especially famous for the fact that both in size and culinary qualities significantly exceeds its counterparts caught in other reservoirs of the Ural region.  Fishing on the Volchikhinsky reservoir occurs year-round.  Ice fishing is no less popular. </p>
