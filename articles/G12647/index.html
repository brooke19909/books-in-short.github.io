    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Before you purchase a phone, you need to study its functions.  For starters, it is recommended to pay attention to the operating system.

Also, users are faced with the fact that some devices have a stylus.  In the original models, it is not provided in the configuration, since all phones are controlled with a finger. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to check iPhone 6 for originality?

It is located on the side face.  It is equipped with a special lock, which opens with a clip provided in the kit. </p><p>  Are you interested in how to check for originality iPhone 6 plus and other modifications?  Pay attention to the diagonal of the display.  In the sixth version, it is 4.7 ∫.

Based on this data, you need to enter the phone menu, open the options item and view the information.  If even 0.1  differences are found, this indicates a fake.  You can also check the type of matrix and resolution.  Sometimes discrepancies can be seen precisely in these characteristics. </p>
