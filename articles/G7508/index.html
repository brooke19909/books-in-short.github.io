    <p>  The Decembrists Movement: A Brief History of Organizations </p><p>  Why did the Decembrists come together in secret communities?  First, the emergence of Decembrist organizations was influenced by the ideas of the enlightenment of revolutionary France.  Views on the structure of the state are reflected in the charters of the communities.  Secondly, having been in overseas campaigns after defeating Napoleon, the Decembrists recognized the European way of life.  These trips convinced them that they could live much better.  Thirdly, during the same World War II, the Decembrists became more familiar with the main population of our country - peasants.  They learned better their way of life and life, which led the conspirators to the realization of the need for change.  And fourthly, the movement of the Decembrists, which is briefly discussed in the article, was greatly influenced by the indecision of Alexander the First in carrying out the reforms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Southern Decembrists Society" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/57305.jpg" width="596"></div>

So, already in 1816 a secret society was created - the <span>Union of Salvation.</span>  It includes guard officers who develop ideas for a new state structure.  This society does not have its own charter and program, and therefore quickly disintegrates.  Following it, the Union of Welfare is created.  This organization is more successful: a clear composition of participants is determined, its own program appears.  The community exists for two years, after which it breaks up.  Now comes the time of the legendary Southern and Northern communities.  <span>The Southern Society of</span> Decembrists led Pestel.  Their program was called "Russian Truth" and consisted of the following conditions: the overthrow of the autocracy, of course, the abolition of serfdom, the creation of a legislative people's governing body.  As for the Northern Society of the Decembrists, it was less radical in its requirements.  The program was called the ‚ÄúConstitution‚Äù and its author was <span>Nikita Muravyov.</span>  The Northern Decembrists settled on the following requirements: the restriction of autocratic power and the introduction of the Constitution, they also advocated the abolition of serfdom and the creation of a parliament, but the preservation of the executive power by the emperor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Decembrist organizations" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/57304.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Organizations carefully prepared for the main presentation.  On the day of the oath to the new emperor, they went to <span>Senate Square.</span>  However, the uprising turned out to be a failure: it all started with the fact that the leader of the Decembrists did not come to the square, and the oath took place before the rebels entered the Senate Square.  <span>Nicholas I</span> suppressed the uprising and executed his most important participants - this served as the beginning of a tightening of the tsar‚Äôs internal policy. </p><p>  The Decembrist movement, which was briefly described in the article, is a striking phenomenon in our history.  It was with him that the struggle for the liberation of Russia from the autocracy began. </p>
