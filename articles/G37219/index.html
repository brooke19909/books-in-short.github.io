    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of a new residential complex, a promising, and nowadays, prestigious direction of the south-west of New Moscow was chosen.  Many of those who are in the process of choosing a new building are wondering how to get to the Nikolin Park residential complex.  Everything is extremely simple: the owners of their own cars will be able to get to the complex along the Kaluga or Kiev highway (it is only 3 km from the Moscow Ring Road).  Moreover, a separate public transport route has been launched from the Teply Stan metro station in the direction of the new microdistrict. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Reviews about the project are positive.  All those who managed to visit the site are impressed by its scope and the zeal with which the developer is trying to maintain the forest belt.  Indeed, construction work is carried out extremely carefully and carefully in order to save every square meter of forest.  And all this for the comfort of the inhabitants of dusty and crowded Moscow.  You no longer have to dream about your own country house or cottage, because apartments in the residential complex "Nikolin Park" have incorporated all the advantages of urban and suburban life.  The air is excellent, just a few minutes walk from the complex flows the river Sosenka. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The development plan of the Leninsky district has already laid the construction of the metro.  Moreover, the <span>reconstruction of the Kaluga highway is</span> ongoing <span>:</span> new interchanges will appear that minimize the load on the highway. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Own infrastructure is what attracted interest holders and current residents of the Nicolin Park residential complex.  Photos of the facility and owners' reviews confirm that in addition to playgrounds and sports grounds, a recreation area and a barbecue, a kindergarten and a medical center where real professionals work were built on its own fenced area.  Moreover, for all car owners here is an excellent garage complex, designed for 730 cars.  Guest parking for 210 cars will save your friends and relatives from the need to look for a free place.  At the stage when the facility was commissioned, almost all apartments are populated, we can draw conclusions about how successful the project turned out.  The developer really thought through everything to the smallest detail, making the life of the residents of the complex convenient, as comfortable and safe as possible. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the residential complex there is an excellent kindergarten with a swimming pool and its own territory of 1 hectare - children have places to play and frolic.  There are no problems with placing children in this institution.  Shops, pharmacies, restaurants and cafes, a car wash - all this really is in the complex.  In terms of infrastructure, the Leninsky district is attractive for life: at present, there are several educational schools in the immediate vicinity, as well as the most prestigious universities of the capital. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Living in the middle of the forest is not entirely safe.  That is why many were skeptical of the complex.  But all doubts instantly disappeared when the developer not only fenced off the territory, but also equipped it with security posts with a round-the-clock video surveillance system.  Moreover, residents of the complex note that entry into the territory is by passes. </p>

    <h2>  Flats </h2><p>  A lot of excellent planning solutions are what were offered to all residents of the Nicolin Park residential complex.  The ceiling height of each standard apartment is 2.8 meters, which allows you to install suspended and suspended, even multi-level structures.  The highlight of the project was apartments with a ceiling height of 4.8 meters, located on the upper floors - it offers stunning views of the picturesque surroundings.  Those who managed to purchase these apartments realized their most daring design ideas, some erected a second floor. </p><p>  What else attracted buyers?  The opportunity to purchase an apartment with finished designer finishes.  Indeed, interest holders were able to choose from several proposed options, even took part in the planning of building and finishing materials for their future apartment.  It‚Äôs very convenient: already at the finishing stage you can start choosing furniture, decoration elements, and after receiving the keys, just bring everything into a new apartment.  High-quality materials, German plumbing, panoramic loggia glazing - this is what all residents received, regardless of the chosen planning decision. </p><h2>  Responses of residents </h2><p>  Of course, the developer can promise a lot, but at the stage of construction of a new complex, it is rather difficult to say exactly what will turn out in the end.  And only when the object is put into operation, the apartments are populated, you can summarize.  So, the reviews about the complex are positive.  Many thank their friends and acquaintances who once recommended an apartment here.  The place is excellent: pine trees, a lake, remoteness from the carriageway, own guarded territory.  And all this in Moscow, with a Moscow residence permit.  Nearby is the huge shopping and entertainment complex "MEGA. Belaya Dacha", the largest construction stores.  It remains only to wait until the metro station opens and the reconstruction of the Kaluga highway is completed, which, according to forecasts, will take place quite soon. </p>

    <p>  Some complain about infrastructure: there are not enough schools, you have to carry children to the capital.  But in the near future, as New Moscow grows, this problem will be solved.  The proximity to the Vnukovo International Airport, many also attribute to the shortcomings, but they are offset by the presence of dense green spaces.  And of course, many strongly recommend that you buy an apartment with a parking place - so you will once and for all protect yourself from parking problems. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  We presented you one of the best <span>residential complexes in</span> New Moscow - LCD "Nikolin Park".  Residents' reviews confirm that this is really a great option for those who are tired of the vain, dirty and crowded Moscow, but are not ready to say goodbye to its infrastructure and residence permit.  Currently, the houses are populated, but if you wish, you can find a free apartment, still at affordable prices. </p>
