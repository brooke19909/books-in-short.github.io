Among our tourists, it is far from being as popular as Budapest, but it also has its charms.  People come here to relax from the hustle and bustle and improve their health at the thermal springs. </p><h2>  Debrecen </h2><p>  By European standards, Debrecen in Hungary is a fairly large city.  About 200 thousand people live in it.  According to one version, its name translates as "good use", according to another - it comes from the Slavic word "Dobrochin". </p><p>  It was first mentioned in 1235, but, in fact, the city is much older.  In the XV century, it became a developed shopping center.  Markets were organized here, fairs were held.  In the XIX century, the city was at the center of the Hungarian revolution, in fact, turned into the capital of the state.  Its inhabitants remember the story and are always proud to have been born in Debrecen in Hungary. </p>

    <p>  It was founded in 1538 as a Calvinist college.  He became a higher educational institution only in the 20th century.  The main building looks reserved and at the same time magnificent, which reminds the palace.  This is a gray building with a red roof, next to which is a botanical garden.  The territory in front of the main entrance is decorated with alleys, flowerbeds and fountains.  Anyone can walk here, but inside the building the entrance is open only on weekdays from 9 to 13 hours. </p><h2>  Khortobad National Park </h2><p>  40 kilometers from the city is the largest national park in Hungary.  Khortobad is 820 km <sup>2 of</sup> flat steppes and salt marshes.  Since ancient times, local residents used its territory for grazing, and during the Soviet period 12 concentration camps were located here. </p><p>  Now the park is a world cultural heritage and is under the protection of UNESCO.  Buffaloes, goats, sheep, Hungarian bulls and many birds live in it.  In summer, the weather in the park is dry and hot, so tornadoes and mirages can often be observed in it. </p>
