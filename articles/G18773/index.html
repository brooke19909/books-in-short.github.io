It is built on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand.  This small bed and breakfast fast hotel has appealed to many tourists who considered it an almost perfect value for money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus Friendly Hotel 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2101379.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  How to get to this hotel?  First of all, you will have to catch a plane, the next flight Moscow - Thailand.  Air tickets can be bought to Bangkok, then by bus or train to get to Surat Thani, and then by ferry - to Koh Samui.  There, in the central settlement of Tongsala, you will find various modes of transport - from taxis to songteos - that will take you to the hotel.  Moreover, to the Chaweng district, on the borders of which this hotel is located, there are a fairly large number of various local ‚Äúminibuses‚Äù.  Flights from Moscow to Thailand can also be bought directly to Samui's international airport - this also exists.  Then it‚Äôs even simpler: from the hub to the hotel, any songteo will take you for 180 baht (about 360 rubles), and the hotel itself provides an individual transfer for 250 baht (500 rubles). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chaweng Beach, Samui </h2><p>  This resort has grown around the beach of the same name.  This is probably the most popular place on the island.  It is located in the east of Koh Samui and you can safely call it a local tourist Mecca.  It is always full of life, even in the rainy season.  In Chaweng, you can find accommodation for every taste - there are five-star luxury palaces and modest backpacker guesthouses at your service.  The resort is divided into three parts - northern, central and southern.  But these boundaries are very arbitrary.  The Lotus Friendly Hotel 3 (Samui) is located on the northern tip of Chaweng, almost where it moves to another area - Bophut, more secluded, quiet and romantic.  Therefore, we can say that the Lotus Friendly Hotel combines all the advantages of the location, since it is not noisy here, but at the same time is close to entertainment.  North Chaweng has very picturesque beaches, and the only drawback is the proximity to the airport, from where planes take off every hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow thailand flights" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2101438.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located?  What infrastructure is next to it? </h2><p>  Lotus Friendly Hotel 3 is located almost in the rainforest.  This is the very end of the Chaweng region, so there are never too many people here.  The hotel is located close enough to the airport of the island - to go there in just a few minutes.  The beach of Chaweng Beach is a few steps from the hotel, but the hotel itself is on the second line.  There is parking at the hotel, and various services and a restaurant are located in the lobby.  Literally next to the hotel is a small round-the-clock Seven-Ileven supermarket, where you can purchase the necessary goods, as well as a May Friend massage parlor.  Very close is the local hospital, where you can go in case of any problems.  They treat inexpensively and expertly.  Not far away is the Thai boxing stadium.  The center is very close - you have to walk on foot for just a quarter of an hour, not really in a hurry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus Friendly Hotel 3 Samui" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2101377.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  The coast is very close to the hotel.  But to get there, you need to go through the road and the territory of other hotels, and it is best to do this before 10 in the morning.  Later, a passage through the cafe opens onto the beach.  It is located directly opposite the Lotus Hotel.  The entrance to the water is sandy, gentle, sometimes there are algae.  There are strong ebbs, then it becomes very shallow.  To fully swim, you need to move from the hotel to the right.  The sand is clean and snow-white.  There are few people on the beach.  Towels for sunbathing are issued directly in the room and changed along with the rest of the laundry.  At low tide, you can walk to small islands near the reef, you just need to be very careful - there are a lot of sea urchins in the water. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Most often, guests of the Lotus Friendley Hotel are interested in beach vacations, as well as everything related to water sports, especially snorkeling and diving.  Therefore, most of them go on such excursions, where you can dive and watch the life of the inhabitants of the sea.  In addition, they still have various popular sea trips, such as, for example, a sightseeing on a boat around the island.  If you are attracted to Buddhism and its architecture, then near the beach there is one very interesting temple - Wat Savang, painted in dazzling white.  You can come there not only on an excursion, but also for the purpose of meditation and communication with monks.  And near the airport there is another Buddhist attraction - Khao Hua Jak Pagoda.  But only courageous and hardy can get there.  The temple is located on a hill 90 meters high.  But your efforts will be adequately rewarded - from the views of the island that open from the mountain, you just feel dizzy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus Friendly Hotel 3 Reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2101384.jpg"></div>
