Hundred Years War: Stages and Consequences</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What could be worse than a war when hundreds of thousands of people die for the interests of politicians and those in power.  And all the more terrible are the protracted military conflicts during which people get used to living in conditions when death can overtake them at any moment, and human life has no value.  This is exactly <span>how the Hundred Years War was, the</span> causes, stages, results and biographies of the characters of which deserve careful study. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  Before studying what were the results of the Hundred Years War, one should understand its premises.  It all started with the fact that the sons of the French king Philip the Fourth did not leave male heirs.  At the same time, the monarch‚Äôs grandson from Isabella‚Äôs daughter, the English king Edward the Third, who ascended the throne of England in 1328 at the age of 16, was still alive.  However, he could not claim the throne of France, according to the Salic Law.  Thus, in France, <span>the Valois dynasty</span> reigned in the person of Philip the Sixth, who was the nephew of Philip the Fourth, and Edward the Third in 1331 was forced to take him a vassal oath for Gascony - the French region, considered the personal property of the English monarchs. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning and the first stage of the war (1337-1360) </h2><p>  6 years after the events described, Edward the Third decided to still fight for the throne of his grandfather and sent a challenge to Philip Six.  Thus began the Hundred Years War, the causes and results of which are of great interest to those who study the history of Europe.  After the declaration of war, the British launched an attack on Picardy, in which they were supported by the inhabitants of Flanders and the feudal lords of the southwestern counties of France. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the first years after the outbreak of armed conflict, fighting continued with varying success, until in 1340 a naval battle took place in Slays.  As a result of the British victory, the English Channel was under their control and remained so until the end of the war.  Thus, in the summer of 1346, nothing could prevent the troops of Edward the Third from crossing the strait and capturing the city of Caen.  From there, the British army followed to Crescy, where on August 26 the famous battle took place, which ended in their triumph, and in 1347 they captured the city of Calais.  In parallel with these events, hostilities unfolded in Scotland.  However, fortune continued to smile at Edward the Third, who defeated the army of that kingdom at the Battle of Neville Cross, and eliminated the threat of war on two fronts. </p>

    <h2>  The plague pandemic and the conclusion of peace in Brittany </h2><p>  In the years 1346-1351, "Black Death" visited Europe.  This plague pandemic claimed so many lives that there could be no question of continuing the fighting.  The only highlight of this period, sung in ballads, was the Fight of thirty, when the English and French knights with squires carried out a mass duel, which was watched by several hundred peasants.  After the end of the plague, England again began military operations, which were mainly led by the Black Prince - the eldest son of Edward the Third.  In 1356, he won the <span>battle of Poitiers</span> and captured the French king John the Second.  Later, in 1360, the Dauphin of France, who was to become King Charles the Fifth, signed the so-called Peace in Brittany on very unfavorable conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Thus, the results of the Hundred Years War at its first stage were as follows: </p><ul><li>  France was completely demoralized; </li><li>  England acquired half of Brittany, Aquitaine, Poitiers, Calais and almost half of the enemy's vassal possessions, i.e.  John the Second lost power over the third territory of his country; </li><li>  Edward the Third undertook on his own behalf and on behalf of his descendants to no longer claim the throne of his grandfather; </li><li>  the second son of John the Second - Louis of Anjou - was sent to London as a hostage in exchange for the return of his father to France. </li></ul><h2>  Peace period from 1360 to 1369 </h2><p>  After the cessation of hostilities, the peoples of the countries involved in the conflict received a respite that lasted 9 years.  During this time, Louis of Anjoui fled from England, and his father, being a knight, true to his word, went to a voluntary captivity, where he died.  After his death, <span>Charles the Fifth</span> ascended the throne of France <span>,</span> who in 1369 unjustly accused the British of violating the peace treaty and resumed military operations against them. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="centennial war reasons and results" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/579249.jpg" width="432"></div></h2><h2>  Second phase </h2><p>  Usually, those who study the course and results of the Hundred Years War characterize the time interval between 1369 and 1396 as a series of constant battles in which, in addition to the main participants, the kingdoms of Castile, Portugal and Scotland were also involved.  The following important events have occurred during this period: </p><ul><li>  in 1370, in Castile, with the help of the French, Enrique the Second came to power, who became their faithful ally; </li><li>  two years later, the city of Poitiers was liberated; </li><li>  in 1372, at the Battle of La Rochelle, the Franco-Castilian combined fleet defeated the British squadron; </li><li>  4 years later, the Black Prince died; </li><li>  in 1377, Edward the Third died, and the minor Richard the Second ascended the throne of England; </li><li>  since 1392, the king of France began to show signs of insanity; </li><li>  four years later, a truce was concluded, caused by the extreme exhaustion of the opponents. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Truce (1396-1415) </h2><p>  When the madness of King <span>Charles the Sixth</span> became obvious to everyone, civil strife broke out in the country, in which the Armagnac party won.  The situation was no better in England, which entered a new war with Scotland, which was also to pacify the rebels in Ireland and Wales.  In addition, Richard the Second was overthrown there, and Henry the Fourth reigned on the throne, and then his son.  Thus, until 1415, both countries were unable to continue the war and were in a state of armed ceasefire. </p>

    <h2>  The third stage (1415-1428) </h2><p>  Those who investigate the course and consequences of the Hundred Years War usually call the appearance of such a historical phenomenon as a female warrior who could become the head of the army of feudal knights the most interesting event.  We are talking about Joan of Arc, born in 1412, whose formation was greatly influenced by events that occurred in 1415-1428.  Historical science considers this period the third stage of the Hundred Years War and highlights the following events as key: </p><ul><li>  the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, in which Henry the Fifth defeated; </li><li>  the signing of the Treaty of Troyes, according to which the distraught King Charles Six declared the King of England as his heir; </li><li>  the British capture of Paris in 1421; </li><li>  the death of Henry the Fifth and the announcement of his one-year-old son as king of England and France; </li><li>  the defeat of the former Dauphin Karl, whom a significant part of the French considered the rightful king, at the Battle of Cravan; </li><li>  siege by the British of Orleans, which began in 1428, during which the world first recognized the name of Joan of Arc. </li></ul><h2>  The end of the war (1428-1453) </h2><p>  The city of Orleans was of great strategic importance.  If the British managed to capture him, the answer to the question ‚Äúwhat are the results of the Hundred Years War‚Äù would be completely different, and the French could even lose their independence.  Fortunately for this country, she was sent down a girl who called herself Jeanne Virgin.  She arrived at the Dauphin Karl in March 1429 and announced that the Lord had commanded her to stand at the head of the French army and lift the siege of Orleans.  After a series of interrogations and trials, Karl believed her and appointed her commander in chief.  As a result, on May 8, Orleans was saved, on June 18, the Jeanne army defeated the British army at the Battle of Pat, and on June 29, at the insistence of the Orleans virgin, the ‚Äúbloodless‚Äù campaign of the Dauphin in Reims began.  There he was crowned as <span>Karl of Seventh,</span> but soon after that he ceased to listen to the advice of the warrior. </p>

    <p>  A few years later, Jeanne was captured by the Burgundians, who handed the girl over to the British, and they executed her, accusing her of heretical and idolatry.  However, the results of the Hundred Years War were already a foregone conclusion, and even the death of the Orleans virgin could not prevent the liberation of France.  The last battle in this war was the battle of Castiglion in <span>1453,</span> when the British lost Gascony, belonging to them for more than 250 years. </p><h2>  The Results of the Hundred Years War (1337-1453) </h2><p>  As a result of this protracted inter-dynastic armed conflict, England lost all of its continental territories in France, retaining only the port of Calais.  In addition, in response to a question about the outcome of the Hundred Years War, experts in the field of military history answer that as a result of this, the methods of warfare have changed dramatically and new types of weapons have been created. </p><h2>  The consequences of the Hundred Years War </h2><p>  The echoes of this armed conflict predetermined relations between England and France for centuries to come.  In particular, until 1801, the British and then the monarchs of Great Britain held the title of kings of France, which did not contribute to the establishment of friendly ties. </p><p>  Now you know, when there was the Hundred Years War, the causes, course, results and motives of the main characters of which for almost 6 centuries have been the subject of study by many historians. </p>
