  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to tie a scarf with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is believed that a scarf is the simplest knitted product.  Therefore, needlewomen should start with it.  However, technology varies depending on the model.  Many options are not successful the first time, even for experienced knitters.  Therefore, in the article we will talk about how to knit a scarf. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Scarves vary by season of socks.  The most popular are warm winter or bright autumn items.  However, also many young ladies prefer to decorate themselves in spring and even summer with light openwork scarves.  Therefore, before you start reading the instructions on how to knit a scarf, you need to determine what time of year an accessory is required.  And after that, pick up yarn and tools.  It is important to note that you can buy any knitting threads.  But for the drawing of this or patterned product, monophonic ones are more suitable.  The tool is better metal.  In this case, we need ring spokes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="willyvossen.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting scarf step by step" class="if uuid-2912391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2912391.jpg"></div><h2>  Do I need to measure the model? </h2><p>  The question that we formed in the heading of the item is asked by many newcomers who decide to knit a scarf.  However, professionals say that this accessory is therefore considered the simplest product.  He fits perfectly on the eye.  The only difficulty may arise when performing a snud.  It is necessary to determine in advance whether the scarf tube will encircle the neck in several layers, and if so, what time.  After that, measure the girth of the head, which will help you sort out the size of the future product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to begin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="willyvossen.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting scarf" class="if uuid-2912389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2912389.jpg"></div><p>  Regardless of which version of the studied product will be connected, it is performed with a smooth cloth over the desired length.  Therefore, the first thing we take is knitting needles, yarn and pick up a number of loops.  We determine the width of the scarf knitted with needles, focusing on our own preferences.  However, professionals advise not to make the patterned product too wide.  When worn, it crumpled and will look uninteresting.  Experts also recommend decorating women's scarves with braids and plaits.  And men's - to make more restrained.  Ideally smooth using a garter pattern or regular elastic. </p><h2>  How to knit a simple scarf </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.flaxandtwine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted scarf" class="if uuid-2912393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2912393.jpg"></div><p>  A classic long scarf to knit elementarily.  After all, it does not require any calculations, reduction and addition of loops.  The accessory is knitted with an even cloth.  That is, the needlewoman picks up loops on the knitting needles, and then moves row by row to the desired length.  At the same time, any patterns can be included in the work.  The main thing when choosing a scheme is to compare the number of rows in your product with rapport.  It is also recommended to add edge loops at the beginning and end of each row of any knitted fabric.  This is the first one, which is simply removed, and the last one is knitted like a purl, regardless of the pattern.  A similar technique will help to make a beautiful, slightly concave edge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to make a stole </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit scarf" class="if uuid-2912423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2912423.jpg"></div><p>  Not so long ago, wide scarves, called stoles, gained immense popularity.  In the classic version, they are worn over their shoulders.  However, some fashionistas use these products as a regular scarf.  Since the stoles act as a cape, they are most often decorated with a pattern or lace.  For the latter, it is recommended to use thin threads.  If you still want to make a warm product, professionals recommend considering angora or mohair.  This rather warm, but thin yarn is ideal for such models.  Talking about how to knit a scarf of this kind is not necessary.  Knitting technology is similar to a simple scarf.  However, in this case, you need to dial at least twice as many loops than in the previous version.  After all, the traditional width of the stole is not less than forty centimeters. </p><h2>  How to do snud </h2><p>  Scarf collar, hood, snood ... There are a huge number of names for this product.  However, fashionistas love him not at all for this.  This type of scarf is convenient in that it goes well with a business outfit, romantic and even sporty.  It harmonizes with a fluffy skirt and jeans, goes with stiletto heels and trendy ‚Äútimberlands‚Äù - red suede boots.  Knits like a product in different ways.  Beginners can knit a flat cloth of the desired length, close the loops and connect the two ends of the scarf using a sewing needle and ordinary threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit scarf for beginners" class="if uuid-2912397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2912397.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting technology seamless snud </h2><p>  Those who prefer a do-it-yourself seamless scarf-snood should learn a different technology.  We‚Äôll talk about this.  So, how do beginners tie a seamless scarf: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to prepare a fragment of the pattern - a square with a side of ten centimeters. </li><li>  Count the loops in it.  And divide their number by ten. </li><li>  After measure head circumference.  And multiply the resulting parameter by the previous number. </li><li>  If you want to knit a scarf pipe, you need to dial the calculated number of loops. </li><li>  If the conceived product must be wound several times around the neck or put on the head like a hood, you need to take a double or even triple value.  Then close the loop in the ring and knit on the circular knitting needles in a circle, reaching the desired width of the scarf. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="iphone.maykop.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting scarf" class="if uuid-2912402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2912402.jpg"></div><h2>  Elementary patterns </h2><p>  Having chosen the model of the conceived product, you should choose a pattern.  Beginners are better off not tackling something too complicated.  Indeed, even simple patterns look very impressive.  For example, the "dash": </p><ol><li>  Rapport - two loops (wrong and front). </li><li>  The first row is arbitrary. </li><li>  The second and subsequent ones are those over the obverse, over the obverse. </li></ol><p>  Another pattern is called "patterns": </p><ol><li>  The first two steps are similar to the previous instructions. </li><li>  All the wrong rows fit in the pattern. </li><li>  In the facial - on the wrong side of the front, on the front side of the wrong. </li></ol><p>  For men's scarves, you can choose a pattern of "chess": </p><ol><li>  Rapport - four loops. </li><li>  In the first row, two wrong two front ones alternate. </li><li>  All the even ones fit in the pattern. </li><li>  In the odd, the pattern changes - on the wrong side of the front, on the wrong side of the front. </li></ol><h2>  Harness Technology </h2><p>  Talking about how to knit a scarf with knitting needles, we mentioned braids and plaits.  The first option is difficult for beginners.  But the second to disassemble and make it quite easy.  It is only necessary to determine in advance what width the harness will be.  Rapport for beginners - no more than ten loops.  In the rest, loops can be lost due to lack of experience.  So, the technology of knitting harnesses consists in the following actions: </p><ol><li>  We collect loops on the knitting needles, given the report and the hem. </li><li>  We knit the front loops on the front side, the wrong ones on the wrong side.  And so for several rows. </li><li>  We skip half the stitches of the report and knit the second part. </li><li>  After we tie the rest of the loop. </li><li>  And remove the resulting tourniquet from the knitting needle. </li><li>  We carry out the following.  And so on until the end. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, knitting a beautiful and original scarf is much easier than it might seem.  However, professional knitters recommend first practicing on simple models and patterns, and only after that move on to spectacular, but also more complex ones. </p>
