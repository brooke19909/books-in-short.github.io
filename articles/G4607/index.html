It is durable, modern and super easy to manufacture.  All you need are a few basic sewing skills.  Detailed instructions, as well as other interesting ideas from jeans, can be found in the article. </p><h2>  <span>Old jeans</span> - new ideas </h2><p>  Everyone loves jeans, because they are comfortable and complete with them you can create a variety of ensembles of clothing.  If the old jeans are torn somewhere or become tight, you can sew a good bag from them.  In the wardrobe of each of our readers there are at least three to four pairs of jeans that are outdated or no longer worn.  But from them you can make excellent denim bags with your own hands.  In this article you will find step-by-step instructions on how to create such a bag; photos are also given of how to complete the work step by step. </p><p>  The best option for sewing a denim bag with your own hands is from old denim trousers, the fabric of which is not too elastic.  It is much more difficult to work with stretching material, since it tends to stretch when cutting and sewing.  Listed below are the necessary materials and tools. </p><div class="photo" data-original="archzine.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Materials and Tools" class="if uuid-2415586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2415586.jpg"></div><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  old jeans; </li><li>  two belts. </li></ul><p>  Instruments: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  scissors; </li><li>  sewing machine; </li><li>  awl; </li><li>  hammer; </li><li>  roulette; </li><li>  rivets. </li></ul><p>  Instructions for sewing a denim bag with your own hands (+ patterns) will help to carry out this work in a short time. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  Having prepared all the necessary materials and tools, you can begin to work.  First, lay out the jeans and cut off a leg of trousers 50 centimeters long.  Cut along the seam and lay out the fabric.  Repeat this process again with another trouser leg, and place them exactly on top of each other.  Measure along the bottom of the folded pieces a section 20 cm long in the center.  Cut off the side parts.  The result was a trapezoid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deavita.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Denim Bag Fit (1)" class="if uuid-2414619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2414619.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to sew a <span>denim bag with your own hands out of jeans,</span> you can use any part of them, not just the bottom.  For example, if you like the upper part of jeans more, you can use it to sew a bag.  Thus, you have the opportunity to use the pockets of trousers for small items such as a phone, glasses or other little things.  In this embodiment, on the top of the bag there are harnesses from the belt, into which you can stretch the belt as an accessory of jewelry. </p><h2>  Corners and bottom of the bag </h2><p>  Now you need to prepare the sides and bottom of the bag.  To do this, cut 50 centimeters from any part of one leg.  Cut along the seam.  Measure out two long 10 x 50 centimeters rectangles and cut them out.  For the bottom of the bag, cut a strip of fabric measuring 10 x 28 centimeters.  If you want to make the bottom of the bag wider, you need to take, for example, a side strip of 20 x 50 centimeters, and the bottom 20 x 28 centimeters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It's time to sew all the details of the bag, having previously swept them away.  You can sew a bag both on the face and on the inside.  It will look good in both versions.  In this example, sewing a denim bag with your own hands, the photo of which is presented in the article, the inside of the jeans is used as the outside of the bag.  After everything is stitched, you can sew all the seams with a zigzag seam and turn the bag on your face.  There is no need to tuck the top of the bag if the bottom of the trousers in your jeans is not frayed or torn.  Otherwise, you need to make a substrate around the entire perimeter of the top of the bag and proceed with the next step in making a jeans bag from jeans with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful jeans bag" class="if uuid-2415880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2415880.jpg"></div><p>  If you plan to make a denim bag with a lining, make it according to the same pattern as the bag.  It is possible to sew an inside pocket to a lining.  Insert the lining, bast and sew it to the top of the bag. </p><h2>  Fastening belt with rivets </h2><p>  Now you need belts, pliers, a hammer and rivets.  Using a belt and rivets, handles are formed on the bag.  Where there are holes in the belt, rivets are inserted into them and are attached to the fabric of the bag with a hammer.  In the part where the belt is buckled, the holes are made with an awl, and the belt is also attached to the fabric of the bag.  The second belt is attached to the other side of the bag. </p><p>  You can also replace leather belts with other pen options.  They can be made of jeans strips, and sewn to the bag instead of rivets, or with rivets, but on a jeans belt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="feminine jeans bag" class="if uuid-2415876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2415876.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoration for a denim bag </h2><p>  If you want to revive a sewn denim bag with your own hands with an original accessory, then different fabrics are suitable for this.  This can be a belt of colored fabric, stretched through the harness sewn on the top of the bag, or a beautiful applique.  Another successful combination would be to add some sparkling accessories.  The easiest way to create an individual design for your own handbag is to tie a fabric on one of the straps.  This always adds a pleasant accent to the denim bag. </p><p>  If you have several jeans for recycling, you can sew a bag from more than one pair of pants.  To do this, individual jeans pieces can be sewn and turned into a nice bag for everyday wear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ideipentrucasa.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Patchwork Bag" class="if uuid-2414973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2414973.jpg"></div><h2>  Bag for everything </h2><p>  This bag can be used in any quality.  And as an accessory in casual style, and as a shopping bag because it is large and there is enough space for many items.  If desired, an inside pocket with a zipper could be placed in it to protect your personal belongings. </p><p>  You can quickly and easily make a comfortable denim bag from old jeans.  The video below details how to create it. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="nLAEc5zaHk8" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLAEc5zaHk8" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/5/1/8/2518.jpg"></div><p>  Little girls also carry bags for their favorite toys or hair ornaments.  Therefore, you can sew a bag of jeans specifically for your little princess and decorate it with children's motifs.  Colored fabrics, buttons and applications are perfect for this. </p><p>  <span>A bag of old jeans</span> is the perfect complement to casual wear.  Of course, it can be worn in combination with jeans, a jeans sundress, or sweatpants.  With a denim bag you can go to the beach, for a walk and to the store.  You can create a creative travel bag with a large design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag of old jeans" class="if uuid-2415878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2415878.jpg"></div><p>  To create it, you may need two pairs of trousers, an original zipper and lining fabric. </p><p>  Let your creativity unfold and create unique denim bags. </p>
