However, these talents are able to win the hearts of the audience even with one voice.  Among them is Dmitry Matveev.  He played in more than 4 dozen films, and also voiced the most famous actors on the planet. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Matveev Dmitry Nikolaevich was born in Potsdam (GDR) in 1953.  His mother at that time worked in the Soviet theater as a make-up artist, and his father served there as a stage engineer.  Soon the family returned to their homeland and settled in the capital. </p>

    <p>  At the age of 3, Dima Matveev starred in the episodic role of Nikolashka in the short film based on the novel by A. Gaidar “Let It Shine!”  (1960).  Perhaps this predetermined his future fate. </p><h2>  In the years of study </h2><p>  In 1981, Dmitry Matveev graduated from the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography.  There he was lucky to learn from such masters of the Soviet screen as Sergey Bondarchuk and Irina Skobtseva.  As a student, Matveyev began to be invited to play a movie.  His first serious work was the main role of Yura in the short film "Labyrinth", in which he starred in 1979. In the same year, Dmitry was lucky to undergo a casting for the role of Victor, the son-in-law of the main character in the famous sad comedy of George Danelia "Autumn Marathon". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Further career </h2><p>  After receiving the diploma, Dmitry Matveev was assigned to Mosfilm, where he worked for 10 years.  In the first years of his activity at one of the leading film studios of the USSR, he starred in such films as: </p><ul><li>  "Lantern Festival". </li><li>  "Tehran-43." </li><li>  "His vacation." </li><li>  "Vasily Buslaev." </li><li>  "Family business." </li><li>  "Like I was a child prodigy." </li><li>  "Garden". </li><li>  "Examination for Immortality." </li><li>  "Primordial Russia" (episodic role). </li><li>  "Option" Zombies.

Year 41 </h2><p>  In the life of each actor, there is a role that is the most significant in his career.  For Matveev, this was the image he created of Ilya Sushentsov, a young officer who was infinitely devoted to his homeland and ready to sacrifice his life for her. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="actor Dmitry Matveyev personal life" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1559657.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <p>  The film "Year forty-first" is the fifth part of the famous series "State Border".  It tells about the events unfolding since mid-June 1941 at the outpost, not far from which is the territory of Poland occupied by the Nazis.  One day, Lieutenant Sushentsov responded with fire to the provocation of Wehrmacht soldiers, violating the order not to get involved in armed conflict.  However, they do not have time to punish him, because on June 22, German units invade the territory of the USSR.  Sushentsova outpost is one of the first to be attacked.  The commander, along with his soldiers, renders heroic resistance to the enemy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the release of the picture on the screens, Matveyev acquired hundreds of thousands of fans and admirers in all corners of our country and earned the title of the most courageous lieutenant of Soviet cinema in the last years of its existence. </p><h2>  In the late 80s </h2><p>  Dmitry Matveev, whose photo in his youth were in great demand among fans, played interesting roles during the years of Perestroika.  Among them, one can note the work in the films “Land of My Childhood” by director Anatoly Nitochkin, “Summer Impressions of Planet Z” by Yevgeny Markovsky, “Crime Quartet”, etc. </p>

    <p>  In addition, in 1987, the 6th part of the series “State Border” was released, which was dedicated to Soviet border guards who are engaged in the destruction of gangs of nationalists in Western Ukraine.  In the picture, the viewer again met with Ilya Sushentsov performed by Dmitry Matveev.  According to the plot, he went through the whole war, rose to the rank of major and took the post of chief of the border detachment. </p><h2>  "Coast of Salvation" </h2><p>  This picture, in which the main role was played by Dmitry Matveev, was undeservedly ignored in our country.  It was shot by Russian and Korean filmmakers in 1990.  The film tells about the events that took place during the Russian-Japanese war.  According to the plot of the picture, the warship commanded by the hero of Dmitry Matveev crashes off the coast of Korea.  Surviving team members decide to make their way home by land.  On the way, they have to engage in fights with the Japanese, who use their <span>taekwondo</span> skills. </p><h2>  Career in the 90s </h2><p>  At the beginning of the last decade of the 20th century, Matveyev, like other actors of the former Soviet Union, had a dark streak.  Cinema was in a deep crisis, and new films were hardly made.  However, Dmitry Nikolaevich found, as they say, his own niche.  At that time, the domestic audience got the opportunity to watch foreign films and TV shows, so dubbing masters always had a lot of work.  One of those who "gave" his voice to the stars of Hollywood and world cinema was Dmitry Matveev.  The actor took part in dubbing such popular films as The Chronicles of Riddick and The Black Hole, where he dubbed Vin Diesel, Predator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Leon (Jean Reno and other male roles), etc. </p>

    <p>  In addition, Sylvester Stallone, Samuel L. Jackson, Mel Gibbson and others speak in the voice of Matveyev in most films translated into Russian. </p><h2>  Work on television </h2><p>  Dmitry Matveev, whose films he enjoyed watching in all cities of the Soviet Union, also voiced the advertising and campaign of Boris Yeltsin.  In 1995, he became the voiceover of the Highway Patrol program, which aired on TV-6.  In addition, the following year he was invited to ORT, where he voiced the television projects Operation and Rush Hour.  Then Matveyev switched to TV Center in the Petrovka 38 program, and also was an off-screen announcer of announcements on the same channel. </p><h2>  TV series participation </h2><p>  Like many successful actors of the Soviet period, over time, Matveev began acting in series and, it must be said, quite successfully.  After the launch of the first such projects with his participation on television, the proposals fell on all sides. </p>
