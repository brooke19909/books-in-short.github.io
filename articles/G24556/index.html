It is known that all cars require OSAGO.  But do you need trailer insurance?  Next, we will deal with this issue, and also talk about the technical inspection of such equipment. </p><h2>  Legal regulations </h2><p>  Such devices, as already noted, are vehicles.  But if you need insurance for a car trailer, you can find out if you look into the federal law on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, and specifically in article No. 4. There are exceptions to which there is no such requirement.  Are trailers mentioned there?  Yes, however, with a limitation: the insurance obligation does not apply to the corresponding additions to passenger cars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kwik-fit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do I need to enter insurance" class="if uuid-3161352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3161352.jpg"></div><p>  The obligation to buy a policy on a trailer for cars does not apply to their owners.  But the owners of freight transport will still have to use this service.  It should be borne in mind that trailers-dissolution and semitrailers are also referred to as such in this case. </p><p>  Whether insurance is needed for a car trailer is interesting to many. </p><h2>  What is considered an insurance object? </h2><p>  MTPL is currently required for: </p><ul><li>  Trailers for cars for legal entities. </li><li>  Trailer equipment for trucks. </li></ul><p>  The objects of insurance are property interests, which are associated with civil liability risks of car owners for obligations arising in the event of damage to the life, property or health of third parties.  Do not forget that the process of applying for a policy for such a technique is only possible with a special inspection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  CTP for truck trailers </h2><p>  Do I need truck trailer insurance? </p><p>  This device is many times larger than for passenger cars, but the area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse in this case is completely different.  Initially, it is worth saying that the implementation of a technical inspection in this case is mandatory.  Accidents with this tool are not at all a rare occurrence.  Regarding compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, it must be said that insurance on freight trailers is compulsory for all categories, regardless of whether it is an individual or a legal entity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do you need insurance for a car trailer" class="if uuid-3161341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3161341.jpg"></div><h2>  Trailer insurance policies and their types </h2><p>  Depending on the number of drivers allowed to drive a car with a trailer, there are several types of insurance.  The document may be limited or unlimited. </p><h2>  Limited insurance </h2><p>  This type of document implies an increase in the total number of persons who are allowed to drive the appropriate vehicle with a trailer.  In addition, it is intended to exclude certain citizens from the established list.  To obtain such a policy, the driver must send a special, correctly prepared application to the insurance company.  At a price this policy will be slightly cheaper than similar paper of unlimited type.  The document is not initially intended to be issued to a legal entity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unlimited insurance </h2><p>  This type of insurance is characterized by a number of features.  The difference is as follows: if the owner gives an oral permit to operate the car or draws up an official power of attorney for another person, unlimited insurance will be valid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="car-satei.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do you need trailer insurance" class="if uuid-3161337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3161337.jpg"></div><p>  In the event that the owner of the vehicle decides to entrust the control of the machine to another citizen, it will not be necessary to make changes or various amendments to the policy.  Unlimited insurance is a more functional document.  Its cost is slightly higher than the limited edition. </p><p>  We determined if you need trailer insurance.  Next, we‚Äôll talk about how to get OSAGO on the appropriate equipment. </p><h2>  The procedure for obtaining insurance on the trailer </h2><p>  In the event that the policyholder is a legal entity, then the policy is required.  To get a third-party liability insurance, you need to do a few steps: </p><ul><li>  Trailer registration. </li><li>  Passing technical inspection. </li><li>  Obtaining a diagnostic card. </li><li>  Making CTP. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the insurance for the trailer is issued separately from the policy of the car itself. </p><h2>  Trailer inspection and conditions </h2><p>  We continue to find out whether the trailer needs inspection and insurance.  Several nuances have recently been introduced into this procedure: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Verification is now carried out in specialized centers by maintenance operators. </li><li>  Instead of coupons, a diagnostic card is issued. </li><li>  Inspection, as a rule, is subjected to any equipment that belongs to legal entities. </li><li>  Any heavy trailers, the maximum mass of which exceeds the norm of 3.5 tons, pass a special check, regardless of the type of owner. </li></ul><p>  Before performing a vehicle inspection, it is necessary to comply with legal requirements and prepare the equipment for this event. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.carthrottle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do I need insurance for a freight trailer" class="if uuid-3161351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3161351.jpg"></div><h2>  How to pass the inspection of trailers with a mass of more than 3.5 tons? </h2><p>  These dimensions are usually trailers.  Before carrying out their maintenance, it makes sense to check whether the state number is well lit, whether the wiring with light-signal units is working.  A critical assessment of the appearance of the trailer is also considered superfluous.  It‚Äôs simply indecent to take dirty equipment for inspection.  In addition, few experts will agree to inspect the trailer, which they may get dirty about. </p><p>  For heavy equipment and trailers that are owned by the institutions, a special inspection schedule is used, the frequency of which directly depends on the age of the vehicle: </p><ul><li>  New funds are exempted from maintenance for the first three years. </li><li>  Between the ages of three and seven, this service is biennial. </li><li>  Those vehicles that are more than seven years old are checked annually. </li></ul><p>  As part of determining the frequency of inspection, the countdown should start from the date of release of the trailer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drivesure.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do I need to include a trailer in the insurance" class="if uuid-3161338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3161338.jpg"></div><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  Trailer heavy equipment is accepted for technical inspection, provided that the owner has a certain set of documents, which should include: </p><ul><li>  Passport of the owner or other identification documents. </li><li>  Presentation of a power of attorney to operate the machine if the owner and the driver are different persons. </li><li>  Providing a vehicle passport and certificate of registration. </li><li>  In the event that the trailer is owned by any institution, instead of a passport, you must show a certificate of state registration of the legal entity and a power of attorney, which is issued in the name of the driver of the car. </li></ul><h2>  Where does the inspection go? </h2><p>  To do this, you can contact the operator in any region without being tied to the place of registration of the machine or its owner.  In the diagnostic card, which is a document of a new format, as part of the TO confirmation, the regional code is no longer indicated. </p><h2>  How much does trailer insurance cost? </h2><p>  Not everyone knows whether to include a trailer in insurance, and do not have information about the cost.  The price of the trailer owner liability insurance policy directly depends on certain factors: </p><ul><li>  Use time. </li><li>  The region of registration of trailed equipment. </li></ul><p>  The calculation formula will be as follows: the basic tariff is multiplied by territorial coefficients, and then by the value of the period of use.  For the fact of trouble-free discounts are not provided. </p><p>  CASCO cost will be: </p><ul><li>  on the risks of ‚Äúdamage‚Äù - from 2 to 4% of the value of the trailer; </li><li>  for "theft" - 0.5% of the price of the corresponding equipment. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.puyallupnissan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do you need inspection and insurance on the trailer" class="if uuid-3161336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3161336.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the insurance period? </h2><p>  If the trailer is used only in a certain time period of the year, for example, from April to November, then the policy should be issued for this period.  This can significantly reduce the cost of servicing the contract. </p><p>  True, it should be remembered that the minimum MTPL period for trailers for individuals is three months, and for legal ones - six months.  At the same time, it is impossible to break the minimum time periods for using the machine (in this case, the trailer). </p><p>  We examined whether trailer insurance is needed.  Information can be very useful for those who were not familiar with the intricacies of the procedure. </p>
