    <p>  The kerchief has been popular in Russia since ancient times, it helps to avoid sunstroke, protect hair from burnout and wind.  Now it is a stylish accessory with many options for tailoring, colors and ornament.  In this article, we will consider how to sew a scarf on an elastic band independently, which materials and patterns are better to use. </p><h2>  Which fabrics are better to use? </h2><p>  When it comes to sewing clothes for a child, you involuntarily think about fabrics that are better to use.  Nowadays, many are beginning to reflect on how material can affect human health.  More and more people recognize the positive effects of natural tissues on their well-being. </p><p>  The ability of linen and silk materials to improve blood circulation is known, moreover, they have antibacterial properties, do not dry the scalp and do not spoil the hair.  Cotton fabric is universal.  In summer it will not be hot in such a light scarf with an elastic band.  A natural knit fabric is also suitable for the girl.  It is flexible and versatile.  Products made of chintz, calico, satin are good for summer days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now they produce environmentally friendly fabrics from bamboo, nettle, soy, hemp.  Indeed, every year more and more people understand the benefits of natural things that not only decorate our body, but also take care of their health. </p><h2>  Sewing options </h2><p>  Before you sew a scarf on an elastic band, you need to consider the style of the future product.  For young children, a headscarf with an elastic soft knit insert around the entire head would be the best option.  She holds well, does not slip, absolutely does not press on the skin of the baby. </p><p>  The second option for sewing can be a simple cotton scarf with an elastic band at the back inserted into the same fabric as the main part.  At the same time, it is sewn into the material, and a strip of fabric with an elastic band is obtained assembled. </p><p>  For older girls, you can offer to sew a bandana.  Now this version of a scarf on an elastic band from knitwear is very popular.  It is worn in different ways.  You can pick up the material and wear as a bandage.  If you straighten the fabric, you get a knitted scarf that completely covers the surface of the crown of the head.  The elastic band for this option is sewn longer than for the second proposed model. </p><h2>  The easiest option </h2><p>  If a child is uncomfortable wearing a headscarf with knotted edges, and her mother does not have a sewing machine, then there is the simplest method to insert an elastic band into an already finished product.  Take the purchased scarf and cut the sharp edges in a straight line.  Next, you need to attach a wide elastic band connecting both ends together. </p>

    <p>  To do this, you can just sew it on, bending the edges of the scarf twice with the wrong side.  And you can hide an elastic band in a pipe sewn from cut material.  The seams are all hidden inside, so that it will not be visible that the scarf is redone manually. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sewing scarves for kids </h2><p>  For the youngest girls, you can sew a scarf on an elastic band according to the pattern proposed below.  The fabric will need two types: thin cotton for the main scarf and a knitted strip for elastic around the head.  The main fabric is folded in half on the wrong side, and a pattern is made.  You can do a lapel, or you can sew without it.  Then the scarf will be lighter and thinner.  The length and height of the pattern vary depending on the size of the child‚Äôs head. </p>

    <p>  After cutting, you need to process the edges of the fabric on the overlock.  Next we will talk about gum.  A soft centimeter measures the part of the head around the forehead and occipital area.  A rectangle is cut out, the length of which corresponds to the measurement, and the width is two times wider than the future gum.  After that, on the inside, you need to double the rectangle and flash the material in length.  Then turn to the front and iron it well.  It remains to stitch the scarf to the knitted elastic.  Then attach the resulting product to the baby‚Äôs head and, having corrected the size, sew on the occipital strip.  Everything, the scarf on an elastic band on a pattern is ready. </p><h2>  Simple scarf with elastic at the back </h2><p>  Such a hat is relevant for girls of any age.  The fabric can be either cotton or silk.  It is recommended to decorate the product with a sewn-in canton, tie it with a lace pattern using a hook, sew an applique in the form of a flower or a child‚Äôs picture, add a lapel.  Gum and piping can be sewn from the same material, for example, plain, and the main scarf - from floral or other bright fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Before you sew a scarf on an elastic band, you need to take measurements of the head from the middle of the forehead to the back of the head.  You will need a square of fabric in the size of the scarf, edging, a rectangle of material of double width in the size of the future gum.  It is advisable to have a sewing machine, then the scarf will turn out more accurately. </p><h2>  The scarf on an elastic band: a sewing workshop </h2><p>  For sewing, you need to take a square of fabric 25x25 cm and fold it diagonally.  Iron so that the fold line is even.  Next, the part is cut into two triangles.  On the legs of one of them is sewn along the edges of the braid.  Then both parts are folded facing each other.  From the inside, only lines with braid need to be sewn.  Then the product is turned on the front side.  It is required to iron all seams well, smooth the edges of the triangle. </p><p>  If the scarf is sewn without braid, then you can simply fold the square in half without cutting it into two triangles.  In order to subsequently sew on the elastic at the back, the sharp corners of the workpiece are cut off and neatly wrapped on both sides, as in the photograph of the sample. </p>
