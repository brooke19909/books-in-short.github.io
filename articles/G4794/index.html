One of the favorite accommodation options among travelers is the Rococo Hotel in Prague.

The passage of the Rococo Hotel is connected to two more old passages, under the roofs of which a whole town is hidden - streets, intersections, squares. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  When studying the description and photos of the Rococo Hotel in Prague, pay special attention to the number of rooms.

Its first leader was the famous singer Karel Gashler.  Many outstanding artists of that time performed here, and therefore the theater was popular. </p><p>  In the 60s, the main specialization of the theater was musical and dramatic productions.  Almost all Czech and foreign stars are on stage.  The Soviet artists also shone on the stage. </p><p>  Since 2005, the Rococo Theater has been included in the Prague City Theaters.  The contemporary repertoire is based on classic dramatic productions performed by prominent actors.  But there is a place on the stage for bold experimental ideas. </p><h2>  Special offers </h2><p>  To stay at the Rococo Hotel in Prague not only comfortable but also beneficial, a number of special offers have been developed for travelers.
