Olympic Kosma Bomo Club 3 *, the description of which we presented in this article, is a hotel where you can meet the perfect combination of price and quality.  This means that we must not forget that this is a three-star hotel, and not demand from it a range of 5-star services.  It has a great location, decent service and a very comfortable interior.  He also proved himself well among the guests and this is evidenced by the positive reviews of tourists who spent their holidays here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bomo Club Olympic Kosma 3 * (Halkidiki / Kassandra)." class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1533413.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Holidays in Greece</strong> </p><p>  Surely there is no country in the world that surpassed Greece in the number of historical sights.  This is a real open-air museum.  Even from school, when we go through the history of the ancient world, many of us become infected with the desire to someday poison in this amazing country and see all these palaces, acropolis, statues with our own eyes.  In a word, the majority of tourists who travel to Greece are fans of sightseeing tours, but do not forget that this country is one of the most attractive beach destinations.  The azure clear sea, magnificent beaches, well-developed infrastructure, and a huge number of hotels of different categories, as they say for every taste.  Of course, you can choose luxury complexes and relax on an all-inclusive basis, but it is very expensive, so most tourists choose budget hotels, for example, Bomo Club Olympic Kosma 3 * (Halkidiki / Kassandra).  By the way, living in island Greece, at times, is much more expensive than in mainland.  However, the first attract tourists much more.  From this point of view, the Halkidiki peninsula has one good plus.  You are as if on an island, but at the same time not quite.  In view of this, hotel prices here are affordable and affordable for middle-income tourists.  If you look at the example of the same Olympic Kosma Bomo Club 3 * hotel, tours to this hotel are 20-30% cheaper than to a similar hotel in Crete or Rhodes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Halkidiki: ‚Äúthree-fingered handsome‚Äù </h2><p>  This peninsula is located in the north of the Aegean Sea.  It differs in the original ‚Äúthree-tooth‚Äù or ‚Äúthree-fingered‚Äù form, which is formed from three separate peninsulas: Kassandra, Athos (Agion-Oros) and Sithonia.  On the map, they look like a trident of the lord of the seas god Poseidon.  Halkidiki is the main resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãmainland Greece.  Unlike the islands, which are located in the south and are distinguished by sparse vegetation, everything is buried in verdure and in odorous exotic flowers, which with one look create a sense of celebration.  The Greeks themselves come here for their portion of relaxation, and tourists who appreciate a quiet and measured rest. </p>

    <h2>  Kassandra Hotels </h2><p>  On the peninsula there are many hotels of different categories, both five-star and budget, three-star, like the Olympic Kosma Bomo Club 3 * hotel (see photo in the article), which is located on the coast of the Kassandra Peninsula.  The air here is amazing, all saturated with the aroma of thyme and pine needles.  Emerald hills smoothly descend to the golden beaches, and then go on to the amazingly turquoise surface of the sea.  What else could be more beautiful ?!  That is why 200,000 tourists visit this small peninsula every year, the width of which is only 15 kilometers.  These are not fictitious, but statistical data.  By the way, they rest here year-round, although the high season lasts from late April to late October.  Moreover, if you can sometimes find available rooms in 5-star hotels, then in budget three-star hotels, such as Bomo Club Olympic Kosma 3 * <span>(Greece / Halkidiki / Kassandra),</span> almost always all accommodation facilities are reserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympic Kosma Bomo Club 3 * (photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1533418.jpg" width="600"></div>

The flight time is approximately three and a half hours.  Most of the hotels that are located on the peninsula organize transfers - delivering tourists from the airport to their territory, and the Hotel Bomo Club Olympic Kosma 3 * hotel is no exception.  However, some tourists prefer to rent cars, then to explore nearby attractions on their own.  Some of them agree on this when buying a tour, and upon arrival at the airport they will already have a car parked in the parking lot.  By the way, the cost of renting, depending on the brand of car, varies from 30-70 euros per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bomo Club Olympic Kosma 3 * (Greece / Halkidiki / Kassandra)" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1533417.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Olympic Kosma Bomo Club 3 * - a beautiful hotel on the coast of Kassandra </h2><p>  This hotel is located on the coast of the Halkidiki Peninsula in the picturesque village of Chanoti.  This economical hotel provides tourists with comfortable rooms of several categories, there are also several food systems, although most tourists choose all-inclusive.  Young people, couples and families prefer to relax here.  Everyone will find entertainment to their liking, although most tourists who come to Greece think more about excursions, and of the water activities that they are offered on the beaches.  And in the evenings they are waiting for bars, taverns and clubs, of which there are a great many in the village.  In general, Chanoti is not at all suitable for those who dream of privacy and quiet relaxation.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is three thousand square meters.  It houses the main building, villas, pool, bars, restaurants and cafes.  In 2016, the Olympic Kosma Bomo Club 3 * hotel was renovated, and since then it has been meeting visitors with updated interiors. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  As already noted, the hotel we are interested in is located in mainland Greece, namely in the north of the Aegean Sea, on one of the fingers of the three-fingered peninsula of Halkidiki, which bears the poetic name of Kassandra.  The village, which is indicated in the address of the Olympic Cosman Hotel, is called Chanoti.  From the airport "Macedonia", which is located in Thessaloniki, to the village of 90 km, and from its center to our hotel - just 500 meters.  If you go by public transport from the airport, you need to take into account that the last 200 meters from the bus stop to the hotel will need to drag your bags.  For those who are very important that the hotel is on the first line, we think we need to find out that it is not such.  On the other hand, the beach can be reached in just 7 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Bomo Club Olympic Kosma 3 *" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1533415.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, about this hotel you will find completely different comments.  However, if you look at the date of publication, you will understand why.  The thing is that the renovation of the Bomo Club Olympic Kosma 3 * has recently been completed.  Reviews 2016, therefore, are enthusiastic, because tourists were accommodated in freshly refurbished rooms, but the records of an earlier period are not so optimistic.  However, in all of them you can find meritorious reviews of the kitchen and the service staff.  The only minus of the hotel is its high audibility.  And so here is just the perfect combination of "price-quality". </p>
