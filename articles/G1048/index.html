Hurghada, Egypt, sea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When you choose a vacation in Egypt for yourself, Hurghada in most cases may be a more attractive place than Cairo or Sharm El Sheikh.  The fact is that this resort is more democratic.  Because the prices here are much lower, and you can relax no worse than in other, more expensive cities in Egypt.  When you arrive in Hurghada, you will have a wonderful vacation: the sea, the sun, pristine beaches, excellent service and good mood.  The climate here is very mild, in Hurghada it is not as hot as in other resorts in Egypt, because you can spend as much time on the beach as you wish.  And you can go on excursions in Egypt (Hurghada);  prices for some of them will be described in the article. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The history of Hurghada is amazing because in just 50 years an unknown place has turned into a tourist mecca.  Even before the mid-seventies of the last century, Hurghada was not even marked on the map of Egypt.  It was a small settlement where search engine oil workers lived and worked, and the only attraction was the military airport.  And in just fifteen years, a small village was able to become a leader among resort towns.  In nineteen seventy-fourth, the first hotel was built, which was given the name Sheraton (now Le Meridien).  But the real heyday of Hurghada began in the eighties, when it was allowed to foreign companies to charter flights.  The first tourists from Russia flew here in the ninety-third year.  And now this resort is called the winter all-Russian health resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hurghada Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/468011.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, it is in excellent condition.  The settlement was founded more than two centuries <span>BC.</span>  Masons lived and worked here.

    <h2>  Hurghada Christian Coptic Church </h2><p>  Here is another attraction - the Christian (Orthodox) <span>Coptic Church.</span>  It is located in downtown (the old city).  Entrance to the church is free. </p><h2>  How to have fun in the evening? </h2><p>  Having a rest on the sea during the day or going on an excursion, you will certainly want to continue the entertainment.  But even at night, Hurghada (Egypt) is beautiful - the sea, the stars set in a romantic mood.  And you will certainly want to sit somewhere in a cozy cafe or restaurant.  And there are plenty of them in the city, for every taste and budget.  The most famous of them is the Felfela restaurant, which specializes in meat cuisine.  "El Mina" - the best fish restaurant.  El Joker is also a fish restaurant, where the seafood selection is so huge that it can even confuse you.  But experienced waiters can always offer a dish to your taste.  After having lunch in a good restaurant, head to the disco.  The most popular disco in Hurghada is the club "Calypso".  Entrance to this entertainment facility is paid.  Sinbad is an equally popular club.  This is the oldest disco.  Entrance is also paid.  And if you want something unusual, then go to the foamy disco in the hotel "Ali Baba".  But, unfortunately, it works only on Tuesdays.  Paid entrance. </p><h2>  Hotel "Riviera Festival" </h2><p>  Of course, any tourist has a question: ‚ÄúWhere to stay?‚Äù  There are a lot of hotels in Hurghada: both expensive and not so expensive.  If you don‚Äôt want to pay a lot for your stay, then you should pay attention to the Festival of the Riviera hotel.  This hotel complex is located in the Dahar district.  The hotel building was built in two thousand eight.  This hotel has four hundred thirty four standard rooms.  The rooms have private bathrooms.  But slippers and bathrobes are provided only to newlyweds and regular customers.  Meals - all inclusive.  Wi-Fi is available only in public areas.  Free parking is available on site.  Be sure to come to Egypt (Hurghada).  "Riviera Festival" is always glad to guests. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Before leaving, make sure that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued a warning about unwanted visits due to the situation in the country.  It should be noted that in Egypt it is difficult to buy alcohol and cigarettes.  Therefore, you can buy a block of cigarettes and three bottles of alcohol in a duty-free shop within a day after the flight.  Do not buy papyrus, as there may be problems when leaving!  Trade in the markets.  Remember that when you fly to a Muslim country, you find yourself in a completely different world.  Therefore, before traveling, take the trouble to learn etiquette rules that may seem strange to a European.  Respect local traditions, otherwise you will be detained by the police.  Do not drink alcohol in public.  Do not wear open clothing.  Natural fabrics are the best option and you won‚Äôt be hot. </p><p>  Do not interfere in the affairs of the religion of the Egyptians.  If you are already talking to an Arab, be prepared for a long introductory conversation about nothing.  And do not neglect the invitation to visit!  There you will be received very warmly and fed to the dump.  Try not to speak with unfamiliar women, so as not to offend their honor.  In a cafe, pay a lot of tips, but it's still better to hide your wallet.  Of course, many people come here for relaxation and service.  Please observe the rules of decency!  From somewhere, after all, stereotypical ideas about Russian tourists come from, which are scary to let into the country.  And excessive consumption of alcoholic drinks will not add to local respect for you. </p><p>  If you follow the rules of decency and follow the instructions of a guide when visiting Egypt (Hurghada), the sights will remain for many future generations - we will keep them! </p>
