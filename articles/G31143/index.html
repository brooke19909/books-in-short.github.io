It is located in the center of the country at an altitude of 1435 meters above sea level.  The capital of Madagascar is translated from Malagasy as “the city of a thousand,” however, no one knows exactly what: villages, warriors, or hills.  Indigenous people call their favorite city simply “Tana”, which means “city”.  You may notice that in almost all sources the double name of the capital is written.  The fact is that until 1977 the city was called Tananarive. </p><p>  It has an interesting history, since it was founded in the distant seventeenth century by Andriadzak, the ruler of Imerina.  Therefore, Antananarivo was the center of Imerena, and only then - the capital of the kingdom.  Moreover, it is also interesting that the castle, which was built by the rulers of Merin, used to be located on this site.  This building has been preserved to this day and is located on the highest point of the city and represents the numerous attractions of Madagascar. </p><p>  The capital of Madagascar is located on three hills that represent </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of Madagascar" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/16022.jpg" width="432"></div>  one whole thanks to numerous stairs and tunnels.  On the south side is the royal hill of Ruva, on its top is the palace of Andafia-varatra, which was built in 1800.  Now here is the National Museum, which became famous for the richest art gallery of the kings.  On the north side of the museum is the residence of the Republican President - Rainilayarivuni Palace.  The capital of Madagascar in the center has Lake Anusi, which attracts tourists with its lilac water, thanks to the reflection of the colors blooming around the jacaranda.  In the heart of the lake is an obelisk ascended into the sky to those Malagasy who died during the warrior.  On Independence Square there is a granite monument, which depicts the flag of the kingdom and the words: “Freedom.  People.  Development".

Among them, the National Assembly and the University, the Academy of Sciences and the Radio House are of particular interest.  In other areas, almost everywhere low-rise buildings, which are decorated with elements of folk architecture.

    <p>  The capital of Madagascar, Antananarivo, is an amazing city: walking along the many streets, it may seem that you are in France: it says “Made in France” in small shops, the faint aroma of freshly baked croissants is felt in the air, and in the very center of the city is Hotel de France . </p><p>  <span>Holidays in Madagascar</span> begin with a visit to this amazing, ancient city.  However, taking a walk along the Antananarivo, approach responsibly the choice of outfit: the military style is extremely undesirable.
