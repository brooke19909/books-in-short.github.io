For a long time, flagships have not pleased with serious differences, limited to a couple of chips in design and software.  However, buyers want a really better product for their money.  As a result, a person acquires a slightly modified old device, at best in a new shell.  In fact, it happened with the iPhone 3GS phone model.  The characteristics of this device are far from ideal.  Moreover, the developers have not fulfilled the main wishes of their fans regarding multimedia, design and camera.  On the other hand, some requirements were nevertheless taken into account. </p><h2>  Sales and Cost </h2><p>  So long announced product iPhone 3GS 16Gb, the characteristics of which were supposed to raise its owners to seventh heaven, did not enter the Russian market.  All attempts by domestic operators to agree on sales are not heard.  However, how many Russian connoisseurs of iPhone have lost a lot? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3gs iphone specifications" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/866115.jpg" width="550"></div>  Interestingly, the new line came in two forms: with 16 and 32 GB of memory.  The cost of the device depends on this indicator.  Outside Russia, the phone is valued at approximately $ 450.  If the devices get on the domestic shelves, then their cost will be approximately 25 to 27 thousand rubles.  Nevertheless, sales of telecom operators have not yet begun.  But there is an active informal implementation through various resources and private stores.  In this case, those who wish will have to pay about 60 thousand rubles for a new phone.

It is worth highlighting the <span>processor characteristics of the</span> 3GS iPhone <span>.</span>  The ARM chipset produces data processing with a frequency of 833 MHz.  However, in the case of standard applications, there are limitations up to 600 MHz.  Also, it will not be superfluous to note the memory characteristics of the <span>Apple iPhone</span> 3GS.  Built-in bracket can store from 16 to 32 GB of information.  But the amount of RAM on the phone is minimal - 256 MB. <br><br>  An interesting feature of the <span>Apple iPhone</span> 3GS 16Gb camera feature.  Apparently, the developers decided that users of their product would not need high-quality shooting.  Otherwise, how can one explain the main camera of 3 megapixels?  Despite the built-in autofocus, the slightest movement results in blurry frames.  The camera boasts a resolution of 2014x1536.  As for video recording, the maximum format is 640x480. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 3gs specifications" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/866116.jpg" width="550"></div>  The device supports more than ten of the most common communication and data transfer interfaces.  Of the additional chips you can select a <span>digital compass,</span> information encryption and an accelerometer.

    <h2>  Subtleties of Design </h2><p>  Differ from previous versions of the iPhone 3GS housing characteristics.  Its dimensions are 115 by 62 mm.  Nevertheless, there is no need to talk about ultrathin - 12.3 mm in thickness.  The weight of this device is 135 g. Thanks to its small dimensions, the phone fits comfortably in your pocket or clutch. <br><br>  The case is made of environmentally friendly plastic.  According to the assurances of the developers, over time, microcracks will not occur on the rear panel, as was the case with earlier models.  There are practically no updates on the design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple iphone 3gs specifications" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/866117.jpg" width="600"></div>  You can note the appearance of the volume control on the headphone cable.  Also included is a complete remote control.  Thanks to him, you can easily manipulate audio files without removing the device from your pocket.  Upon purchase, users will receive a standard and outwardly unremarkable product in the iPhone 3GS 16 Gb line.

It should be noted that the iPhone 3GS 16Gb display characteristics are really good.  Despite the small resolution of 320x480, the screen produces 16 million colors.  All thanks to the use of TFT and HVGA technology. <br><br>  The display has a special coating that protects the surface from grease stains.  In previous models of the line, traces on the screen remained even from the slightest touch, and they were erased quite hard. <br><br>  Interestingly, the new product used an advanced multi-tasking management system. </p><h2>  Performance indicators </h2><p>  For a 3GS iPhone, processor features are perhaps its only advantage.  Due to the increased frequency of the chipset, the data stream is processed many times faster.  The hardware platform has also been enriched with a 2nd level cache.  Its volume is 256 Kb. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple iphone 3gs 16gb feature" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/866118.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the modern market, this flagship is considered the benchmark for interface performance.  New products based on WM and Symbian were not with him.  In 3GS, not only standard programs are launched quickly, but also a browser, and Internet cards, and other graphically complex applications. <br><br>  High performance is also noted in the AppStore, where it often takes a long time to wait for the processing of the search sheet and file playback.  As the reviews of 3GS owners show, the phone works faster in any mode than the same previous model of the 3G line.

    <h2>  Battery Charge and Volume </h2><p>  Oddly enough, the 3GS iPhone battery characteristics are not encouraging.  In terms of volume, the battery remained at the same level as the so-criticized 3G model.  In a press release, the device announced that the battery would hold a charge in full load (Internet, video stream, games) for about 10 hours.  In fact, it turned out that the phone‚Äôs active time will be no more than 5.5 hours. <br><br>  In the playback mode of audio files, the battery will hold about 20 hours.  In the active state, a 2G or 3G battery will store a charge of up to 10 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 3gs 16 gb specifications" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/866119.jpg" width="600"></div>  Thus, with standard use of the device, its operating time is limited to one day.  This is normal practice for Apple products, but it‚Äôs high time to move away from it.  What is convenient is the battery indicator in percent.

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  One of the obvious advantages of the model is the proprietary iPhone browser.  No developer has yet been able to at least repeat Apple's achievement.  The browser has built-in scaling capabilities, limitations of graphic elements, fixing the speed of work, percentage indicators, preview mode and much more. <br><br>  Also, the advantages of 3GS are a convenient email client, high-quality transmission and speech recognition, a simple and pleasant interface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 3gs 16gb specifications" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/866120.jpg" width="600"></div>  Among the shortcomings, the fact that when playing any media file requires synchronization with iTunes.  With active use, the phone has to be charged every 10-12 hours.  There is no way to minimize most applications.

    <h2>  3GS iPhone Reviews </h2><p>  The processor features make the phone one of Apple's fastest mobile products.  A digital compass makes navigation easier on Google Maps.  Very convenient voice control.  With VoiceOver, your device can recognize commands in seconds.  The option works in all embedded applications. <br><br>  The main disadvantage of the phone is its unreasonably high price.  In addition, the camera is still weak, the shooting quality is average.  The back panel scratches quickly if you do not use a case.  The battery is weak, so you always have to carry a charge with you. </p>
