For retirement, this component plays an extremely important role.  That is why it is required to find out as much information as possible about insurance experience.  Indeed, in the case of <span>seniority,</span> everything is clear - these are periods of time for official employment.  Counting it is not as difficult as it seems.  It is enough in years, months, weeks and days to express the total duration of employment.  But as regards the experience of the insurance type, everything is not so simple.  In some cases, this feature has to be further confirmed.  So what are we talking about?  And what should every citizen know about this component? </p><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  First of all, you have to understand what the length of service is.  For retirement, this is an extremely important component.  Without it, in principle, pension payments are not allowed.  Therefore, many think about what this term is. </p><p>  Seniority - periods of time during which a citizen made contributions to the <span>Pension Fund of Russia.</span>  More precisely, this is the total result of the indicated intervals.  Usually the insurance experience is more than labor.  According to the definition established in Russia, this term denotes the total duration of contributions to the FIU, which has no significant relationship with seniority. </p>

    <p>  Simply put, it means the periods in which a citizen makes contributions to the Pension Fund.  What do you need to know about them?  What features do you need to pay attention to? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of experience </h2><p>  What is an insurance experience?  For retirement, he plays, as already mentioned, an important role.  Without this component, pension payments cannot be received at all.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the insurance experience may be different.  There are several types of it.  Which options are highlighted in Russia? </p><p>  Normal length of service is the first category.  As a rule, it is characterized by the periods in which certain deductions were made to the FIU of the Russian Federation.  That is, payments without features. </p><p>  Special insurance experience is the second type of the studied component of the formation of pensions.  It characterizes the period of labor in special (for example, harmful or dangerous) conditions. </p><h2>  Unearned periods </h2><p>  There are no more types of insurance guards.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that these periods are not necessarily official employment under a work book or contract.  There are periods that are officially credited to the insurance period, but they are not considered working hours.  The length of service for the <span>appointment of a pension</span> plays a fundamental role.  But due to some circumstances, citizens are forced to not work.  Therefore, special unearned moments of life are counted in the "insurance". </p>

    <p>  Among them are: </p><ul><li>  <span>caring for an elderly person</span> with a <span>disability</span> from the age of 80 or a disabled person from birth; </li><li>  being on maternity leave up to one and a half years; </li><li>  military service; </li><li>  time of receipt of disability benefits (temporary); </li><li>  periods during which unemployment benefits were paid; </li><li>  the time spent in prison, if afterwards the innocence of a citizen is proved; </li><li>  relocation as directed by employment centers for employment purposes; </li><li>  finding spouses of people working in embassies and consulates outside the Russian Federation; </li><li>  periods of stay with the military (meaning spouses) in areas where it is impossible to find a job. </li></ul><p>  However, there are some limitations.  The thing is that periods of care for minors allow you to get no more than 4.5 <span>years of experience</span> in total.  And if we are talking about staying with a military husband where you can‚Äôt find a job, then the studied period of time will allow you to get a maximum of 5 years of experience in the field of insurance.  Otherwise, no restrictions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Official labor </h2><p>  The length of service for an old-age pension is extremely important.  The time periods that are counted as "insurance" have already been named.  But often the insurance experience is a period of employment.  If a citizen does not officially work and does not have any features of the unearned type, then his seniority is not counted.  So, it may be that a citizen will receive a minimum pension in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance calculator" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1488998.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <p>  The official periods of the labor type, which allow to increase the insurance period, are considered: </p><ul><li>  Work hours under an employment contract.  This refers to official employment. </li><li>  Participation in public works that are paid by the state.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter in which ones. </li><li>  Periods of doing business.  All entrepreneurs, regardless of the type of business, make contributions to the FIU for themselves and for their employees. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, businessmen can also receive a pension and insurance experience.  This is extremely important for those who do not plan to work "uncle", but still counts on pension payments in the future. </p><h2>  Relevance </h2><p>  The length of service for calculating a pension is one of the most important indicators.  Without it, pension payments cannot be calculated.  After all, as a rule, a pension is paid precisely from all accumulated deductions that were made for a citizen or directly to a pensioner earlier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Also the insurance period is important for the sick leave.  But a much more important point is precisely the pension.  After all, this type of payment becomes the main source of income for disabled elderly people.  It is worth paying attention that they plan to increase the insurance period for the appointment of a retirement pension (or any other) until 2024.  So, it is worth worrying about its availability in advance.  The bigger, the better.  Moreover, getting insurance type experience is easier than working. </p><h2>  How to calculate </h2><p>  What principles are suggested to be guided for <span>calculation of the experience?</span>  In fact, there is nothing difficult.  The thing is that the calculation of the insurance period for a pension is only the simplest mathematical operations, or rather addition. </p>

    <p>  It is enough to summarize all periods of official employment, as well as the time that is included in the length of service.  At the end, you get the total amount.  In principle, there is nothing difficult or special about this.  Many recommend the use of a special insurance coverage calculator.  It will allow you to accurately determine how much "insurance" a person has accumulated from the input data.  Find this service is offered on the official website of the FIU. </p><h2>  Lows </h2><p>  What else should you pay attention to?  The thing is that there is a certain minimum length of insurance experience that every citizen must gain.  Only in this case it will be possible to apply for retirement benefits from the state.  He used to be 5 years old.  But in 2015 there was an increase to 6 years.  In 2016, it was slightly increased by 1 year.  Now, to receive a pension, you will have to earn at least 7 years of insurance experience. </p><p>  But, as already mentioned, before 2024 it is planned to increase this restriction.  They say that in Russia the insurance period for a pension (old age or any other) should be at least 15 years.  This change has already been accepted.  Therefore, future pensioners should worry in advance about the availability of sufficient insurance experience. </p><h2>  the confirmation </h2><p>  But this is not all the important information that everyone should familiarize themselves with.  How is the confirmation of the insurance period for the pension?  This is not so easy.  The thing is that every citizen must, when assigning a pension, provide some evidence indicating certain periods that are counted in the type of experience studied.  The documents are varied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="retirement insurance calculation" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1488997.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among the evidence usually provide: </p><ul><li>  military ID; </li><li>  birth certificates of children; </li><li>  certificates of adoption; </li><li>  extracts on doing business; </li><li>  work book; </li><li>  other papers indicating the presence of insurance experience (for example, statements on caring for a disabled person 80 years old). </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, if the insurance period calculator is used, then all specified time intervals will have to be specified independently.  Only then will it be possible to fully find out your insurance experience. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Perhaps this is all the important information that every citizen of Russia should know about.  In general, the situation with pensions in the country is ambiguous.  Now we have to constantly monitor changes in the system.  It is already clear that the insurance type experience will increase.  But they do not plan to exclude unearned periods, which allow you to get additional "insurance". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="length of service for a retirement pension" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1489000.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what the length of service is.  For retirement, this is one of the main indicators that directly affects pension payments.  In fact, to calculate the experience, and also to prove it is not so difficult.  It is recommended to learn about all changes in the FIU.  They will definitely tell you everything about employment and insurance experience.  Also, this organization will help to find out how long an insurance type is for a given citizen. </p>
