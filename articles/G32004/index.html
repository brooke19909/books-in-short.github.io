Simultaneously with the formation of the armholes, the neck of the shape of your choice is tied.  In this case, shelves are created separately from each other.  After the back is created and in front of the vest, the details are sewn together.  The armholes and neckline are tied with a neat seam or a small elastic band. </p><div class="photo" data-original="heaclub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2733560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2733560.jpg"></div><p>  Knitted with a knitting needles, a simple vest is usually created with a garter stitch, that is, all the loops are knitted with the front method in both even and odd rows.
