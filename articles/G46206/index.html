    <h2>  Documents for a loan </h2><p>  Reviews about Vostochny Bank are often laudatory because of the minimum package of documents that a financial institution requires when applying for a loan.  Indeed, when applying for most types of loans or credit cards, the bank does not ask for any additional papers and certificates.  The main necessary documents are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Original of a valid passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  SNILS is a green plastic card for state pension insurance. </li></ul><p>  Sometimes a bank may request additional documents from its potential borrower.  These include the TIN.  Such a document is considered mandatory for presentation to the bank if the borrower is an individual entrepreneur. </p><p>  There are certain nuances.  When applying for a loan of more than 300 thousand rubles, a mandatory document will be a 2NDFL certificate or in the form of a bank.  It will serve as proof of the solvency of the client.  But in some cases this is not required.  The need to provide such a certificate disappears if the borrower is a salary client of the bank. </p><p>  To obtain a loan or a credit card, additional documents may also be referred to a financial institution.  This list includes: </p><ul><li>  Driver's license. </li><li>  A copy of the work book certified by the seal of the employer. </li><li>  Title to the vehicle. </li><li>  Certificate of ownership of real estate. </li><li>  Foreign passport, with marks on leaving the country during the last year. </li><li>  Third-party credit card. </li><li>  Voluntary health insurance policy. </li></ul><p>  According to reviews of Vostochny Bank, such additional documents are rarely required.  You can get a loan for just two inquiries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="east bank customer loan reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2182964.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Customer feedback on loans </h2><p>  Credit Bank "Vostochny" customer reviews, like most other financial and credit organizations, are very contradictory.  Let's consider them in more detail.  Some clients are very satisfied with lending services and a low interest rate, while others are absolutely not. </p><p>  But despite this, both sides have an agreement on one thing: the bank too imposes its services.  How is this manifested?  According to current and former customers, employees of a financial institution intrusively offer their services in the field of lending.  They often call numbers that were left as additional contacts, offering to arrange a loan. </p><p>  But on the whole, the feedback from Vostochny Bank's customers is positive about the loan processing procedure and the annual rate on it.  The benefits do not end there.  The simplicity of filling out an application on the official website of the bank, as well as the speed of decision-making on the submitted application for a loan, received positive feedback. </p><p>  Not all customers are satisfied that when you loan a large amount of money, you must provide not only a certificate confirming income, but also a copy of the work book. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="orient express bank customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65584/2181806.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Credit Card Reviews </h2><p>  Credit cards issued by the bank are also popular.  However, customer reviews of Vostochny Express Bank on credit cards are not so positive.  Why?  Most negative opinions relate to the currently popular ‚ÄúHeat‚Äù credit card.  Customers complain that you can not refuse insurance during its registration.  It is worth noting that additional payments are made for card insurance. </p><p>  But that is not all.  A lot of complaints from customers come about the complete closure of the credit limit on the card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eastern bank loan reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65584/2181791.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Bank debtors reviews </h2><p>  A separate story is the opinion of debtors.  Everyone understands that feedback from Vostochny Credit Bank from people who have overdue debts will not be positive.  Complaints are received by collector calls at almost any time of the day.  But this is understandable.  None of the credit organizations will forgive the debt to its borrower.  She will make every effort to ensure that the debtor returns the money. </p><p>  In addition to negative reviews from the debtors themselves, negative ones also come from people whose number was left as an additional contact. </p><h2>  Feedback from Vostochny Bank employees about working in it </h2><p>  And now about the feedback that Vostochny Credit Bank receives from its current and former employees. </p><p>  Unfortunately, most of them are not positive.  Former employees of a credit institution complain about the irregular schedule associated with a lack of staff.  Also, if you read reviews about working at this bank, you can find out that employees are practically forced to make calls with a proposal to get a loan.  In this regard, the offices have a large staff turnover.  Former employees complained that they had to hand out flyers advertising banking services.  However, such work was not paid extra. </p><p>  Of course, there are also positive reviews from Vostochny Express bank employees.  They talk about the stable and timely payment of wages, a close-knit and friendly team and career opportunities. </p>
