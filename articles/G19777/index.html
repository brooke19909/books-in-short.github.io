    <h2>  Hotel Advantages </h2><p>  Often the reviews of previous guests are a decisive factor when choosing a place to stay.  The tourist complex Aqua Azur 4 * (Bulgaria) does not have the best reputation, because the opinions of guests are not always positive.  First, consider the advantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  Clean rooms that are carefully cleaned every day.  They wipe the dust from the cabinets, wash the floors well, clean the sink, bath and toilets. </li><li>  Smiling and friendly staff who politely answer questions and quickly solve problems. </li><li>  Very warm and calm sea.  The entrance to it is smooth, so it is well suited for swimming with children. </li><li>  Only a few minutes to the beach.  The hotel and the sea are separated by a small staircase and a road. </li><li>  A very beautiful sea view opens from the balcony. </li><li>  Standard but hearty breakfasts.  Well suited for children. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Hotel Disadvantages </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the hotel Aqua Azur 4 * (Bulgaria) has negative reviews.  According to tourists, there are serious drawbacks that can ruin a vacation.  They believe that the hotel management should pay attention to the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The hotel has water problems.  For several days she was not at all, so I had to wash my face with water from the cooler. </li><li>  There is no Internet either in rooms or in public places.  It works intermittently only at the front desk. </li><li>  Bad housekeeping.  The pool is always dirty tiles, on the beach there are a lot of cigarette butts, packets of chips, plastic glasses and other garbage. </li><li>  Poorly washed dishes in a restaurant.  In September, the playground does not work, so the hotel has no entertainment for children at all. </li><li>  There are no sun loungers and towels on the beach.  You have to buy them yourself. </li></ul><h2>  Should I go here on vacation? </h2><p>  If the listed disadvantages of the hotel did not seem significant to you, then Aqua Azur (Bulgaria) will be a good place for you to relax.  It is designed for a family vacation, so couples with children, as well as elderly tourists, will like it here.  In general, the hotel offers a budget vacation at good prices that are consistent with the quality of service.  Although some travelers still believe that it is more likely a three-star rather than a four-star complex. </p>
