Of course, there are species that women and even children are fond of, but catching pike perch in December is perhaps a truly male hobby.  Pikeperch is well caught at any time of the year, but since its favorite habitats are whirlpools, pits, hollows and steep slopes, it is difficult but interesting to fish on it, and even in winter. </p><p>  Good bite happens in the evening, almost at dusk, or vice versa, in the morning - at dawn, when the pike perches.  There are many ways to catch this predator, but catching pikeperch on a sprat (a small sprat, which this fish likes very much, especially in winter, when it becomes more difficult to get live food) is probably the most popular. </p><p>  Fresh bait is used as bait.  Its quality is determined by the purity and luster of the scales, and the specific cucumber flavor.  The method of attachment of the spool to the hook depends on the type of the main <span>bait (spinner,</span> mormyshka, single hook, jig head), as well as on the activity of the fishing process.  Although it is impossible to exclude the influence of other factors: the manner of cutting fish, the conditions of the reservoir and the specific preferences of the fisherman.  This method is best calculated independently, empirically.  However, catching zander on a spider has its own specific feature: the bait does not withstand repeated thawing, falling apart and flying off the hook. </p><p>  The fishing tackle necessary to catch zander is presented with one, but an important requirement - strength.  The diameter of the fishing line can range from 0.2 (with a depth of less than 8 meters) to 0.25 millimeters (depending on depth), and reels from 70 to 90. Such a fishing line is reliable enough to catch even large individuals.  The fishing rod can be ordinary, but with a short tail and an elastic nod.  The rest of the equipment depends on the desire and capabilities of the angler, but in any case, it includes a mormyshka with a hanging hook located above it at an altitude of 30-40 centimeters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since zander is a nocturnal predator that responds well to light, it is advisable to acquire mormyshka light-accumulating, or color it with a phosphor.  Such a simple technique is very effective, because fishing for pike perch in mormyshka is carried out at a considerable depth, where almost complete darkness reigns.  The mormyshka or hook is attached to a leash 15 cm long. Double or triple hooks are sometimes used, but they complicate the process of casting fishing line into the hole.  The leash is tied to the fishing line so that even with a very strong jerk, it can easily slide to the very bottom.  Therefore, it would be optimal to tie the leash not to the fishing line, but to an elastic band or cambric mounted on it.  The second option is even more preferable - cambric, squeezing the fishing line, will not allow it to be injured, but the slip will remain elastic. </p><p>  Another specific detail - the suspension leash in diameter should exceed the main forest.  So they get less confused, and catching pike perch on a spider becomes even more pleasant.  Depending on where the zander lives, the tactics of its survival are also selected.  If there are several ranges on this reservoir, then in the absence of a bite on one of them, you should not linger - the pike perch always selects its special place and becomes attached to it.  It should be borne in mind that in the winter the zander is inactive, which means that it will need to be thoroughly teased.  That is why catching zander on a spider is effective - a very attractive bait for this predator. </p><p>  The main fishing tactics in this case are as follows.  In a potentially good place, several fishing rods are exposed at once.  Then, in turn, it is necessary to play vigorously with the bait on each of them.  Such ‚Äúprey‚Äù activity will necessarily wake the hunting interest of zander, and the fisherman will only have to pull out the catch. </p>
