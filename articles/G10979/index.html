  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian-Livonian war: years, causes, outcome of the war, historical facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Russian-Livonian war is one of the largest military conflicts that occurred in the 16th century.  It was attended by the Livonian Confederation, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Danish and Swedish kingdoms, as well as the Russian kingdom.  Military operations developed mainly on the territory of modern Latvia, Estonia, Belarus and North-West Russia. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The Russian-Livonian war was preceded by a treaty that Ivan III concluded with the Livonian Confederation.  It was a six-year truce.  Then it was extended five more times.  Under the terms of this agreement, the bishopric paid Pskov an annual tribute.  But at some time, payments stopped. </p><p>  In 1554, Ivan the Terrible demanded compensation for arrears, however, the Livonian Confederation did not comply with its obligations.  In addition, the Livonians concluded an agreement with the Polish Kingdom that they became its vassals. </p><p>  The year 1557 is generally rich in events that lead to the Russian-Livonian war of 1558-1583.  Ivan IV opens a port on the banks of Narva, but the Hanseatic League, together with Livonia, refuse to allow European merchants to trade with the Russians.  Those have to, as before, go to Livonian ports. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.laliku.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan groznyj" class="if uuid-2601667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601667.jpg"></div><p>  Among historians, there are two versions of what led to this war.  On the one hand, it is believed that Ivan the Terrible acted in accordance with the geopolitical interests of the state.  Thus, the non-payment by the Livonians of the ‚ÄúSt. George's tribute‚Äù became a justifiable reason for the outbreak of armed conflict.  Those researchers who support this view point out that at that time there was a barrier in the form of Livonians between Europe and Russia.  It was necessary to eliminate it in order for the country to continue cultural and military-technical development. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to another version, Ivan the Terrible was not going to start a war against Livonia, the entire military campaign in 1558 was only a demonstration of strength, with the aim of encouraging the Livonians to pay tribute.  Therefore, the war did not initially pursue geopolitical reasons; no documents of that era contain information about the need for access to the sea. </p><h2>  Course of war </h2><div class="photo" data-original="diletant.media" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Siege of cities" class="if uuid-2601682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601682.jpg"></div><p>  The Russian-Livonian war is conditionally divided into 4 stages.  The first is characterized by a confrontation with the Livonian Confederation.  The beginning of the Russian-Livonian war was due to the invasion of the enemy‚Äôs land in 1558. </p><p>  In April, Narva was besieged.  After the fire in the city of the Russian army, a successful assault succeeds, the main forces of the Livonians surrender as a result. </p><p>  The situation at the walls of Neuhausen is more complicated.  Several hundred knights almost a month reflect the attacks of the governor Peter Shuisky.  Only after the destruction of the towers and fortress walls by Russian artillery did the Germans retreat to the upper castle.  Their leader, von Padenorm, wants to continue to defend, but there are so few defenders alive that they refuse to continue the resistance.  Out of respect for their courage, Shuisky allows the Germans to leave the fortress with honor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By July, Shuisky reaches Dorpat.  After a protracted shelling, the city surrendered.  By the end of the year, the Russian army captures 20 fortresses-cities.  After that, he leaves for winter apartments, leaving small garrisons in the cities.  At this moment, Master Ketler decides to regain the lost position.  The siege of Ringen continues for five weeks, but the Germans still beat him off when the defenders ran out of gunpowder.  Ketler is unable to develop his success further; he is moving to Riga. </p><p>  In response, the Russian army goes on a winter raid.  January 17, 1559 Governor Serebryany defeats the army of the knight Felkenzam.  Further, the Russian army passes to Riga, capturing 11 more cities along the way. </p><h2>  Armistice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Janissaries of Ivan the Terrible" class="if uuid-2601672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601672.jpg"></div><p>  After the winter raid, Ivan IV offers the Livonians a truce.  This was caused by pressure from Poland, Lithuania, Sweden and Denmark, who themselves had views of the Livonian lands and persuaded the Russian tsar to stop the campaign, otherwise threatening to support the confederation. </p><p>  Taking advantage of this respite, the Livonians organized reinforcements, a month before the end of the armistice they attacked the Russian army. </p><h2>  The resumption of war </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thor-2006.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Livonian War in the North" class="if uuid-2601671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601671.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, the Russian-Livonian war resumed in 1560.  Our troops were again successful.  The Livonian army was virtually completely defeated, new lands and fortresses were captured. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After that, Lithuania and Sweden demanded that Moscow withdraw troops from territories that they considered to be their own, since during the armistice the Livonians came under their protectorate.  But Ivan the Terrible refused to do this, having entered into another armed conflict. </p><h2>  Confrontation with Lithuanians </h2><p>  The new stage of the Russian-Livonian war (the years in which it lasted - 1558 - 1583) was a conflict with the Principality of Lithuania. </p><p>  The situation was complicated by the blocking of Narva, the Swedes helped.  And in 1562, Lithuanian troops attacked Velizh and Smolensk.  The situation on the southern borders has worsened.  But in 1562, <span>Prince Kurbsky</span> defeats the Lithuanian detachment, which invaded the Pskov lands.  As a result, a truce was concluded between Russia and Denmark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sb.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Andrey Kurbsky" class="if uuid-2601670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601670.jpg"></div><p>  After the successful capture of Polotsk, Russia experienced a decline.  The defeat followed.  In addition, Kurbsky, who commanded the Russian army to the west, crossed to the Lithuanian side.  Inside the country, many were against the war, in particular, eminent boyars were against the siege of the Lithuanians. </p><p>  In response, Tsar Ivan organized repression, introducing the oprichnina in 1565.  As a result, the convened Zemsky Sobor supported the tsar to wage war in the Baltic until the capture of Riga. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lemur59.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean raids" class="if uuid-2601668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2601668.jpg"></div><p>  The third period of the war is due to the difficult situation on the northern borders.  Russia has strained relations with Sweden, and Devlet I Giraya, whose army burned Moscow in 1571, intensified in the south.  True, by the next year it was possible to destroy the army of the leader of the Crimean Tatars.  The further course of the war was negatively affected by economic ruin, the distribution of land in the Baltic to Russian nobles, which pushed the local peasantry from Russia. </p><h2>  War against poland </h2><div class="photo" data-original="turambar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Livonian war participants" class="if uuid-2602006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2602006.jpg"></div><p>  The final period of the war is associated with the war against Poland; it fell on 1577-1582.  The commander in chief of the Russian army during the Livonian War is Ivan the Terrible.  He decided at the beginning of 1577 to send troops under Revel, but failed to take the fortress.  In parallel, they began to build their fleet in Vologda, but it did not work to transfer it to the Baltic. </p><p>  Another betrayal awaited the Russian Tsar.  The Duke Magnus contacted <span>Stefan Batory,</span> making a separate peace.  Six months later, he fled from Livonia, going to the side of the Commonwealth. </p><p>  Under the leadership of Batory, many mercenaries from Europe fought, the ruler himself hoped that the Russians would go to his side, deciding to abandon his tyrant, even had a marching printing house that printed propaganda leaflets. </p><p>  In 1579, Bathory officially declared war on Russia.  The Polish army besieged Polotsk, the fortress surrendered three weeks later, followed by Great Luke. </p><p>  Grozny offered a truce to Poland, agreeing to give all the Livonian cities with the exception of four.  But Bathory did not agree.  The Polish and Lithuanian army continued to rob Smolensk, Ryazan, Novgorod. </p><p>  The Russians succeeded in a successful campaign in Lithuania in 1581, led by Dmitry Hvorostinin.  The heroic <span>defense of Pskov</span> in 1581-1582 determined the successful outcome of the war for Russia.  Having failed, Bathory agreed to peace talks. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  As a result of the Russian-Livonian war, the Livonian Confederation ceased to exist.  Its territories were divided by Denmark, Sweden and the Commonwealth.  Russia was ruined, the course of the war was greatly influenced by the Crimean raids. </p><p>  In 1582, near Pskov, the Yam-Zapolsky truce was concluded for 10 years with the Commonwealth.  As a result of the Livonian War, the Russian state abandoned claims to Livonia and the lands of modern Belarus, but it managed to return the border territories. </p><p>  In 1583, the <span>Plyus Armistice</span> followed with Sweden for three years.  Territories in the south of the Gulf of Finland that were returned only as a result of the war of 1590-1595 went to the latter. </p>
