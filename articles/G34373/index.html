    <h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Tributs Vladimir Filippovich, whose biography is unique, was born on July 15, 1900 in St. Petersburg.  Despite the poverty of his parents and constant malnutrition, he managed to finish several classes of primary school and then continue to pay tuition at the Petrovsky College. </p><p>  The result of the study was the admission of Vladimir to the military paramedic school.  Here he was always dressed, shod and fed.  Training was already free.  Having passed the exams, Tributs served in one of the hospitals in Petrograd. </p><h2>  Service start </h2><p>  In 1918, Vladimir decided to go to the front.  During the fighting against the Germans near Narva, he falls into the detachment of the Baltic <span>revolutionary sailors.</span>  This gave him the opportunity to later go to the Caspian Sea and prove himself in battles for the cities of the Caucasus region. </p>

    <p>  In the 1920s, Vladimir began training at a naval military school and, after completing 2 courses, received the post of commander of a naval platoon on the <span>battleship</span> Paris Commune.  Here he managed to prove himself as a purposeful and hardworking commander, ready for anything for the sake of the fleet.  In just three years, Tributz managed to rise to the rank of assistant ship commander.  After he was transferred to the combat ship "Marat", and in the end became the commander of this destroyer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Baltic Fleet Commander </h2><p>  Four years after successful training at the Maritime Academy, Vladimir Filippovich became the chief of staff of the Baltic Fleet, and two years later he took the post of commander of the Baltic Fleet.  He was in Talin when the Nazi Germany and their allies attacked the USSR.  Tallinn temporarily became the stronghold of the Baltic Fleet.  Despite the awareness of the German attack, the fleet was forced to evacuate from its base, and in August 1941 the ships arrived in Kronstadt.  Admiral Tributs, whose photo now adorns the BOD, named in his honor, did an excellent job of this task. </p><p>  This retreat was a difficult test for the admiral.  The entire naval squadron moved along Cape Yuminda, being subjected to shelling of enemy <span>coastal artillery</span> and air raids.  The situation worsened when the fleet hit the <span>minefield.</span>  As a result, in a few hours, many people were lost, three destroyers and many transport ships.  Having settled at night and bringing the ships to normal, in the morning the fleet moved again.  By evening, the fleet with heavy losses arrived at their destination. </p>

Most of the sailors from the ships were ordered immediately sent to the defense of the city.  It was a serious blow and a difficult decision for the fleet commander, but Admiral Tributs had to accept it, since there was no other choice.

It was necessary to revive the fleet and recruit new specialists to service the ships.  At the same time, the forces of the Baltic Fleet and naval aviation supported the existence of the road of life through Ladoga, and all attempts by the Germans to seize the Baltic Sea were suppressed. </p><p>  The next test that Admiral Tributz passed with honor was the liberation of Leningrad and the transfer of the army to the shores of the Baltic Sea.  The whole operation began under cover of night, and ended at dawn, when artillery began to work on the enemy fortifications.  For two months of the artillery of the Baltic Fleet, aviation, maneuvering operations of both the fleet and the ground forces, it was possible to lift the blockade from Leningrad. </p><h2>  After the Second World War </h2><p>  After <span>this, Admiral</span> Tributs continued to lead the operations of the fleet in the Baltic Sea.  Under his leadership, Konigsberg, the fortress of Pillau, was liberated.  At the end of the war, Vladimir Filippovich participated in the mine clearing of the sea borders of the USSR. </p>
