Here, for example, conventional ammunition.  It would seem, what to take from them?  Only a murder weapon and nothing more.  But let's open you a completely different side.  What can you make crafts from cartridges with your own hands? </p><h2>  The beginning of the story </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY do-it-yourself cases" class="if uuid-3088208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3088208.jpg"></div><p>  How did it all start?  Centuries ago, cartridges as such did not exist; they are a product of the nineteenth century.  Crafts from cartridge cases began to be massively done during the First World War.  Its positional character required that a large number of people be present at the front, although hostilities were not very active. </p><p>  Then the soldiers thought what to do with themselves.  Some of them began to make all kinds of crafts from cartridges.  So, various nice trinkets, jewelry and even useful things were made from them.  For example, little caches.  Now you can find many different devices that craftsmen manage to make from cartridges.  For example, lighters.  Let's look at how they are created. </p><h2>  Lighter making </h2><div class="photo" data-original="steampunker.ru" data-author=": koksasha, "><img itemprop="image" alt="finished lighter" class="if uuid-3087587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3087587.jpg"></div><p>  Gasoline is used as fuel.  The performance and caliber are not specified, so the freedom of creativity rests only on the available resources: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The fired sleeve is taken.  First of all, it is necessary to drill a capsule from it. </li><li>  Then his nest is reamed. </li><li>  After that, a thread is screwed in the hole.  A refueling system will be arranged here.  You can get by with a regular cork or even pour gasoline through the wick, although this is not entirely convenient. </li><li>  Now you can go to the sleeve of the sleeve.  First of all, it is necessary to choose a workpiece that will have a larger diameter several millimeters.  In it you need to drill a hole (in the center) a little smaller than the wick. </li><li>  Saw the workpiece / chop / cut so that a circle is obtained. </li><li>  We put it on the bolt and tighten the drill in the cartridge. </li><li>  We turn it on full turns and grind it until we get a perfect circle, which coincides in diameter with the dulce.  From the edge you need to step back a millimeter and grind a little deeper. </li><li>  Then a nest is created and pressed.  To ensure a firm fit, these two parts must be soldered.  A regular soldering iron is not the best option, and tin, to be honest, is not very suitable for this purpose.  Therefore, you can use a gas burner and silver solder. </li><li>  Now it's up to the cap.  In his role, you can use the bullet.  But before that, it must be processed and left with one steel core. </li><li>  This whole thing is assembled into one whole, and the turn of the node for cutting the spark comes.  As a basis, you can use a rectangular piece of brass, which should be bent into the letter "P".  Flint is pressed into it.  A spark jumps from friction, and the lighter can be used. </li></ul><p>  Of course, the circuit is described in general terms.  And the product is called a trench lighter. </p><h2>  Other possible craft options </h2><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="bK36B2d_KzE" data-url="https://youtu.be/bK36B2d_KzE" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/5/8/5/14585.jpg"></div><p>  You can make a variety of crafts from cartridges.  Everything rests on desire and creative imagination.  It is not in vain that people rethink even the things that are created in order to bring death. </p><p>  Cases from the sleeves can be cut out or invented and embodied on metal, complemented with beads and crystals, as well as other jewelry.  For example, you can make interesting and truly unique rings.  Another option is miniature vases and jugs, as well as useful things like flash drives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="flash drive" class="if uuid-3088444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3088444.jpg"></div><p>  And some craftsmen even make cutlery and small drawers. </p>
