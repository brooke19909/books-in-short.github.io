Its western border runs along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.  Neighboring countries are Angola, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  The nature of Namibia is unique.  These places attract tourists who love outdoor activities and exciting adventures. </p><p>  If you seek solitude, Namibia will exceed all expectations.  It is considered the second least populated country in the world!  However, there are very amazing places and attractions in Namibia.  They are <strong> </strong>  different from all those you've ever been to.  Below is information on what to see in Namibia.  Attractions with a description will help you get to know this African country. </p><h2>  Kolmanskop - ghost town </h2><p>  There is a city in the Namib desert.  Ten kilometers separates it from Luderitz and from the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>  In 1908, Zakaris Leval, a railway worker, found small diamonds in the sand.  This news spread very quickly around the district and one of the local residents, August Stauch, urgently bought land in which theoretically there could be deposits of these crystals.  The clever Stauh guess was correct, diamonds accumulated in its sections, delivered by winds from the hot Namib deserts and the ocean.  At a very fast pace, Stauch made himself a multi-million dollar fortune.  Everyone who wanted to get rich began to come to this area.  They were mostly African poor.  The population grew rapidly, the city grew rich rapidly.  After some time, the desert was built up with houses, schools, hospitals, stadiums, a casino, and even its own power station appeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This success did not go unnoticed, Namibia was captured by the <span>Union of South Africa.</span>  The new company, De Beers, began to engage in exclusive crystal mining.  However, diamonds ran out very quickly. </p>

    <p>  There were other negative factors that the Namibians faced: lack of water, sandstorms, strong winds.  After a few years, the city was completely empty.  Kolmanskop is still an abandoned city.  Some of the buildings are almost entirely covered with sand.  But, in recent decades, residents of nearby villages are engaged in restoration of buildings, maintain the museum city in good condition and conduct tours for tourists. </p><h2>  Swakopmund </h2><p>  Swakopmund is the fourth largest city in Namibia.  Landmark is a beach resort located in the oldest desert in the world!  Its sand and the beauty of the Atlantic Ocean - serves as a magnet that attracts tourists from different countries.  This is one of the few places in Namibia where you can find nice and cozy cafes for a good time. </p><p>  The city was designed by German architects.  Here you can try to surf not only on the waves of the ocean.  Descent on a board or skiing from sand dunes is very popular among extreme lovers, but be careful, sand can be your breakfast.  You can also fly on a hang glider, ride horses or ATVs.  For active travelers or lovers to make a good photo of the sights of Namibia, this is the place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sossussflay </h2><p>  Sossussflay is a large clay plateau in the desert.  When the wet period begins (February), the plateau is filled with water from the Tsohab River.  The spectacle is truly bewitching.  Also here is the "Dead Valley", in which you can see the dried trees, about 600-700 years old.  They do not break up, as the climate is very arid.  The rest of the vegetation is camel acacia.  It grows everywhere. </p>

    <p>  Sossussflay is famous for its very high sand dunes.  The largest is called ‚ÄúBig Dad‚Äù, it is about 380 meters high.  It is hard to imagine a more spectacular sunrise than what is happening in Sossussflay.  The formation of sand dunes is a continuous process.  Their shapes are constantly changing under the influence of wind.  Hiking in the sand dunes is like walking in a snowy field without snowshoes.  Of course, this is exciting, but be prepared for the fact that your muscles the next day will remind themselves of pain. </p><h2>  Tweelfelfontein (Damaraland) </h2><p>  This northwestern region of Namibia is remote from the ocean, so fewer tourists come here than to Etosha National Park.  But if you come to this African country, do not miss the opportunity to visit the Twiefelfontein Valley.  Here you will find one of the largest petroglyphs in all of Africa!  Drawing made by <span>red ocher.</span>  He is at least 6,000 years old and illustrates the lifestyle of a hunter-gatherer.  This is a great place for lovers of archeology and ancient artifacts. </p>

    <p>  Damaraland also offers one of the most unusual things you've ever done in your life - tracking the dangerous <span>black rhino</span> on foot!  You start a 4x4 jeep trip, as the guide will look for telltale signs of rhino activity.  Then you go out and silently, moving extremely carefully, follow him.  Be sure to make sure that you are not standing in the wind.  Although all rhinos are herbivores and have poor eyesight, they have a great sense of smell.  They will sniff everything and may perceive your smell as a potential threat. </p><p>  You can also visit the people of Himba.  It is a semi-nomadic tribe living in the northwestern Kunen region, also called Kaokolend in Namibia.  This region has a low population density - one person for every 2 square kilometers.  As a result of isolation and a secluded lifestyle, the tribe still adheres to its culture and traditional lifestyle.  Himba women have very amazing and incredible hair. </p><h2>  Kalahari Desert </h2><p>  The Kalahari Desert is a little misleading.  Although this place is quite arid, there are highly localized environments of flora and fauna.  One of the best examples is Succulentlent Karoo.  Here you can see more than 5,000 different species of plants, half of which are endemic to Namibia! </p>

    <h2>  Fish canyon </h2><p>  Fish River Canyon in Namibia <strong></strong>  - the largest in Africa and the second largest in the world.  It reaches 160 km in length, 27 km in width and up to 550 m in depth.  It is not surprising that this place is the second most popular attraction in Namibia.  You can spend the whole day walking around the edge or heading inside the canyon to experience real adventures. </p><p>  Tourists wishing to pass a fascinating test go hiking on the Fish River Canyon hiking trail.  This is one of the most popular routes throughout southern Africa.  The trail is about 90 km long, so the trip will take about 5 days. </p><p>  There are no amenities along this path; the canyon does not catch cellular communications, so you will be completely divorced from civilization.  There are only 2 emergency stations along the way.  In other words, this is a real test of strength. </p><p>  Get ready for long car rides.  Namibia is a huge country, so you have to travel long distances.  If you are driving, you should also know how to change the tire if necessary, since there is no place to wait for help and you will have to rely only on your own strengths. </p><p>  Reviews about Namibia, the sights of this country are quite diverse.  Immediately it is worth noting that the rest here does not meet the standards to which we are accustomed.  Namibia is a country for those who prefer active tourism rather than luxury hotels. </p>
