The application supports installation on any operating system, however, some users are used to talking with smartphones that support two SIM cards.  As a result, they began to look for ways to solve how to install more than one Vatsap account on one phone.  The messenger developers did not implement a similar function when creating it, however, there are ways to solve the problem. </p><h2>  How does Vatsap work on a phone with two SIM cards? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="topkin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to install two WhatsApps on the phone" class="if uuid-2925703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2925703.jpg"></div><p>  An ordinary smartphone that supports the use of two SIM cards allows you to install Vatsap using only one phone number.  The developers did not implement the ability of the program to support multiple accounts on one device at once.  As a result, if the user works with the standard version of the application, then he will have to choose exactly the number to which the largest number of calls comes. </p><p>  However, for many people using two SIM cards at the same time, such a flaw is a rather inconvenient option.  Despite the limitation, most of them are trying to figure out how to install two ‚ÄúVatsap‚Äù on one phone with two SIM cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Are two Vatsap accounts allowed on the same phone? </h2><p>  According to the official version of the messenger, such an option is not provided, but modern progress in the field of technology allows you to circumvent any obstacles to excellence.  Therefore, there will always be people who can circumvent all the rules. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whatsapp-for-free.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install two WhatsApps on one phone with two sims" class="if uuid-2925716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2925716.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to note that the installation methods of the application differ depending on the operating system installed on the smartphone.  As a result, the methodology for installing two ‚ÄúVatsaps‚Äù on one phone with two SIM cards on an iPhone and an ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù will be slightly different. </p><h2>  Installing two Vatsap accounts on one phone: Android </h2><p>  Modern users who do not agree with the current limitations of the application are trying to find all kinds of methods to find out if it is possible to install two ‚ÄúVatsaps‚Äù on the phone.  The current rule "one device - one account", as it turns out, can be circumvented.  The choice of the second method of installing the application depends on the operating system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lumpics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install two WhatsApps on one phone" class="if uuid-2925714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2925714.jpg"></div><p>  For devices based on Android, experts have developed additional utilities, which cannot be said about iOS.  Supporting software is free and available for download at official app stores. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to install two Vatsapa on one phone?  This is a very urgent problem for the modern world of technology.  You can download the Vatsap application for two numbers using the Android operating system using applications such as Parallel Space, GBWA and Disa.  As a rule, the installation of the second instance of the application is not safe, and the developers do not bear any responsibility for the safety of user data.  And this fact should be taken into account. </p><h2>  First installation method: Parallel Space </h2><p>  So, the first way to install the second WhatsApp application on your mobile device is to use Parallel Space.  The software is available for download on the Play Market and allows you to create copies of applications, which makes their use much more efficient and convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sinhogamer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install two WhatsApps on one phone with two SIM cards" class="if uuid-2925722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2925722.jpg"></div><p>  After downloading and installing the Parallel Space application, you will need to enter an additional phone number to get started.  If the same number is used, the application will not function normally.  The icon of the second instance of Vatsap will be significantly different from the original, but it is not an obstacle to the full disclosure of all the features of the application. </p><h2>  Second installation method: GBWA </h2><p>  Before you install two ‚ÄúVatsap‚Äù on the same phone, you need to download the GBWA application itself and update the ‚ÄúVatsap‚Äù.  This will create interoperability between applications. </p><p>  The application will work without any problems if the smartphone supports more than one SIM card.  Otherwise, you will have to change the phone, insert a second SIM card and re-pass the confirmation via SMS message.  Activation can be done using a voice call, which should be registered.  During the call, a special code will be dictated, which will need to be entered to confirm the actions taken. </p><h2>  Third Installation Method - Disa </h2><p>  Disa developers have noticeably tried to create a program through which you can create another Vatsap account.  Therefore, most users do not have problems with how to install two "Vatsap" on the same phone.  To install Disa, you also need to use the services of the Play Market, and after installation add a copy of Vatsap and pass an identity check using your mobile phone number. </p><h2>  Install a copy of WhatsApp on a single Apple device </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lumpics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install two WhatsApp on one phone with two SIM cards on iPhone" class="if uuid-2925723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58295/2925723.jpg"></div><p>  The Apple device is practically no different from ordinary smartphones.  To install a copy of WhatsApp on iPhone, you need to do the following: </p><ul><li>  download the TuTuHelper application from the official website of the program; </li><li>  allow uploading the certificate to the smartphone; </li><li>  in the settings in the control panel, select Winner Media Co., LTD and mark ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù; </li><li>  open the downloaded program and use the search to find "Vatsap"; </li><li>  After a while, the messenger will be installed again, after which it is necessary to reaffirm the user's trust. </li></ul><p>  Performing the above steps will install a copy of the WhatsApp application on your iPhone. </p><p>  If you thoroughly consider how to install two ‚ÄúVatsaps‚Äù on one phone, it is important to note that the user performs all the manipulations at his own risk.  The risk is also possible when using third-party software, since there is a possibility of downloading viruses that can harm the smartphone and its performance. </p>
