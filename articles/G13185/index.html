With their help, you can not only make calls, but also view pages on the World Wide Web, play games, listen to music and much more.  It is not surprising that the increased popularity of gadgets has led to the emergence and mass distribution of various malicious programs and adapted advertising inserts both in programs and on sites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove ads from the phone" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1111137.jpg" width="600"></div>  If when using computers they learned how to deal with this by installing special software (antiviruses, firewalls, firewalls), the situation in the world of small portable devices is much worse.  Alas, there is no panacea, so today we will consider only one of the ‚Äúfacets‚Äù - we‚Äôll tell you <span>how to remove ads</span> on your Android phone.

    <h2>  Varieties of advertising inserts </h2><p>  Depending on the implementation method, advertising inserts are divided into several groups.  The first includes pop-ups that appear when browsing the Internet.  Here you can also attribute various automatic <span>redirects (redirects</span> in the browser) to unwanted resources. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="an advertisement pops up on the phone how to remove" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1111138.jpg" width="300"></div>  The second group includes advertising modules built into the programs that cause the content to be displayed on the phone screen when there is access to the Web.  And finally, the third, most unpleasant group, is a spontaneous redirect to third-party sites in any installed browser.  It is easy to guess that the answer to the question of how to remove ads on an Android phone depends on the way it is displayed.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Negative impact </h2><p>  Despite the fact that some owners of mobile devices simply put up with the display of advertising by closing it, we still recommend combating it with more substantial methods.  If you leave everything as it is, then there is a risk of a virus program appearing on the smartphone, downloaded and installed in the <span>background.</span>  In addition, if you don‚Äôt figure out how to remove ads from the phone, the display module will constantly ‚Äúhang‚Äù in the system, occupying part of the RAM and processor time, which will negatively affect the speed of the device as a whole.  And finally, the background loading of advertising messages consumes traffic, which can be limited and paid separately. </p><h2>  Dummy Address </h2><p>  One of the ways that has long been successfully used on desktop systems is editing hosts.  This special file contains instructions on how to perform redirects for the entered website addresses to internal IP.  The structure is extremely simple: on the one hand, a list of names of network resources is presented, and on the other, Internet addresses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove ads on an android phone" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1111139.jpg" width="574"></div>  For those of them that need to restrict access, compliance 127.0.0.1 is prescribed.  When requested from the browser, the operating system first checks the <span>hosts file,</span> and if there is a match there, then there is no data exchange with the resource.  How to remove ads from the phone in this way?  For this, the easiest way is to use special programs.  One of them is Ad Away.  First you need to install the program and run it.  Next, turn on the Internet.  And finally, in the application menu, click "download file and enable lock".  If successful, a message will be displayed.  In the program menu, the user can activate the update, which consists in uploading new configuration files, in which the list of unwanted resources displaying ads is expanded.  An important nuance: making changes to hosts requires root rights.

How to remove it and what is the reason for the appearance of this advertisement?  Unfortunately, in the software part of some budget class gadgets, inside the operating system files there is malicious code that controls all requests to the Network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove ads on an android phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1111140.jpg" width="281"></div>  It either deliberately interferes with the system by Chinese manufacturers of cheap gadgets, or accidentally gets there.  Because of this, spontaneous redirects to pages with ads occur in any installed browser.  How to remove ads from the phone, if it manifests itself in the form of redirects?  This case can be considered the most "difficult", since a simple installation of a "rescue program" can not do.  First of all, you need to get root rights.  For example, using KingRoot.  Then install the Titanium backup application and through it ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù or remove all programs that are not needed to work.  This is a YouTube player, mail application, gallery, etc. All of them should be subsequently replaced by their original virus-free counterparts.  At the same time, this is not the only way to remove ads from the phone in case of redirects.  If the gadget‚Äôs developer site has an updated version of the firmware, then you can try downloading it to the device by following the accompanying instructions.

    <h2>  Page Inserts </h2><p>  Desktop users know that they can cut ads using the AdBlock browser extension.  There is a similar solution for Android.  After installing it, it is necessary in the program to put the switch in the ‚ÄúEnabled‚Äù position. </p><h2>  Code cleaning </h2><p>  And finally, if all this does not help, and the advertisement pops up on the phone - how to remove it in this case?  The solution is the Lucky Patcher app.  Using it, you can identify an ad module in almost any program and block it.  Root rights are required.  After starting, the user sees a list of installed programs, under the names of which indicate whether an unwanted "insert" has been detected.  If there is one, then you need to select the menu and proceed to the ‚ÄúDelete advertisement‚Äù item. </p>
