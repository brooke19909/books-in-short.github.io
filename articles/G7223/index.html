However, sometimes the choice is made in favor of more expensive flagship models, although subsequently most of their functionality is still not used. </p><p>  But do not forget that for some budget gadgets the functionality can be just as good, and the performance is enough for a hassle-free use, and they cope with all everyday tasks.  Such a model is the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Grand Duos GT-I9082, the characteristics of which are far from the flagship, but the device deserves attention. </p><h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  The smartphone is made in the corporate design of Samsung and has a physical Home button at the bottom of the screen.  In general, the appearance is attractive, but not entirely convenient for using the gadget with one hand.  The fact is that the back cover is glossy, and the phone can easily slip out of your hands.  In addition, it collects prints well and is easily scratched.  Therefore, immediately after buying a smartphone, you should think about purchasing a cover that covers the back cover, such as a bumper. </p><p>  In total, the smartphone Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos GT-I9082 is made in two color variations - white and blue.  Blue looks more attractive because it has a light metallic shade with brilliance, while white is no different from devices from other manufacturers.  Build quality is high, there are no backlashes and creaks, and the back cover is tightly closed. </p><p>  In addition to the large Home button, other controls are located on the smartphone in the usual Samsung style.  The power / unlock button is located on the right side, the volume rocker is on the left.  The top end is occupied only by the headphone jack, and the bottom received a USB-connector and a microphone hole.  The flash, camera and speaker are lined up at the top of the gadget.  The camera protrudes slightly, and there is a slight bulge on the speaker grill, which ensures high volume when the smartphone is on a table on the back cover. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  There are no complaints about the diagonal of the display - they are honest and have become the standard for modern budget employees 5 inches.  However, the picture quality was badly pumped, and there are two main reasons for this.  The first is a rather low resolution for such a diagonal, which is only 800 x 480 pixels.  This value is too low, and pixelation is clearly visible even without a detailed view of the image.  The second reason is the use of a simple TFT matrix.  If there were at least IPS, and low resolution could be forgiven, but with the low viewing angles inherent in this particular technology, the picture quality becomes completely sad.  Therefore, the display can be clearly attributed to the minuses of this unit. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs sensor is classic for budget models.  The reaction is fast and accurate, multitouch up to five touches is supported.  The display is protected by glass, but not tempered, so you should consider protecting it from scratches by means of a protective film or glass.  Using the Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos GT-I9082 sensor, whose characteristics are still pleasant, is quite convenient, and it does not cause any particular complaints. </p>

    <h2>  Main camera </h2><p>  The smartphone Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 Duos GT-I9082 has two cameras with pretty good specifications.  The main one got a resolution of 8 megapixels and high-quality optics, which allows you to take clear pictures without noise in clear weather and quite acceptable quality photos in artificial or low light.  In addition, there is the ability to shoot video in a resolution of 1920 x 1080 with a frequency of up to 30 frames per second.  LED flash does not really help when photographing, but it can serve as an excellent flashlight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Front-camera </h2><p>  The front camera received a resolution of 2 megapixels, which is quite enough for a pleasant conversation via video.  Selfies can also be taken, but only subject to the availability of good lighting, otherwise the photos are noisy and fuzzy.  But in general, with respect to cameras, the smartphone received pretty good performance for the state employee. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The smartphone has a battery with an average capacity indicator of 2100 mAh for a given price segment.  According to the manufacturer, this capacity should be enough for 10 hours of conversations on a 2G network.  And it is here that the presence of a display matrix that is undemanding to power makes itself felt and becomes a plus, increasing the operating time from a single charge.  As a result, the smartphone survives quite effortlessly during the day of active use with constantly on or mobile Internet, or Wi-Fi.  If you use it mainly for calls and short correspondence, then the battery will last for 2-3 days. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the battery of the Samsung GT-I9082 Galaxy Grand Duos is quite durable, and its capacity does not begin to drop significantly after the first 100 cycles, as is the case with other manufacturers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Hardware specifications </h2><p>  Often, Samsung and similar manufacturers cannot meet any MTK or a similar budget crystal.  So in this model the Broadcom BCM28155 chip is installed, which has 2 cores with frequencies of 1.2 GHz each.  Work with graphics provides a video accelerator VideoCore IV.  It can be seen that the Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos GT-I9082 specifications are far from flagship, and could have problems in work, if not for the low resolution display.  Thanks to him, the interface remains smooth, and using the smartphone is quite comfortable, although there are some slight hangs.  However, you can safely forget about heavy gaming applications with high requirements for the graphics subsystem - they simply will not start or will not work correctly. </p><p>  For the simultaneous operation of several applications, 1 GB of RAM is provided.  It is enough to use a couple of messengers and a browser without constantly closing every application.  To store user and system files, the device received 8 GB of non-volatile memory.  The system out of the box takes about 4 GB, the rest is available to the user.  Immediately it is worth noting that applications are not transferred to a memory card, so it‚Äôs best to leave this volume just for them, and to download music, videos, movies and other content, you need to install a MicroSD memory card with a capacity of up to 64 GB.  To connect the smartphone to the computer and reset the files, download the driver for the Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos GT-I9082, which can be found on the official website of the manufacturer. </p><p>  When buying a memory card with the maximum capacity for the device, it is best to immediately check for compatibility directly in the store, as it was noticed that some cards, despite the fact that they were correctly formatted, were not seen by the smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  Out of the box, the device comes with firmware based on Android 4.1.2.  Subsequently, if desired, it can be updated by air to version 4.2.2.  Unfortunately, on this version, the manufacturer‚Äôs support for the smartphone was discontinued, the appearance of custom firmware with a newer version of the system is also unlikely, at least they are not yet in the special theme Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos GT-I9082 w3bsit3-dns.com. </p><p>  The software is optimized well, thereby reducing battery consumption, and increasing the smoothness of the interface, this is often emphasized by users when they write reviews about the Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos GT-I9082.  As in other devices from Samsung, the smartphone received the brand name TouchWiz Nature UX.  However, along with this interface on the smartphone there are a large number of branded applications, which, however, may be useless for some.  Unfortunately, they are systemic and cannot be deleted without rooting the system. </p>

    <h2>  Positive aspects of a smartphone based on reviews </h2><p>  User reviews are mixed on most issues, so some controversial aspects can be disclosed both positively and negatively.  Among the points that most liked were: </p><ul><li>  Large display.  Yes, it is the size of the display, not the picture quality.  Due to this size, it is convenient to use a large number of applications, including navigators and e-readers. </li><li>  Nice design.  Samsung has always awarded its devices an attractive appearance, sometimes to the detriment of ergonomics.  This happened this time, and externally the smartphone is very catchy, especially in a dark color. </li><li>  A fairly high-quality main camera, which allows you to take acceptable pictures even in not-so-good lighting conditions, which fans will definitely like to photograph any remarkable trifle at any time.  This is one of the strongest advantages of the Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos GT-I9082, the description of the model on many sites confirms this. </li><li>  Good price / quality / performance ratio.  One of the few smartphones in its price segment, in which there is a good balance of reliability and cost. </li><li>  The presence of a proprietary interface that makes the operating system attractive and smooth. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the gadget copes with the main functionality of the smartphone without problems.  However, there are also disadvantages in it, which can be critical for some users. </p><h2>  Negative points according to reviews </h2><p>  Among the negative aspects highlighted in the reviews by users who have had a smartphone for some time, were the following: </p><ul><li>  The need to periodically reset the settings.  If you do not perform this operation, then garbage accumulates in the system, leading to a gradual decrease in performance and increased consumption of battery capacity. </li><li>  Poor display quality.  The small resolution for such a diagonal and the use of a TFT-matrix reduced the load on the battery and the GPU, but in return gave unpleasant moments in the form of strong pixelation, low viewing angles and insufficient margin of brightness, which makes using a smartphone in bright sunlight uncomfortable, if not practically impossible . </li><li>  A small amount of internal memory, as a result of which it is not always possible to install all the necessary applications. </li><li>  A large number of unnecessary applications cluttering the internal and RAM. </li></ul><p>  Before making a choice in favor of this smartphone, it is worth considering carefully whether you are ready to put up with these shortcomings. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The smartphone is a good budget model with good autonomy, which performs all the functions of a device for communication and allows you to take pictures of acceptable quality.  The display became the weakest point, however, this may not be a very serious problem if you use your smartphone mainly as a communication device.  Otherwise, the Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos GT-I9082 has pretty nice specifications, and you can use it comfortably without paying attention to the downsides. </p>
