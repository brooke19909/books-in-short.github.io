On long trips and evening walks, each member of the fair sex will certainly take her with her, since this particular part is part of the image and, most likely, plays not a practical, but a symbolic role.  A handbag should always match the image of its owner - fit either under the outfit or under her shoes.  Also, many psychologists claim that it is thanks to this accessory that you can identify the character of a lady, focusing on the color and shape of the product.  In this case, it can be stated with full confidence that if a woman uses patterns of bags and sews this accessory herself, then it becomes much easier to determine her temperament. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bag patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/53055.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Backpacks designed for walking with children or for long trips are the easiest to make.  <span>Patterns of bags of a</span> similar plan will be clear even to beginners in this matter, and the production process will not take much time and effort.  Most often, for such products, dense material is used, such as denim, raincoat fabric and so on.  It is also worth noting that the patterns of bags of this type consist of three parts - the bottom, the base and the folding top.  They are accompanied by cut elements that form the basis of the lining.  All seams of the bag are straight and clear, so even a novice dressmaker can sew such a product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Patterns of <span>women‚Äôs bags are</span> presented in large numbers in magazines, and sometimes home-made accessories look much more attractive and interesting than store goods.  This detail of the image can win due to a very unusual cut, but in this case it is important that the bag is sewn by a professional. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patterns of women's bags" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/53056.jpg" width="420"></div>  Uneven seams, tightened fabric and other possible defects on such a product will immediately catch your eye.

    <p>  If you use simple patterns of bags, you can experiment with fabrics, choosing the most expressive and attractive.  Such models are always decorated with accessories, brooches and stripes, which, incidentally, can also be made with your own hands. </p><p>  It is important to know that the patterns of women‚Äôs bags need to be done both for the base and for the lining.  If this stage is ignored and the lining material is not sewn into the product, then its seams will soon disperse, and the fabric located near them will be wiped off very soon.  In order for the bag to serve as much time as possible and at the same time not lose its quality features, it is advisable to choose a durable fabric that will not succumb to wear and at the same time retain its shape at all costs.  Do not forget to also strengthen the straps and the top of the product, which more than all other parts lend themselves to wear and rubbing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patterns of women's bags" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/53057.jpg" width="520"></div>
