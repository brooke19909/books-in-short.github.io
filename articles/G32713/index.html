Singapore: City Information</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Singapore is a dream city.  They say that it was built, adhering to all the rules and canons of the Chinese teachings of Feng Shui.  Therefore, it is not surprising that this place is flourishing, its inhabitants are successful people, there are beautiful houses and cars, corruption and crime are completely absent.  Singapore is located in the southeastern part of Asia, near the equator.  It is hot all year round, the rainy season falls in November-January, which are the coldest months.  It is very dry and warm here from May to July.  Singapore is a city-state of Asia.  This is both a country, a capital, and an island. </p><h2>  general information </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Singapore - the capital of which state?" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/538643.jpg" width="510"></div></h2><p>  When people ask: ‚ÄúSingapore is the capital of which state?‚Äù, I immediately want to give an answer that the best, bright and, most importantly, clean.  Nowhere in the world will you see such clean streets and neat houses.  Garden City - this is also called this place because of its lush vegetation.  The mild tropical climate contributes to its growth, and people carefully protect their nature and care for it. </p><p>  By the way, the population here is very colorful.  Most of it is Chinese.  But in the city you can also find Arabic, Indian and Malay quarters.  Everyone lives peacefully, religions and customs intertwine, but this does not cause conflict and aggression.  The initial language is Malay, and the official languages ‚Äã‚Äãalso include English, Tamil and Putonghua. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe state of the same name, whose capital is Singapore, is about 630 square kilometers.  Here is located the industrial zone, and business districts, and pristine <span>national parks.</span>  According to Malay legend, once a very long time ago, the Sumatran ruler met a lion on this island and decided to establish a settlement, the name of which translates as "city of a lion". </p><h2>  Singapore River </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Big Cities Of Singapore" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/538649.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  If you want to visit the best attractions, then the first thing to go to this waterway.  It stretches across the central and southern part of the island and flows into the ocean.  The river is known for its beauty and power.  The founder of the modern city, Stamford Ruffles, built a trading port here, the first in this country, and this structure was also famous for its reservoir. </p><p>  Singapore - the capital of which state?  The one where they respect the environment.  Even the river was attributed to the national heritage of the people.  Residents gladly show it to tourists, proudly walk along the promenades, which are called the main attraction of their hometown. </p><p>  There are historical monuments that tell visitors about the past of the country, about its national origins.  If you are hungry, you will be deliciously served by professional chefs in restaurants, which along the river are as plentiful as mushrooms after rain.  Sitting in a cozy place and tasting fish delicacies, you can admire the crystal clear river and evening lights of its insanely beautiful promenades. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fountain of Wealth </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital city of Singapore" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/538656.jpg" width="525"></div></h2><p>  It is located in the very center of the city.  Built in accordance with all the rules of Feng Shui, the fountain is a tourist attraction and part of "Santek City" - a large shopping center.  Back in 1998, it was registered in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest and largest fountain in the world. </p><p>  The capital of the state of Singapore has always surprised with the accuracy of the designs and the deep meaning that architects gave them.  The Fountain of Wealth is no exception.  He is a symbol of life and its spiritual wealth.  It is made in the shape of a bronze ring that embodies the unity, brotherhood and equality of all people on the planet.  It also symbolizes our universe, its harmony and eternity. </p><p>  Locals are sure that with the help of the fountain you can really get rich.  To do this, you need to perform a ritual.  It consists in the following: the design consists of two parts: large (external) and small (internal).  Most shut down several times a day.  At this time, you need to run to the small bowl of the fountain, lower your hand into the water and, constantly thinking about gold and money, go around three times.  It is then that you will certainly become rich and happy.  Here is such an unusual and slightly naive capital of the Republic of Singapore, whose inhabitants still believe in a fairy tale. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Singapore Zoo </h2>

    <p>  This menagerie is one of the best in the world.  Singapore - the capital of which country?  A state whose inhabitants take care of the flora and fauna and love their smaller brothers.  The menagerie, which is spread over 28 hectares, is home to about 3 thousand animals, amphibians, birds and fish.  At the same time, animals are not closed in cages; they live an ordinary wild life among the tropics.  Especially dangerous for people are surrounded not by gratings, but glass walls in order to protect visitors from predator attacks. </p><p>  The most popular and beloved inhabitants of the zoo are hulking hippos and long-legged giraffes, rare <span>white tigers</span> and shaggy lions, mysterious ostriches and graceful antelopes, dexterous primates and chirping birds.  All of them are located in special pens, in which the most natural and familiar habitat is created for them.  The menagerie trick is the night safari.  This is a tram lit by artificial moonlight that rides late visitors along the paths of the zoo. </p><h2>  "Underwater world" </h2>

    <p>  That is the name of the oceanarium, which tourists enjoy visiting.  Singapore - the city-state of Asia - boasts one of the largest and largest marine centers located in the East.  Here you can see almost 3 thousand representatives of the underwater world of various species, the number of which reaches the number 250. </p><p>  The design of the aquarium is very unusual.  Visitors stand on a special moving track and with its help overcome a long tunnel.  At the same time, sharks and stingrays, huge and small schools of fish of different sizes, swim above them, on the right and on the left.  But you can not only look at them, but even touch them with your hands.  To do this, in the center there is a special place - a compartment.  There is also a room equipped with the name ‚ÄúDolphin Lagoon‚Äù, where you will become a spectator of a production performance with the participation of these cute and very smart sea animals.  Under the supervision of a trainer, you can even swim with them and feed them fish treats. </p><h2>  Ferris wheel </h2>

    <p>  Singapore - the capital of which state?  One where they love everything great and the best.  Another such record holder was an attraction, which simply does not exist anymore in the world.  This is a Ferris wheel, the height of which is already 165 meters.  Moreover, the diameter of the circle reaches 150 meters. </p><p>  The dizzying miracle of technology was built in 2008.  A truly stunning view of the whole city opens up from the heights, you can also take a look at the nearest islands of this country, on which large cities of Singapore are located, as well as the outskirts of neighboring countries - Malaysia and Indonesia. </p><p>  Having dashed off and having fun, you will even more cheer yourself up with excellent shopping.  Shops and cafes are equipped in the premises of the terminal, in which the entire construction of the attraction is built.  The most interesting thing is that initially the wheel turned against the movement of the clock hands, but then it was changed, according to the rules of the same favorite Feng Shui by the Chinese. </p><h2>  Universal Studios and Merlion Park </h2><p>  These are two of the most favorite places for tourists.  Universal Studios is the largest amusement park.  You will not see anything like this in all of Southeast Asia.  This is where you can ride on the highest and longest double roller coaster on the planet with a breeze.  On the territory there is a zone called "Hollywood" - a small copy of his "big brother" in Los Angeles. </p>

    <p>  As you can see, Singapore is a very green city.  There are many plots of land in its pristine beauty, where nature demonstrates its wealth and generosity.

Here you can see 60 thousand varieties of orchids, about 2 thousand hybrids of this flower.  The park is divided into 4 parts, each of which is thematic and symbolizes a certain season.  In the spring zone grow orchids of golden hues, in the summer - pink and scarlet, in the winter - plants of cool light colors, in the autumn - all together.  Orchids can be sniffed, touched and photographed, but vomiting is strictly prohibited.  This flower is a symbol of the country and is protected by law. </p><p>  Gardens by the Bay - a complex of two greenhouses, which grow 220 thousand different representatives of the flora.  The highlight of this place is the gigantic trees that make up the whole designer forest.  This is a cluster of 18 giant sculptures that adorn the park and connect an invisible web of plants from different parts of the world.  Here he is - Singapore.  Information about the city and its <span>green areas is</span> not limited only to the above places.  All parks, greenhouses and gardens are simply impossible to list. </p><h2>  Singapore beaches </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Singapore: City-State of Asia" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/538812.jpg" width="551"></div></h2><p>  In the city-country there are many resort places where you can soak up the sand and plunge into the warm sea.
