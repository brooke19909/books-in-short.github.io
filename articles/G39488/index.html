As the name implies, this is "kopeck piece" located on Patong - the central resort of the island.  The hotel is not by the sea, it can be called urban.  This is a representative of the type of hotels that are called "bed and breakfast," that is, "bed and breakfast."  Most tourists choose it so that it is cheap and convenient to spend the night.  We can safely say that this is one of the best budget hotels in Patong, and we will prove it to you now.  The hotel is dearly loved not only by backpackers, but also financially secure people, all thanks to the excellent management and work of the owners.  The hotel is conceptual - its walls, lobby, rooms are painted with various English quotes and maxims, thematically related to the word "bed".  So the name of the Bedz Patong hotel is played out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beds patong" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1480710.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  The hotel is located in Patong Beach.  This resort is a typical city of modern Thailand with an entertainment industry, grown right on the beach.  Some people call it ‚ÄúPattaya in miniature‚Äù, because here you can find almost everything you go to Tai for.  Therefore, Patong is chosen by young people and tourists who prefer nightlife and excursions, rather than lazy hanging out on the beach.  The Beds Patong Hotel is the best suited for such guests.  Well, the sex industry in this city also does not remain from Pattaya - ‚Äúspecial‚Äù bars and clubs can be found at almost every step. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beds patong hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1480692.jpg" width="600"></div>

The most inexpensive guesthouses and hotels are located on and around Nanai Road.  In this area is Beds Patong 2 * (Phuket).  Budget hotels can be found right by the sea.  Of course, they are across the road from the beach, because there are simply no hotels in the area closer to the coast.  An example is Patong Beach Bed and Breakfast.  This hotel has similar rooms and almost the same services as the Beds Patong, except for a slightly larger area and included breakfast.  But the prices for this service are much higher, solely due to the location of the hotel.  Therefore, tourists who know how to count money prefer to settle a little further from the sea, but save. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beds Patong 2" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1480706.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Beds <span>Patong Phuket</span> is located 40 kilometers from the international airport, since Patong itself is located on the other side of the island.  Airplanes from different countries fly here, including from Russia and Ukraine (mainly charters).  From other cities in Thailand, you can get here on <span>Thai airlines,</span> including Air Asia.  To get to Patong from the airport, you have several options.  You can use taxi services - but this is a very expensive way to travel.  The most popular are minibuses, which for 150 baht will take you to any place in Patong.  And if you are completely limited in funds, then it is best for you to take a shuttle bus to the island's capital - Phuket Town, and from there transfer to another minibus.  It goes to Patong, but unlike the minibus it does not transport passengers to hotels, but has a fixed stop near the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Beds Patong" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1480713.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is it better to swim and relax on the beach? </h2><p>  In order to get to the beach from Beds Patong 2 * hotel (Phuket), you need to walk seven hundred meters down the street.  You will not get lost, because there are signs everywhere.  People come here, of course, to swim and sunbathe, but mostly to "hang out".  This is a very decent and equipped beach, which stretches for three kilometers.  It is wide, with fine white sand and a gentle entrance, located in a very beautiful bay.  It was once considered the best <span>beach in Phuket,</span> but now there are always a lot of people here, mostly young people.  Therefore, sunbeds are in several rows.  If you are looking for privacy, then you should go to Kathu or Karon.  Patong Beach offers many water activities such as ‚Äúbananas‚Äù and ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù.  Almost every hundred meters there are rental stations with boats and water skiing.  But after rains it‚Äôs difficult to swim here, because sea water mixes with clay streams flowing from the mountains.  There are many sun loungers, and the cost of renting them is about 100 baht per day.  You can order drinks and snacks in the beach bars right to the place where you are lying - the waiters will bring everything.  A lot of merchants walk along the beach, offering various goods - their prices are not high, and they are not as harassing as in Egypt.  Several diving centers work here, including those with Russian management. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beds patong 3 phuket patong" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1483306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where and how to travel around? </h2><p>  First of all, you need to start with Patong itself.  To see a transvestite show, you do not need to go to Pattaya - tickets can also be purchased for a local performance in Phuket.  And in some bars, the elements of this show are generally shown for free.  Another impressive sight is Thai boxing, since the stadium is located very close to Beds Patong Hotel 2 *.  If the crowds on the beach bother you, then at a distance of less than ten kilometers from Patong there are several more interesting options for sea holidays - Karon, Kamala and Tri-Tra beaches.  But the problem is that if you do not have a rented car or bike, a trip there is possible either on an expensive tuk-tuk (300-400 baht one way), or on a local bus with a transfer in Phuket town (and this can take a lot time).  Near Kamala Beach, there is the Fantasea Entertainment Center, where stunning Las Vegas-style shows take place in the evenings.  By the way, it is local performances that are considered the best in all of Thailand - they are very colorful, and hundreds of participants are involved in them. </p><h2>  What and where to buy? </h2><p>  When you dance enough at discos and go around all the nightclubs and other fun venues, you may come up with the thought: "But what to bring home for memory?"  Patong is the best place for shopping.  Everything is sold and bought here and on almost any street - the resort is replete with various shops where you only need to be able to bargain, and for this basic knowledge of English is useful.  The largest shopping centers of the resort city - Jungseilon, which is within walking distance from Beds Patong Hotel, and Patong Shopping Paradise, are very popular with tourists.  Stores do not offer you too cheap goods, but the choice there is truly huge and very interesting.  Here you can buy jeans, and skirts, and shirts, and some tourists manage to come to Patong with empty suitcases, and leave with full ones.  Thai herbal cosmetics are also valued.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãhere and good electronics.  But it is advised to buy it only if the merchant has an international license for the goods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patong beach bed and breakfast" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1483309.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beds Patong 2 *: reviews </h2><p>  Among the guests of this complex there are not so many Russians - mainly English-speaking tourists prefer it.  Management and hotel owners usually make a special impression on them - pleasant, nice, friendly and helpful people, always ready to help guests.  The rooms in the hotel are comfortable and clean, the location is good.  They are equipped much better than in other budget hotels of this category - this is noted by many travelers.  From the upper floors you can watch very beautiful sunsets.  Of course, this hotel is intended for those who do not sit still and prefer active recreation.  But here you can really feel not the advertising, but the authentic Thai hospitality.  By the level of services and amenities, this hotel is given two and a half stars, and sometimes it can be found on various tourist sites called Beds Patong 3 * Phuket (Patong). </p>
