  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vacuum cleaner robot. Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The robot vacuum cleaner is an automatic cleaning device with artificial intelligence.  It belongs to a certain class of technology.  Namely, to models of smart household appliances and home robots. </p><p>  The work of this technique can be carried out with one of two defined conditions.  Robot vacuum cleaners can clean according to a predefined schedule, as well as after a user‚Äôs command.  These household devices provide cleanliness in the room by independently moving along a given plane.  In the event that an obstacle is encountered in their path, robots must make a decision to overcome it.  This process is possible in connection with equipping a technical device with a special algorithm.  After garbage collection, most models are designed to independently return to a device designed to charge them. </p><p>  The start of production of <span>home robots</span> designed to maintain cleanliness in the premises was carried out in 2000.  The first models were a disk having a diameter ranging from twenty five to thirty five centimeters.  They were equipped with a contact sensor installed in the front section of the vacuum cleaner, as well as an <span>infrared</span> sensor <span>.</span>  Some of them were equipped with a Virtual Wall device. </p><p>  The first, as well as the second generation of the Robot Vacuum Cleaner model, reviews of which indicated the need for manual setting of room parameters, had three buttons of large, medium and small sizes on the case.  Subsequent developments of this type of home appliances eliminated the need for their use. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A robot vacuum cleaner, reviews of which demonstrate its practicality in connection with the use of installed internal batteries, must be recharged regularly.  A special module is used for this.  In modern models, the probability of finding a device for charging is provided.  For this, an intelligent vacuum cleaner communicates with the module using an infrared sensor.  A full charge of an intelligent home appliance takes an average of three hours.  The intelligent technology of previous generations was powered from the mains for half a day. </p><p>  A robot vacuum cleaner, reviews of which testify to its ability to remove trash under any furniture, has a small height.  It is about thirteen centimeters.  If the technical device does not have the possibility of further advancement in connection with a meeting with an unforeseen obstacle, then it stops and gives special sound signals that allow the user to determine his location and correct the malfunction that appeared during the cleaning process. </p><p>  A robot vacuum cleaner, the use of which indicates ease of use, is programmed with one of three existing cleaning production algorithms.  Indoors, the task of quick or regular cleaning is possible, and in a territory that occupies an area within two square meters - local. </p><p>  A modern robot vacuum cleaner, reviews of which speak of further improvement of models, contributes to the cleaning of the premises using preliminary planning of the task, that is, automatically.  It becomes possible to configure household appliances for the period of time when the user is absent. </p><p>  After the cleaning of the premises, the owner of the intelligent household appliances must empty its dust collector from accumulated debris. </p><p>  Some robot models use an infrared remote control.  With it, you can configure the technical device at a distance. </p>
