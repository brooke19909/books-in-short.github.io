This is a fairly convenient option to loan a small amount of money.  Almost all banks provide their loan products in this form, including the leading financial structure of Sberbank. </p><p>  However, sooner or later, there comes a time when there is a need to close the credit card and the account to which it is attached.  And if many customers are well aware of how to draw up such a payment instrument, then units represent how to properly complete their use.  Many customers do not know how to close a credit card of Sberbank and whether it is possible to do this ahead of schedule.  We will understand the intricacies of this procedure in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to close a Sberbank credit card" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1647686.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reasons to close a credit card </h2><p>  The reason for closing such a payment instrument may be the expiration of its validity period, various veiled payments and commission charges, due to which there is a regular decrease in the amount of funds in the account.  Also, it may not be convenient for a bank client to keep a credit card amount under control, because electronic money is a little more difficult to follow than cash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And the main reason for closing the card is its theft or loss, because in this case the offender can completely cancel the client‚Äôs money account at any time.  And here the question suddenly arises: how to close a credit card in Sberbank ahead of schedule?  And if in the case where the need for a formalized payment instrument simply ceased to exist, you can take your time, then when committing theft or loss of documents, you must act promptly with the wallet.  Otherwise, the owner of the credit card risks losing his money. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instructions for standard credit card closing </h2><p>  For this process, a step-by-step algorithm of operations is very important, because we are talking about money, and the slightest discrepancy with the rules entails very unpleasant consequences. </p><p>  Before closing a Sberbank <span>credit</span> card account, you need to fully repay the debt on it, if any.  To confirm the completion of this operation, it is necessary <span>to obtain an</span> account <span>statement</span> from the bank teller.  If you have your own amount in the account (since such payment instruments allow you to store not only borrowed funds on them), you can transfer it to another credit or debit card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to close a credit card of Sberbank" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1647688.jpg" width="600"></div>

Since in the process of closing unwanted debt may appear again, which will slow down the process. </p><p>  Then you need to contact the Sberbank branch personally, in which the card was issued.  The client must have a passport with him, a credit card that he wants to close, and a certificate of absence of debt on it.  Sometimes customers are interested in a hotline whether it is possible to close a credit card of Sberbank without a personal visit to the bank.  It is worth noting here that without the direct presence of the client, the bank will not be able to stop the account. </p><p>  When contacting an employee of a financial institution, the cardholder must fill out an application form for a request to close a credit account.  It should be noted that it is necessary to close the account, and not a credit card.  It is only a tool for using borrowed funds stored on it.  Together with the completed application, you should give the plastic itself.  The bank employee at the client must destroy the card. </p><p>  On this, all the necessary actions to close on the part of the already former credit card holder are completed. </p><p>  When the bank considers this application and closes the credit account, the client will receive a message on his mobile phone.  After that, you can visit the bank branch again to receive documentary evidence of the transaction.  This is a very important step, because this package of documents acts as a guarantor for the client.  The duration of all these activities can be up to 45 days. </p><h2>  Closing a credit card in case of loss or theft </h2><p>  After the discovery of the loss, it is necessary to immediately notify the bank employees by phone who will take all necessary measures.  Next, you need to visit a branch of Sberbank and write a statement about closing a credit account or reissuing a card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a credit card in a savings bank ahead of schedule" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1647687.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  When is a credit card considered closed? </h2><p>  Many people mistakenly think that having repaid the debt and liquidating the card on their own, it becomes closed.  But in fact, this is not true.  Then, <span>how to close a credit card of Sberbank,</span> so that subsequently there are no problems?  It is worth noting here that the money is not stored on plastic, but on the account to which it is attached.  Therefore, when a question arises how to close a credit card of Sberbank, you must go to the bank and write a statement about the request to close the account, not the card.  Only after the bank employees have entered all the necessary information into the register, the account will be closed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a sberbank credit card account" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1647685.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Possible difficulties in the process of closing a credit card </h2><p>  It is uncharacteristic for Sberbank of Russia to encounter any difficulties during the process of closing credit cards.  This bank is the leading financial institution in our country and carefully scrutinizes its reputation, observing all the rules, norms and rights of customers. </p><p>  However, nothing is perfect.  For example, a bank employee forgot and forgot to give the client the relevant documents.  In this case, even after a long period, the client has the full right to demand their issuance.  Since sometimes documentary evidence of the absence of any kind of debt is required to be provided to some organizations.  Employees always meet their customers, therefore, in this case, there can be no special reasons for excitement and anxiety.  In other matters regarding the question of how to close a credit card of Sberbank, difficulties should not arise. </p>
