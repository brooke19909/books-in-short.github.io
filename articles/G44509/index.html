This is not so difficult to do.  The main thing to remember is how to act under certain circumstances.  The Mir cards were developed in Russia as analogues of foreign bank cards.  And so far, they are mandatory only for certain categories of citizens.  Over time, it is planned to transfer all citizens of the Russian Federation to work with plastic called "Mir". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a world map in a savings bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1985388.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  How to get such a card?  This is not so difficult to do.  Especially if you follow some directions.  But about them later. </p><p>  The first step is to understand what the "World" cards are.  This is bank plastic, created as an analogue of <span>"Visa" and "MasterCard".</span>  Usually, this card means its debit variety. </p><p>  Sberbank‚Äôs ‚ÄúMir‚Äù payment cards (almost everyone can receive them) are allowed to pay utility bills, make purchases, receive benefits, pensions and other government payments.  This is actually a regular debit card. </p><h2>  Ways of registration </h2><p>  How to get a Mir card at Sberbank?  There are several scenarios. </p><p>  Namely: </p><ul><li>  personal clearance; </li><li>  order online. </li></ul><p>  How to act?  It all depends on the chosen solution to the problem.  Nevertheless, even a schoolboy can cope with this task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a world card at a sberbank pensioner" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1985389.jpg"></div>

Sberbank is the leader in the manufacture of the aforementioned bank plastic. </p><p>  But, as a rule, not everyone will be able to get it.  Only citizens of the Russian Federation can use this service.  The applicant must have temporary or permanent registration in Russia.  In addition, only persons who have reached at least 14 years old can apply to Sberbank for such a card.  Without a passport, it is not possible to realize an idea. </p><h2>  About service </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the Mir bank cards have terms of service.  They help to understand how plastic works. </p><p>  So, the mentioned ‚Äúdocument‚Äù only works with rubles.  It is issued for 3 years.  The first 12 months of maintenance will cost 750 rubles, the rest - 450. The ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù option from Sberbank is already automatically connected to bank plastic. </p><p>  If a citizen decides to connect the Mobile Bank, then he will also have to pay for his service.  The monthly payment is 60 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get the sberbank world map" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1985390.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Documents </h2><p>  How to get a Mir card at Sberbank?  The answer to this question will no longer cause any trouble.  After all, from now on, we understand how to act in a particular case. </p><p>  Documents required to obtain bank plastic are minimal.  Typically, a citizen is required only an identification card.  Namely - a passport.  In addition, they may additionally ask permission from parents (for minor recipients), as well as a certificate of registration. </p><h2>  Seniors </h2><p>  How to get a Mir card at Sberbank for a senior citizen?  The algorithm of actions in this case will be exactly the same as when making a plastic ordinary citizen.  The only difference is that under such circumstances more documents are needed. </p><p>  To receive the Mir-Social (Pension) card, they are additionally asked to bring a pension certificate.  I need the original and a copy of this paper. </p><p>  Such plastic, in comparison with the standard Mir card, has a number of advantages.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  free service; </li><li>  accrual of 3.5% per annum on the balance of funds; </li><li>  SMS requests to check the balance. </li></ul><p>  Another advantage is that everyone can get a similar card.  But, as a rule, <span>"Pension" cards</span> are issued without problems only to pensioners.  It doesn‚Äôt matter in which bank a person receives a pension. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a world bank card in a savings bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1985393.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Let's start with the benefits.  These include: </p><ul><li>  support in Crimea; </li><li>  high level of protection; </li><li>  alternative to other payment systems. </li></ul><p>  But judging by the reviews, plastic also has many shortcomings.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  lack of support for working with foreign online stores; </li><li>  defects of the functional type; </li><li>  high cost of service; </li><li>  lack of use outside the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  In addition, Mir cards are not accepted everywhere.  And this is considered the main disadvantage of plastic. </p>
