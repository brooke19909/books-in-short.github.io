And what this word means, few guess.  How are emperors different from kings?  What are their powers?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  The first emperors in Rome </h2><p>  For the first time in Rome, the meaning of the word "emperor" was defined.  So called the commander in chief of the Roman army.  Everyone knew about who the emperor was, from recruits to the leaders of large army units.  It was this man who had the unlimited right to decide what the actions of the great army would be. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the emperor" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1277776.jpg" width="600"></div>  The very definition of the word emperor comes from the Latin "imperium", which means "supreme power."

    <h2>  First emperor </h2><p>  The first to find out what the emperor was were the subordinates of the Roman commander Scipio Africanus.  During the <span>Second Punic War,</span> it became a custom to give such a title after the first great victory over the enemy.  At first, only the Senate could really indicate who the emperor was and appoint a bearer of this title.  But later, even ordinary warriors could proclaim their commander such a big name.  In addition, the title of "emperor" of the Roman commanders could be awarded several times.  Then the word form Imperator II was used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Scipio Africanus</span> proudly bore this honorary title, as he was honored during official public events and during Senate speeches.  In addition, Scipio, as a conqueror of Carthage, could write <span>this title</span> for life next to his name. </p><h2>  Emperors Caesar and Octavian </h2><p>  For some time, the tradition of calling emperors generals remained.  After a series of victories, this title could be given to several military leaders at the same time.  Gradually, the concept of what the emperor means changed.  Now this term was used in the meaning of "endowed with supreme power", including military. </p><p>  Julius Caesar was a permanent holder of the Imperator title and always wrote it after his name, along with other official ranks.  But his successor, <span>Octavian Augustus,</span> changed the use of this title.  Now, so that everyone knows what the emperor is, Augustus has commanded to write the title in front of his name.  His portraits and statues are signed only as the Imperator Caesar Divi Julii filius.  Now the honorary title of military leader and commander has become one of the titles of supreme rulers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word emperor" class="if" height="497" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1277782.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The title of emperor in the Eastern Roman Empire </h2><p>  The inhabitants of Byzantium have long known what an emperor is.  But after the <span>division of the Roman Empire</span> , the inhabitants of the eastern part took root another word.  The familiar word "emperor" was translated from them as "autocrat", which means "having power."  Here, as in Rome, autocrats were called rulers and rulers.  Later, this honorary title passed to all the rulers of Byzantium.  In its unchanged form, autocrat survived one and a half millennia.  In modern language, this is the name of a person endowed with unlimited powers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  When the title of Emperor disappeared </h2><p>  It would seem that such a magnificent title is destined for a long life.  In the Roman Empire, each new ruler added a new shade to this title.  Trajan, for example, had his own understanding of what an emperor was.  He claimed that only the military could award him the title Imperator, but for civilians he was the first, that is, Princeps. </p><p>  From the second century AD, the title was finally established in the register of ranks of the supreme ruler and was in use until 476.  And during the period of the Diocletian Empire and some time after it, there were two emperors in the Roman Empire: one of them was called Caesar, and the second was August.  After the destruction of the capital of the Roman Empire, everyone forgot what the emperor was for several centuries. </p><h2>  Emperor of the Middle Ages </h2><p>  The revival of the title of emperor took place at the beginning of the 9th century AD.  It was the heyday of the empire of the Franks, so it is not surprising that the Roman title fell at the time of the most significant person in Europe at that time, Charles the Great.  This title was granted to him by the representative of God on earth - Pope Leo III.  Therefore, the adjective ‚Äúsacred‚Äù was added to the name ‚ÄúRoman Empire‚Äù.  So it was shown that the new state of the <span>Holy Roman Empire</span> exists by the will and command of God.  The pope was considered the viceroy of God on earth in spiritual matters, but the emperor resolved secular issues with God's blessing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is the emperor" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1277791.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By this, the representatives of the Western Church seriously outraged the rulers of Byzantium, because after the fall of Rome, only they had the right to bear this title.  But Charlemagne knew perfectly well what the emperor was.  The definition of this concept suited the harsh warrior and the wise politician as well as possible. </p><p>  After Charles the Great, Otto took the emperor‚Äôs crown.  After him, the title was given to the noble masters of the small German kingdoms.  A tradition has been established to take the title of emperor of the Holy Roman Empire only from the hands of the Catholic ruler.  The popes manipulated this right with might and main, forcing the monarchs of small German states to dispute the honorary title among themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is emperor definition" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281260.jpg" width="220"></div>  For the ghostly honor to be called the emperor of a country that had not been on the map for a long time, people fought and died, the borders of states were erased, cities were destroyed.  But after the emergence of new powerful states on the map of Europe, the title of emperor of the Holy Roman Empire finally lost its meaning and quietly died away at the beginning of the 19th century

    <h2>  Emperors of the Russian state </h2><p>  In the 18th century, what is an emperor, was remembered in the Russian state.  This title was taken by Russian tsars in 1721.  The corresponding decree was proclaimed by the Senate and the Synod in honor of the <span>Nishtadt peace.</span>  The decree of Tsar Peter I was asked to accept a new title and henceforth be called "Emperor the Great and Father of the Fatherland."  The document was agreed and adopted immediately by two of the most important governing bodies of Russia: the Senate considered secular affairs, and the Synod dealt with the spiritual side of being.  Thus, it was emphasized that the emperor‚Äôs power was both secular and spiritual. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what does the emperor mean" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1277800.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  Gradually, the new title was taken by all the famous royal houses of Europe.  The first to honor Russian sovereigns were in Prussia, the Netherlands and Sweden.  The title of emperor accompanied every Russian monarch until their death.  The last holders of the Russian imperial title were shot in 1918. </p><h2>  French emperors </h2><p>  Until the beginning of the 18th century, kings ruled in France.  But for Napoleon I, this title was unacceptable.  A revolution has just passed away in his native France, in which all members of the royal family ended their life on the block.  Therefore, the king was called a warrior and the ruler of the country was not with his hands.  Here the emperor‚Äôs title came in handy: this is how the connection between the <span>empire of Charlemagne</span> and the state of Napoleon was emphasized.  On May 18, 1804, Napoleon was duly granted this magnificent title. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="definition of word emperor" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1277808.jpg" width="252"></div>  After his defeat and deposition, the title of emperor was taken from the former sovereign of France.  Later it briefly passed to Napoleon III, but due to a number of political failures, this ruler was not long emperor.  After the formation of the presidential republic, the title finally went out of use.

    <h2>  Emperor in Austria-Hungary </h2><p>  In 1804, another empire was born on the map of Europe.  Franz wished to free Italy from French rule and subjugate the entire southeast to the royal house of the Habsburgs.  Franz of Austria later assumed the title of ‚Äúapostolic‚Äù emperor and created another empire - Austria-Hungary. </p><h2>  British empire </h2><p>  Along with continental European empires, others existed for some time.  For example, England began to call itself the British Empire in 1583, when the colonization of North America was completed.  Even after the loss of the American colonies, England did not lose its influence and continued to rule politics around the world.  In 1876, Britain annexed Indian possessions, so Queen Victoria received the title of Empress of India.  The power of the English Empire spread throughout the world - it was not for nothing that they said that the sun never sets on the British Empire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word emperor and its definition" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1277828.jpg" width="414"></div>

    <p>  There were empires in other parts of the world.  For example, who the emperor was was well known in Mexico.  There, Maximilian I ruled for some time. There were emperors in Haiti, in Brazil and some other countries. </p><p>  The First World War destroyed all the foundations of the existing world order.  Imperial politics came to an end, and the emperors too.  The world has changed, emperors are a thing of the past, and you can learn about them only from articles, books or films on historical topics. </p>
