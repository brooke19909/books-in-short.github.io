Interested in rafting and other water sports?  Then you should go to the <span>Leningrad region</span> in the village of Losevo.  This is exactly the place where extreme lovers will feel great, as well as those who prefer a quiet pastime in the lap of nature.  Here you will not only have fun navigating the expanses of water, but also find a large number of friends and like-minded people. </p><h2>  The history of the village of Losevo </h2><p>  The history of Losevo dates back to 1948.  Until this time, this village was subordinate to Finland and had a different name - Kiviniemi, which means "stone cape" in Russian.  However, after this settlement moved to the Leningrad Region in 1945, they decided to rename it Losevo. </p><p>  Currently, the village of Losevo, Leningrad Region consists of 10-12 streets, and the population is about 2000 people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Losevo in winter" class="if uuid-3079075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3079075.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  You should not look for sights in the village of Losevo, Leningrad Region, the entire settlement itself is a real attraction that fascinates with its miraculous beauty.  These places simply attract with their virgin purity and enchant with landscapes.  Despite the fact that the village is small and sparsely populated, close to it you can find a large number of children's camps, health centers and recreation centers.  But one of the most favorite places for tourists is still considered the Losevsky threshold.  It was formed as a result of technical work between the Vuoksa River and Sukhodolsky Lake.  Previously, it was planned to organize a wide passage to Lake Ladoga at this place, but this could not be done.  The passage turned out to be small, as a result of which the vessels could not cross it.  After some time, the formed Losevsky threshold was used for extreme water sports: rafting, kayaking, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you plan to spend at least 2-3 days in Losevo, Leningrad Region, then you need to stay at the Losevo recreation center.  And if you wish, you can pitch a tent on the picturesque bank of the Vuoksa River. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Losevo Village" class="if uuid-3079068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3079068.jpg"></div><h2>  Things to do in Losevo </h2><p>  Here you can not only relax away from the busy city, but also have fun.  For example, in the village of Losevo, entertainment such as: </p><ul><li>  Kayaking. </li><li>  Rafting. </li><li>  Water slalom. </li><li>  Alloy on rubber broads. </li></ul><p>  In addition, during the influx of tourists (from April to October), various festivals and bard concerts are held in Losevo.  One of the most important festivals is Vuoksa, which attracts a large number of fans.  At this festival, desperate water sports enthusiasts compete in river swims. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vuoksa River" class="if uuid-3079070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/3079070.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel Guide </h2><p>  <span>This wonderful and picturesque place</span> is located on the border of Finland and Russia.  There are two ways to get to the village of Losevo, Leningrad Region: by car or by train.  Those who chose the first option should get to St. Petersburg in any convenient way (by bus, train, plane).  Then, moving towards the north, keep on Priozersky highway, which one way or another will lead you straight to the village.  The road from St. Petersburg to Losevo is no more than 80 km.  For those who like to go the beaten path, the second option is suitable - an electric train.  Similar commuter trains depart from St. Petersburg daily. </p><p>  The village of Losevo is ideal for recreation for all those who are not looking for easy ways, who prefer a campground and cooked food at the stake, who can spend several days away from civilization and familiar comfort.  It is a mistake to believe that such a rest is the lot of those who cannot afford a trip to expensive resorts.  After all, Losevo is a place where fresh air, crystal clear water and entertainment, from which it is simply breathtaking, are perfectly combined.  Believe me, not every resort can boast of this. </p>
