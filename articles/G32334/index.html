    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The museum of calligraphy in Sokolniki conducts active educational work.  Feedback from visitors tells about the unusualness of the exhibits and their own surprise at the possibilities of this art.  Many appreciated the beauty of strokes, the skillful writing of individual characters and entire books.  Those who managed to see handwritten lists of the Koran, Torah, Japanese engravings, report that they did not even suspect how thin the work could be.  A lot of positive reviews were expressed about the master classes of the museum, where employees introduce children not only to the writing technique, but also to materials, tools, and history. </p><p>  Negative reviews were expressed about the location of the museum, which is located far from popular routes and about the room itself, which is an ordinary pavilion in which few people can suspect the existence of the exhibition.  Some visitors were dissatisfied with the staff of the museum, which did not allow viewing the exposition in a company with compact vehicles. </p>
