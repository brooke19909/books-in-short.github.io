Dominican Republic in all its glory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The famous resort of Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) is a typical paradise.  It is here that the <span>turquoise sea,</span> long sandbanks, palm trees that bend to the water, and, of course, warm and sunny weather almost all year round.  This place is ideal for any type of vacation - both for a honeymoon, for family vacations with children or for a noisy friendly company.  First-class resorts, pearl white sand and everything that the soul can wish for, contains Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. </p><h2>  Flight to Central America </h2><p>  Dominican Republic is located on the islands of the Antilles archipelago in the <span>Caribbean.</span>  You can fly there both from Moscow and from St. Petersburg by direct flight, but only if you purchase a ticket through a travel agency.  Buying just tickets Moscow - Punta Cana will be much more difficult, or rather, impossible.  Independent travelers will have to get there with a transfer in one of the cities of Europe.  It is also possible to get to the USA, and from there already follow the flight New York - Dominican Republic, Punta Cana.  The map of this area tells us that you will have to fly from the states very briefly - no more than 3 hours.  Arriving already at the final destination, it is most convenient to get to the city by taxi.  For this trip you will pay an amount within $ 20. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Punta Cana Dominican Republic" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/480076.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the winter months, the influx of tourists is especially large, because tours are not cheap.  During this period, Dominican thermometers usually do not show more than 30, which is quite enough for sunbathing and swimming.  Since April, it gets much hotter here, the air warms up to 35-38 degrees, the sea also gets warmer.  The number of travelers during this period is significantly reduced, due to which there is an opportunity to relax here very cheaply.  But in the fall, such a place as Punta Cana, the Dominican Republic as a whole and all the resorts adjacent to them boast very high waves.  From September to November there is a storm season, because windsurfers flock here like flies to honey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Punta Cana map" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/480075.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fauna of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  One of the countries in which a whole host of the most interesting and diverse animals and reptiles lives, is the Dominican Republic.  Punta Cana (you can see the photo in the article) boasts to tourists its unique zoos and reserves, in which such inhabitants are found.  The most famous resort park is Manati.  Mostly tropical birds, reptiles and ... dancing horses are represented here.  Also, guests of the country love to book such a program as swims with dolphins.  This event is open to both adults and children.  Another famous park is Ice Ecological, where over five hundred different species of tropical and equatorial animals live. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Punta Cana Photo" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/480077.jpg" width="514"></div>

The Dominican Republic is the very place where there is an incredible variety of different marine inhabitants who simply amaze with their beauty and uniqueness.  It is on such excursions that you can get to know them better and even touch some of them.  Diving into the underwater world of the Dominican Islands, you can see whales, electric stingrays, <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãfoxes,</span> amazing bright and colorful fish of various breeds and even whale sharks.  Do not be afraid, they are not dangerous, especially since diving here is done only with instructors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="punta cana tours" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/480074.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Field trips </h2><p>  The animal and plant world, as mentioned above, are the main attractions of such a city as Punta Cana.  The excursions that are held here are aimed specifically at ensuring that every guest of the country is able to explore all these natural beauties and enjoy them in full.  Therefore, jeep safari is considered to be very popular here, which is always carried out in places remote from cities.  During this trip you can meet such unique animals as nosuha (or scientifically coati), some animals (something between a cat and a raccoon), various wild cats, panthers, mongooses, possums, mites, and many others.  But who really should be feared in the Dominican Republic is the poisonous centapi, or centipedes.  They can be either very small or giant, but in any case their bite is poisonous, and for young children it can be very dangerous. </p><h2>  If in Punta Cana is too noisy </h2><p>  It happens that you go to such a famous resort as Punta Cana, in the midst of the season, and from other tourists there is simply no passage.  In such cases, field trips to neighboring islands are suitable for you.  By boat or <span>jet ski</span> you can go to the island of Saona or St. Catalina, visit the uninhabited small islands that are adjacent to the state, or just go out of town and, driving along the coast of the Caribbean Sea, find a secluded bay.  In this area, such miracles of nature are full, therefore, everyone can find something suitable for himself. </p>
