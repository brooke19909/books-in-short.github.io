    <p>  The Meisu brand was not represented in this segment until recently, and its products could be seen in the premium or mid-price category.  The manufacturer decided to correct this state of affairs and launched a budget device - the Meizu M5c 16Gb M710H smartphone on the domestic market.  Reviews about the model are mostly positive, and user ratings do not fall below 4.5 points out of 5. Therefore, you should pay attention to the device, if only because of the same price: the cost of a smartphone does not rise above 9 thousand rubles (an average of 8 thousand) per retail distribution sites. </p><p>  So, we present the review of the <span>smartphone Meizu</span> M5c 16Gb M710H.  User reviews, expert opinions, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the gadget will be considered in our article. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device is available in a small box of cardboard.  The packaging was designed in a specific manner of the brand: everything is completely white without any attractive girls or equipment - only the name of the gadget, and on the back there is a dry specification in small print. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Due to a well-arranged interior, the components do not ‚Äúswear‚Äù and neatly take their own place.  It's nice to look at the packaging, and it is clear that the manufacturer did not save on it, although it made it miniature. </p><p>  The following components are included in the scope of delivery: </p><ul><li>  smartphone itself; </li><li>  network adapter (1.5A / 5V); </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  hook for removing SIM and SD cards; </li><li>  documentation; </li><li>  warranty obligations. </li></ul><p>  Options poor, but it‚Äôs for the better.  Any additional accessory increases the cost of the device, but we are still dealing with a budget device, so covers, films, headphones and other surroundings will have to be purchased separately. </p><p>  Users in their reviews of the Meizu M5c smartphone especially warmly noted the USB cable for recharging and synchronizing with a PC.  It has a rather thick section, so you can use it not only to charge the device, but also for flashing any gadgets. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The device looks noticeably attractive to its competitors.  "Meizu M5s" is just the case when the company did not touch the premium design, but changed only the set of materials used.  In our case, rather high-quality plastic is used instead of metal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The appearance of the gadget is simple and concise: a one-piece candy bar with rounded side faces and a flat cover.  In the black matte color, the model looks especially pretty, and simply calling the budget does not turn it into a budget.  Judging by the reviews on the Meizu M5c M710H smartphone, users are satisfied with the design of the device.  The gadget has enough colors, so everyone can choose an option to their liking. </p><h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the device has a five-inch screen, it cannot be called large.  The available dimensions (144 x 71 x 8 mm) allow you to comfortably place your smartphone in any pocket or small handbag. </p><p>  The ergonomics of the device also did not disappoint: the gadget fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and does not try to slip out of your hands due to the convenient matte finish.  Spraying the case, although high-quality, but users in their reviews about the Meizu M5c smartphone still complain about fingerprints and dust.  Of course, to the gloss, which like a vacuum cleaner collects everything and everything is far away, but you will have to wipe the device quite often, especially if you choose dark tones. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  From its more noble counterparts, the model is distinguished by the absence of some key controls.  Here, alas, you will not see a fingerprint sensor, a duplicate microphone for the noise reduction system and other "chips" from the premium class.  But the whole standard set is present. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  At the bottom you can see the mirror slots for the speakers, and between them there is a universal USB port.  There are no complaints to the latter: it connects all the peripherals, which, in principle, should work with smartphones.  But the grilles turned out to be not quite practical.  Users in their reviews of the Meizu M5c smartphone have repeatedly complained that dust and dirt are clogging in the holes.  At the same time, you can get it out of there only with the help of a needle or small tweezers.  Therefore, a "pocket" life for a gadget is not the best option, because the grates will be clogged with small debris. </p><h2>  Interface Features </h2><p>  On the upper edge is a standard 3.5 mm mini-jack audio jack.  At the side there is a hybrid interface for working with cards.  Their hot swap is not provided, so you have to reboot the device. </p><p>  The volume rocker and the power key are located on the right side.  The buttons move clearly, and they themselves are large and stiff, so they are no problem to the touch.  Judging by the reviews on the Meizu M5c smartphone, users did not notice accidental clicks, even in the back pockets of pants and other tight clothing. </p><p>  Above, on the front side, you can see the usual speaker grill, sensors and the front camera eye.  The latter, of course, does not have a flash, and in its place is an LED event indicator. </p><p>  Under the screen there is an oval-shaped hardware key familiar to Meizu without a fingerprint sensor.  It has a touch pad, so gestures and other functionality are available to the user, which is usually the case with other phones with three buttons ("Home", "Back", "Menu").  Reviews about the Meizu M5c 2GB smartphone on this subject are mixed.  Those who previously used Meizu gadgets calmly perceive such a ‚Äújoystick‚Äù, and newcomers are experiencing serious problems with adaptation. </p><p>  On the back there is a peephole of the main camera, and just below the dual-flash LEDs.  You can see the brand logo just below, and the rest of the back cover is empty. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The device received an ordinary IPS-matrix with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels and a pixel density of 293 ppi.  On a five-inch screen, you can see the pixelation, but if you only specifically look closely. </p>

    <p>  The picture on the output is normal, without critical flaws.  Viewing angles have a maximum degree for the IPS matrix, so there will be no problems with viewing content in the company of one or two friends.  The data on the screen is more or less readable in the sun, thanks to the anti-reflective coating, but you can‚Äôt talk about comfortable work. </p><p>  Users in their reviews of the Meizu M5c 2 GB smartphone note the uneven distribution of the black field on the screen, as well as mediocre dynamic backlighting, which also cannot be turned off.  In all the rest - a normal screen of medium quality. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Smartphone chipsets are based on the proven Mediatek MT6737 series with four cores.  The graphic part fell on the shoulders of the Mali-T-720 accelerator. </p>

    <p>  2 GB of RAM is more than enough for trouble-free operation of the interface, as well as the volume of the internal drive of 16 GB.  It is possible to expand the last parameter to 128 GB using third-party SD-cards. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews on the <span>Meizu M5c</span> smartphone <span>(16 GB), 2 GB</span> RAM is not enough for modern and "heavy" toys, so the graphic part has to be reset to medium or even minimal settings. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The gadget received a non-removable 3000 mAh battery.  For such a set of chipsets, such a capacity is clearly not enough, considering also the voracious Android platform. </p><p>  In the combined mode (calls, the Internet, messages, games and videos) the device will last all day, but by the evening it will need recharging.  If you properly load the device with toys and video in high resolution, then the battery lasts for three hours. </p>

    <p>  Using the gadget as a regular ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, you can extend the battery life to two, or even three days.  But then the purchase of this smartphone will not bear any practical benefits.  If you look at the reviews on the Meizu M5c 16 GB smartphone, users are quite flattering about the device‚Äôs autonomy.  A good half of budget devices are even equipped with 1800, 1600 or even 1300 mAh batteries, so you don‚Äôt have to complain much. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  If you look at a bunch of other competing smartphones, then our respondent looks very good against their background.  The gadget received a good IPS-matrix, showing a decent picture, a good set of chipsets, as well as an attractive appearance and good autonomy. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the device is budgetary, so here you need to understand that it is not equipped with a large number of additional functions.  The model is positioned by the brand as a standard ‚Äúworkhorse".  For demanding consumers, there are always prestigious models of the company in the premium segment.  If you look at the reviews on the Meizu M5c smartphone 2GB / 16GB, we will see that users very warmly accepted the gadget without any critical comments. </p>
