  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why you should buy a ceramic electric kettle</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In order to boil water, we use a kettle.  Due to its characteristics, the most popular among these products is a ceramic electric kettle.  At the same time, you can find both models with a very affordable price (for example, POLARIS PWK 1391CC), as well as more expensive ones that not everyone can afford (for example, Vitek VT-1161).  The price at which you purchase a ceramic electric kettle depends on the following: </p><ul><li>  Product displacement (the amount of water that it can boil at a time). </li><li>  The time for which the maximum volume of liquid boils is its power. </li><li>  Manufacturing company. </li><li>  Year of release (new or not). </li></ul><p>  Electric kettle power </p><p>  In fact, the <span>power of an electric kettle</span> is exactly what affects the rate of boiling of a liquid in it, but this does not mean that the larger it is, the better.  In modern products, this figure is in the range of 1000-3000 watts.  So, before you purchase a ceramic electric kettle of maximum power, you should find out if your wiring can withstand it.  If you did the repair for a long time, then the answer will be unequivocal - no. </p><p>  Many reassure themselves that the water in a powerful kettle boils very quickly, in almost a couple of minutes (for example, Tefal KO 7001 Classic).  But this time is enough for the wires to be closed.  Well, if at the same time there will be adults in the house, and if only children?  Therefore, choosing a ceramic electric kettle, it is worth considering not only how much time it heats the water, but also about its own safety.  It is not in vain that all large manufacturers produce products of various capacities.  The most interesting thing is that Tefal KO 7001 Classic is also considered the most reliable ceramic electric kettle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why should the electric kettle be ceramic? </p><p>  Now electric kettles are produced from the following materials: </p><ul><li>  plastic; </li><li>  ceramics; </li><li>  glass; </li><li>  metal. </li></ul><p>  Why not choose a product made not of ceramic?  In fact, to make a high-quality and relatively inexpensive electric kettle, ceramics are best suited.  This product has the following positive qualities: </p><ul><li>  Ceramics are chemically inert, therefore, impurities cannot get into the water during its boiling.  Thanks to this, your tea or coffee will have only its true taste and aroma. </li><li>  The inner wall has a perfectly flat surface, which reduces the formation of scale on it. </li><li>  High durability is also due to the use of ceramics in the manufacture of the product. </li><li>  The form of the product - it can be either classic, or in the form of various fairy-tale characters, cartoon characters.  That is, no matter what style your kitchen is designed in, you choose a ceramic teapot that will fully fit into the interior. </li></ul><p>  But, like any thing, a <span>ceramic electric kettle</span> has its drawbacks.  In particular, it is its fragility.  But after all, if you drop a plastic, glass or metal kettle, you can also damage them.  So this criterion is more likely to be comparative rather than decisive.  The cost of a ceramic teapot is quite reasonable and is not overpriced.  Of course, you can buy an electric kettle made of plastic much cheaper, but will the water, after it boils in it, be completely harmless?  It will be if you purchase a technological model of a well-known manufacturer, but they, as a rule, are more expensive than ceramic electric kettles. </p><p>  We are used to the fact that our morning begins with a cup of tea or coffee.  In order not to be disappointed in the aroma and taste of the drink, buy a high-quality teapot (ceramic) for boiling water.  In addition, it can be a wonderful addition to the interior of your kitchen.  Indeed, at the moment, there are many different forms of this product, colors, drawings applied to it.  Therefore, you can buy not just an electric kettle, but an ornament for your interior. </p>
