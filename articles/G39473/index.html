Therefore, it is definitely worth creating a cake. </p><p>  First, a blank is made for the tiers of the future product.  Three circles are cut out, since it is planned to make a <span>three-tiered cake.</span>  Imagine that you need to glue a box of round shape.  Additional centimeters should be left for “seam allowances” at the edges of each.  Make the sides, fasten them with a stapler along a vertical wall and attach to the circle, which will serve as the bottom.  It is recommended that all seams be glued with any glue that is strong and reliable. </p><p>  It is required to perform in this way three tiers: one less than the previous one.  From the outside, it looks like a festive packaging for a multi-tiered cake.  The blank can be decorated with colored paper, gift ribbon. </p><p>  But this is not the most important thing.  So far, materials have been used to make ordinary decorative crafts, but how to make a cake out of juice and Barney with your own hands? </p><h2>  Second phase </h2>
