It sounds proud and domineering.  Indeed, during the existence <span>of the media,</span> journalists have rightfully been dubbed the fourth power.  This short thesis precisely defines the ins and outs of this profession.  Initially, the masters were writers who subtly noted topical news in their publications.  At the same time, the nature of such authorial works was completely opposite to what modern press readers are used to. </p><p>  In the past, those who were interested in periodicals were enlightened with the help of biographies, personal writings, short news and colorful memoirs, historical chronicles.  Current journalism operates with completely different methods and style.  Now the profession of a journalist extends to such media as newspapers, radio, television and Internet sites.  In this article, we will reveal the personality of the unique ace of journalism - Mironov Miron Petrovich, about whom extremely little information has been preserved.  Unfortunately, photographs or images of a talented publicist and editor did not reach the current reader. </p>

    <h2>  Journalist card: nature and occupation </h2><p>  The journalist <span>Mironov Miron</span> Petrovich was born in 1890.  As a young man, he joined the newspaper Birzhevye Novosti.  This was the starting point of his career in the media.  Later, the editions of a young successful journalist changed; he could work simultaneously for several publications.  Until his death, Mironov was engaged in publications in newspapers such as Russian Word, Seven Days in Illustrations, and Illustrated Russia.  His activity was not concentrated in one city.  Miron Petrovich Mironov in his entire life managed to visit Moscow, Kiev, and Riga, and at the end of his life he moved to Paris. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  short biography </h2><p>  Mironov Miron Petrovich (1890-1935 - the years of his life) was a journalist of periodicals.  His main goal was to cover events taking place in the interwar period.  At the same time, the young guy was active, which in the future ensured him success and career growth.  Now this journalist is more often referred to as an author of Jewish origin, who was able to raise several little-known magazines to a higher level.  Unfortunately, the biography of Miron Petrovich Mironov is scarce, almost nothing is known about his personal life.  Yes, this is not surprising, because he devoted himself entirely to a single business - journalism. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="M.P. Mironov" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/1964536.jpg" width="215"></div>  Short abstracts about a journalist </h2><ul><li>  Mironov Miron Petrovich is not just a publicist.  He was able to grow from an ordinary inexperienced boy into an editor and founder of several magazines.  Moreover, he was able not only to found informational publications, he attracted a third-party reader to his magazines and interested him in thoughtful publications. </li><li>  The journalist always went against the established framework, foundations and beliefs.  In his circle he was called an anarchist, since all his work was organized not according to the principles of the party.  Miron Petrovich also led his readers to one and the same political system - Bolshevism. </li><li>  He worked with such well-known writers and publicists as I. Bunin, A. Kuprin, S. Yushkevich and K. Balmont.  Thanks to Mironov, many famous works were published on the front pages of magazines.  The journalist, and in the future the chief editor, seemed to feel that the reader would like it and what talents needed to be promoted to the masses.  Thanks to this trait, Mironov had a circle of close friends who supported him in all projects until his death. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Miron Petrovich Mironov interesting facts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47053/1963501.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  ‚ÄúIllustrated Russia‚Äù, or a project that left a mark on history </h2><p>  This magazine owes its appearance entirely to Miron Petrovich Mironov, because it was he who was able to make it popular and interesting.  So, for 15 years, Illustrated Russia has been one of the best-selling publications.  Over time, this magazine began to publish prose, short stories, poems, and scientific works from now-famous publicists.  The list we listed above.  At the same time, Mironov, despite his deviation from the party, tried to allow strictly cultural work into circulation.  The journalist, and later the editor and director, literally felt what his readers lacked.  This flair affected the vitality of the magazine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Work in the magazine showed Mironov‚Äôs personality on the other hand.  He introduced himself to his colleagues as an energetic, competent, experienced and intelligent editor who breathed life into this creative direction. </p>

    <h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  Miron Petrovich Mironov died in 1935.  4 years earlier, the journalist had serious problems with his legs, which made elementary movement impossible and painful.  The disease broke the talented editor, and he soon left his post, because after some time the leg had to be amputated. </p><p>  A short rehabilitation helped Mironov get back to work, but not in Illustrated Russia, but in the local newspaper in Paris, Seven Days in Illustrations.  Not having lived after the operation and for four years, Miron Petrovich died.  Now his monument and grave is in the Panten cemetery. </p>

    <h2>  Close people and friends </h2><p>  Friends and acquaintances of Miron Petrovich Mironov mentioned relations with this person with trepidation.  One of his close friends was Alexander Kuprin.  Now this prose writer is known as the author of the works ‚ÄúGarnet Bracelet‚Äù, ‚ÄúElephant‚Äù and ‚ÄúOlesya‚Äù.  It was to this person that the journalist was able to transfer control of Illustrated Russia. </p><p>  Immediately after the death of Mironov, Kuprin came to the editorial post, but he also did not serve there for long, also due to health problems.  During the year, Kuprin's vision deteriorated, as a result of which editorial work brought only pain and tension. </p><h2>  Jewish talk </h2><p>  An interesting fact about Mironov Miron Petrovich is that the journalist was a purebred Jew.  This moment was often mentioned in the history of Russian literature and journalism.  Thanks to Miron Petrovich, ‚ÄúIllustrated Russia‚Äù worked enough talented people, most of whom were Jews.  While this magazine existed, there were published weekly works that spoke of a partnership between Russians and Jews.  For example, in one issue it was said that two musicians L. Godovsky and <span>Y. Kheifets</span> laid the first stone in the foundation of the music conservatory, which was soon erected in Jerusalem near the Hebrew University. </p>

    <h2>  What was Mironov talking about? </h2><ol><li>  Firstly, about cultural values.  The main task of Miron Petrovich was to convey competent and thoughtful work to people, while the publisher took into account all the wishes of its readers. </li><li>  Secondly, the journalist, along with culture, covered historical facts, presenting to his reader truthful, incorruptible information.  He was not afraid to cover sensitive topics, because the main ‚Äúhorse‚Äù of Mironov was in the ‚Äúculture and ethics‚Äù of each text. </li><li>  Thirdly, Miron Petrovich devoted most of the pages of the journal to his memoirs.  Thanks to this, readers were able to get acquainted with the Great French Revolution, which was described in detail by Yablonovsky. </li></ol><p>  Mironov over several years of work was able to achieve greater results than some journalists over the years of his career.  A striking example of his success can be the release of a series of books, which were referred to as the "Library of the best Russian and foreign writers."  He showed an excellent record by publishing over 20 books a year.  This figure can be envied and thank Mironov, because with his light hand the world opened up such talents as Z. Gippius, I. Bunin and D. Merezhkovsky. </p>
