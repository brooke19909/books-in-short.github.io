    <p>  Due to its short flight and affordable prices, Egypt has become one of the most popular destinations in the tourism industry.  Relaxing in Egyptian resorts is now much cheaper than in sanatoriums and boarding houses of the Crimea and Krasnodar Territory, and in terms of living conditions and quality of service, the country of the pharaohs has long surpassed domestic health resorts. </p><p>  Arriving in Egypt, you can see the mysterious sphinx and magnificent pyramids, ride a boat on the Nile, visit the Valley of the Kings and see the mummies in the <span>Cairo museum,</span> ride through the desert on a deadpan camel, visit the Bedouin village and arrange an ATV race on sand dunes.  The main wealth of Egypt, of course, is the Red Sea, which attracts us with the inexhaustible wealth of its depths. </p><p>  Many tourists for frequent visits to Egypt choose economical hotels in Hurghada.  If you decide to combine a quality vacation away from the hustle and bustle of the city center and enjoy a good beach vacation and a rich excursion program, there is no need to overpay for a pretentious five-star hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A competent choice in this case could be Zahabia <span>Hotel Beach Resort 3</span> Hurghada, whose rating, according to visitors, is four out of five points.
