  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fuel free generator</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the end of the nineteenth century, an alternating current system was invented, which is still used today.  This is a fuel free generator.  Its author is Nikola Tesla.  The design works without any fuel.  Tesla's task was to condense the energy between the Earth and the upper atmospheric layer.  Next is the conversion of the received energy into electric current. </p><p>  The generator has a high <span>transformation ratio,</span> from ten to fifty times the ratio of the available number of turns of the secondary winding to the number of turns of the primary winding.  The output voltage of the device can reach several million volts.  The voltage corresponding to the resonant frequency is capable of creating strong electric discharges in the air (up to several meters in length). </p><p>  The simplest fuel-free <span>Tesla generator is</span> available to make on your own.  It comes with a pair of coils without a common core.  The primary winding includes from three to ten turns of thick wire.  In the secondary winding there are approximately one thousand turns.  When deciding to create a <span>fuel-free generator with your own hands,</span> you need to know that the most difficult thing is the primary winding power circuit.  To make such a generator is relatively simple, but expensive.  First you need to take any voltage source (at least one and a half kilovolts).  It should be connected to the capacitor for the required voltage.  The fuel-free generator of this option has a very simple circuit.  The procedure is as follows: </p><p>  1. Connect the selected source to the required voltage to any available capacitor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Provide a diode bridge due to the large capacitance of the capacitor.  However, experimenting with small containers is recommended first. </p><p>  3. Connect all this through the spark gap to the primary winding of the coil. </p><p>  The bare ends of the wire are directed in one direction.  The gap between them should be adjusted by bending the <span>wire.</span>  At the peak, the voltage is always higher than the original, since the current is alternating.  Therefore, to create a secondary winding, one hundred and fifty turns is enough.  If the work process is carried out correctly, a discharge of one centimeter will result (if the leads of the coils are close).  If you separate the conclusions to the sides, you get a noticeable arc.  The bottom output of the coil must be earthed. </p><p>  Due to the fixed capacitance of the capacitor, the circuit is tuned by correcting the primary winding resistance.  At the same time, the connection point to it changes.  If the settings are made correctly, then the upper part of the secondary winding will have a sufficiently high voltage.  This will cause large discharges in the air.  If we compare conventional transformers, then we can draw the following conclusion: the ratio of the turns of the windings (primary and secondary) does not affect the voltage. </p><p>  The fuel-free generator can be assembled according to the scheme proposed in the technical reference.  You can also find useful information on the Internet.  For beginners, the process at first seems complicated.  A working coil can be obtained by making small calculations.  Specialist instructions will also help. </p><p>  A non-fuel generator can also be assembled using the following parts: aluminum foil, a capacitor with a voltage of 160 - 400 Volts, a resistor, a metal pin, wires, a fiberboard or cardboard sheet.  The manufacturing process is as follows: </p><p>  1. Drive a metal pin into the ground. </p><p>  2. Attach one end of the wire to the pin. </p><p>  3. Attach the other end of the wire to the capacitor. </p><p>  4. Attach a sheet of foil to a sheet of cardboard or fiberboard and connect a wire to the capacitor to it. </p><p>  5. Solder a limiting resistor to the capacitor to prevent breakdown of the dielectric. </p><p>  Before manufacturing a Tesla fuel-free generator yourself, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with safety procedures when working with high voltage. </p>
