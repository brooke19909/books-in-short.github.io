Along with the popular resort areas of Turkey and Egypt, this country is among the three best budget options for a summer beach holiday.  Greece is a member of the European Union, which means that to enter the country you will need an appropriate permit called a visa.  By the way, the Greeks are very loyal to this procedure, and issue tourist visas for a long period.  Well, you have all the documents, now you need to determine the place where you want to spend your Greek holidays.  The most popular holiday masses are the islands of Rhodes and Crete.  But in the article I would like to talk about such a wonderful place as the island of Zakynthos, the existence of which many forget. </p><h2>  Amazing place </h2><p>  Zakynthos is a resort patch of land that is part of the Ionian archipelago.  Its distinctive feature is widespread, and the coastline has a length of about 123 kilometers.  Due to its favorable location and nature rich in vegetation, the air of the island is filled with the heady aroma of the sea breeze, coniferous forests, citrus trees, juniper thickets and spicy herbs.  If you went to this place in search of historical sights, then we are in a hurry to upset you, it is unlikely that you will be able to find something on the island of Zakynthos, since this territory has been repeatedly subjected to earthquakes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Askos Stone Park" class="if uuid-2404220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2404220.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Greece is full of stories and myths, in fact, like the name of the island itself.  Zakynthos is the son of King Dardan, who once landed on the land lost in the sea and founded his own city here, named after him.  The banner of the island also bears the symbolism of the founder, which develops on all public buildings, along with the national Greek flag. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mention of the island of Zakynthos can also be found in the "Illiad" of Homer, who sang the beauty of this wonderful place back in those days.  The culture of these places is completely saturated with Romans, Byzantines and Normans.  Since it was these peoples who had the greatest influence on the island at different periods of their possession. </p><p>  Let's just say that the Renaissance on the island of Zakynthos in Greece fell on the XVII century.  As a result of the Ottoman conquest of Crete, many of the best architects and craftsmen were forced to move here. </p><h2>  Weather and climate </h2><p>  If we talk about a vacation on this beautiful island, many prefer it not for the sake of architectural values, which are not there at all, but for the sake of beautiful nature.  Zakynthos Island in Greece is one of the greenest places in the whole country.  From an environmental point of view, rest on the island is simply impeccable.  There are no industrial enterprises and any factors that worsen the atmosphere of the air. </p><p>  The island has a temperate Mediterranean climate.  Already in late April - early May, tourists are slowly arriving on the island, thereby opening the first bathing season.  It is also worth noting that meteorologists recognized the local climatic conditions as the mildest in all of Greece. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifo.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Agios Nikolaos Beach" class="if uuid-2404232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2404232.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning that in winter the island is completely opposite weather.  This is probably very successful, since Zakynthos managed to combine a sort of middle ground between mild cold in winter and the lack of sun in the summer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  The sights of Zakynthos are represented, to a greater extent, by magnificent beaches, grottoes, nature and local animals.  Residents of the island with great respect for the conservation of wildlife in their territory.  Unfortunately, most of the historical monuments have not been preserved to this day, but the perfection of nature on Zakynthos has remained unchanged. </p><p>  Blue caves, countless grottoes, stone arches and a beautiful promenade deserve special attention.  For those who are new to the island for the first time, the presence of the most beautiful stone reserve Askos, one kilometer from the port of Agios Nikolaos, can serve as useful information. </p><p>  But the main reason to visit this truly beautiful place is its amazing natural attractions and magnificent beaches.  The whole beauty of Fiore de Levante - that's what the Venetians called the island of Zakynthos, it is impossible to describe in words.  Let's get acquainted with this magnificent natural heritage. </p><h2>  Navagio Bay </h2><p>  If you are not traveling on your own, but are turning to tourist organizations for help, then in any of them you will definitely be shown a photograph of a fabulously beautiful embankment with azure water and snow-white sand.  Is it a montage?  No, this is one of the famous Navagio Bay, which occupies a leading position in the list of the most photographed places on the planet.  Previously, the bay was called St. George, but after a storm, as a result of which a small ship was washed ashore carrying smuggled goods, the country's authorities decided to rename the place.  Unfortunately, you can visit this place in the only way - by sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discovergreece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Navagio Bay" class="if uuid-2404176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2404176.jpg"></div><h2>  Laganas </h2><p>  An equally important attraction of the island is considered to be the endangered species of sea turtles with the funny name ‚Äúcarriage-carriage" that live in the picturesque place of Laganas.  The reserve park consists of several beaches, where the most comfortable living conditions for these wonderful creatures are recreated.  As excursions on the island of Zakynthos, many travel companies organize a boat trip with a transparent bottom in these surroundings, so that tourists can observe the life of the marine fauna. </p><h2>  Blue caves of Zakynthos </h2><p>  A few paragraphs earlier we already mentioned in passing about the blue caves in Greece, but it is not enough just to know about their existence, it is important to get a complete picture.  The northern side of the island received numerous grottoes, caves and the cleanest sea in Greece.  This whole complex is called ‚ÄúBlue Caves‚Äù and is an important tourist destination in the country.  The most famous of the caves is considered to be the ‚ÄúBlue Grotto‚Äù, located on Cape Skinari.  To get inside should be every tourist who arrives on the island.  In addition, this can be a great independent adventure, since none of the ships can fit under low arches.  Thus, there is only one way out of this situation - to swim. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue caves" class="if uuid-2404174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2404174.jpg"></div><h2>  Stone Reserve </h2><p>  Attention is also given to the Askos stone reserve, located near the port of Agios Nikolaos.  Here you can find interesting architectural delights built in ancient times, such as water tanks, wooden compositions and much more.  It is also worth noting the beautiful nature in this part of the island. </p><h2>  Zakynthos beaches </h2><p>  In addition to the famous Navagio Bay, there are a lot of interesting beaches on the island.  In addition, Navagio is not the best place for a beach holiday.  Since tourists are landed here for a short time, many only manage to take a couple of selfies against the backdrop of majestic cliffs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fidelitytravel.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caves on the island" class="if uuid-2404214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2404214.jpg"></div><h2>  Porto Roxa and Porto Limnion </h2><p>  The tourists do not call these places favorable for a beach holiday, but here you can enjoy clean water, sunbathe in the sun on the terraces overlooking the small fjords.  Since there is a rather rocky area and there is no sand at all, many vacationers actively use Porto Roxa and Porto Limnion as a place for amateur diving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelwithemilie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Porto Roxa Beach" class="if uuid-2404225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2404225.jpg"></div><h2>  Porto Vromi </h2><p>  Porto Vromi is one of the fjords on the island, but unlike previous places, there is a full beach.  The main highlight of this location can be considered a picturesque view of the shaggy cliffs, which are clearly visible from the beach.  In addition, boat trips to Navagio Bay are regularly organized from here, but this is not the only exotic route.  The organization may vary depending on the time spent on the island, so experienced travelers are advised to find out all the details directly on the spot. </p><h2>  Agios Nikolaos </h2><p>  Many tourists mistakenly take it by hearsay for another city of the same name located in Crete.  No, you should not mislead yourself.  That Agios Nikolaos, which is discussed in our article, is located several kilometers north of the city of Zakynthos.  This is probably one of the best beaches on the island.  It has excellent infrastructure, the necessary amenities for a pleasant pastime, as well as magnificent landscapes.  The only sadness for vacationers, according to reviews, is pebbles on the shore, so you should always take beach shoes with you. </p><h2>  Makris Gialos Beach </h2><p>  If you start a conversation about exotic and beautiful views, then this is Makris Gialos.  This beach was created to show off on postcards.  From the very approach to it, a breathtaking view opens up.  From the city of Zakynthos, the beach is only 30 kilometers away.  Believe me, if you come here, it is better to stay for the whole day and spend it under the sun.  Makris Gialos beach consists of a mixture of sand and pebbles and has a fairly large extent.  On the sides you can see a kind of blue caves.  Nevertheless, this is a good option if you did not succeed in looking at the original. </p><p>  According to reviews of Zakynthos, Makris Gialos is the most popular, since there is not only a beautiful beach, but also a magnificent landscape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Makris Gialos Beach" class="if uuid-2404235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2404235.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Hotels on the island of Zakynthos are crazy.  But, as everyone knows, the correct choice of a berth is the key to a successful holiday.  Judging by the reviews, the most popular are considered to be Astir Palace Hotel, Zante Park Resort &amp; Spa and Zakantha Beach. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Tours to the island of Zakynthos are quite a popular phenomenon among various travel agencies, and for good reason.  This place, like many others in the Greek state, deserves special attention.  We hope that in our article you managed to find a lot of useful information. </p>
