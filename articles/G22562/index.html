  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MFI "VIVA Money": reviews, conditions for obtaining a microloan, office addresses</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is not only banks that can provide credit services to the population.  Various financial institutions do not always offer loans at competitive rates.  As a result, MFIs have become one of the leaders in the number of offers in the microcredit market.  The population applies for a loan for various reasons, and almost always citizens receive approval of applications, unlike banks. </p><p>  However, it is worth considering that each microfinance company makes its own terms when concluding a loan agreement.  Therefore, it is important to understand that although the company is less influential than any of the domestic banks, it is also subject to the rules of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, as well as the Civil Code. </p><p>  VIVA Money offices are located in most large and medium-sized cities of Russia.  The company has extensive experience in microcrediting and offers some of the most favorable conditions in comparison with other financial and credit institutions. </p><h2>  Benefits of MFIs </h2><p>  If we talk about reviews about VIVA Money, many customers note strict compliance with the current legislation in the field of microcredit regulation of the population.  Employees of the organization are always polite and courteous.  In terms of benefits, MFIs have many. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.movinggalleries.org" data-author=": Ellen, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card Loan" class="if uuid-2966038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2966038.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, it concerns the extended limit.  If you have a good salary, you can get a loan of up to 40 thousand rubles at the first appeal.  This is significantly more than many MFIs offer in the microcredit market.  Since the company has a license from the Central Bank, it fully complies with the established forms of contracts and does not violate them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the extended limit, a long loan repayment term is also provided.  The client can pay the debt in installments, broken down for up to 12 months.  The interest rate on microcrediting, although higher than on consumer loans at the bank, but it does not go beyond the established framework of the Central Bank. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  VIVA Money reviews as MFIs indicate that the company has extensive experience and strong ties with its customers.  The organization always offers favorable conditions for loans and extended limits on borrowed funds to customers who often turn to the institution.  In addition, the accumulated base of borrowers and strict adherence to legislation allows you to have a good rating among financial institutions. </p><p>  The company has extensive experience not only thanks to the coordinated work of the team, but also because it has existed in the credit market since 2011.  For 7 years, the founders have been constantly improving the system of providing loans, introducing new conditions and technologies for obtaining them.  During this long period of existence, MFIs have opened more than 20 branches throughout the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inc.com" data-author=": Courtney Rubin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Available limits" class="if uuid-2966040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2966040.jpg"></div><p>  A positive point in the work of the company is that they provide loans only after a full check of all the details.  This is especially important.  After all, there are times when scammers use the Internet to issue a loan to a front man or stolen documents of another person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the first loan it is necessary to come to the office and provide the original documents.  At the same time, citizens can submit applications online.  Only after passing a full check of all the data and personally signing the loan agreement does the citizen receive the amount of money indicated in the application. </p><h2>  How the company works </h2><p>  In reviews of VIVA Money, a convenient system of the company‚Äôs work is also noted.  To obtain the necessary amount of money, various loan programs are offered.  The very principle of the work of MFIs is debugged and yet simple.  The official website of the organization contains a registration form.  After filling in, access to your personal account is opened. </p><p>  By registering, the client gets the opportunity to leave an application for a loan online.  Filling all the fields with information does not take much time.  After this, it is necessary to confirm all the specified data and indicate the required loan amount.  After that, the application is sent to the operators for consideration.  They check the source data and make a decision within 10 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.top10bestbusinessloans.com" data-author=": JeFreda Brown, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Signing a loan agreement" class="if uuid-2966042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2966042.jpg"></div><p>  Next, the client must go to the nearest office from him to complete the loan.  Money is issued in cash or by transfer to a bank card.  However, it is worthwhile to understand that the first loan is always issued and issued at the office. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Microloans ‚ÄúVIVA Money‚Äù allow you to get a loan on different conditions.  The company has express loan or round-the-clock loan programs.  At any time, the user can contact the MFI to obtain the necessary amount of funds.  If a client has already used the microloan system from this company several times, he can count on a loyalty program.  It allows you to receive the necessary credit limits online or by call without a personal visit to the office. </p><h2>  How to get a loan </h2><p>  VIVA Money reviews often say that users do not know how to get a first loan.  You can also find reports that they are denied a loan, although their credit history is good and there are no outstanding debts.  In fact, this situation is not uncommon in the company.  Employees refuse to borrowers if they are not in the region where the organization‚Äôs office is located.  If the registration is not in the city or region where the branch is located, the application will be automatically rejected. </p><p>  In order to apply for a loan, you must go to the official website of the company.  On the main page, you will immediately be asked to choose a loan amount and term.  After that, the system will transfer the user to the registration page.  It will require you to specify all the information about yourself and attach scans of documents if necessary. </p><p>  At the end, the region where the company‚Äôs office is located is selected and the information is sent to the MFI server.  Employees verify the data and decide whether to provide a credit line or to refuse this action. </p><h2>  Card design </h2><p>  ‚ÄúViva Money‚Äù also offers a convenient opportunity for its clients to issue a company card for receiving borrowed funds.  It completely looks like a bank, and through it you can withdraw funds or pay with it in any store or institution.  This is quite convenient, because the card supports all systems of payment and cash withdrawals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wisesmallbusiness.com" data-author=": Wise Small Business, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Financial support" class="if uuid-2966048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2966048.jpg"></div><p>  The system is convenient to use and allows you to withdraw funds without commission at any ATM in the country.  There is an important nuance: you can withdraw funds only in terminals that support the VISA system.  View all completed transactions on the card is available in the user‚Äôs account on the company‚Äôs website. </p><p>  The card not only has credit funds, but can also be fully debit.  There is no service fee, as long as there is active account activity.  Clients who often use this offer are provided with extended benefits and other interesting bonuses. </p><h2>  Credit repayment methods </h2><p>  ‚ÄúViva Money‚Äù makes it possible to deposit credit funds and interest on them through any payment system.  This is convenient enough, especially when you need to quickly transfer money and pay off a loan.  Depending on the chosen method of repayment of the loan, commissions for the implementation of this transaction may be charged by intermediaries providing such a service. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the established limits and restrictions.  Internet wallets and payment systems may not fully transfer the indicated amount, as restrictions are set.  So, users of online wallets that are not registered in the system can send money for one transaction in the amount of not more than 15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Risk insurance </h2><p>  The loan at VIVA Money has recently become subject to insurance.  This is a new program in the MFI system, which is completely copied from bank offers.  Many users know that when applying for a consumer loan, it is proposed to take out insurance in order to avoid the risks of non-payment of debt.  The program protects the interests of clients for up to two months, depending on the amount and the selected loan conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yourfinanceformulas.com" data-author=": Kenneth Parker, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interest calculation" class="if uuid-2966051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2966051.jpg"></div><p>  This is quite convenient, because the percentage on microcrediting is greater, and the terms are shorter.  In case of unforeseen circumstances, a citizen can always contact the MFI and warn the operator that at the moment he does not have time to deposit funds.  In addition, insurance protects borrowers in the event of their partial or full disability for a specified period of time. </p><h2>  Requirements for the borrower </h2><p>  VIVA Money considers applications based on established requirements for potential borrowers.  Equal conditions for granting loans are offered to all.  This is due to the fact that the technology developed by the company for assessing the borrower makes it possible to avoid further education of the debtor's delay. </p><p>  The main requirements when compiling an application online are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Citizenship of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Permanent (non-temporary) registration of the applicant at the location of the company office. </li><li>  Age over 21 years (applications of male citizens who do not have a military card on hand are not considered). </li><li>  No open debts to MFIs. </li></ol><p>  A more detailed consideration of the application takes place directly in the office of the company.  Original documents must be provided. </p><h2>  Help and service </h2><p>  The addresses of VIVA Money and the cities where the MFIs are represented can be found on the company's website.  In Moscow, the office of the company is located at ul.  Zemlyanoy Val, d. 29, p. 1. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.758333" data-lng="37.65788359999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/8/3/2/11832.png"></div><p>  In Tolyatti, the branch can be found at ul.

In addition, support for phone numbers indicated on the website works around the clock. </p><p>  Clients of the company note that employees always try to meet borrowers.  Therefore, in case of unforeseen circumstances, it is important to immediately contact the MFI office for a solution to the problem. </p><h2>  Current shares </h2><p>  IFC "VIVA Money" in order to attract new customers and encourage them for their activity constantly conducts various contests and promotions.  Basically, these are bonuses in the form of cash.  Anyone who brings a friend to an MFI receives 500 rudders when applying for a loan. </p><p>  In addition, each quarter the organization plays out various household appliances and electronics.  There are also special prizes.  The most active borrowers with a good credit history are invited to participate in the competition for receiving as a gift 100 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ourbusinessnews.com" data-author=": ADMIN, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Economic assistance" class="if uuid-2966056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2966056.jpg"></div><h2>  Are there any discounts </h2><p>  The company "VIVA Money" offers all new customers a loan on special conditions.
