Many tourists relax there every summer and probably studied the entire route to the smallest detail.  But what if you came to the resort with one mode of transport, and are going to leave with another? </p><p>  In this article you will find complete information on how to overcome the distance from Anapa to Moscow.  But it is serious.  Only in a straight line is 1208 kilometers.  But even liners do not fly like that, since the path partially lies above the sky of Ukraine and, in particular, the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, which are a zone of military conflict. </p><p>  Since Anapa is a popular resort in Russia, it is connected with the capital by all types of public transport: plane, train, bus.  You can also get to Moscow by car.  Let's look at all the options for the path in order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="100500miles.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://100500miles.ru/tag/anapa/page/2/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa - Moscow" class="if uuid-2234299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2234299.jpg"></div><h2>  By car </h2><p>  Paved tracks are close to a straight line on the map.  But all the same, ‚Äúruns over‚Äù the extra 267 kilometers.  Thus, the total distance from Anapa to Moscow is 1475 km. </p><p>  There are two route options: through Krasnodar or Rostov-on-Don.  All motorists are advised to choose the last option.  Firstly, this road is more oriented to the north and there is no need to make a hook to the east.  The highway to Rostov-on-Don is single-lane, but is in good condition.  If you leave Anapa early in the morning, you can avoid the proximity of trucks and other vehicles.  The city of Timashevsk is better to cross through.  Motorists claim that on the ring road you can get stuck at the <span>railway crossing</span> for a long time <span>.</span>  <span>The M4 highway is</span> wide, but at the peak of the season traffic jams occur here.  Fortunately, there are many taverns on the way where you can eat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are several paid sections on <span>the M4 highway</span> , at which a speed of 130 km / h is allowed.  This significantly reduces the total travel time on the <span>Anapa-Moscow route.</span>  There are few police patrols on the track, but many radars.  So do not break the rules.  To Moscow (if you do not make long stops along the way) you will arrive in the evening.  After midnight, the chance of getting stuck in traffic is minimal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="premier-log.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://premier-log.ru/anapa"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa - Moscow: distance:" class="if uuid-2234305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2234305.jpg"></div><h2>  Plane from Anapa to Moscow </h2><p>  Now consider travel options by public transport.  The fastest way from a resort to the capital is a plane.  Daily scheduled flights are operated by Aeroflot, Emirates and Qatar Airways. </p><p>  If you are a resident of Anapa and fly to Moscow on business, then the most convenient flight leaves at 8:00.  Already at 10:15 you will land in the capital Sheremetyevo.  And if you are a Muscovite returning from vacation, then the best flight is at 18:00.  He arrives in Domodedovo at 20:20.  There are days of the week when planes from other airlines depart on the Anapa-Moscow route.  This is "ES 7" (Monday and Tuesday), UP Israel "(on weekdays).  The demanded evening flight, except for Qatar Airlines, is operated by Emirates.  Prices, of course, bite.  But if you take care of buying a ticket in advance, then you can get a seat on the plane already for 4821 rubles.  It should be remembered that you should arrive at the Vityazevo Airport (Anapa) at least one and a half hours before the flight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="clubofmozambique.com" data-author=": Isaac Ojeda, " data-source="http://clubofmozambique.com/news/more-on-the-tender-launched-for-allocation-of-air-routes-mozambique/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa-Moscow: plane" class="if uuid-2234318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2234318.jpg"></div><h2>  The trains </h2><p>  Several trains run along this route.  There are both fast trains and express trains.  The latter, under the number 011 Oe, spends a little less than a day on the road.  Fast trains reach the capital in 29 hours (155 C), 36 (109 C) and 37 (247 C). </p><p>  The best train on the route Moscow-Anapa in the reviews is considered an express train.  The cars are clean, there is a TV, and the staff is helpful and polite.  This train leaves Anapa at 13:45, and arrives at the Kazan station in Moscow at 13:38 the next day.  Not the most convenient time, travelers complain.  And the prices will start from 3990 rubles in the reserved seat.  And in a soft car the ticket costs 29 162 rubles. </p><p>  Other trains on this route offer more affordable prices.  The cheapest train is 247 C (3 thousand rubles in the reserved seat and 3125 in the compartment).  He leaves at 23:20, and arrives in Moscow in one day at 12:37.  Convenient is also the composition of No. 155 C, leaving Anapa in the morning, at 9:10.  He arrives in the capital the next day at 14:35. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.com" data-author=": Aleksandr Rais, " data-source="https://www.drive2.com/l/10425742/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow - Anapa: reviews" class="if uuid-2234323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2234323.jpg"></div><h2>  Anapa-Moscow bus </h2><p>  There are only three flights per day in this direction.
