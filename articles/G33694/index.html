Bank Credit Policy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A bank is a credit organization that offers its customers (individuals and legal entities) a variety of products.  Consider some of the proposals of these financial institutions, which are currently in maximum demand. </p><h2>  Customer credit </h2><p>  This is the most demanded product, which is used to a greater extent by individuals.  Banks and other credit organizations offer a simplified procedure for obtaining it.  Often you only need to provide a Russian passport in order to count on receiving this banking product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kisspng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian banks" class="if uuid-3032474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/3032474.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Let us analyze the types of consumer lending.  According to the option of spending material resources, consumer credit is either targeted or free. </p><p>  In the first case, it is possible to purchase goods that can be issued directly in large stores.  If, however, a non-targeted loan is considered, you can use it at your own discretion.  The client receives the materiel directly at the cash desk of this bank (after the consumer credit processing procedure). </p><h2>  Collateral Options </h2><p>  There are two options for a consumer loan: secured, unsecured. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secured consumer credit implies the presence of collateral or the presence of guarantors.  In this case, the banks of the Russian Federation have a certain insurance that the consumer will be repaid the loan within the time period established by the concluded agreement.  Otherwise, all responsibility of the financial burden will be on the shoulders of the guarantor. </p><p>  If there is a loan collateral, the banks of the Russian Federation will attract collateral property to compensate for the damage they have suffered.  There are also situations in which the total amount of a secured consumer loan taken is significantly higher than a loan without collateral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.interactivepromotions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank of Russia credit institution" class="if uuid-3032476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/3032476.jpg"></div><h2>  Important points </h2><p>  Depending on the material income of the credited, the size of the loan may vary significantly.  The amount of the monthly payment should not exceed 40-45% of the monthly salary of the borrower. </p><p>  Some financial institutions that offer consumer loans, before concluding an agreement, require the client to provide income certificates for the period of the last six months. </p><p>  There are promotions that offer targeted interest-free loans, there are also offers with suspiciously low interest rates.  It is necessary to be wary of such things, since they clearly do not correspond to reality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.loansagain.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banks and other credit organizations" class="if uuid-3032478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/3032478.jpg"></div><h2>  Credit card debt repayment methods </h2><p>  The Bank of Russia is a credit institution that offers customers various products.  For example, recently, credit cards are in demand.  But what to do in those cases when it has accumulated a lot of debt?  Despite the fact that there is no universal way to solve this problem in a short time, the situation is still far from hopeless.  You can use some proven methods of repaying the resulting credit card debt.  The choice of one of these methods will be determined by the financial goals of the borrower. </p><p>  We offer several methods for reducing credit card debt.  The first option can be called "snow debt."  In this case, we are talking about repaying loans in the ratio of lesser debt to more debt, not taking into account the interest rate on these loans.  You can quickly pay off your first debt, which will be an excellent motivation to repay other loans.  "Snowball" is suitable for all consumers. </p><p>  In the second option, repayment of the largest loan is first proposed.  Organization of credit operations of banks involves obtaining a maximum profit by a financial institution.  In many cases, such a loan is estimated as 30% of all credit debt, that is, you can feel a decrease in the credit burden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The third way is to pay off credit debt - using another account. </p><p>  If there are transfer fees, it is important to calculate whether it will be possible to compensate for them with low interest rates.  In order for this method of loan repayment to work to the maximum extent, you need to fight the temptation to use a card cleared of debt obligations.  It is important to pay off the balance used by the borrower in a timely manner.  If there is no specific action plan, the procedure for transferring funds from one credit card to another will be inappropriate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.utkarsh.bank" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how is the organization of the lending process in the bank" class="if uuid-3032482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/3032482.jpg"></div><h2>  The importance of consumer lending </h2><p>  A bank is a credit institution that offers its customers a variety of products.  Bank analysts say that currently consumer loans are the most popular.  When applying to the bank, you must first think about whether this amount is really needed, and whether it will be possible to return it to the financial institution in a timely manner. </p><p>  A bank is a credit institution that will not work to the detriment of its interests.  Depending on the purpose of a bank loan, financial institutions offer various lending options. </p><p>  Among the most common and sought-after types of loans, one can mention consumer loans issued for some urgent needs.  This option assumes that the client will take cash or the currency will be transferred to the current account.  You can spend them on the purchase of certain goods.  On average, interest rates on such a proposal are 22-25% per annum. </p><p>  Additionally, you will have to pay a commission to the bank for servicing the loan.  A commercial bank is a credit organization that tries to get the maximum profit at the lowest cost.  That is why a prerequisite for obtaining a loan is life insurance. </p><p>  If the client chooses credit through a card, in this case you need to understand that when withdrawing cash from the card through an ATM, you will have to pay an ATM fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="organization of credit policy of banks in the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-3032485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/3032485.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting offers </h2><p>  A bank is a credit organization that studies customer requests for the formation of new products.  Some commercial institutions offer the option of soft loans. </p><p>  With timely reimbursement to the bank of the amount of money that appears in the contract, the client does not pay additional bank fees, that is, significantly saves his money.  The organization of a bank‚Äôs credit policy is a difficult task, the income and stability of the organization depend on the success of its implementation. </p><p>  That is why the design of a plastic credit card is offered not only in offices, but also through the World Wide Web. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="commercial Bank" class="if uuid-3032490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/3032490.jpg"></div><h2>  Lending without guarantors and certificates </h2><p>  People tend to constantly seek additional material resources, and therefore they are trying to take consumer loans.  A Russian credit organization offers loans both with and without guarantors. </p><p>  If the borrower turns out to be an unscrupulous payer, this threatens the guarantor with the need to repay the loan.  It is because of distrust in the loaned that many people today refuse to become guarantors.  Scare people away and the numerous certificates that they are forced to collect in order to help their relative or friend get a certain amount of money. </p><p>  The organization of the lending process in the bank is so serious that not everyone is ready to bear responsibility as guarantors for other people's debt on loans.  That is why many financial institutions offer loans without a guarantor (secured by property). </p><h2>  Certain difficulties </h2><p>  Some individual entrepreneurs have several additional incomes, which they clearly do not intend to declare to the tax authorities.  If they want to take loans from banking organizations, in such situations they will have to look for a guarantor or prove their financial situation with certain certificates, which it will be quite difficult for them to obtain. </p><p>  Banks that offer consumer loans can ask for the number of mobile or landline phones of relatives, accounting at the place of official work, or colleagues. </p><p>  They are trying to understand how reliable the loan applicant is, whether he will be able to pay interest on loans in a timely manner.  If an unemployed person who is unable to prove his material well-being comes to the bank, he will not be able to count on a positive decision on the part of a financial organization to issue a loan. </p><p>  Depending on the guarantees received by the bank, credit rates may vary, and the maturity of consumer loans may change. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldfinance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit organization" class="if uuid-3032491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/3032491.jpg"></div><h2>  About the difficulties of a mortgage </h2><p>  Currently, many average Russians are able to buy their own housing only through mortgage lending.  This segment of banking is in high demand, and therefore deserves a separate discussion.  What are the features of obtaining a mortgage? </p><p>  Where are the potential borrowers waiting for pitfalls, how to get rid of them?  To begin with, patience is required to arrange a mortgage, as this process is a very lengthy procedure. </p><p>  After the global economic crisis, banks have significantly increased their requirements for issuing mortgages, the employees of this financial institution carefully check potential borrowers. </p><p>  For example, after applying for a mortgage, a decision on the possibility of a loan can be made not in 3-4 days, but in 7-8 days. </p><p>  During this time, the apartment can already be sold, so you have to look for a new option.  The cost may be much more expensive, in addition, the apartment will be located, for example, in a remote area from the traffic intersection.  There are cases that the consideration of a loan application submitted to the bank is delayed for a calendar month, and the final decision will be negative. </p><h2>  What do you need to know? </h2><p>  The solvency requirements of potential borrowers have changed significantly.  A check by bank employees of a certificate of employment is carried out with special care, no ‚Äúsalaries in envelopes‚Äù are taken into account.  Working in a company issuing a ‚Äúwhite salary‚Äù of about 13-15 thousand rubles, it is difficult to convince bank employees that an unofficial salary is fifty thousand rubles a month, therefore, obtaining a mortgage loan will be problematic. </p><p>  Also negatively affects the value of the mortgage and the fluctuation of the ruble.  With changes in the exchange rate of the national currency against the US dollar, the cost of a mortgage loan increases. </p><p>  In order to withstand the procedure for evaluating the property selected for registration of a mortgage, you need nerves of steel.  An assessment may be conducted several times, depending on the conditions of the mortgage.  Payment for the procedure is carried out by the potential borrower. </p>
