But in fact, its location is Italy, although at one time the Greeks really ruled it.  The letter ‚Äús‚Äù at the end of the name of the settlement also came from them, and it was in this city that Archimedes, Plato lived and created, staged his masterpieces by Aeschylus.  Therefore, despite the fact that Syracuse is an Italian place, it can rightfully be considered a Greek heritage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="syracuse attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/556928.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  There is no escape from history </h2><p>  Syracuse (attractions and the oldest part of the settlement) were located on the island of Ortigia.  But this city was growing at an incredibly fast pace and rather quickly turned into the largest settlement in all of Sicily.  During the peak of prosperity, there were five quarters in Syracuse, the ruins of structures of ancient times (the altar of Zeus Eleutherio, the Greek theater, quarries, the Roman amphitheater and the tomb of Archimedes).  All these prominent places are overwhelmingly located in the quarter called Neapolis. </p><p>  Already in the V century BC, Syracuse was the title of the largest <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Sicily.</span>  Also, this metropolis was one of the most influential settlements in the entire Mediterranean.  Many rulers ruled Syracuse.  But the most famous is the despot Dionysius I. He ruled the city for almost 40 years.  And the fame of Dionysius I brought his bestial cruelty and pathological suspicion.  As the legends say, the satrap, seeing a sharp razor in the hands of the barber, ordered the man to be crucified, for he decided that it was possible to kill the ruler with this item. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At one time, the greatest of mathematicians, Archimedes, created and lived in this city.  Syracuse, whose sights are something unforgettable, can boast of Piazza Archimedes - an area named after the scientist.  The 75-year-old mathematician was responsible for the technical side of the defense during the military confrontations with the Romans and the many-month siege of Syracuse.  According to historians, at this time, Archimedes used in practice some machines, which, in fact, he himself invented. </p><p>  After all these events, the city has lost its significance.  And after the Arabs moved to Palermo, the capital of the island of Syracuse turned into a provincial provincial town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Syracuse Attractions Photos" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/556926.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Ear shaped cave </h2><p>  If you do not know what to see in Syracuse, then our advice is to you: start your excursion with a visit to the Ear of Dionysius.  It is a limestone artificial cave, which was knocked out in the rocks of Temenite.  The strange name of the object came from the fact that it resembles the human ear in shape. </p><p>  Most likely, this attraction was formed where there was once an ancient quarry.  Such quarries of Syracuse were famous all over the world.  The cave reaches a height of 23 meters.  And in the depth of the cliff its length is 65 meters.  Looking at the Ear of Dionysius from a helicopter, you can see that the cave bends like the letter S. And the entrance here looks like a drop.  Thanks to this form, the cave has unsurpassed acoustics.  Even the quiet whisper of visitors will be heard throughout its territory.  A map of Syracuse with landmarks will show you where this unrivaled facility is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Syracuse map with landmarks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/556924.jpg" width="600"></div>

After all, this object is considered the pearl of a magnificent local square.  This temple was the richest place in ancient Greece.  And therefore it was not a big surprise that the temple was robbed more than once.  In the first century BC, the greatest damage was caused to the church of the city of Syracuse.  The sights, photos of which are presented in our article, fortunately, have been preserved.  Residents are proud that such a magnificent monument of architecture is located on the territory of their city. </p><p>  On the example of the Cathedral, you can get acquainted with the features of Italian church architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="syracuse sicily attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/556927.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Greek Theater</span> in Italy </h2><p>  Syracuse, the sights of which we are considering, are known for the fact that the Greeks lived here.  And in the city there are many objects that prove this truth.  One of these is the Greek theater - a grandiose monument reminiscent of the era of antiquity.  Its creator was a satrap named Gelon.  And the architect was Domokolos.  The theater, like the Ear of Dionysius, was hollowed out in the rock of Temenite.  It held public meetings, staged comedies and tragedies.  Even today, every two years, classical performances by the National Institute of Ancient Drama are demonstrated here. </p><h2>  All museums museum </h2><p>  Each city has a museum that is definitely worth a visit.  Syracuse (Sicily), whose sights are mainly ancient objects, also have one.  And his name is the Palazzo Bellomo Museum.  It is located on the island of Ortigia.  The institution was opened in the late 40s of the last century, but only after 30 years it was finally staffed.  Today, among the museum exhibits can be called the sarcophagi of Giovanni Cabastida and Giovanni Cardenas.  The Palazzo Bellomo looks like a magnificent palace, which was built in the XIII-XIV centuries.  The building has a long history, and it was turned into a museum only in the middle of the last century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in syracuse" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/557804.jpg" width="404"></div>

    <h2>  A few words of farewell </h2><p>  Syracuse (attractions in particular) will leave a lasting impression on every traveler.  And let this city today be very small (its population is approximately 120 thousand people), but it is simply crowded with various archaeological and cultural sites.  All of them became witnesses of this or that era.  And today, these prominent places tell each person the story of their lives, making the soul tremble and the heart beat violently. </p>
