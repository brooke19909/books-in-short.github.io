It was used by our ancestors back in the Middle Ages.  In structure, it looks like plasticine, its properties are unique: it does not stick to the hands, it is very sticky in the craft, you can work with it for a long time before it begins to harden.  Both adults and children loved him, and they turned out to be real works of art. </p><h2>  Make the dough </h2><p>  Often, salt dough was used to make toys.  One such example would be a goat made from salt dough.  How to make it?  Now we will tell. </p>

    <p>  Before you start sculpting, you need to cook the dough itself.  Over the long life of this technology, several recipes have been invented.  When performing the figurine together with the baby, it is better to use the classic version, which includes only flour, water and salt (a glass of flour, half a glass of salt, water - as much as necessary). </p><h2>  Make a goat </h2><p>  So, for work, prepare the dough, water and a brush.  Modeling goats will take place in several stages.  At the first stage, the dough is rolled out, depending on whether a flat or three-dimensional figure should turn out. </p><p>  If there is no skill, it is better to start with the first option.  When the dough is rolled out, we make small details from it according to the drawing, and then larger ones.  Leave them to dry for about fifteen minutes.  At the next stage, the details are very carefully combined into one.  If there are irregularities, we correct them with a brush dipped in water.  Dry the finished figure.  It will take about a day.  And at the last stage, the figures are glossed and painted.  That's all, the goat from salt dough is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from salt goat dough" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1009008.jpg" width="521"></div></h2><h2>  Another goat option </h2><p>  If you have the skill to work with such a floury consistency, then you can try to make more complex <span>crafts from salt dough.</span>  A goat decorated with twine wool can be a wonderful souvenir for a friend or an exclusive fridge magnet. </p><p>  So, let's prepare salt dough, thermal gun, stack, paints, twine.  We form the head.  Make a smile with the help of stacks.  Add ears, sculpt horns, make small cuts on them with a stack.  From the dough, we roll up small circles (these will be the eyes), attach them to the place and mark the pupils with a pencil.  To the head we add a neck with a strap and a bell.  Now you need to make the body, on it - the tail.  The legs will be made of twine attached to the body, on the tip - the hoof.  There is a blank.  Now we dry it and then proceed to the finish. </p><p>  We color how much anyone has enough imagination.  It remains to make wool.  To do this, cut the twine into small pieces and start gluing it from the bottom up to the body.  Everything, the goat from salt dough is ready.  She can decorate a Christmas tree, a refrigerator, successfully fit into a panel in the kitchen. </p><h2>  Lamb </h2>

    <p>  And how else to make a sheep?  Now we will tell.  We use dough, brush, foil, paints, toothpick, ribbon, glue.  Roll out the finished dough to 5 mm thickness.  Part of it goes to the body.  From the remaining dough, cut the strips and wrap them in spirals.  Moisten the base of the body with a brush and use a toothpick to put ‚Äúwool‚Äù on it.  We will make the missing parts from the rest of the dough: paws, head, ears. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Using a brush dipped in water, glue it all to the body.  Transfer to a baking sheet and bake (2 hours at a temperature of 80 degrees), raising his head with paper.  The legs are baked separately, because they will be attached to the body with a braid on glue.  We decorate the cooled figure at our discretion. </p><h2>  Goat </h2><p>  And here is another souvenir goat made from salt dough.  It can be a wonderful gift, and even the time spent on its manufacture will help to develop creative abilities.  Having made the basis for this goat, you can decorate it in different ways, and you will get several options for a souvenir. </p><p>  So, from the rolled dough we cut the torso and form the head of a goat, decorate the torso with a pattern (flowers, hearts, stars), which can be applied in any way (with a pen, a lace napkin), add horns, ears, cut out the nose, outline eyes.  We make hooves, make holes with a toothpick on the hoof and on the body, so that you can then attach it.  Further options are possible: to dry or bake in the oven.  In the second case, our souvenirs will acquire a pleasant golden hue.  It remains to colorize and add some bright elements (bow, flower, scarf, bell).  That's all.  The souvenir is ready. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goat salty dough sheep" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1009009.jpg" width="315"></div></h2><h2>  Fast craftsmanship </h2><p>  If there is no time for painstaking work on the craft, in this case a goat, a sheep from salt dough, performed according to simplified technology, can help out.  To do this, take a piece of dough, divide it into three parts: one goes on the body, the other on the head, from the third we make horns, ears, a tail and legs (we will attach them to the string).  We lay out all the details on cardboard and dry.  When dry, with nail polish we will decorate the hooves and horns.  Everything, the craft is ready. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to make a goat, a <span>sheep from salt dough.</span>  Having mastered the basic techniques of work on the manufacture of such products, you can create real masterpieces. </p>
