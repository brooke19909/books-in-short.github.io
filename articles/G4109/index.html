Its name translates as "dam, dam on the Amstel River."  This pearl of Northern Europe is often called Northern Venice.  The city with amazing architecture, hundreds of canals and bridges is fascinating at first sight. </p><p>  In Amsterdam, no one will be bored - lovers of excursion and educational vacations will be able to visit numerous museums and exhibitions, explore the sights of the old city, will delight Amsterdam and lovers of parties and noisy entertainments, and culinary gourmets will certainly be interested in national cuisine - numerous restaurants and cafes will offer them delicious dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.al-rahhala.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam landmarks" class="if uuid-2624591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2624591.jpg"></div><p>  We hope that a little acquaintance with the city, which we will present in this material, will help everyone who intends to visit the capital of the Netherlands, but does not yet know where to go in Amsterdam and what to see there first of all. </p><h2>  Where is the city located? </h2><p>  Amsterdam is located in the northwest of the country, in the province of North Holland.  It is located at the mouth of the Amstel River, adjacent to the provinces of Utrecht and Flevoland. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.3702157" data-lng="4.895167899999933" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/6/0/6/5606.png"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  We invite you to briefly familiarize yourself with the history of the city.  Perhaps this will help you choose those places from the abundance of Amsterdam attractions that you should definitely go to, even if you are limited in time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the XIII century, a small fishing village appeared near the dam on the Amstel River, and after a little less than half a century (1342) it received the status of a city.  By the 15th century, Amsterdam became a major trading city of the country, which was included in the Hanseatic League. </p><p>  During this period, Amsterdam began to expand rapidly, defensive ring channels appeared.  City buildings were built on the foundations of long wooden pillars.  The city became vulnerable to fires due to the use of wood, even despite numerous canals.  The strongest fire in the city in the middle of the 15th century destroyed most of Amsterdam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the city" class="if uuid-2624580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2624580.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the XVI century, the Spaniards captured the main Dutch <span>port of Antwerp.</span>  The population of the city increased, and by the 17th century Amsterdam became one of the largest cities in Europe along with Paris, London and Naples.  Then he practically stopped expanding.  Already in the XVIII century, its population decreased markedly. </p><p>  A new round of city development began with the onset of the industrial revolution.  By 1900, Amsterdam was inhabited by 500 thousand inhabitants.  During the war years (1941-1945) the city was not too damaged.  Bombing damaged only its northern areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sights of Amsterdam: where to go and what to see? </h2><p>  Despite its not too large size, Amsterdam in terms of the number of interesting places can compete with the largest cities in Europe.  Magnificent architectural monuments, picturesque canals and an indescribable atmosphere make it truly unique.  The city is fraught with many intriguing surprises and unique attractions.  They can be examined independently, or you can become a member of the tour accompanied by a guide. </p><p>  Quite often, time-limited tourists are interested in: ‚ÄúWhere to go in Amsterdam in one day?‚Äù  For such a short period, you, of course, do not recognize the city and do not appreciate its charm, but in this case we also recommend to visit: </p><ol><li>  Dam Square. </li><li>  State Museum. </li><li>  Canals of Amsterdam. </li><li>  Meyderslot Castle. </li><li>  Church Oudekerk. </li><li>  Vondelpark. </li><li>  Zoo "Artis". </li><li>  Public library. </li></ol><p>  This is only a small part of the interesting places in Amsterdam, where experienced tourists advise everyone who visits the city for the first time and whose visit time is limited to go. </p><h2>  Dam Square </h2><p>  The central square of the capital of the Netherlands, which is located on a dam of the XIII century.  A third of the country's area is below sea level.  For the construction of residential buildings, entire streets, laying communications, the Dutch had to build dams and drive piles into fragile soil. </p><p>  The name "Dam" is translated as "dam".  Today, the square is the commercial center of Amsterdam.  The stock exchange worked here for quite some time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mnque.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dam Square" class="if uuid-2624604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2624604.jpg"></div><h2>  State Museum </h2><p>  Question: ‚ÄúWhere do lovers of ancient art go in Amsterdam?‚Äù  never faces city guests.  There are many museums, expositions of which can amaze even experienced travelers. </p><p>  The State Museum, located in the city center, presents a unique selection of paintings by Dutch masters of different times (from <span>Frans Hals</span> to Jan Vermeer).

Jewish families were hiding from the Nazis in this house.  This is a kind of memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, and it is gratifying that today it is one of the most visited attractions of Amsterdam. </p><p>  As a museum, he began working in 1960.  Visitors are presented the original diary of Anne Frank and items that tell about her such a short life. </p><h2>  Amsterdam canals </h2><p>  Many tourists who have visited Amsterdam admit that it was the cruise through the canals of the city that left them with the most vivid impression.  Excursions do not last long - no more than one and a half hours.  Some guests from such a trip begin acquaintance with the capital of the country, for others it becomes a vivid and memorable chord of travel.  Almost two hundred boats and small ships ply the city‚Äôs canals. </p><p>  By the way, everyone who is interested in where to go in Amsterdam in the evening, we recommend considering this option.  Here you can book a romantic trip with dinner or a thematic tour, for example, to places that are associated with the name of Van Gogh. </p><p>  Within the city, the length of the canals is about 75 km.  As early as the middle of the 15th century, the first channel was excavated as an urban moat.  Today it is one of the main channels of Amsterdam - Singel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nodestinations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam canals" class="if uuid-2625007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2625007.jpg"></div><h2>  Public library </h2><p>  And now we offer to get acquainted with another attraction of Amsterdam, where many literature lovers from all over the world dream of going.  The construction of a unique complex cost the state treasury 80 million euros.  The author of the grandiose project was the former Dutch state architect Jo Kunen.

In the Middle Ages it was used as a customs house, not a fortress, so it was never besieged.  Here you will be told the legend of the ghost of Count Floris V, one of the former owners of the castle. </p><p>  They say that until now the ghost wanders through the dark corridors and basements of the castle, not knowing peace.  The count was betrayed and killed by his vassals. </p><h2>  Church of st.  Nikolay </h2><p>  Where can I go in Amsterdam to lovers of the greatness and beauty of religious buildings?  Recommended - St.  Nicholas!  The townspeople are especially fond of it, since St. Nicholas is the patron saint of Amsterdam.  She is considered truly afflicted.  During the Reformation, there was no question of building new Catholic churches - even the old ones were banned.  Church of st.  Nicholas, who began to build in 1884, testified to the mitigation of the persecution of the Catholic faith. </p><p>  It turned out to be surprisingly beautiful and embodied two main styles - Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque.  Crowning the facade are two tall towers, a bas-relief depicting the Savior, surrounded by disciples, a sculpture of St.  Nicholas - all this makes a huge impression. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of st.
