She has two tributaries - Western and Eastern.  Where does the Dagomys go?  In the Black Sea, on the coast of which the resort of Sochi is located, from which the river is very close.  The bridge runs along the river, which was built over a hundred years ago.  In addition, the shores of East as well as West Dagomys are connected. </p><h2>  West Dagomys River </h2><p>  This is a river in the mountains, which is the right <span>tributary of the Kuban River</span> (Dagomys).  Near the middle course, a few kilometers from the village of the same name, is the territory of the canyon "Trough".  The waters of Western Dagomys pass through a microdistrict with a similar name in the city of Sochi.  At the moment, work is underway to strengthen the river bank, in order to build houses on the coast in the future.  In addition, several bridges were built across the river.  The length of the Western Dagomys is more than 21 kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The Kuban River of the Lazarevsky District in Greater Sochi is located near the village of Dagomys.  It is located on the <span>Black Sea coast,</span> where there are also gentle mountains, on the slope of which there is woodland, many gardens, vineyards and even tea plantations.  Dagomys is considered to be a resort in this region, which is among the most popular. </p><p>  In the second half of the XIX century, this land passed to the family possessions of the tsar and the Romanov family as a whole.  After that, in this area, about ten hectares were planted with garden trees, among which were the most exotic at that time.  The center of the park area is known for palace buildings.  After 1917, the Soviet authorities seventeen years later, the gardens were transferred to the local fruit farm.  In the subtropical park, which is located on the slopes of the peak of the Armenian, there is a rich collection of flowers, shrubs and trees.  The area in which the Dagomys River flows, for the first time in Russia, was also planted with tea.  Today, the famous Krasnodar variety is growing in this area. </p>

    <h2>  Tourist routes </h2><p>  This is not just a number of excellent resorts on the Caucasian Black Sea coast, but thanks to high trails, picturesque rivers and bubbling waterfalls, it is also a place known throughout the country for lovers of outdoor activities.  First of all, it is mountain and water tourism.  From these places there are a large number of paths that will lead the traveler to the picturesque gorges of the rivers of Western and Eastern Dagomys.  Buses go to this area, and you can simply get there by car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  East Dagomys River: Tourism </h2><p>  What to do for a traveler in this region?  According to reviews, the most useful and pleasant moment that the river Dagomys (Vostochny) offers is not even water tourism or picturesque landscapes, but the water itself.  There is evidence that it has a spring origin.  In addition, if you follow the river, you can see that <span>fontanelles flow into</span> it <span>,</span> which hit from a rocky cleft.  It is completely uncomplicated to consider a site in which river water is saturated with minerals of underground origin.  There, the stones appear something like a touch of red or burgundy.  Since ancient times, the inhabitants of the Caucasus loved to tell legends about such places.  For example, that these red-burgundy stones are sacred and that the blood of a god or a great national hero was shed in these areas, after which healing power appears near the water. </p>

    <p>  The Dagomys River (East tributary) has backwaters, and there are quite a lot of them, as tourists and locals say, and they are quite deep.  The channel also has a large number of crevices, as it flows along mountain faults. </p><p>  If you want to go for a walk along it, you need to take shoes for this purpose, which is made of fabric (but always dense) material, and will also fit snugly to your feet.  This may seem like an extra measure to you, but walking along the riverbed will be much more convenient and safe with bare feet.  In this situation, you will not constantly look down so as not to step on anything. </p><p>  If you go up the river, then sooner or later you will go to the site where the eastern tributary of the river merges with Western Bezumenka.  You can go to one and the other, as there are several high and very beautiful waterfalls.  The one located on Bezumenka often stays dry in the summer, but even in such circumstances, you can look at the views of the canyon that you will not forget for a long time after the trip.  A number of waterfalls of the East Dagomys river are commonly called Samshitov.  This is not just a random name.  In fact, Boxwood waterfalls are located where there is a heavy canopy of ancient boxwood forests. </p>

    <h2>  Trough Canyon </h2><p>  The western tributary of Dagomys (located on the territory of the Lazarevsky district in the city of Sochi) has a famous canyon, which is commonly called the "Trough".  Here, on the river, at a short distance from the village you can find a pointer to this magnificent natural monument.  The rock is eroded by layers due to the water flow, therefore a large number of depressions appears in the bottom.  Due to the fact that these ridges and ledges resemble a trough, they got this name here. </p><p>  If you walk along the river, then you will have the opportunity to enjoy not only beautiful natural views of the river, but also the majestic Colchis forest, which is nearby.  There are many rare plants that are protected by the Red Book. </p>

    <h2>  Baranovsky troughs </h2><p>  The Dagomys River is one of the attractions of this resort region.  It is necessary to look at the surroundings of not only the western, but also the eastern tributary.  Your vacation will not be complete if you at least once do not have something like a picnic or a barbecue trip in this area, in the Caucasus.  The site, which is ideal for this purpose, is the so-called "Baranovsky trough" (the name of the village near the canyon).  Here both locals and tourists gather who want to take a break from city noise surrounded by nature - forests and birds to the sounds of water.  Evergreen boxwoods and other trees grow near mossy rocks.  You can also swim here, especially true in the hot season (summer-spring). </p>
