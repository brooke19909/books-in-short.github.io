  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a scientific theory?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Scientific theory is the highest form of the formation of <span>scientific knowledge.</span>  This higher form gives a holistic view of the essential relationships and patterns of a particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãreality being studied. </p><p>  Scientific theory is represented by a system of statements that are logically interconnected.  The building of knowledge in it is carried out using an evidence-based mechanism.  Scientific theory embodies a specific research program, which ensures its integrity, presenting it as a single system containing knowledge.  The methodological point of view provides that this system should strive to maximally adequately and fully describe, derive provisions, while maintaining integrity and internal consistency. </p><p>  Scientific theory includes a number of components.  These include, in particular, the empirical basis (facts obtained as a result of the experiment), the theoretical basis (laws and postulates used in the description of idealized objects).  In addition, the system is composed of logic (principles and rules of proof and logical inference), as well as a set of results and statements. </p><p>  Scientific theories have a different nature of the tasks being solved.  The methods of construction and the types of realized processes are also different.  Along with these different forms of idealization and types of idealized objects correspond different types of scientific theories.  In this regard, there is a certain classification of systems, according to which scientific theories are divided into deductive, descriptive and mathematical. </p><p>  Descriptive (empirical) systems include, for example, the <span>evolutionary theory</span> put forward by Darwin, Pavlov's physiological system.  Linguistic theories in their traditional sense, a large part of modern theories of psychology and others, are also included in this category.  In accordance with numerous experimental data, these knowledge systems describe a specific group of phenomena and objects.  This allows us to derive general laws that form the basis of the theory.  As a rule, descriptive systems are formulated in a simple natural language using special terminology from the corresponding field of knowledge. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mathematical theories are distinguished by the active involvement of the mathematical apparatus and <span>model.</span>  <span>The model</span> is a construction of an ideal object, which replaces and represents some specific real object.  This type of theories includes mathematical linguistics, genetics, theoretical physics. </p><p>  The third type is deductive systems.  The need for their construction appeared in connection with the arisen problems of mathematical justification.  The "First Principles" of Euclid are referred to the first deductive theory.  They are built on the basis of the axiomatic principle.  These scientific theories are compiled in several stages.  First, the initial, initial basis is formulated.  Then statements are created that are supposed to be obtained from this framework.  The logical tools used in deductive theories are strictly fixed, while the evidence is built on the basis of these tools.  Such systems use a special formalized language. </p><p>  A scientific concept is created in accordance with certain requirements.  Must be present the adequacy of the described object, the completeness of the description of the investigated sphere of reality.  An essential condition is the interconnection of different components, compliance with the experience. </p><p>  Using <span>methods of scientific</span> analysis, scientists not only create descriptions of objects in the corresponding <span>subject area,</span> but also explain their functions, structure, composition, genesis. </p><p>  In relation to any system, certain justification procedures may be applied (falsification, verification, etc.).  As a rule, they are associated with criticism of the <span>theoretical basis.</span> </p>
