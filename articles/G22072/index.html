  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting gloves - a great activity in your free time</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Gloves are a necessary piece of clothing that not only protects against wind and cold, but also carries decorative functions.  The main difference between gloves and mittens is that all fingers are tied in them.  Their length can be any and depends on their purpose. </p><p>  <span>Knitting gloves with</span> needles is made round.  For this, 5 needles are required.  Below is a very simple way to create a product that is perfect for beginners.  If you want to make a do-it-yourself gift for a man, woman or child, then gloves are suitable for this, as well as possible. </p><p>  It‚Äôs easier to start knitting gloves with threads of the same color.  At the first stage, you need to determine how many loops will be required to create the product.  To do this, measure the circumference of the hand, not taking into account the size <span>of the thumb.</span>  Then you need to knit several rows of the sample, gaining 20 loops.  Thus, the density of knitting is determined, and the number of loops per one centimeter of the web is calculated by dividing the number 20 by the resulting length of the sample.  The result should be multiplied by measuring the circumference of the hand - this will be the number of loops required for the job.  If a fractional number is obtained, then it is advisable to round it to the integer, so that it is divided into four without a remainder. <br>  Then the loops are distributed equally into four knitting needles. </p><p>  Knitting gloves with knitting needles can be done with a hem, with a cuff or with a thickened set.  Having made the canvas to the beginning of the palm, you need to tie out a place for the thumb.  To do this, create a wedge, which is made for the left glove at the end of the fourth needle, for the right - at the beginning of the third. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The wedge is tied out gradually, adding air loops (crochets).  Adding is done in three circles.  The crochet must be done in the last stitch of the fourth knitting needle and before the first - third knitting needle, then knit one loop and again make on the crochet.  As a result, on both knitting needles it becomes more by 2 loops. </p><p>  The second increase will be made for the right glove as follows: in the 4th or 5th row of the beginning of the third needle, the yarn is made, then three facial, yarn.  For the left: at the end of the fourth knitting needle, the double crochet is knitted in front of the last 3 loops, then the three crochets and the crochet.  The additions are completed when the height of the wedge reaches the base of the thumb. </p><p>  Wedge loops must be assembled into two pins, and instead of them dial air loops, the number of which should be less than half.  Next, they knit one row, and on the next, they reduce the loops where they were typed on both sides.  Decrease is carried out of that moment until the initial number of loops remains on the knitting needles. </p><p>  If knitting <span>gloves without fingers is</span> done (min-fish), then the work will have to be done according to a different scheme. </p><p>  Then the gloves are knitted to the base of the little finger.  The loops for all fingers are divided into four parts.  If there is a residue, then it can be added to the back of the middle and index finger.  The loops on the little finger side are dropped onto a pin, and the rest are knitted two rows higher.  To make the middle finger feel free, a jumper is created, for this 4 crochets are added.  Then the loops for the <span>ring finger are</span> counted <span>,</span> to which 4 more yarn from the middle are added.  Make knitting with the help of three knitting needles before the start of the nail.  And after that, the decrease begins at the end of each spoke. </p><p>  The remaining three loops must be assembled on the needle and tightened from the wrong side.  In the described way, you should knit the index, middle fingers, as well as the little finger, not forgetting to add 4 air loops to create jumpers. </p><p>  At the final stage, knitting gloves is done and working out the thumb.  To do this, loops from pins are gathered in a circle and translated into two knitting needles, and with the help of the third, air loops are gathered along the edge of the upper edge of the product.  This is where the work ends. </p><p>  The pattern of knitting gloves-mittens will differ from the previous one in that only the thumb and forefinger do. </p>
