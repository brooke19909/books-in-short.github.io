Moreover, according to some criteria, their products confidently hold leadership.  But this applies primarily to premium models and partly to the middle class.  For several years, the budget segment has been left without due attention of the company, although there are some steps in this direction.  Great expectations of fans of this niche associated with the device <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> J1 Mini SM j105h.  Reviews of a considerable part of users indicate that the creators managed to cope with the basic tasks, although some successes do not compensate for the model‚Äôs price tag of 4.5-5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Smartphone Overview </h2><p>  The device is positioned as a cheap compact smartphone that continues the J1 series.  This model has not received anything fundamentally new, and even by the standards of its budget segment it looks quite average.  This is due to the fact that the niche itself has long faded into the background, which inevitably affected the interest of manufacturers themselves.  The only thing that attracts this device against the background of other offers is the brand name.  At the same time, there were few branded solutions in the filling.  For example, if the classic representative of compact smartphones J1 wins the competition due to the SuperAmoled screen, then in this case even point glimpses of originality and technological superiority are not observed.  Despite this, a certain backlog in quality is nevertheless provided to the device Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini j105h.  A review of the model, its technical data and user reviews will help to understand in more detail the consumer value of the new product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The device largely duplicates the solutions used, offering a slightly different, more compact form factor.  This development should not be compared with the trends in the production of modern smartphones, since it is noticeably behind.  However, conservative users may be interested in the balanced technical basis of the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini j105h, the characteristics of which are presented below: </p><ul><li>  OS platform - Android 5.1. </li><li>  The display size is 4 inches. </li><li>  Screen format - TFT 480 x 800. </li><li>  The processor is a quad-core Spreadtrum at 1.2 GHz. </li><li>  Camera - with a 5-megapixel VGA matrix. </li><li>  RAM - 750 MB. </li><li>  Built-in memory - 8 GB with the possibility of increasing the volume due to the card up to 128 GB. </li><li>  Battery - a lithium-ion cell with a capacity of 1500 mAh. </li><li>  The safety rating for the SAR system is 0.806. </li><li>  Dimensions of the smartphone - 121 x 63 x 10 mm. </li><li>  Mass - 123 g. </li></ul><h2>  Design Reviews </h2><p>  Perhaps design and assembly are the strongest points of this unit.  According to users, the developers managed to implement a reliable case without backlashes and creaks.  Although there are claims to the quality of the plastic itself, but this is already a given budget class as such.  The style in which the smartphone is made is generally similar to the general concept of the line.  The owners note the laconicism and external sophistication, which slightly distinguishes the device from the vast gamut of state employees of this level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As for color, the model received several options.  In addition to the basic shades characteristic of other members of the family, the <span>Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini</span> j105h Black appeared, reviews of which note originality and even a hint of presentability.  There is also one feature of the form factor of this model, which causes conflicting responses.  The fact is that the smartphone turned out to be thicker than usual.  From the point of view of ergonomics, this nuance can be considered a plus, although modern manufacturers have long relied on thin cases.  In this style, for example, the basic modification of the J1 smartphone was made, which also received a larger screen. </p><h2>  Camera Reviews </h2><p>  The VGA matrix, which is also a relic of the past in the context of modern trends, eloquently testifies to the quality of shooting.  Users also note the modesty of functionality - the lack of autofocus leads to the fact that the already not impressive 5 megapixel resolution makes the pictures blurry.  However, there are many positive feedback from landscape photo shooters.  In terms of video also special effects should not be expected.  In any case, to obtain more or less high-quality materials, you will have to experiment with light and shooting angles.  This also applies to the front camera, which is also provided with the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini j105h smartphone.  Reviews about this module are more critical.  Many owners draw parallels with models that came out several years ago.  Again, there is no question of any occurrence of the cameras of the device in modern trends. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Battery Features Reviews </h2><p>  In addition to the price tag, budget smartphones are traditionally attracted by relatively high energy saving.  The battery in this model was used very modest - at 1500 mAh, but it is clear that the developers have thought up this nuance of operation.  Users note that the device is able to provide full-fledged performance with an average load of resources of two days.  This is a worthy indicator even against the background of the possibilities of economy-class models.  However, such a result was achieved due to the performance limitations of the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini j105h.  Testimonials also indicate the flexibility of energy-saving management, which is really useful in practice.  The device provides a mode of economical energy consumption, in which all functions are disabled, except for the basic ones. </p><h2>  Feedback on communication options </h2><p>  Systems for communication support are also far from the requirements of a modern user, but the basic modules work very well.  So, the owners indicate the stability of signal reception in 2G and 3G networks.  To work in them, there are two departments for micro-SIM cards.  There are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensors, which allows you to use the gadget as a pocket access point to the network.  Two navigation systems of the <span>Samsung Galaxy J1</span> Mini j105h are also noted - reviews about the GPS and GLONASS functions are often positive, although there are problems in places difficult to communicate.  For those who may not have enough proximity sensors, experienced users recommend using special software that locks the screen at the time of the call.  That is, the display remains active when a signal arrives.  Double-tap allows you to instantly unlock the screen during a conversation. </p>

    <h2>  Performance Reviews </h2><p>  The device has a quad-core Spreadtrum processor modification SC8830.  For graphic processing capabilities, the Mali-400 MP2 system is responsible.  According to users, this combination provides confident work with the interface, as well as with most applications.  In any case, gross delays are not observed.  The smartphone allows you to run even modern 3D-games, but there is already another drawback of the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini j105h.  Reviews complain about the small screen sizes, which do not have the best effect on the comfort of work with multimedia files.  Nevertheless, demanding games go almost without delay, although this may require manipulation of the graphics settings.  As for the Lollipop operating system, it was cleaned of unnecessary elements.  Optimization was successful, saving users from overloading the device‚Äôs capacities. </p><h2>  Sound Reviews </h2><p>  Regarding the work of the sound speaker, there are also few negative reviews.  The hole for the module is located on the back near the camera.  According to the owners, the volume margin is enough to make the call heard even in noisy places.  The sound quality does not cause any special complaints, although the device is also difficult to call a reference for this indicator.  This is evidenced by flaws in the work of the earpiece <span>Samsung Galaxy J1</span> Mini j105h.  Reviews, for example, note certain distortions that are not characteristic of other representatives of the series. </p>

    <h2>  Who is the model for? </h2><p>  This device is hardly suitable for an advanced and demanding user.  Moreover, not every fan of budget decisions can be advised this modification, since there are many options on the market with wider functionality, shooting quality and other features.  Nevertheless, there are factors that point precisely to the stylish performance of the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini j105h White.  Reviews emphasize, first of all, its elegant appearance, as well as the stability of the basic functions, for which you can forgive the rest of the shortcomings.  For example, the device is more than worthy of itself in the hands of those who use instant messengers.  Do not neglect the compactness of the device, which led to a relatively long maintenance.  In other words, the model turned out to be modest, but practical.  Another thing is that these qualities hardly justify the price tag of 5 thousand rubles.  In the budget niche for this amount you can look for a productive and multi-functional smartphone from competitors. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Premium gadget manufacturers mainly adhere to a strategy for a balanced distribution of functions and new developments across all families of their products.  In this case, the developers fully respected this balance within their own line, but did not take into account the general situation in the segment for which the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini 2016 j105h was being prepared.  Reviews of many owners of this smartphone note that they made a choice mainly because of its belonging to the brand.  If you compare with the direct competitors of the device, you will find many parameters by which the Korean will lag behind.  Moreover, the model did not even receive the company's modern proprietary developments that could justify the purchase for the sake of the well-known name of the manufacturer. </p>

    <p>  On the other hand, there are no particular disappointments in the device either.  Owners initially accept its shortcomings, but otherwise there are simply no reasons for criticism.  The filling, although low-power, but fully implements the declared capabilities, is the same with the set of functions.  And this is not to mention the high-quality assembly, which can be written as a clear plus, even against the background of comparison with individual premium models. </p>
