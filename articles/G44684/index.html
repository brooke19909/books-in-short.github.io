In the south of this beautiful country you will find ancient cities with Gothic architectural diversity and originality.  Every corner of Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is filled with romanticism and modernism.  One of these cities is Kutna Hora, a place of silver mines with a long history. </p><p>  It is also called the Czech treasury.  One of the most visited places in the world.  It is always crowded, crowds of bewitched tourists with open mouths, accompanied by a guide with dashes, mix from one object to another.  In the Middle Ages Kutna Hora (Czech Republic) was considered the second capital of this beautiful country in terms of beauty and wealth, and was also the center of the silver industry. </p><p>  Today, the population has declined slightly and amounts to no more than 20,000.  The city has so far retained its original appearance.  Walking along the cobbled streets that once miners and kings used to walk around, you will feel the atmosphere of antiquity and unique charm.  Everything breathes history here. </p>

    <p>  Legend has it that a monastery was previously located on the site of the city.  One monk, while working, decided to take a break and dozed off.  Whether in a dream or in reality, he saw silver sprouts, hence the name Kutna Hora appeared.  In the Middle Ages, the city experienced a ‚Äúsilver rush‚Äù, its mines supplied almost a third of this metal to Europe.  This place was visited by real pirates and adventurers.  Thanks to silver, the city became very rich and significant.  With the proceeds, the Temple of St. Barbara was erected. </p><p>  Dormitories and schools were built for young people - completely free.  Many years have passed since that era, but this place still remains majestic and has universal value.  Today it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The whole earth is pitted with underground mines, where people from different parts of the globe flock.  In summer, interesting and informative excursions to these historical places are held. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Historic Sites &amp; Attractions: Kutna Hora </h2>

    <p>  The most creepy and at the same time bewitching is the Chapel of All Saints, or the Ossuary.  It is located in a picturesque place Siedlec - a kilometer from the station on the outskirts of the town.  The interior of the skeleton is truly awesome, made entirely of human bones.  According to reliable data, 40 thousand remains were used for these purposes.  Some refer to the chapel as a bone church.  Its construction dates back to the 14th century. </p><p>  The history of this facility is rather sad.  In 1421 there was a fire here, and the entire adjacent territory of the Siedletsky Monastery was badly damaged.  Until the 18th century, no one was engaged in its restoration.  In 1784 a wealthy family of Schwarzenberg bought the bones and decided to give the monastery a presentable appearance.  The reconstruction was carried out by a talented wood craftsman who turned the chapel into a real work of art. </p>

    <p>  It took a lot of time.  The main material was human remains, which the decorator first sanitized and then bleached with chlorinated slaked lime.  Under the influence of this solution, the bones became white.  Having studied the material and appreciated the beauty and smooth lines of the ribs, the miniature phalanx, he created the Schwarzenberg coat of arms.  It turned out unusual and infernal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also from the remains were made garlands, donors, candelabra and flowerpots.  He captured his autograph on the wall with the help of bones.  Strong emotions and experiences are caused by Kostnitsa.  Kutna Hora is proud of this creation and honors it.  The first impressions of tourists are very powerful, it seems that he found himself in an ominous place - with the Satanists or in the tomb.  There isn‚Äôt enough a guide in a black robe and lampshades fitted with human skin - everything else is available.  With surprise, visitors look at the immortal creation, imitating a Gothic monastery. </p><h2>  Sacred place </h2><p>  The main attraction and architectural monument of the city is the Cathedral of <span>St. Barbara</span> (Kutna Hora).  It is often compared to the church of St. Vitus.  The interior of the temple is decorated in the Baroque and Gothic style.  The walls of the cathedral are decorated with frescoes that depict mint workers and miners.  The last update was carried out in the 20th century.  The mesh vault, decorated with the arms of the guilds of artisans, attracts attention. </p>

Kutna Hora is a great opportunity to get acquainted with the traditions of local residents and enjoy a fascinating journey.  If you arrive here in early June, you will be taken to a theatrical costume show - Royal Silvering.  You will get the most positive, personally see the jousting tournaments and visit the fair. </p><p>  In the heat, head to Dvorce, a sports and leisure center consisting of a volleyball court, grass beach, tennis tables, a pool and much more.  Take a walk with the children along the mirrored corridor of the tower, similar to the Eiffel, which is located on the Petrshin Upland.  Show your child a spectacular changing of the guard ceremony and take a picture with the guardsman. </p><p>  Visit the museum of toys (free for children), which displays exhibits from different eras.  Another unforgettable place will be the zoo.  We do not recommend visiting <span>Prague in the winter,</span> as most museums, castles and cathedrals close.  In any case, the trip will give a firework of feelings and a lot of vivid impressions. </p>
