This question begins to worry many parents almost from the very birth of the baby.  The wrong choice will either make you spend extra money on fixing the error, or it will not bring joy and pleasure to the child.  Sometimes this can even affect the baby‚Äôs self-esteem.  So let's try to learn some rules that can help us in choosing a gadget. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone for baby" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/959031.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Age </h2><p>  Firstly, it is worth starting with the fact that smartphones now exist different.  And in their functionality, they are suitable for children of various ages.  Therefore, if you are thinking about which smartphone is best for a child, you will have to consider his age.  Maybe the phone is not needed yet. </p><p>  As a rule, now these gadgets are given to children almost from birth.  And this fact is not very pleasing - for kids there is a dependence on technology.  And with age, choosing a decent <span>smartphone for a child of</span> 7 years old, 10 and so on will be harder and harder.  In principle, the ideal age for the purchase of such equipment is 7 years, that is, just in time for the period when the baby goes to school.  Rather, now it is a necessity, not a desire.  Previously, a child is better off not buying a phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Inclinations </h2><p>  In addition to age, you will also have to take into account the personal characteristics of your baby.  It may seem to someone that this does not need to be done at all.  But in reality it turns out not so.  After all, the child's inclinations can cause <span>dependence on the gadget.</span>  And then you will have to study very tightly with study.  Do you really need problems with this? </p>

    <p>  If you want to understand what is the best way to buy a smartphone for a 7-year-old child, then try to give the baby an installation: the purchased equipment is needed in order to call and communicate with parents and relatives if necessary.  This is an important gadget, and for games it is unsuitable in the same way as for entertainment.  If you notice that by the age of 7 the child begins to depend on any gadgets, you will have to be strict and pay attention to the most primitive models.  It would be better for the first time not to buy a smartphone at all, but a regular button phone of absolutely any model.  For a while you will be spared the question of which smartphone is best for the child.  But still not for long. </p><h2>  The size </h2><p>  A pretty important point to buy is the size of the model.  To be honest, modern smartphones that are five times larger than the size of a hand are not particularly suitable for a child.  Such a technique will not be "living" for a long time, which means that it is better to refrain from such a purchase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth choosing a model based on the size of your child‚Äôs hands.  In principle, you can buy any smartphone with a diagonal of 3-4 inches.  This will be quite enough so that you can watch movies and make an urgent call.  True, often parents prefer to pamper their children with large, ‚Äúadult‚Äù smartphones.  And this is not entirely correct.  Pay your attention to the "Nokia <span>Lumiya 620".</span>  This is a very good model that will save you from thinking about which smartphone for a child of 10 years, for example, is most suitable. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The phone‚Äôs operating system also plays an important role.  From about six years old, a modern child is extremely versed in gadgets.  And that is why he is able to understand whether the operating system is suitable for certain games and other entertainments or not. </p>

    <p>  The most common scenario is, of course, a smartphone for a child based on Android.  This will help to avoid many problems with the installation and operation of some games and applications.  If you have a very young child, then you really have to give preference to ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  On this operating system, you can run an incredible number of games that are so interesting for kids.  But for an older age, you can offer a smartphone based on Windows Background.  Such models are distinguished by their versatility and utility.  True, there are not so many games for this system at the moment.  But perhaps this is for the better. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  A smartphone for a child of 10 years and older is needed not only for entertainment.  The thing is that students now use this gadget also for study.  And this factor is certainly worth considering.  Indeed, in the case of insufficient functionality of the smartphone, it simply loses its relevance.  You will have to either give your child your phone, or buy him a new, more advanced and multi-functional. </p><p>  The best smartphones for schoolchildren must have a calculator, an alarm clock, Internet access (preferably with a Wi-Fi connection), as well as the ability to transfer data via Bluetooth.  This is what will help the student in the classroom.  In addition, a good smartphone must now have a camera.  And the better it is, the more universal the model is considered.  What kind of smartphone is there to choose?  To solve this issue is very difficult.  After all, almost every modern gadget surpasses its analogues in something.  So we‚Äôll have to take into account a few more important points that can help us decide. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The price tag is another important point.  It is he who often does not allow you to quickly <span>choose a smartphone phone</span> for a child, especially if parents have difficulties with the budget.  The price should always be considered.  Sometimes you just overpay for a big name or brand.  And with all this, the quality of the device will not necessarily please you. </p><p>  <span>A cheap smartphone</span> for a child, if it also looks awful, is a huge shame.  Most likely, in the school on this score there will be jokes and harsh phrases addressed to your baby.  And this behavior can give rise to aggression from the child.  If you want to buy an inexpensive smartphone, then keep in mind: a normal phone costs from 4,000 rubles.  And with all this, sometimes the quality of such devices is more than good. </p>

    <p>  Do not spend too much and buy your child expensive gadgets, especially at a young age.  So limit yourself to some Samsung or Nokia.  You can forget about iPhones.  Now even adults often refuse such gadget models. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  If you decide to buy an inexpensive smartphone for a child, then try to make sure that it looks stylish.  As already noted, the design can put your baby in an awkward position in front of peers.  And to explain that the family does not have money or the opportunity to purchase an expensive gadget is useless. </p><p>  In general, it is best to give preference to smartphones, which come with interchangeable panels.  As a rule, they are colorful, vibrant and beautiful.  This is just what is so interesting to children.  With age, of course, your child will begin to buy his own original panels for the phone.  And this is normal.  For a teenager, any smartphone is suitable for design (of course, taking into account its color preferences) with a donated original panel, for example with a photograph or print. </p><p>  The most common design options are classic black or white.  If you want to buy a smartphone for a child with brighter colors, then you should pay attention to Nokia Lumiya, especially the 620 model. Here you can find many colors: from the usual black to acid yellow or acid purple.  An original approach that many students will appreciate. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the phone's memory.  The thing is that modern children are very fond of playing games.  And they usually require a lot of space.  Which smartphone is best for a child in this regard? </p>

    <p>  It would be ideal to purchase a phone with an internal memory of approximately 16 GB, as well as the ability to insert an additional memory card.  At the same time, consider the inclinations of your child and his character.  If the baby has the rudiments of dependence on technology, then you can purchase the <span>Nokia 5800</span> Express Music.  Although this is already an outdated model, it has 8 GB of memory, the Symbian operating system, and there is also a good player.  Such a phone looks stylish, almost does not get damaged in the fall, and also does not allow you to install many games that constantly distract the kid from school. </p><p>  But if your child has no dependence, then you can pay attention to the Sony Expiry Aion or Samsung Galaxy Es.  These smartphones are now very popular among children and adults.  Just what a modern user needs so much.  There is a lot of memory, and a lot of opportunities. </p><h2>  Internet access and special programs </h2><p>  The Internet is the place where a child (and an adult, too) is able to disappear for a long time.  We can say that this is a very dangerous space, especially for a preschool child or a student in elementary school.  In truth, Internet access and specialized programs that need the World Wide Web are another thing to consider. </p>

    <p>  If you have a very small child, it would be better to buy, as already mentioned, a push-button telephone.  And at the same time make sure that there is no Internet access.  Specialized applications are also affected.  But a middle school student can already buy a smartphone with free Internet access.  But at the same time try to get rid of special programs, for example, for quick access to YouTube or social networks.  After all, this may affect the student's academic performance. </p><h2>  Quality </h2><p>  Also worth paying attention to such a factor as the overall quality of the smartphone.  After all, it is it that is capable of playing a cruel joke with you.  An adult child is able to carefully handle the equipment, but the baby is unlikely.  And therefore, it is important that the smartphone for the child is of high quality. </p><p>  What exactly is it about?  In a simple way, this is called the word "unkillable."  That is, something like "does not sink in water, does not burn in fire."  Try to choose such a smartphone so that when it falls, it does not crash, and if it gets wet, it can work for some time.  And here Nokia or HTC fits well.  This applies to any models.  Just what modern gadget users need. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So we figured out with you the problem of choosing a modern phone for kids.  The best smartphones for children should not be an obstacle to their development.  So try to take into account all these factors in order to make the right choice. </p>
