A lot of films are devoted to him, a unique collection of books has been written about him.  Poets dedicate their poems to this unique corner, musicians - songs, and artists find inspiration here.  The beauty of the place can be estimated from the photo. </p><h2>  Preserve "Pillars" </h2><p>  Countless destinies are associated with this unique corner of nature.  The Pillars Nature Reserve contains many interesting stories.  An amazing movement of columnists was born here.  This society has its own traditions and folklore.  An entire generation of great climbers and climbers has been brought up here, as well as a beautiful living corner - "The refuge of Dr. Aibolit." </p><p>  The <span>Pillars</span> Nature Reserve <span>(Krasnoyarsk)</span> is known all over the world.  This corner of nature can rightly be called the pride of the region.  It was founded in 1925 to protect the rocky tract Pillars, which is incredibly beautiful and picturesque.  In the middle of the taiga belligerent cliffs rise, representing the granite-syenite remains of pinkish-brown color.  The height of some of them reaches 100 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature reserve pillars" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448090.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Famous visitors </h2><p>  In the years 1720-1727, the "Pillars" Reserve in Krasnoyarsk was visited by the famous physician and botanist Daniil Gottlieb Messerschmidt.  During seven years of research in Siberia, he visited the area three times.  Also, the explorer <span>Vitus Bering</span> (1733-1734) and the naturalist expedition participant Johann Georg Gmelin (academician) and his assistant Krasheninnikov (Kamchatsky) Stepan Petrovich came to the Pillars Preserve in 1735.  From 1771 to 1773, the Pillas State Reserve was visited by one of the largest explorers of Siberia, Pallas (professor of natural history).  He lived in the capital of the region for almost a year, working on monographs.  His works such as "Journey through the Provinces of the Russian Empire", "Russian-Asian Zoogeography" and "Description of the Plants of the Russian State" gained fame. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The thirties of the 19th century in Siberia were characterized as the times of the "gold rush".  On the territory of the reserve, a constant search for precious metal was carried out, after which this place was called "Roy Creek" (from the word "dig"). </p><p>  In 1833, the animals of the Pillars Reserve were recounted.  An inventory was compiled: 43 foxes, 67 sables and about a thousand skins of other fur-bearing animals.  In the 1970s and 80s, schoolchildren began to come to the Stolby Reserve (Krasnoyarsk) with excursions.  The head of such events was one of the teachers of the local gymnasium - I.T.  Savenkov.  He created a topographical sketch about all the environs of Krasnoyarsk.  This work has become a teaching tool for Siberian geologists.  And in 1886, Savenkov published a description of the geological structures of the localities of Krasnoyarsk.  By the end of the 1940s, 16 scientific papers were already ready.  In the same period, studies began to be carried out on the effects of atmospheric clogging, as well as the recreational use of taiga ecological systems. </p><p>  In 2000, a living corner became the main department at the Royev Ruchey Zoo in the Pillars Nature Reserve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reserve pillars Krasnoyarsk" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448091.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Geographic features </h2><p>  The mid-mountainous territory from the north-west to the southeast is crossed by an arc from the ranges - Listvyazhnoye, Central and Kadyisky.  The southernmost is the latter, its length is 11 km and its height is more than 700 meters.  Mana is the largest and most significant river of these places.  Its width in some places is 200 meters, the depth on the rifts is 40-60 cm, in the pits - up to 30 meters.  The average speed is about 5 km / h.  On the river there are about 10 bays and 20 islands, many of them were created artificially by rafting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The nature reserve "Pillars" is located in the temperate climatic zone.  The coldest month is January, the average temperature is -17.6 ° C.  In the hottest month, the air warms up to + 16.2 ° C.  For the entire time that the reserve exists, the absolute minimum is registered at -45 ° , the maximum - at + 31.5 ° . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillars reserve in Krasnoyarsk" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448092.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The reserve contains 150 species of plants that are subject to special protection.  Among them you can see a very rare two-flowered violet, as well as snow cinquefoil, spring minaret, Siberian patrinia, white-flowered geranium.  In addition, endemic species need protection - Yenisei anemone, Mongolian thyme, comb forget-me-not and many others. </p><p>  There are 56 species of various mammals in the Pillars Nature Reserve, most of them are inhabitants of the forest.  Of the large ungulates, deer are found more often than others.  They live in small families or in groups of 2 to 8 individuals.  In the mid-1970s, their numbers reached five hundred individuals.  Also in the reserve there are such large and medium-sized predators as <span>brown bears,</span> wolves, wolverines, foxes and badgers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="animals of the reserve pillars" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448093.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Cliffs </h2><p>  For millions of years, <span>frost and sun,</span> winds and heavy rains carved unusual shapes from stone.  Almost all the rocks have their own names - “Feathers”, “Lion Gate”, “Grandfather”, “Vulture”, “Big Golden Eagle”.  Names were also awarded to several individual stones and fragments.  Rocks can form groups or be solitary.  A single array usually has multiple vertices.  In the rocks themselves, passages leading to the peaks are laid.  There are also "tricks" - these are places that are impossible to pass without special skill. </p><h2>  Three areas most visited by tourists </h2><p>  <span>The cable car,</span> called the Beaver Log Fanpark, begins in the Bazaihi river valley, runs along the ski slope and ends at the very top of the ridge.  It offers stunning views of the entire reserve and the cliffs.  Nearby is the largest rock complex "Takmak". </p><p>  "Central Pillars" are located at a distance of 7 km from the outskirts of the reserve.  It is here that you can see unique cliffs.  The most famous passages to the tops of the cliffs also have their own names, for example, “Blue Coils” and “Chimney”.  Experienced people say that during the years of the revolution the Bolsheviks made the inscription "Freedom" on the largest and most massive pillar. </p><p>  <span>The China Wall</span> is located in the Bazaihi River Valley, at the very foot of Takmak.  In addition, the Ermak rock and a group of small rocks with the names "Toad", "Tsypa" and others are located in the indicated area. Several tracks for skiers are laid in the part of the reserve that adjoins the city.  The most popular are Beaver Log and Kashtak.  Those who love nature will be very interested to visit the "Dr. Aybolit Shelter".  Here are wounded animals.  After they recover, they are released back into the wild, into their natural habitat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillars Nature Reserve" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448094.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Famous trails </h2><p>  The most famous route is the circular.  It starts from the First Pillar and passes through several rocks.  In particular, on the way there are sections called "Granddaughter", "Feathers", "Grandfather", "Lion Gate", "Grandma".  The route runs through the 4th, 3rd, 2nd “Pillars”, and then again comes to the “Elephant” and the First Rock.  Once a month there is an opportunity to get to the reserve territory on a special additional bus. </p><h2>  Guest houses </h2><p>  In 2013, in the Pillars Reserve, the first structures on screw piles were built.  These guest houses were only three out of ten planned.  Initially, they were intended for employees of the Narym scientific and educational complex, stopping to study the flora and fauna of the reserve.  But now they can accommodate tourists (no more than six people).  Such a pleasure is worth almost 6 thousand rubles / day.  Over time, the number of guest houses increased, and in December 2013 two more specialized buildings for tourists with disabilities were built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo reserve pillars" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448095.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the Stolby reserve? </h2><p>  This unique place is located on the right side of the Yenisei.  Visitors can get there on the Laletinsky road.  The Pillars Nature Reserve is open daily; admission is free for visitors.  You can get from Krasnoyarsk by shuttle buses No. 19, 50, 78 to the stop "Turbaz" (Sverdlovsk district).  Then you should cross the road, go down a large cascade of wood onto a path that, in fact, leads to the reserve.  There are a lot of visitors on the weekend, you can just follow people.  But on working days there are few travel companions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillars State Reserve" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448096.jpg" width="550"></div>  Before the beginning of the reserve, go no more than two kilometers, then about 5 more - to the rocky area.  If you are afraid to get lost on the border of Laletino, it is best to purchase a landmark map, which is sold at a nearby kiosk.  Throughout the path, shields with diagrams are placed.  Also, oncoming tourists will help find the road among the many paths.  If you have a desire to climb the rocks, be prudent and careful, start with more accessible and simple areas.
