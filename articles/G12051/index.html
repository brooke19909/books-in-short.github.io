Description and location of the stadium</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many of its magnificent buildings and cultural institutions are famous for the capital of Russia - Moscow.  IC "Olympic" can rightfully be considered one of the main attractions of this metropolis.  Over the entire history of its existence, various world stars have been sold out in its famous walls.  And in 2009, the complex became famous all over the world, becoming the venue for a popular music contest called Eurovision.  In one year, more than three million viewers can visit it.  Over a similar time period, about two hundred spectacular events take place here. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In 1980, Moscow hosted the <span>Olympic Games</span> .  Olimpiysky Sports Complex was built on this occasion and opened on July 19 of the same year.  To this day, it is considered one of the largest structures in Europe.  The engineers who created the wonderful project of the complex were awarded the Lenin Prize. </p>

SC "Olympic" is exactly the place where their performances took place.
