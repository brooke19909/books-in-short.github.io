They became Job, who until then was the Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia.  During the period of his patriarchate there were many state crises. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  The future first Russian patriarch was born in 1525 in the town of Staritsa near Moscow.  In the world, his name was Ivan.  He came from posad people.  The boy went to study at the school, which belonged to the Staritsky Assumption Monastery. </p><p>  In the same place in 1556, Ivan took monastic tonsure, in which he received the name Job.  Archimandrite Herman directly influenced his decision to devote his life to the church.  Job became one of the most educated and prominent people in the Russian Orthodox Church.  His personal qualities allowed the monk to become a prominent person in his monastery. </p>

    <h2>  Under Ivan the Terrible </h2><p>  In the period from 1566 to 1571, the future first Russian patriarch was abbot of his native Staritsky Assumption Monastery.  Perhaps Job would have remained in this place for a long time if the lands near Moscow had not become part of the oprichnina according to the reforms of Ivan the Terrible.  So the abbot met the king.  Ivan Vasilievich made him rector of the monastery.  Job soon moved to Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the early 80s, the leader of the church was first bishop of Kolomensky and then archbishop of Rostov.  The first Russian patriarch, before becoming the main person of the church, traveled a lot around the country.  He also had a significant number of connections in the state environment.  In the last years of the <span>reign of Ivan the Terrible,</span> Job became close to Boris Godunov.  These relationships determined the fate of the archbishop. </p><h2>  Background of the emergence of the patriarchate </h2><p>  In 1584, Ivan the Terrible died.  On the throne was his son Fedor, who was distinguished by poor health and dependence on his brother-in-law Boris Godunov.  The approximate monarch began to restore his order in Moscow.  He cracked down on enemies and placed friends on important government posts.  Among them was the future first Russian Orthodox patriarch. </p><p>  In 1586, Boris Godunov helped Job to be elected Metropolitan of Moscow.  At that time it was the supreme dignity in the Russian Orthodox Church.  The metropolitan depended only on <span>the Patriarch of Constantinople,</span> who was then Jeremiah II. </p><p>  <span>The Russian Orthodox Church</span> since its inception was subordinate to the Greek hierarchs from the Byzantine Empire.  At first, the metropolitans were not even nee Slavs, but came from Constantinople.  However, in the 16th century the situation became completely different.  In 1453, Constantinople was captured by the Turks.  The world capital of Orthodoxy has become an Islamic city.  The Church of Constantinople lost its former influence, and its patriarch lived in exile. </p><p>  This could not but affect the mood in Moscow.  Ivan the Terrible became the first <span>Russian Tsar to</span> adopt such a title (in fact, he was equal to the imperial, that is, Byzantine).  But if Moscow politically emphasized its exaltation, then on the religious plane - not yet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Reform Organization </h2><p>  In 1586, Moscow authorities found a convenient excuse to finally organize the establishment of their own patriarchate.  At this time, the west of Russia was visited by Joachim.  It was the Patriarch of Antioch - the head of one of the eastern churches.  Joachim sent a letter to Moscow asking for permission to enter the Tsar‚Äôs capital.  This was the first time since the fall of Constantinople when the patriarch visited the Kremlin.  Moscow was delighted with the request.  Three embassies were waiting for Joachim along the way. </p><p>  The Patriarch of Antioch met with <span>Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich.</span>  Then the first agreements on the establishment of the Russian patriarchate took place.  To carry out the establishment process, Moscow needed to enlist the support of all the major eastern churches.  Joachim was the first patriarch on this list.  After he left Russia, immediate activities began to prepare for an important church reform. </p><h2>  The role of Godunov </h2><p>  The main initiator of the establishment of the patriarchate in Russia was, of course, Boris Godunov.  For him, this was an important step, not so much in the religious as in the political sense.  Since Fedor Ivanovich was on the throne, his brother-in-law has become the de facto ruler of the country.  However, he looked to the future, clearly dreaming of the throne.  Circumstances were on the side of Godunov.  Fedor and Irina (Boris‚Äôs sister) did not have children to whom the law could pass power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Godunov was the sole ruler.  It was important for him to control the entire state machine.  The church for him was an important political tool.  Therefore, the royal brother-in-law wanted to get a patriarch loyal to himself. </p><p>  Godunov immediately chose Job for this role.  There was a long trust relationship between them.  As time has shown, the first Russian Orthodox patriarch remained a faithful ally of Godunov even in the most difficult moments for him. </p>

    <h2>  His Holiness Patriarch </h2><p>  Job was appointed patriarch on February 5, <span>1589.</span>  His first major event in a new capacity was assistance to the Georgian Tsar Alexander.  This monarch was caught between two powerful Muslim powers - Turkey and Persia.  In order to somehow preserve his country, Alexander accepted Russian citizenship. </p><p>  Now the Georgian monarch needed help in restoring order in church affairs.  Just at that time, Job became the first Russian patriarch.  He wrote the king two large letters that have survived to this day.  In his letters, the patriarch gave Alexander advice on the fight against heretics who split the Orthodox Church in Georgia.  Job selected several icon painters and theologians.  They were sent to the Caucasus to revive Georgian Christian life.  The preserved letters that the first patriarch of the Russian church sent to Alexander testify to his great education and well-readness.  Affected by the years spent in the monasteries.  At the same time, Job mercilessly criticized not only heretics and Muslims, but also Catholics with Protestants. </p><h2>  Participation in public policy </h2><p>  When Job became the first Russian patriarch, Boris Godunov hoped to make him his support in the system of secular power.  This plan has been successful.  The fact is that Job, unlike all his predecessors (still metropolitans), actively participated in state affairs.  After daily service in Moscow churches, the patriarch went to meetings of the <span>Boyar Duma,</span> where he defended and promoted the ideas of Boris Godunov in one or another aspect of politics. </p><p>  But even before that, the opinions of Job's predecessors weighed a lot.  At the councils with the tsar, where the entire state elite was present, according to tradition, the first patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church received the right to speak at the very beginning of the event.  The God-fearing Fedor Ivanovich always carefully listened to his advice and instructions. </p><p>  The election of the first Russian patriarch, even at the formal level, markedly changed the state principles.  Now the head of the Russian Orthodox Church has officially become the second person in the country.  A big burden and responsibility fell on his shoulders, whether he wanted it or not.  Russia adopted this principle from Byzantium.  In the empire at all times, the patriarch and the emperor were almost equal figures. </p>

    <h2>  Church affairs </h2><p>  Of course, the election of the first Russian patriarch is associated with the name of Boris Godunov.  In 1598, he finally finally became king after the death of his predecessor Fedor Ivanovich.  Godunov did not belong to the hitherto reigning Rurik dynasty.  This did not add authority to him in the eyes of the boyars.  Nevertheless, the new tsar established a strict sole regime of power. </p><p>  The election of Job (the first Russian patriarch) was necessary for Godunov in order to receive additional support when he was only an approximate monarch.  Now the situation has changed, and the head of the church almost ceased to participate in public life. </p><p>  Instead, Job engaged in the Christianization of the Volga and Siberia.  These lands were recently annexed to Russia.  On their open spaces lived many Muslims and pagans.  The name of the first Russian patriarch is associated with the opening of churches in these regions.  The Christianization of Siberia and the Volga went in parallel with the influx of Russian population from the central regions. </p>

    <h2>  Enemy of False Dmitry </h2><p>  Boris Godunov failed to maintain peace in his country.  First, Russia was struck by hunger, which led to unrest among the people.  A fatal blow for the king was the appearance of False Dmitry.  The impostor was walking with a large army to Moscow.  Godunov was saved from reprisal by natural death at a feast. </p><p>  After his death, it became clear that Job could not save the rank of patriarch.  Supporters of False Dmitry seized him and sent him into exile in his native Staritsky monastery.  Soon in Moscow False Dmitry appeared.  On his orders, they killed Fedor Godunov, the son of Boris, who was the king of just a few weeks. </p>

    <h2>  Exile </h2><p>  Even before the appearance in Moscow, False Dmitry was anathematized.  The first Russian patriarch excommunicated him from the church.  The biography of this hierarch portrays to us a man who has not abandoned his principles and loyalty to the lawful king.  When Fyodor was killed, Job returned to the capital and served in the Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin.  For this he was captured and sent into exile.  Supporters of False Dmitry wanted to humiliate the eighty-year-old man as much as possible.  The patriarch's vestments were torn from him and expelled from the capital. </p><p>  Instead of Job, Otrepiev elected his supporter Ignatius as the patriarch.  However, the procedure for his appointment was illegal.  Formally, Job (the first Russian patriarch) was not even deprived of his rank, although he was expelled from Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  Rehabilitation and death </h2><p>  Very soon, False Dmitry lost power.  He surrounded himself with Catholic Poles, which the ordinary people did not like very much.  The boyars were also against the impostor because of his tyrannical nature.  In 1606, an uprising broke out in Moscow.  False Dmitry tried to escape, but was captured and killed. </p><p>  Power passed to the Moscow boyars.  They elected Vasily Shuisky as king.  The new monarch rehabilitated Job.  The first patriarch even returned to Moscow.  However, the old man refused to become the <span>head of the church</span> again <span>.</span>  By that time, he was already almost blind and was seriously ill.  Job returned to his native Staritsa, where he died in 1607.  The first patriarch was buried in a local monastery.  In the XVII century, his remains were transferred to the Assumption Cathedral of the Kremlin.  The Russian Orthodox Church canonized Job in the guise of saints. </p>
