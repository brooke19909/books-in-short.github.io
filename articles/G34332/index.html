Who are the Polovtsy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of Russia is full of different events.  Each of them leaves its mark in the memory of the whole nation.  Some key and turning events reach our days and remain revered and worthy in our society.  Protecting your cultural heritage, remembering the great victories and commanders is a very important duty of every person.  The princes of Russia were not always on top in terms of their control of Russia, but they tried to be one family, which jointly makes all decisions.  In the most critical and difficult moments, a person always appeared who "took the bull by the horns" and turned the course of history in the opposite direction.  One of such great people is Vladimir Monomakh, who is still considered an important figure in the history of Russia.  He achieved many complex military-political goals, while he rarely resorted to cruel methods.  His methods consisted of tactics, patience and wisdom, which allowed him to put up with adults who had hated each other for years.  In addition, you can‚Äôt ignore the prince‚Äôs talent and fight, because Monomakh‚Äôs tactics often saved the Russian army from death.  The defeat of the Polovtsy, Prince Vladimir thought through to the smallest detail and therefore "trampled" this threat to Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rout of Polovtsy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467475.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Polovtsy: acquaintance </h2><p>  Polovtsy, or Polovtsy, as historians call them, are people of Turkic origin who led a nomadic lifestyle.  In different sources they are given different names: in the Byzantine documents - Kumans, in the Arab-Persian - Kipchaks.  The beginning of the XI century turned out to be very productive for the people: it drove the torques and Pechenegs from the Volga region and the donkey itself in these parts.  However, the conquerors decided not to stop there and crossed the Dnieper River, after which they successfully descended to the banks of the Danube.  Thus they became the owners of the Great Steppe, which stretched from the Danube to the Irtysh.  Russian sources have this place as the Polovetsky field. </p><p>  During the creation of the Golden Horde, the Polovtsy managed to assimilate many Mongols and successfully impose their own language on them.  It is worth noting that later this language (Kypchak) was laid as the basis for many languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Tatar, Nogai, Kumyk and Bashkir). </p><h2>  Origin of the term </h2><p>  The word "Polovtsy" from Old Russian means "yellow."  Many representatives of the people had fair hair, but most were representatives of the <span>Caucasian race</span> mixed with the Mongoloid.  However, some scientists say that the origin of the name of the people comes from the place of their stop - the field.  There are many versions, but none is reliable. </p><h2>  Clan system </h2><p>  The defeat of the Polovtsy was partly due to their military democratic system.  All the people were divided into several genera.  Each clan had its own name - the name of the leader.  Several clans united in tribes, which created villages and winter-cities for themselves.  Each tribal union had its own land on which food was cultivated.  There were also smaller organizations, smokers - the union of several families.  It is interesting that not only Polovtsy, but also other peoples, with whom there was a natural mixture, could live in smokers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Political system </h2><p>  Kureni united in hordes led by a khan.  The khans had the highest power in the field.  In addition to them, there were also categories such as servants and wells.  It should also be noted such a division of women, which predetermined them as maids.  They were called chaga.  Wells are prisoners of war who were essentially domestic slaves.  They did the hard work, had no rights, and were the lowest link on the social ladder.  There were also cats - the heads of large families.  The family consisted of cats.  Each kosh is a separate family and its servants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="defeat of the Polovtsy by Vladimir Monomakh" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467474.jpg" width="423"></div>

    <p>  The wealth obtained in battles was shared between the leaders of military campaigns and the nobility.  An ordinary warrior received only crumbs from the table of the masters.  In the event of an unsuccessful campaign, you could go broke and become completely dependent on some noble Polovtsy. </p><h2>  Warfare </h2><p>  The military affairs of the Polovtsy were at their best, and even modern scientists admit this.  However, history has preserved to this day not too much evidence of the Polovtsian warriors.  Interestingly, any man or youth who was able to simply carry weapons should have dedicated his life to military affairs.  At the same time, his state of health, physique, and especially his personal desire, were not taken into account at all.  But since such a device always existed, no one complained about it.  It is worth noting that the military affairs of the Polovtsy were not well organized from the very beginning.  Rather, it will be said that it developed in stages.  Historians of Byzantium wrote that this people fought with a bow, a crooked saber and darts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Each warrior wore special clothes that reflected his belonging to the army.  It was made of <span>sheepskin,</span> and was quite dense and comfortable.  It is interesting that each Polar warrior had at his disposal about 10 horses. </p><p>  The main force of the Polovtsian army was light cavalry.  In addition to the guns listed above, warriors also fought with sabers and lassos.  A little later they appeared heavy artillery.  Such warriors wore special helmets, shells and chain mail.  At the same time, they were often made very frightening in order to further intimidate the enemy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rout of the Polovtsian date" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467473.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We should also mention the use by the Polovtsy of heavy self-arrows and <span>Greek fire.</span>  Most likely, they learned this at the time when they lived near Altai.  It was these opportunities that made the people practically invincible, because few military leaders of that time could boast of such knowledge.  The use of Greek fire many times helped the Polovtsy to defeat even the very fortified and protected cities. </p><p>  It is worth paying tribute to the fact that the army had sufficient maneuverability.  But all successes in this business came to naught due to the low speed of movement of the troops.  Like all nomads, the Polovtsy won many victories thanks to sharp and unexpected attacks on the enemy, lengthy ambushes and deceitful maneuvers.  They often chose small villages that could not provide the necessary resistance, and even more so defeat the Polovtsy, as the object of the attack.  However, the army was often defeated due to the lack of professional fighters.  Junior education was not given too much attention.  It was possible to learn any skills only during the round-up, when the main occupation was the development of primitive battle technique. </p><h2>  Russian-Polovtsian war </h2><p>  Russian-Polovtsian wars are called a long series of serious conflicts, which played out for about a century and a half.  One of the reasons was the clash of territorial interests of both parties, because the Polovtsy were a nomadic people who wanted to conquer new lands.  The second reason was that Russia was going through hard times of fragmentation, so some rulers recognized the Polovtsy as allies, causing the anger and indignation of other Russian princes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="final defeat of the Polovtsy" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1467553.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The situation was rather sad until the moment when Vladimir Monomakh intervened, who set his initial goal to unite all the lands of Russia. </p><h2>  The background of the battle in Salnice </h2><p>  In 1103, the Russian princes conducted the first campaign against the nomadic people in the steppe.  By the way, the defeat of the Polovtsy took place after the Dolob congress.  In 1107, the Russian forces successfully defeated Bonyaki and Sharukany.  Success instilled the spirit of rebellion and victory into the souls of Russian warriors, therefore, already in 1109, the Kiev governor Dmitry Ivorovich smashed the large villages of the Polovtsy near Donets to shreds. </p><h2>  Monomakh Tactics </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the defeat of the Polovtsy (date - March 27, 1111) was one of the first in the modern list of Memorable dates of the military history of the Russian Federation.  The victory of Vladimir Monomakh and other princes was a well-thought-out political victory, which had far-sighted consequences.  The Russians prevailed despite the fact that the advantage in quantitative terms was almost one and a half. </p><p>  Today, many are interested, the tremendous defeat of the Polovtsians under which prince became attainable?  A huge and invaluable merit of the contribution of Vladimir Monomakh, who skillfully applied his leadership gift.  He took several important steps.  Firstly, he implemented the good old principle, which states that it is necessary to destroy the enemy on its territory and with little blood.  Secondly, he successfully applied the transport capabilities of that time, which allowed him to deliver infantry soldiers to the battlefield in a timely manner, while preserving their strength and spirit.  The third reason for Monomakh‚Äôs thoughtful tactics was that he even resorted to weather conditions in order to win the desired victory ‚Äî he forced the nomads to fight in such weather that did not allow them to fully use all the advantages of their cavalry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="defeat of the Polovtsy monomakh" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467471.jpg" width="466"></div>

    <p>  However, this is not the only merit of the prince.  Vladimir Monomakh thought over the defeat of the Polovtsians to the smallest detail, but in order to implement the plan, it was necessary to achieve the almost impossible!  To begin with, we plunge into the mood of that time: Russia was fragmented, the princes held onto their territories with their teeth, each strove to act in its own way, and each believed that only he was right.  However, Monomakh managed to collect, reconcile and unite the wayward, rebellious or even stupid princes.  It is very difficult to imagine how much wisdom, patience and courage the prince needed ... He resorted to tricks, tricks, and direct persuasions that could at least somehow influence the princes.  The result was gradually achieved, and the feuds ceased.  It was at the Dolob Congress that the main agreements and agreements between the various princes were reached. </p><p>  The defeat of the Polovtsians by Monomakh was also due to the fact that he persuaded the other princes to use even the Smerds in order to strengthen the army.  Previously, no one even thought about it, because only the combatants were supposed to fight. </p><h2>  The defeat in Salnice </h2><p>  The campaign began on the second Sunday of Great Lent.  On February 26, 111, the Russian army, under the command of an entire coalition of princes (Svyatopolk, David and Vladimir), headed towards Sharukani.  It is interesting that the campaign of the Russian army was accompanied by the singing of songs, escort by priests and crosses.  From this, many scholars of the history of Russia conclude that the campaign was a crusade.  It is believed that this was Monomakh‚Äôs thoughtful move to raise morale, but most importantly, in order to inspire the army that it can kill and must defeat, for God himself tells them to do so.  In fact, Vladimir Monomakh turned this great battle of the Russians against the Polovtsy into a righteous battle for the Orthodox faith. </p><p>  The army reached the battlefield only 23 days later.  The campaign was difficult, but thanks to morale, songs and a sufficient amount of provisions, the army was enough, and therefore, in full combat readiness.  On the 23rd day, soldiers went to the shores of the <span>Seversky Donets.</span> </p><p>  It is worth noting that Sharukan surrendered without a fight and pretty quickly - already on the 5th day of a severe siege.  Residents of the city offered the invaders wine and fish - a seemingly insignificant fact, but it indicates that people led a <span>settled lifestyle</span> here <span>.</span>  Also, the Russians burned Sugrov.  Two settlements that were defeated bore the names of khans.  These are exactly the two cities with which the army fought in 1107, but then Khan Sharukan fled the battlefield, and Sugrov became a prisoner of war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="defeat of the Polovtsians by Vladimir" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467470.jpg" width="419"></div>

    <p>  Already on March 24, the first initial battle took place, in which the Polovtsy put in all their strength.  It took place near the Donets.  The defeat of the Polovtsians by Vladimir Monomakh occurred later, when a battle took place on the river Salnitsa.  Interestingly, the moon was full.  This was the second and most basic battle of the two sides, in which the Russians won up. </p><p>  The largest defeat by the Russian armies of the Polovtsy, the date of which has already stirred up the whole Polovtsian people, because the latter had a great numerical advantage in battle.  They were sure that they would win, however, they could not resist the thoughtful and direct blow of the Russian army.  For the people and soldiers, the defeat of the Polovtsians by Vladimir Monomakh was a very joyful and cheerful event, because good booty was obtained, many future slaves were captured, and most importantly, a victory was won! </p><h2>  Effects </h2><p>  The consequences of this great event were vivid.  The defeat of the Polovtsians (year 1111) was a turning point in the history of the Russo-Polovtsian wars.  After the battle, the Polovtsy decided to approach the borders of the Russian Principality only once.  It is interesting that they did this after Svyatopolk moved into another world (two years after the battle).  However, the Polovtsy made contact with the new Prince Vladimir.  In 1116, the Russian army made another campaign against the Polovtsy and captured three cities.  The final defeat of the Polovtsy broke their fighting spirit, and soon they switched to the service of the Georgian king David the Builder.  The Kipchaks did not respond to the last Russian campaign, which confirmed their final decline. </p><p>  A few years later, Monomakh sent Yaropolk in search of the Polovtsy for Don, but no one was there. </p><h2>  Sources </h2><p>  Many Russian chronicles narrate about this event, which has become key and significant for the whole nation.  The defeat of the Polovtsy by Vladimir strengthened his power, as well as the people's faith in his strength and his prince.  Despite the fact that partially the battle of Salnitz is described in many sources, the most detailed ‚Äúportrait‚Äù of the battle can be found only in the <span>Ipatiev Chronicle.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rout Polovtsy prince" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1467467.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <p>  An extremely important event was the defeat of the Polovtsy.  Such a turn of events in Russia came in handy.  And all this became possible thanks to the efforts of Vladimir Monomakh.  How much strength and mind he put into saving Russia from this scourge!  How carefully he thought over the course of the whole operation!  He knew that the Russians always acted as victims, because the Polovtsy attacked first, and the population of Russia could only defend themselves.  Monomakh understood that he should be the first to attack, because this will create an effect of surprise, and will also transfer soldiers from a state of defenders to a state of attackers, which is more aggressive and strong in the general mass.  Realizing that the nomads begin their campaigns in the spring, since they practically have no foot soldiers, he appointed the defeat of the Polovtsians at the end of winter in order to deprive them of their main strength.  In addition, such a move had other advantages.  They consisted in the fact that the weather deprived the Polovtsy of their maneuverability, which was simply impossible in the conditions of winter remarks.  It is believed that the battle of Salnitz and the defeat of the Polovtsy in 1111 is the first major and well-thought-out victory of Ancient Russia, which was made possible thanks to the military talent of Vladimir Monomakh. </p>
