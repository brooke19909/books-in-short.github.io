    <p>  When it is not possible to pay off the debt to the bank, you can use the services of refinancing.  Refinancing at VTB 24 is a great way to solve problems. </p><h2>  About the bank </h2><p>  VTB 24 is one of the largest representatives of financial organizations operating in the economic market.  He is part of the VTB international group and considers working with individuals, entrepreneurs and small business owners a priority in his activity.  The Bank covers about 72 regions of our country, offering consumers the main financial products: lending, corporate services, money transfers, opening deposits, as well as a refinancing program.  Refinancing at VTB is a great way to reunite several loans and reduce the interest rate.  Let's look at this issue in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Refinancing concept </h2><p>  The very essence of refinancing is to arrange a new loan in order to close loan obligations to other banks.  When refinancing, each bank tries to create comfortable conditions for its client: change the amount of the monthly payment, the loan period and the date of payment.  VTB 24 carries out refinancing exclusively in the interests of the borrower, helping him to avoid fines and while maintaining a good credit history. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that this type of refinancing is the most common and most simple. </p><h2>  Car loans </h2><p>  If you need to reissue a car loan, you can also contact VTB Bank.  Refinancing in this case occurs under other conditions: </p><ul><li>  The loan amount varies from 30,000 to a million rubles. </li><li>  The rate is from 13.95%. </li><li>  The contract is concluded for up to 60 months. </li><li>  Road transport becomes collateral for a financial institution. </li><li>  The borrower is required to issue a CASCO. </li><li>  Monthly payments are made in equal amounts. </li></ul><p>  In this case, the bank offers its customers rather favorable conditions that allow avoiding problems with the law. </p><h2>  Action algorithm </h2><p>  VTB financial institution refinances loans from other banks according to a very clear and consistent algorithm, which the borrower must follow.  Let's consider it in more detail: </p><ul><li>  The client of the bank must independently know the amount of debt on the current loan and the number of payments paid. </li><li>  The borrower can contact the VTB 24 Bank with the information available, personally visiting any convenient office or filling out an online form on the organization‚Äôs website. </li><li>  According to the data provided, the bank manager determines the format of the refinancing, conducts the application review process, and also reports the results. </li><li>  If the bank gave a positive answer, the borrower must collect and provide the entire list of necessary documents and transfer it to the manager for processing.  Based on these documents, a loan agreement is drawn up, which must be signed by both parties. </li><li>  Funds that are transferred to the borrower to the specified account must be paid to pay off existing credit debt to a third-party bank.  In the corresponding period, the borrower begins to pay money in favor of VTB in accordance with the new terms of the contract. </li></ul>

    <p>  Based on all of the above, we can conclude that the proposed transparent and favorable conditions, a simple list of documents, a simple algorithm of actions make the VTB 24 refinancing program accessible to most citizens and quite competitive in the financial sector. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As in any financial sector, there are both positive and negative aspects to the issue of refinancing at VTB 24 Bank. </p><p>  According to a number of borrowers in this financial institution, it is rather difficult to refinance loan products of other banks.  VTB exposes very harsh conditions.  Which causes a clear indignation of citizens who want to reduce their headache.  In addition, there are clients complaining about refusal to refinance even with an impeccable credit history.  Employees of the bank argue that the approval of on-lending is not an obligation of the organization, but merely a service provided.  And the final decision depends only on the bank itself.  Some borrowers complain about constant malfunctions in the VTB online system, payments are also lost, or it is generally impossible to send money to the destination. </p><p>  Naturally, the negative reaction is associated with personal experience, and it turns out that such borrowers were not lucky, because there are also positive aspects.  Bank customers who successfully completed the refinancing program note a reduction in monthly payments and the quality of the service provided.  In addition, the opportunity to write off funds directly from the current account is encouraging.  This eliminates the need for the borrower to queue and make payments in advance.  The result of all feedback on the work of the bank and the refinancing program can serve as the words: "How many people, so many opinions." </p>

    <p>  Here are some feedback from borrowers: </p><ul><li>  VTB, for example, like Sberbank, offers some of the most optimal conditions.  But it is advisable not to bring the situation to the point of collecting a bunch of loans, and then look for opportunities to combine them into one. </li><li>  In case of loss of work, the bank rarely goes towards the client.  As a rule, he is denied refinancing services even with a good credit history and unofficial income. </li><li>  Often, after filling out an online application, the manager calls back, asks clarifying questions and says that the application is approved.  A few days later, information comes from the bank that they cannot provide you a loan.  They do not explain anything.  For whom then is this program? </li></ul>
