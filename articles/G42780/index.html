Archaeologists attribute its origin to the IX-XII century.  From ancient times, people believed that certain ornaments and patterns in cross-stitch on clothing and household items could protect them from the evil eye and evil spirits.  Especially strong amulets were considered things made in one day - from dawn to dusk.  And since embroidery is a rather laborious process, several craftswomen worked on the product at the same time.  Over time, this art has undergone many changes - for example, now most often clothes are decorated with machine embroidery. </p><h2>  Craftswomen in Russia </h2><p>  Initially, noble people and monks were engaged in this art.  They worked with gold threads, natural pearls, natural stones, and silk was used as the basis.  From about the 18th century, embroidery ceased to be a privilege of the nobility.  Art goes into the account of compulsory work for ordinary peasant women.  They embroidered on the simplest materials with ordinary threads, which were made from linen and hemp. </p><p>  As a rule, women were engaged in similar work.  They taught their daughters this art from the age of 5-7 years.  By the age of fifteen, the girl had already had a dowry embroidered.  This is not surprising, because in Russia they married out at about this age.  The dowry included embroidered towels, bedspreads and other household items.  And before the wedding, his wedding was held.  After all, it was judged by the dowry how diligent and hardworking the craftswoman was. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern embroidery ornament" class="if uuid-3173353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3173353.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern cross stitch </h2><p>  As they say, everything new is well forgotten old.  This also applies to cross-stitch.  She's back in fashion now.  Very many craftswomen are engaged in this type of creativity.  They are constantly in search of new patterns and ornaments in cross-stitch and ideas for work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stitchedmodern.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross stitch flowers" class="if uuid-3173342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3173342.jpg"></div><p>  For creativity, you can now purchase ready-made sets with canvas and floss.
