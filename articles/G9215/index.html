Origin history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For those who travel often or just like to consider a geographical map, it is not a secret at all how entertaining and funny the names of the settlements of our country and the world can be.  Quite often it happens that the name of the village is more interesting - you just want to know what kind of people live there and what they call themselves.  Often you can track the origin of the names of the settlements and find out why and how they gave the village or village such a name - didn‚Äôt this seem ridiculous ?! </p><h2>  Such a delicious name! </h2><p>  Very often funny names of settlements are found in Ukraine.  The local population, allegedly, doesn‚Äôt at all complex about the funny names of their native villages and villages, only smiles on occasion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="funny place names" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/364088.jpg" width="483"></div>

    <p>  There is, for example, in the Odessa region the wonderful village of Borshchi.  Where did this name come from, and no need to explain.  The famous Ukrainian dish, which gave the settlement its name, was masterly able to cook in a local inn in the 18th century.  Travelers who looked into the inn for lunch and rest, ate delicious borsch and praised.  And then not only they themselves tried again to come back here, but they also advised others that they should stay in this village, because there is no such delicious dish in the vicinity.  It is not surprising that the traditions of cooking borsch in the village with that name have been preserved to this day - every self-respecting housewife here cooks this tasty dish according to her own special recipe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tails?  Twist?  No, do not bake! </h2><p>  Again Ukraine - we find cool names of settlements in the Lviv region.  Oddly enough, in the village of Pikhikhvostyv there are no recipes for unusual dishes with the participation of tails, and its inhabitants prefer baked potato pancakes.  However, the legend of how such a name appeared has survived to this day.  They say that during the attack of the Tatars on these lands all the surrounding people found refuge in a large cave.  But when fleeing, they were in a hurry to escape, so much so that they took very little food with them, but somehow it was necessary to survive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cool names of settlements" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/364090.jpg?1396293595886" width="600"></div>  So the villagers had to eat animals taken with them, including baking the tails of bulls and horses.  And then came the name of the Oven Tails.  As you can see, the ridiculous names of settlements often come from serious history.  Residents are used to the name of the village.  There are a lot of creative people here, cheerful and talented.

    <h2>  How Tsar Peter once urchil </h2><p>  Of course, funny names for settlements in Russia are also available.  A very large percentage of Russians now live in villages and villages with funny names.  And everyone has a special story.  Often the village received a ridiculous name nicknamed the vibrant person who lived in it, and sometimes the name of the village was given to offended residents of neighboring villages, thus seeking revenge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual village names" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/364091.jpg?1396293623758" width="584"></div>

According to legend, Peter I himself had a hand in the name of this settlement. Once, the great Russian sovereign ordered raw chicken eggs from villagers, which at that time were used to strengthen clay and lime mortars during the construction of walls.  And the villagers, having decided that it was not worth the king to send the raw eggs, took them and cooked them.  As the sovereign estimated the magnitude of the intelligence of the inhabitants, one can guess by the name of the village.  Alas, now Durykino is almost empty, but the old-timers do not forget the legend. </p><h2>  When shitty, not always bad </h2><p>  In the Voronezh region, the station with the very intriguing name "Khrenovaya" - passengers who decide to travel by train to the regional center, probably pass it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="funniest place names" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/364089.jpg?1396293667375" width="600"></div>  In appearance, by the way, the station is quite consistent with the name, being for the most part a deserted platform with a rather neglected train station.  Maybe Khrenovoi won‚Äôt win the nomination ‚ÄúThe funniest names of settlements‚Äù at the competition, but it‚Äôs very remarkable that the station is located just between two villages with consonant names - Khrenishche and Khrenovoye.  Khrenovoye Farm, by the way, has a rather rich history.  Once there was a large stud farm, and in 1892 A.P. himself visited the village.  Chekhov.  And the solution to the name is quite simple - it came from the name of the local river.  The river, of course, is also worthless, but not at all bad, it was named so thanks to the thickets of horseradish along the banks.

    <h2>  Used to the name </h2><p>  Very often, the unusual names of villages and villages attract many tourists to such places, because a real traveler is well aware: in order to find something interesting, sometimes you just need to look carefully around.  It is enough for someone to write down an unusual name, someone is photographed against the background of a tablet, so that later they can show to friends and acquaintances.  Residents of the village of Bereguyfalu have long been accustomed to such attention, but they don‚Äôt think at all that it‚Äôs funny - and who knows what is heard there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="origin of settlement names" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/364085.jpg?1396293702158" width="600"></div>  It is calmly explained to ardent jokers that Bereguyfalu is the Hungarian name, which means just one more village near the village of Beregovo.  By the way, Hungarians still not only live there, but also make up about 60% of the population.

    <h2>  Happiness with raisins </h2><p>  Funny names have not only small settlements.  Unusual city names are also found.  Here, for example, the city of Happiness in the <span>Luhansk region of</span> Ukraine is unique in its name.  According to legend, the founders of the city in the distant 18th century were serfs who escaped from the landlords.  Once, Catherine II passed through these places, who was glad for the free people living here, and said that they must have happiness here.  And so it was. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="funny names of places in Russia" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/364087.jpg?1396293735438" width="595"></div>

    <p>  But the real highlight is not far from Kharkov - the city of Raisins.  And even though the emblem of the city depicts grapes, there is still no version confirming the origin of the name of the city from raisins.  Historians believe that the city was named after the Izyumets river and the Izyumsky ford, known from antiquity, on which the settlement was founded. </p><h2>  An obscene village </h2><p>  Not only in Russia and its closest neighbors you can find funny names of settlements, for example, they are in Western Europe and the United States.  And quite often there are those that will be understandable to travelers with the most basic level of knowledge of the language.  For example, known around the world precisely because of its funny (especially for English-speaking) name the Austrian village of Fucking (Fuking).  This place is loved by tourists.  In fact, of course, there is nothing abusive in the name - the village is named for the founder of Focco.  However, this does not stop tourists from having fun and taking pictures near the nameplate of the village.  By the way, in a fairly short time this tablet has been stolen several times already. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual city names" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/364086.jpg?1396293763086" width="320"></div>

    <p>  The United States also did not bypass the cool names of the settlements.  There are also talking names such as, for example, Hell (Hell), Idiotville, Climax and others. </p><h2>  You laugh, and here we were born and live </h2><p>  Alas, quite often it happens that the name of the native village does not please its inhabitants at all.  Sometimes they are even ashamed to admit where their small homeland is.  After all, the ridiculous names of the settlements, which are so exciting to find on a geographical map, do not seem so funny to everyone.  Residents of the village of Lokhovo, which is located in the Irkutsk region, the piquant name of the village does not suit.  Young people, which, of course, are more important than prestige than old-timers, even turned to the city authorities to change their offensive name, but were refused.  Indeed, despite the analogies that arise among many curious travelers, the settlement was named after the name Lokhov, worn by its founder. </p><h2>  Entertaining geography </h2><p>  The cases listed here are only a fraction of the funny and unusual names of the settlements.  There are also the villages of Old Worms and Kozyavkino, Tsatsa and Mukhoedovo, Such and Good Bees;  villages Bolotnaya Rogavka and Durakovo, Pig and Zhabino, Dudes and Golodrankino;  the village of Yes, the city of Bottom and many others. </p>
