Most likely, the answer to this question will be negative.  And very much in vain. </p><p>  Many argue that such a trip at least once in a lifetime is worth taking, once gathered and organized an excursion to Temirtau.  The blue lake, the amazing flora and fauna and the purest air - all this, as a rule, is to the liking of all, even the most capricious and experienced travelers. </p><p>  Is it possible to miss such an opportunity, being or even more so living nearby?  Of course not! </p><h2>  Section 1. The village and its history </h2>

Geographically, it is located in the Tashtagol district in the Kemerovo region of Russia, and administratively refers to urban-type settlements.

    <p>  A village was built 100 km from Novokuznetsk near the Novokuznetsk-Tashtagol railway.  There is a station on the Ahpun - Uchulen line and a stop on the Uchulen – Kashtau branch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From Temirtau bus lines run in the direction of Tashtagol, Novokuznetsk, Kaza and Mundybash. </p><p>  In 2014, the population of the city was about 4100 people. </p><p>  The village was formed in 1931 as the ore base for the construction of the Novokuznetsk Metallurgical Plant (KMK) Temirtau.  Blue Lake at that time was not so popular, it simply did not exist. </p><p>  The bulk of the population arrived in 1931-1953.  from the European part.  People came here from Central Russia, from Belarus and Ukraine.  Some of the residents consisted of convicts in the settlement.  In the period from 1932 to 2001, the Temirtau mine was one of the suppliers of ore for KMK.  Since 1973, the movement of trains to Novokuznetsk began. </p><p>  It should be noted that the name of the village of Temirtau is translated as “Iron Mountain”, it has Turkic roots - “Temir” (iron) and “tau” (mountain). </p><h2>  Section 2.

The central part includes Akhpun station, a residential area, schools, hospitals and shops.  To the north of Akhpun station and to the south of high-rise buildings are residential wooden buildings and the upland part - the former zone. </p><p>  Kashtau, consisting of several dozen wooden houses, is located 3 km from Ahpun station near the bus stop.  On the road from Temirtau to Uchulen, there is the Priuchulensky part of Temirtau, numbering almost a hundred houses and the Holy Trinity Church.

    <p>  Even local residents do not always think about how the territories appeared in the area, which from a geological point of view could not be there.  And the answer is quite simple: as a result of flooding the quarry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The round pond has a diameter of about 300 meters and is located in a pit with steep walls 40 meters high. </p><p>  At any time of the year the Temirtau Blue Lakes are quite picturesque and unusual.  How to get to them is well known to the locals, and they, they must say, do it without any problems.  But guests of the region often simply take their breath away from moving along a steep serpentine road. </p><p>  By the way, there is a small equipped parking on the shore that can accommodate only 35 people, so those who want to relax with their family or company should come early in the day off in order to manage to take a more convenient and comfortable place. </p><h2>  Section 4.

Visibility under water depends on the season and depth and is 15-30 meters.  Water is almost always cool and does not warm above 12 degrees.  Vegetation in an artificial reservoir practically does not exist.  This, incidentally, applies to the fauna.

    <p>  Here divers like to gather.  Why?  The thing is that these places are great for scuba diving.  The descent from the road, going straight to the lake, forms a small backwater where you can make scuba dives. </p><p>  To dive directly, swim a little straight or turn right and cross the small ledge surrounding the road. </p><p>  The depth behind the protrusion increases significantly.  If you move further to the left, then, as experienced travelers say, it increases, if to the right, it decreases. </p><p>  Only the most experienced divers dive to the center of the pit. </p><h2>  Section 5.

    <p>  The descent into the reservoir is free, and the depth is available at a distance of 10-90 m from the coast.  At a 12-meter depth, there is a sunken GAZ truck, which is to some extent the attraction of this quarry.  Those who wish can explore it and take underwater photographs. </p><p>  Temirtau’s quarry hosts training of Siberian freedivers and events of the Freediving Federation.  Due to its features, the reservoir is practically no different from the sea and allows you to dive seven months a year. </p><p>  The lake is closed, there is no large fish and water transport.  All this makes the pond completely safe for freediving. </p><h2>  Section 6. Chalet “Blue Lakes” (Temirtau) - prices and level of service provided </h2><p>  Not far from Novosibirsk, 200 meters from the Ob Sea, the recreation center "Blue Lakes" is located.  The camp site got its name thanks to the reservoirs located on its territory. </p><p>  Cozy buildings and summer houses built in a pine forest.  There are separate picnic areas, gazebos, tables, a bathhouse and a sauna.  Here you can not only spend weekends and vacations, but also celebrate a wedding celebration, a corporate party or a family holiday.  For rent are a banquet hall and a conference room for business negotiations. </p><p>  In summer, vacationers can rent catamarans, boats and bicycles, and sports grounds are open.  For children, playgrounds and quads are organized.  Outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy horse riding or cycling. </p><p>  In winter you can go skiing, ice skating, sledding and snowmobiling or play hockey.  Especially fun at the camp site during the Christmas and New Year holidays, Epiphany or Shrovetide.  It hosts festivities and recreational activities. </p><p>  The cost of living depends on the time of year and the level of service provided.  On average, a day of rest on the territory of the camp "Blue Lakes" (Kemerovo region, Temirtau) will cost 1200-1600 rubles. </p><h2>  Section 7. Reviews of the visit to the lake </h2>

Here you can relax with family or friends in the warm season.  People call it the Blue Lake Temirtau.
