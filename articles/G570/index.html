    <p>  The very word "town hall", borrowed from the Polish language, literally translated means "house of councils."  But initially, these government agencies were merchants.  This suggests that the name of the new business center is not only beautiful - "Nevsky Town Hall", but also absolutely accurate. </p><h2>  Everything you need is within walking distance </h2><p>  Here, in one place, everything necessary for solving urgent problems will be concentrated, even a four-star hotel, where participants in negotiations and business meetings can linger.  But the most important thing is that in the new business district, which is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã6.1 hectares, there will be 7 Class A business centers and the city administration building.  One of the most important advantages of this project is its location: between Degtyarny lane, Novgorodskaya and Moiseenko streets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Center is always an advantage </h2><p>  In contrast to the Okhta-Center transferred from the city center, the Nevskaya Town Hall, located in the heart of the metropolis, is surrounded by three central metro stations, of which the closest is Chernyshevskaya (a 15-minute walk).  In the immediate vicinity of the business district there are two stations - Finlandsky, from which the Allegro express train leaves for Helsinki, and Moskovsky, where the Sapsan arrives. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the Neva town hall" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/457727.jpg" width="540"></div>  Located in the most convenient place for business, the Nevskaya Town Hall was conceived as a large-scale business district, providing on its territory all the necessary infrastructure for work and living.  In addition to buildings for purely business meetings, even projects such as the Interactive Science Museum for Children were considered.  Dates - 2007 (beginning) and 2018 (completion of work).

    <h2>  To match the face of the city is a necessary condition </h2><p>  The total area being built will be 366,431 square meters.  Organizations and firms will be housed in buildings whose appearance must gracefully fit into the surrounding picture.  The authors of the project took into account the moment that where the Nevsky Town Hall is located, where the center of <span>St. Petersburg is located, the architecture of</span> which is known to the whole world, nothing should disturb the historical face of the city that has developed over the centuries.  Therefore, the architecture of the administrative and business district, which forms the new look of the Northern capital as a major financial, economic, cultural center, is made in the style of modern classics, which are characterized by exquisite decor (colonnades and pilasters) and clear characteristic lines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="construction of the Neva town hall" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/457728.jpg" width="585"></div>  The decorative plastering of the facades by Travertino Romano, giving the walls the appearance of an old stone due to marble granules, makes the business district aristocratic, somewhat reminiscent of Italy.  And this fits well with the architecture of St. Petersburg, over the appearance of which many craftsmen from this country worked.  The square in front of the Main Administrative Building of this region was conceived as one of the new large squares of the city, along with St. Isaac's and the Palace.  The neighborhood will be decorated with landscape decor.  Part of the city administration will move to new residences, so residents call the Smolny-2 construction site.

The first provided for the construction of the second and third buildings of the business center, the Administration building, where officials from various specialized committees of St. Petersburg, trade and service infrastructure, the public zone, and entrances from Novgorodskaya and Moiseenko streets would have to move, that is, at the first stage, all architectural dominants of the complex.  The second stage provided for the complete development of Moiseenko Street and the final registration of travel from it to Degtyarny Lane. </p>

The construction is financed by VTB, so the global crisis has slowed down the construction of the facility slightly, and still the timing of their commissioning has been adjusted.  In October 2013, the first two buildings in Degtyarny Lane, provided for by the first stage of construction, were commissioned.  One of them is fully intended for VTB structures.

    <p>  BC "Neva Town Hall" has the most effective <strong> </strong>  planning decisions - and this is not one of its advantages.  But crises, as a rule, affect expensive projects, such as the Nevsky Town Hall, which provides for an ‚ÄúA‚Äù class facility.  Demand for them falls due to the high cost, albeit justified.  And therefore, the expensive buildings of the second stage of construction will be completed as tenants appear, otherwise they become unstoppable.  The delivery of the administrative building is delayed, but it is planned to be delivered in January 2015. </p>
