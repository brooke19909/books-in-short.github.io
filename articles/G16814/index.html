Ribbons can be satin, crepe or kapron.  Crafts from satin look shiny and look more spectacular, but if you want to achieve airiness and tenderness, choose nylon strips of fabric. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself tape products are different.  Most often, these are jewelry for hair - hairpins, bows on elastic bands or hoops, beautifully decorated with flowers.  But real masters skillfully frame caskets and vases, make voluminous flowers and insects from ribbons, create original brooches, earrings and bracelets.  New Year's toys and a Christmas tree made from petals using the kanzashi technique look beautiful.  Anyone who knows how to work with ribbons can quickly decorate a gift box by tying a magnificent bow, and twist a bow tie for a boy for a carnival costume. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to quickly and efficiently make products from tapes with your own hands, what additional materials are needed.  You will learn how to connect the details of the craft with each other, what glue will keep it intact, learn how to make New Year's toys and tie magnificent spectacular bows. </p><h2>  Two-tone pearl bracelet </h2><p>  On the basis of a simple plastic hoop of any color, you can make an original bracelet of any two colors.  For the manufacture of such jewelry you will need red and black thin satin ribbons, a base for gluing and packing small golden round beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aftoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin bracelets" class="if uuid-3148998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148998.jpg"></div><p>  To strengthen the fabric on the plastic, a glue gun is used.  To begin with, put a hot glue on the inner surface of the ring.  The edge of the black satin ribbon should be melted over the candle fire so that the threads do not split, and attached to the glue from the inside at an angle.  Then a strip of fabric is wrapped in a spiral around the entire surface of the bracelet and the last turn is likewise attached with an adhesive gun to the inner surface of the ring. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Further, the product from the tapes with their own hands is wrapped in a second color - red, but the turns are no longer made in a spiral, but evenly, moreover, two segments are crossed through the bead so that the bead is held exactly in the center of the bracelet. </p><h2>  Ribbon Hair Clips </h2><p>  From crepe ribbons of lilac and white color you can roll the original bow for attaching to a hairpin or elastic band for hair.  From cardboard it is necessary to cut polyhedra with seven corners, similar to a star.  As you approach the middle, the bow is twisted smaller.  An article is made layer by layer - stitching with threads selected in tone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful hairpin made of ribbons" class="if uuid-3148972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148972.jpg"></div><p>  In the step-by-step photo you can clearly see how you need to alternately circle all the corners with tape and make a couple of stitches in the center so that the loops hold in place.  Then the cardboard is removed and similar work is carried out on other pieces of fabric, only paper templates are taken smaller.  The central stitches are hidden under shiny rhinestones, laid with a flower.  It remains only to attach a hairpin with a glue gun and you can go on holiday to school or kindergarten. </p><h2>  Feminine brooch </h2><p>  From individual segments of a satin ribbon of two colors and delicate lace, you can make a delicate brooch in just a few minutes.  The step-by-step photo clearly shows how they are sewn together and connect the corners to each other.  When the first layer of a dark shade is correctly assembled, work begins on individual elements of a light shade.  Make the petals of a lush flower folded with loops using tweezers and candle fire.  Fold a piece of fabric in half and make a couple of oncoming folds on the slices.  Grabbing the bottom edge with tweezers, hold it to the candle.  The fused edges of the fabric will hold the connection securely. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful ribbon brooch" class="if uuid-3148849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148849.jpg"></div><p>  Loops are placed around the circumference, and lace and many beads are sewn on top.  To make it convenient to attach the brooch to clothes, sew the craft on a felt circle and set an English safety pin.  Everything, the brooch is ready! </p><h2>  Ribbon box bow </h2><p>  To choose a gift that is useful and necessary for a person is half the battle; you still need to beautifully arrange it.  For this, ribbons are most often used.  Let's look at how you can make a lush multi-colored bow from equal segments of a crepe ribbon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gaming.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a magnificent bow from ribbons" class="if uuid-3148965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148965.jpg"></div><p>  Alternately putting on the pieces folded in half with the edges on a needle with a thread, a dense bundle is collected.  Do not forget to pre-melt the cut lines with a candle so that the threads do not split.  Subsequently, it is pulled together with a thread and tied a strong knot.  It is more convenient to attach a bow from a ribbon to a box using a felt mug.  The gift is tied with a ribbon crosswise and glued on top of the bow with hot glue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  New Year card </h2><p>  An original postcard can be made with a child for the New Year.  You will need to pick up a few bright buttons and a satin thin ribbon of green.  The Christmas tree from the ribbon is assembled by folding loops to one and the other side of the "trunk".  In the center, at the junction of the intersection of the segments with each other, put a point with a glue gun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas card made of ribbon" class="if uuid-3148924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148924.jpg"></div><p>  They start making crafts from below, from the largest "branches" and gradually reduce the size of the loops.  In the center, stitch the buttons.  Work will look better on bright cardboard.  From above, you can make an origami star out of paper or fold it from a yellow ribbon. </p><h2>  Ribbon embroidery on fabric </h2><p>  Unusually look paintings with flowers, embroidered satin ribbons of different colors and shades.  For work, you need a special porous fabric, most often it is bought at sewing accessories stores.  It has in its structure small holes for piercing with a needle.  Embroidery on this material is more smooth and accurate. </p><p>  To insert even a thin tape into the eye of the needle, it must be large.  Make a gypsy needle.  It is suitable for both thin and wide strips of fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mycrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery with ribbons on fabric" class="if uuid-3148952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148952.jpg"></div><p>  Hoop the fabric and draw the outline of the future image with a fine or simple pencil.  Then, starting from the wrong side, insert the needle, creating a floral pattern.  If you want to achieve a more voluminous image, then the tape can be turned over or bent a couple of times.  If you need a flat pattern, then straighten the tape with the back to the fabric. </p><h2>  The bow tie </h2><p>  Preparing for the matinee in kindergarten always rests with mom.  In search of a costume, you can spend a lot of time and money.  If it is possible and the most basic sewing and needlework skills, then any woman will cope with sewing a carnival outfit in one evening.  A boy can make a bow tie from a ribbon to suit his shirt.  How to make such an accessory is clearly visible in the step-by-step image below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cutoutandkeep.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bow tie from ribbons" class="if uuid-3148837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148837.jpg"></div><p>  Pick up two satin ribbons of a contrasting color and different widths.  We place the dark wide strip on the bottom, and narrow - decorate the tie on top.  In the photo under No. 1, the segments of tapes were joined together by gluing.  For this purpose, you can use a glue gun or transparent moment glue.  If you have neither one nor the other, just sew them with a neat inner seam.  Pre-melt the edges of the ribbon with a candle so that the threads do not peel. </p><p>  You will get two rings of fabric that need to be folded one on top of the other and tied in the center with a small piece of fabric folded in half.  On this fold, a bow tie can be decorated with a bead or rhinestones.  Then we sew the crafts on an elastic band and tie a satin ribbon bow on the child‚Äôs neck under the collar of the shirt. </p><h2>  New Year's toys from tapes </h2><p>  Such a wonderful holiday - New Year - is always replete with a variety of crafts, especially if a lover of needlework lives in the house.  One of the popular Christmas toys is considered a snowflake.  The craftsmanship made from kanzashi petals looks great.  To create such a Christmas tree pendant, you will need several ribbons of different colors, a glue gun, a candle and tweezers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="br.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kanzashi snowflake" class="if uuid-3148879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148879.jpg"></div><p>  All the petals are made by one of the main techniques of the kanzashi technique.  Consider it carefully: </p><ul><li>  the tape is cut into equal squares; </li><li>  fold the workpiece in half diagonally, and then again; </li><li>  the resulting right-angled triangle is bent again, connecting sharp corners with each other; </li><li>  the back side of the workpiece has many layers of tape, they are squeezed with tweezers, leaving a couple of millimeters of tissue from the outside; </li><li>  bring these slices to the candle fire and when they are melted, press them down with your fingers on both sides; </li><li>  the petal with a strong connection is ready. </li></ul><p>  It remains only to assemble a snowflake from individual elements using hot-melt adhesive and attach a loop for hanging </p><h2>  Christmas ball </h2><p>  Balls made of ribbons are a very beautiful element of decor; they can decorate a room or hang them on a Christmas tree branch.  As a basis, use a foam ball purchased and a thin satin ribbon.  From two opposite sides, the workpiece is pierced with pins with a bead at the end and tightly wrap the tape around the entire perimeter of the ball. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ball of ribbons" class="if uuid-3148833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3148833.jpg"></div><p>  A simple ball looks beautiful, and if you still glue flowers made separately using the kanzashi technique with glue, then the craft will become a real masterpiece.  You can add a beautiful bow to the top and the decor for the room is ready! </p><p>  As you can see, do-it-yourself tape products are easy to do.  Be sure to try starting with simple crafts.  Good luck </p>
