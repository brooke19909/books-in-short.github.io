    <h2>  Hotel reviews by Russians </h2><p>  Since many travelers, when choosing a hotel, are often guided by the impression of people who have already stayed in it, we will give generalized comments from our compatriots regarding their stay at Tsokkos Paradise Village.  In general, it can be noted that for the most part Russians were satisfied with their stay at this hotel. </p><p>  As for the rooms themselves, our tourists found them quite spacious, bright, clean and well furnished.  The furniture here is not new, but it is in very good condition.  The rooms were cleaned regularly.  Sometimes it happened that the maids forgot to change the bedding, but the reception desk quickly solved this problem. </p><p>  A controversial issue is always nutrition.  As for this hotel, most of the guests were satisfied.  True, breakfast seemed to our compatriots a little monotonous, but the quality and taste of the food did not cause any complaints. </p><h2>  Ayia Napa Travel Reviews </h2><p>  The comments of Russians vacationing in this Cyprus resort are for the most part not only positive, but even enthusiastic.  Moreover, this does not depend on the starryness of the hotel or on the budget of the trip.  Moreover, the citizens of Russia, who had previously vacationed in the resorts of Turkey and Egypt, claim that they are far from Cyprus in general and Ayia Napa in particular.  The greatest delight of tourists, of course, is associated with the magnificent beaches of this region.  The azure Mediterranean Sea, picturesque bays and lagoons, clean snow-white sand did not leave anyone indifferent.  Travelers also appreciate the wide range of entertainment offered to tourists in Ayia Napa.  So, in addition to a beach holiday, there are plenty of restaurants, bars, discos and nightclubs.  There is also a great water park.  History buffs enjoyed visiting local attractions.  Summing up, we can say that travelers who have been here advise everyone to definitely come to Ayia Napa. </p>
