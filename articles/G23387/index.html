Holidays in Abkhazia differ from standard holidays on the coast of distant countries. </p><h2>  Abkhazia </h2><p>  The tiny smiling Abkhazia shone again in the arena of the tourist sky.  The status of the Black Sea resort country is gradually returning to it.  Cleanliness and level of service once again attract tourists.  There are no previous ambitions, no pessimism, there is only a single-minded look into the future.  As before, the river cakes toasts at the tables, the pines, pines and cypresses are also fragrant, and, as in former times, the Abkhazian wine is magnificent.  Some omissions are compensated by the cheapness of recreation, improvements in the developing infrastructure, hospitality of the local population and picturesque places of recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday home sunny Abkhazia" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31568/817337.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <p>  The main resorts of Abkhazia are the capital of the country Sukhum, Gagra, Pitsunda, New Athos.  These cities were previously popular among tourists. </p><p>  First of all, a favorable climate attracts.  In the summer beach season from May to October, the air temperature rarely drops below +24 degrees, and the water temperature, even in October, is rarely below +20 degrees.  In the hot months off the coast, sea water warms up to 28 degrees.  A gentle sand and pebble beaches are ideal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Going on vacation to Abkhazia, do not think about choosing a currency.  Everywhere throughout the republic, the Russian ruble is used in calculations.  This simplifies a lot and solves frequently arising economic issues among tourists abroad. </p><h2>  Gagra </h2><p>  The most popular holiday destination in the resort of Gagra is the Solnechny holiday home.
