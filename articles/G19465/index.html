The ribbed surface is very pleasant and comfortable.  The tablet can be firmly held without effort, and it does not slip even in wet hands. </p>

    <h2>  The appearance of the gadget </h2><p>  The weight of 571 grams is quite decent for a 10-inch device.  Opponent devices are usually a bit heavier (for example, the Nexus 10 with a weight of 603 grams and the Apple iPad with a weight of 652 grams).  However, the bezel of the device is very wide, and thus the Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 FHD ME302KL tablet is not very thin, and most likely will not fit in your pocket.  Its dimensions are 264x183x9.5 millimeters, and this makes it impossible to get to the center of the screen with a preview when the device is held with both hands.  Although not very convenient, this feature is common to all 10-inch tablets. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Asus installed an <span>Intel Atom</span> Z2560 processor on this device, which is still a rarity in the Android sector.  This is a dual-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.6 gigahertz.  Intel uses its own Hyper threading technology, which allows you to increase performance and capacity.  The operating system displays four, not two, cores, and the output performance is slightly higher than without the HT function. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the Z2560 is based on x86 and does not support ARM technology, the use of this processor requires special applications.  Unlike the first Atom tablets, most Android programs are now available in a compatible version in the store. </p>

    <p>  The socially integrated SGX 544 MP2 is responsible for the quality of the graphics.  This module has a PowerVR license, which has a very mediocre performance. </p><p>  The gadget has a very good RAM capacity of 2 GB DDR3.  The amount of internal memory is 16 or 32 gigabytes, depending on the model.  Storage space can be expanded up to 32 gigabytes using a microSD card. </p><h2>  Connectivity and widgets </h2><p>  The device has a standard micro-USB port for recharging the battery and connecting to a computer, micro-HDMI, as well as a 3.5 mm jack designed for a headset.  The ports are spacious enough, so their simultaneous use is not difficult. </p><p>  In this model, the Android platform is installed on the 4.2.2 distribution (JellyBean).  Asus has added widgets, as well as several proprietary applications and tools for calibrating color and the equalizer.  Apparently, an updated version of Android is not expected.  In addition, Asus offers the buyer 5 gigabytes of disk space in its own cloud service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Communication, connectivity and GPS </h2><p>  Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 FHD supports Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n with a maximum speed of 150 megabits per second.  The range of use of Fritzbox LTE is quite wide, it allows streaming Full HD-video at a distance of more than 20 meters. </p><p>  The tablet supports Bluetooth 3.0.  In addition, the existing set of functions allows you to connect the device to a TV without cables via Miracast / Wi-Fi Direct. </p><p>  In addition to GPS, electronic compass-like positioning is also available.  GPS localization takes quite a long time - up to 30 seconds, and the result is sometimes mediocre (low accuracy of determination).  This function works even longer indoors and gives more errors, respectively.  Thus, the location should be determined using the Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 FHD me302kl only in open areas. </p><h2>  Cameras and Multimedia Features </h2><p>  The Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 tablet is equipped with two cameras.  The rear has a resolution of 5 megapixels and shows high-quality results in good daylight.  The quality of the images is quite acceptable, but the meaning of using a 10-inch tablet for taking photos is actually not obvious.  The camera records video in Full HD mode with average quality. </p><p>  The front camera has a resolution of 1280x800 pixels.  Pictures taken with it are not suitable for the album, but they look good as avatars in mini-resolution and are suitable for social networks and forums.  In addition, for video calls, the image quality is pretty good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Accessories and completeness </h2><p>  The Asus Memo Pad FHD me302c tablet does not have expensive accessories that are offered with some other devices.  In addition to the tablet, a user guide, a 2A power supply with a USB cable, and a plastic stand are included.  It is made of thin and very inexpensive plastic, disguised as the material from which the tablet body is made.  Asus offers a 24-month international warranty on returning your device in the event of any defect. </p><h2>  Input and control devices </h2><p>  The developer offers his own virtual keyboard for all new devices.  It is worth noting that it is equipped only with basic standard functions and does not have any convenient extras (for example, Swype mode and the ability to change the location of the keys). </p><p>  The Asus Memo Pad 10 FHD <span>touch screen</span> itself supports 10-point multi-touch, which allows you to type with both hands without any problems.  Fingers slide easily across the screen.  In turn, the automatic rotation remains a bit sluggish. </p><p>  Several physical keys located on the device‚Äôs body are quite far from each other.  Thus, users will not mistakenly press the volume button instead of the power button, and vice versa. </p>

    <p>  The processor from Intel allows the device to work very quickly, but sometimes scrolling or opening a new window occurs in jerks.  This is especially often observed when applications run simultaneously in the background. </p><h2>  Display and screen features </h2><p>  The screen for the Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 has a high resolution of 1920x1200 pixels.  Although the pixel density is 240 dpi (lower than on the iPad or Nexus 10), single pixels are not visible even when the tablet is held very close to the eyes.  The device has very good image sharpness and excellent contrast when watching dark videos or game scenes. </p><p>  As this often happens, the screen is glossy, which causes intense reflection of direct sunlight.  The brightness of the screen (294 cd / m¬≤ in the center) can create glare in partial shade. </p><p>  The IPS contrast is 1470: 1, and thus, the screen of the Asus Memo Pad 10 FHD can compete with more expensive devices. </p><p>  Despite the glossy screen, Memo Pad 10 FHD can be used outdoors.  However, direct sunlight is highly advisable to avoid.  Viewing angles are not always good. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusions and Test Results </h2><p>  In general, the completeness of the Asus Memo Pad 10 FHD is very good: the Intel Atom Z2560 is very fast, and the power of the video card is enough for a high-resolution screen.  However, games can sometimes freeze, as the PowerVR graphics device has some drawbacks.  On the other hand, a working memory of 2 gigabytes ensures that applications will open quickly and with only minor errors. </p><p>  The PowerX SGX544MP2, integrated into the Atom Z2560, reproduces 400 MHz graphics.  GPU can very well cope with a screen of 1920x1200 pixels in everyday use.  However, several games with high graphics requirements will freeze a bit, which is a drawback of the Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 me302c. </p><h2>  Additional configurations </h2><p>  The device does not have such additional configuration items as a digitizer or IR sensor for using the tablet as a remote control.  LTE is optionally available on models that are more expensive. </p><p>  Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 me302kl is suitable for use as an e-book, as well as for viewing videos and photos due to its large size. </p><p>  Thanks to the Intel chip, the Internet works perfectly, the connection speed of Memo Pad FHD 10 always remains at a high level.  The performance of the device in the field of data storage is also pleasantly surprising. </p>

    <h2>  Temperature and effect on the operation of the device </h2><p>  Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 me302kl 16gb, of course, is insensitive to small fluctuations in ambient temperature.  In standby mode, the boot time does not change with temperature conditions.  The tablet can be conveniently placed on your lap, but do not let it heat up more than 32 degrees Celsius.  The ribbed back surface promotes air penetration and cooling if the unit is located on a continuous surface.  Intel seems to have good power control.  The processor cooling system is more than sufficient, even with continuous active operation of the device for several hours. </p><h2>  Speakers and sound quality </h2><p>  Both stereo speakers in the Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 16gb produce good sound for this category of devices.  The sound quality is very noticeable, and the highest settings are even reflected by vibration on the fingers.  The sound can also be adapted to any situation through the equalizer application.  Despite the above, Asus Memo Pad 10 FHD is not suitable for use as a stereo element (however, other similar tablets have the same problems). </p><h2>  Power consumption </h2><p>  A high-resolution screen has an appropriate power consumption.  High resolution will have to be compensated with bright background lighting to achieve a sufficiently clear picture.  Therefore, a battery charge above average is obvious when the screen is operating at maximum brightness.  The tablet consumes only 2.8 watts in minimum brightness mode. </p><p>  FHD 10 does not apply to long standby time.  The tablet consumes a bit more power than expected for a device of this category. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  The battery in the Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 me302c model is quite powerful - 6760 mAh.  In fact, the battery life of the tablet‚Äôs battery is quite decent.  As testing shows, the device can operate continuously for 5 hours under heavy load, and more than 7 hours - with Wi-Fi only. </p>

    <p>  Compared to other gadgets of the same price category, these are good results.  However, it is inferior to the battery life of the iPad 4 and Nexus 10 (which is able to function without recharging for more than 10 hours).  It is also worth noting that the battery is non-removable, so its subsequent replacement is impossible.  This does not affect the repair of the Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 if necessary. </p><h2>  Intel and Android - interaction </h2><p>  The Asus Memo Pad FHD 10 tablet lacks a bit of 3D performance.  In particular, graphically demanding applications and games may not work too well and hang regularly.  Perhaps this is one of the most significant shortcomings of the device.  As for working with other applications, the processor easily copes with most of the available modern programs. </p><h2>  Final conclusions </h2><p>  The most striking feature of the Asus Memo Pad FHD 10, reviews of which appeared immediately, is a new screen with a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels.  Thus, the tablet successfully competes with many devices released recently.  However, it is more expensive due to the addition of a virtual keyboard. </p><p>  At the same time, the screen displays slightly dull colors and a slight bluish tint, however, the resolution and brightness compensate for this drawback.  Excellent contrast when viewing a darkened image pleases the eye and allows you to watch movies with night shooting.  The low temperature of the tablet also deserves attention.  The device remains pleasantly cool even during loading, and it is very convenient to hold in your hands thanks to the ribbed back surface. </p><h2>  Who is it for? </h2><p>  Buyers with an unlimited budget who can buy an expensive gadget can neglect this device and purchase for $ 468 the Nexus 10, which has an even higher screen resolution and a fast A15 processor.
