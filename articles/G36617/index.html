    <h2>  Description of the village </h2><p>  What is Priozerye (cottage village, Kaluga region)?  It includes 362 sites, each of which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãsix acres or more. </p><p>  The developer does not offer a mandatory contract for the construction of a house, so each owner who has bought a land plot will be able to decide for himself whether he will build a house or not, and if so, on his own or with the assistance of professional construction crews. </p><p>  You can also order the construction of a cottage according to one of the existing standard projects.  All plots become the property of future owners with the preparation of all necessary documentation. </p>

    <h2>  Reservoir </h2><p>  Not far from the cottage village is a large reservoir with clean water.  On its shores there are sandy beaches.  You can get to it in about seven minutes at a leisurely pace.  The specified reservoir is rather large in size.  Its length is 2.5 kilometers and a width of 700 meters.  Seven years ago, the authorities completely renovated the dam, investing about 20 million rubles in its reconstruction.  The reservoir offers residents of nearby villages all kinds of water activities: excellent fishing, boating, windsurfing, etc. </p><h2>  What else is attractive to Priozerye? </h2><p>  Priozerye (cottage village, Kaluga region), photos of which are presented in the article, are located on a slope from the south side.  Due to this feature of the terrain, the land of the entire site warms up very well, and in the spring snow melts earlier. </p><p>  Hunting lovers will also like accommodation in the village, as it is located near the Ryabtsevskoye hunting farm.  And the latter, in turn, has rich fauna and flora.  It is important that there are no snakes or lizards, so lovers of wandering through the forest can feel completely safe.  But mushrooms and berries are enough for everyone. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Priozerye village is located in an area with a very low level of environmental pollution.  Winds blow here from the southwest towards the metropolis, and not vice versa, and they do not bring smog and exhaust fumes. </p><p>  It is believed that the Maloyaroslavets district allows people to breathe much more freely than, for example, Serpukhov, that is, the atmosphere in the first is much less polluted.  Here are some statistics.  The level of air pollution in the Lyubertsy district of the Moscow region is 10 times higher than in the Kaluga regions.  Due to the good ecological situation, Priozerye is considered the most attractive place for recreation and permanent residence. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits of living </h2><p>  Living conditions in the capital and beyond cannot be compared to any other.  In the first case, this is a complete smog and exhaust gases of millions of cars, in the second - the opportunity to fill your lungs with clean and fresh air every day.  That is why Priozerye (cottage village, Kaluga region) has quite good reviews.  Those who move to a permanent residence outside the metropolis immediately realize what they lacked in the capital - the opportunity to breathe deeply.  The cottage village is praised for its excellent ecology and remoteness from the bustle of the city.  Moreover, the developer made sure that his future residents did not know any inconvenience at all, and provided them with a well-developed infrastructure. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  However, not everyone holds a high opinion of Priozerye.  The cottage village in the Kaluga region receives periodic and negative reviews.  People considering the option to buy a plot here and rebuild the house claim that Priozerye is in complete decline, there is dirt and ruin everywhere in the village, and the management, they write, should be changed. </p><p>  However, the opinion of each person is subjective, and you can make your own only by coming here on your own and seeing everything with your own eyes. </p>
