For recreation, it has an ideal climate, a fantastically beautiful sea, hundreds of entertainment options and dozens of first-class hotels.  Ali Baba Palace 4 * (Hurghada) - one of the best.  He is one of the three hotels owned by a single owner.  Guests can freely visit the territory of any of them, use the beach, pool, participate in entertainment programs and compare which of the three hotels is the best.  Most tourists call Ali Baba Palace. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Ali Baba Palace 4 * (Hurghada) is located in the famous resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVillage Road, 15 km or a 20-minute drive from Hurghada city center.  The international airport from the hotel is located only 8 km, so the road to the place of rest is always short and tireless.  However, aircraft noise or any other inconvenience associated with the proximity of the airport does not exist.  Near the Ali Baba Palace 4 (Hurghada) are the hotels "Jasmine" and "Aladdin", where you can walk freely.  The sea and the beach are a 2-4 minute walk away.  Not far from the hotel is the famous promenade, where at every step there are bars, restaurants, shops with all small things.  Also nearby are three water parks and diving centers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ali Baba Palace 4 Hurghada" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/982766.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Perhaps there is no tourist who would not admire the territory of the Ali Baba Palace 4 * hotel (Hurghada).  The photo captures the alley leading to the beach.  The area is quite large, 120 thousand square meters.  It remains to be wondered how in the deserted Egyptian climate it is possible to create gorgeous flowering gardens in which the hotel is literally buried.  In addition to palm trees and ordinary evergreen trees and shrubs, the hotel has many plants that designers have worked on.  The fruits of their labor are Christmas trees, hearts, welcome signs, geometric shapes.  Walking in such a beautiful area is a pleasure.  On emerald lawns, in the shade of palm trees, there are impressive pools, bars, cafes, sports grounds, a corner with swings for children‚Äôs games, shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ali Baba Palace 4 Hurghada" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/982769.jpg" width="574"></div>
