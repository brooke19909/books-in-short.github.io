Especially popular with our compatriots Antalya with its hotels operating on the "All inclusive" system.  However, do not forget that this country is also washed by the waters of the Marmara, Black and Aegean Seas.  Due to this circumstance, there are resorts in Turkey where the merger of the two seas occurs.  Marmaris, which is one of them, relatively recently began to be mastered by the Russians.  This article is devoted to the features of relaxation at the confluence of the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas. </p>

    <h2>  About Sultan Suleiman and the Unlucky Builder </h2><p>  Marmaris appeared on the map of the Ottoman Empire in 1522.  The name of the city is associated with the name of the Sultan Suleiman, who, according to legend, ordered to hang an architect who built an unprepossessing fortress there, exclaiming: "Mimara as."  However, more credible is the version that it came from the Greek word, which translates as "Shining." </p><p>  In fairness, it should be noted that the city on the coast of the bay near the confluence of the Mediterranean and Aegean seas, which was called Fiskos, appeared at a time when no one had heard of the Turks.  By the 11th century BC  e.  He conducted intensive maritime trade with the countries of the Mediterranean.  Later Fiscos was owned by the Persians, Romans and Byzantines.  It was only at the end of the 14th century that it was captured and plundered by the Turks, who, however, it took another 3 dozen years for him to finally join his empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The construction of a fortress in the 16th century gave a new impetus to the development of Marmaris.  The appearance of this defensive structure made trade safer, which led to the economic prosperity of the city. </p><p>  In 1789, an English flotilla led by Lord Nelson stopped at Marmaris Bay.  The next half century, nothing special happened in the city. </p>

    <h2>  Modern history </h2><p>  In 1957, Marmaris was badly damaged by the earthquake.  Oddly enough, this tragic event gave impetus to the development of the city.  In particular, when it began to be rebuilt, wide avenues, a promenade and modern infrastructure appeared on the map of Marmaris.  However, the transformation of these places into a modern resort began in the 80s, when there appeared a lot of hotels and entertainment venues.  Thanks to an intensive advertising campaign conducted outside of Turkey, tourists from Western Europe began to come there, and in 2000, Russian language began to sound more often there. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Marmaris is located in the south-west of Turkey, on the banks of a picturesque bay.  From the north and east it is surrounded by mountains and pine forests. </p><p>  The question of which sea in Marmaris, Aegean or Mediterranean, can be heard quite often.  Although guidebooks often write that the resort is located in a place “where they merge in a kiss”, in reality this is not at all the case.  The city of Marmaris itself is located on the Mediterranean coast, and the meeting place of the latter with the Aegean is located a little to the west, before reaching the city of Dalaman, where the nearest international airport is located. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Now that you know what sea Marmaris is in Turkey, it's time to find out when to go.  So, the climate on this stretch of the coast of Turkey is Mediterranean.  This means that the best time to visit Marmaris in Turkey is June (beginning of the month) and September.  The holiday season here begins in late May.  The warmest in Marmaris in August.  However, even then there is much more pleasant weather than in Antalya.  As for winter, the water temperature in the sea at Marmaris drops below 20 degrees in mid-autumn, so from the 20th of October all the hotels will close at the resort. </p><p>  If you are interested in precipitation, then throughout the season the resort practically does not rain and the weather is sunny. </p><h2>  Main beach </h2><p>  Reviews about the sea in Marmaris are usually admired.  But it could not be otherwise, since the beaches of the resort are protected by a bay in which there are no high waves. </p><p>  In addition, Marmaris is attractive for lovers of diving and photographing the underwater world. </p><p>  The main beach of the city is located in the very center of the resort.  It is sandy and quite long.  The disadvantages include the small width and the fact that in places at the entrance to the water sand is replaced by pebbles.  This makes the main <span>beach of Marmaris</span> not the best place to relax with young children, especially since there is quite a lot of people there.  At the same time, “party people” are very fond of him, as right along the beach line there are many bars, cafes and discos where you can have fun, including at night. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Other beaches </h2><p>  Couples and tourists who come to rest in Marmaris with children prefer to stay in hotels that are outside the city limits.  The best choice for them are hotels located in the village of Icmeler, where there is a clean and comfortable beach that received the <span>Blue Flag.</span>  It has water slides and attractions for young children. </p><p>  A great place to sunbathe and swim, is located in Turunc.  The beach of this village is picturesque and surrounded by conifers, which is very useful for people with lung and respiratory problems. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Want to know which sea in Marmaris is best for diving?  Judging by the reviews of fans of this type of active sport, the most interesting dive sites are located near small islands located in the Aegean Sea.  There are great diving spots on the Mediterranean stretch of the coast of Marmaris.  These include dive sites at Cape Kutyuk, Haitly and Sary-Mehmet, at the Inje Burun and Kadyrga lighthouses, coastal waters off the Jennet and Karga islands, as well as Aksu and Abdi Reis bays.

    <h2>  Boat trips </h2><p>  Among the activities in the resort of Marmaris, boat trips to explore the islands of the Aegean Sea are especially popular.  For example, many tourists recommend visiting Sedir.  Such a sea excursion involves a walk along the Kekova Bay and relaxation on the beach with special sand.  According to legend, Cedar once housed the summer residence of Queen Cleopatra.  <span>Mark Anthony,</span> who decided to provide maximum comfort to his royal sweetheart, ordered several barges of sand to be brought from Egypt and poured onto the beach so that she would not experience the inconvenience of walking on pebbles. </p><p>  Tourists can enjoy the boat trip along the Dalyan River Delta, where there are giant turtles sailing to these protected places to lay eggs. </p><h2>  Natural wonders </h2><p>  The main attraction of Marmaris is the sea.  It is hard to say which place to choose in order to see the most beautiful landscapes.  Many advise to take a boat trip to the <span>islands of the Aegean</span> .  If wide beaches stretch for many kilometers along the Mediterranean coastal line, then you can see high steep banks and picturesque cliffs. </p><p>  In addition, everyone who comes to Marmaris is recommended to go to Pamukkale.  This place is really worth seeing.  Legends were made about his beauty back in the days of Cleopatra.  In Pamukkale, water, saturated with mineral salts, falls from high rocky ledges, forming a kind of terrace.  It is collected in pools in which the water temperature always keeps at +37 degrees Celsius. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  To find out which sea in Marmaris is more suitable for a beach holiday, it is best to ask those who have already visited this resort.  It turns out that both the Mediterranean and the Aegean have their pros and cons.  In particular, the latter is considered to be cleaner, but it is cooler and there are almost always at least small waves there.  As for the Mediterranean Sea, it is warmer, and the excitement in Marmaris Bay for most of the swimming season is very slight.  Some tourists pay attention to the degree of salinity of the water, which is much lower in the Aegean. </p><p>  Now you know what to expect from a holiday in the Turkish resort of Marmaris.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, they leave this resort with the best impressions and recommend it to everyone, in whose mind a successful vacation is not associated with lazy hours of lying on the beach. </p>
