However, the surrounding cities of this region include many <span>interesting places.</span>  By visiting them, you can learn more about the history of the country.  One of them is the Small Earth memorial.  Novorossiysk, in the vicinity of which it is located, cannot be called the most popular city for a beach holiday.  But excursions to the memorial are arranged from many resort villages.  The place can be reached by car or public transport.  It is located directly on the outskirts of Novorossiysk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk memorial small land" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/294348.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What will the Small Earth memorial tell visitors?  Novorossiysk during the Great Patriotic War was captured by enemies.  But on a small plot of land, Soviet troops held a long heroic defense, which subsequently allowed the development of a counterattack and the liberation of the city.  This victory caused significant damage to the enemy and weakened his strength.  Historians agree that the liberation of Novorossiysk was one of the important stages in the battle for the freedom of the Caucasus.  After that, our troops were able to conduct powerful offensive operations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="small land Novorossiysk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/294342.jpg" width="600"></div>

The defense lasted as long as 225 days (from February 4 to September 16, 1943), after which the bridgehead became the starting point for the offensive and helped liberate Novorossiysk.  The Small Earth memorial is a symbol of courage, courage and solidarity of the Russian people. </p><p>  At the moment, the entrance to the Museum of Military Equipment and the Gallery of Glory, which are located inside the monument, is open for visitors.  The composition itself was made in the form of a warship, on which the heroic landing of the sea landing was carried out under the leadership of Ts. L. Kunikov.  The dynamic image is complemented by bas-reliefs depicting sailors and soldiers. </p><p>  The Small Earth memorial (Novorossiysk) includes the Gallery of Glory, which houses bas-reliefs of <span>Heroes of the Soviet Union,</span> memory boards with instructions from regiments and troops that took part in the battles for the city.  In the center of the gallery is a sculptural composition with a mosaic panel, where the oath of fighters is written, and in the capsule "Heart" are the names of the dead. </p><p>  The entire territory of the memorial is protected and is under special protection of the state.  Here, fragments of guns, ditches and trenches, fortifications and command posts have been preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="small land Novorossiysk map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/294356.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <p>  In order to see this place with their own eyes and to honor the memory of the dead, tourists visit the memorial "Small Land".  Novorossiysk, the map of which necessarily contains an indication of the location of the bridgehead, most often serves as a starting point on this journey. </p><p>  The memorial gained particular popularity in the Soviet Union after the release of the book by Leonid Brezhnev.  He published his military memoirs in 1978 and called "Small Earth".  Novorossiysk still keeps a memory of the fighting on the bridgehead, the memories of which were described by Brezhnev in this book, which diverged in millions of copies throughout the country. </p>
