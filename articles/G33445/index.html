Such accessories can easily transform your look and add charm and charm.  Making an artificial flower from a fabric on a dress is a whole science.  Although novice needlewomen can cope with simple flowers for a baby‚Äôs outfit, this will not require any special expenses.  But for inflorescences, which are as similar as possible to real ones, skill, patience and hard work are necessary. </p><p>  Creating flowers from fabric on a dress, you can update and refresh your wardrobe.  Also, such products are a wonderful gift. </p><h2>  The origin of artificial flowers </h2><p>  Such accessories are a great addition to any outfit with the right selection of textures and shades.  Every woman, whether a child or a lady of age, loves jewelry.  They can be absolutely any, and the sewn flowers on a dress made of fabric with your own hands are generally unique and inimitable! </p><p>  Note that the use of cloth flowers for clothing decor came to us from ancient times.  Even in ancient China and Egypt, similar art was developed, and wonderful crafts of craftsmen were insanely expensive.  It was customary to water such flowers abundantly with perfume to attract the opposite sex.  Decoration of the image with fabric inflorescences was accessible only to rich and noble ladies, for commoners this pleasure was closed.  But time passed, and in the Renaissance, the French established a wide production of such a decor - accordingly, it became much cheaper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="finished organza flowers" class="if uuid-2725353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2725353.jpg"></div><p>  And nowadays, the amount of inexpensive materials and decor has flooded the markets, so anyone can make such a miracle - there would be a desire! </p><h2>  Accessory Versatility </h2><p>  Fabric flowers are appropriate in any case: at a wedding, a party, a funeral, for going to restaurants, for walks, etc. Such a universality as a flower made of fabric on dresses, T-shirts, jackets - but anywhere - does not have any decoration.  It is clear that such products must be correctly selected - the important role is played by the shade, size, texture.  There is a whole direction of creating beauty from the material, called it "silk floristry."  The result of the activity is stunning flowers, completely indistinguishable from real ones.  This art has become quite popular and recognized as official - as well as origami. </p><h2>  Where can i use it? </h2><p>  A small flower can revive and add a festive atmosphere to anyone, even on a cloudy day.  And when you make it with your own hands - it will become even more pleasant.  When wearing flowers from fabric on dresses, there are several important rules: </p><p>  For example, for the office, it is better to choose a decoration that does not attract too much attention.  Lush and vibrant flowers with rich decor may not fit into the business style.  A strict official outfit will be revived by a discreet monophonic rose, and a small chrysanthemum will fit perfectly with a white blouse. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But for a walk you can choose a larger and brighter jewelry, but also do not borsch with stones, sparkles - leave this for special occasions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pacountrycrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric flower on the belt" class="if uuid-2725368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2725368.jpg"></div><p>  For a romantic look, make flowers from organza or chiffon, for a more ordinary look - denim. </p><p>  And finally, for an evening dress, pick up a beautiful, large decoration, sparkling with rhinestones.  Interesting options are obtained when they combine the opposite.  A chic image, for example, in contrast to the splendor of clothing and the dullness of the decoration. </p><p>  Textile decor is remarkable in that it can make any outfits festive.  Attach beautiful fabric flowers to your dress for a walk and you will get a vibrant look. </p><p>  A separate theme is wedding textile decor.  As a rule, these are delicate pastel or white flowers, but the original ones are also possible - red, black.  Use a fabric such as satin, chiffon or silk. </p><p>  Flower arrangements, in addition to bridesmaid dresses, are also placed in the hairdo, on the shoes, as well as for the groom‚Äôs boutonniere. </p><h2>  Most used fabric </h2><p>  When creating colors use: </p><ol><li>  Organza (necessarily artificial), the flowers from it will turn out delicate, light, airy. </li><li>  Silk fabrics.  They are usually taken for a luxurious evening dress.  Silk has the property of elegantly, elegantly overflowing, the product is luxurious, which is absolutely not suitable for use during the day. </li><li>  Satin fabric is also an evening option, which is great for weddings. </li><li>  Chiffon fabric - for delicate delicate flowers. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="thediymommy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="making petals" class="if uuid-2725350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2725350.jpg"></div><p>  In general, any materials are used to create colors.  The only condition is a beautiful color, a suitable texture and, preferably, a natural composition.  Such fabric holds folds well, leaves turn out more tender and graceful.  Synthetic puffs, and get an exquisite look is unrealistic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Do not try to use expensive material to make your first flower.  Stock up on simpler, cheaper materials.  And only having acquired some skills, feel free to take expensive fabric and accessories. </p><h2>  How to make flowers on a dress made of fabric with your own hands in a simple way? </h2><p>  It is much easier to go the easy way and get a flower in the store, but how interesting it is to create everything with your own hands!  You will not find such an accessory in anyone - it is unique!  To make flowers you need to purchase: </p><ul><li>  material; </li><li>  needles with thread; </li><li>  beads, rhinestones, sequins; </li><li>  candles or an alcohol lamp. </li></ul><p>  Be sure to be patient - you will need it! </p><div class="photo" data-original="pt.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric flowers on carnival dress" class="if uuid-2725362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2725362.jpg"></div><p>  To give the inflorescences a natural color, the leaves are stained with special dyes.  Well, if there are none, then take ink or gouache.  Sometimes they dye the entire canvas of the material, but it happens that the petals are already cut out. </p><p>  The fastest way to make flowers is to twist from a strip of fabric.  This is done very simply! </p><p>  To work, you need: </p><ul><li>  burlap or linen; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  lace; </li><li>  beads. </li></ul><p>  First, cut a strip of fabric 10 cm wide and about a meter long.  To create a flower in the style of Provence, glue lace onto a strip. </p><p>  Next, fold the inside out and bend on one side at an angle of 45 degrees. </p><p>  Twist the resulting sharp corner and begin to twist the strip, while wrapping around the center. </p><p>  Fill the end of the strip under the flower, on the lower side, and fix with glue.  Also gently glue every place with a poor fit to the fabric strip. </p><p>  From a felt, cut out a circle of a suitable size and glue it from the bottom to the rosette.  Attach the clasp. </p><p>  The brooch is ready! </p><h2>  Weightless inflorescences - organza accessories </h2><p>  A very delicate and airy flower of tremendous beauty can be made from this airy matter.  How to sew a fabric flower on an organza dress? </p><p>  First, cut a few circles of various sizes.  If there is such an opportunity, it is better if smaller details are darker, medium ones are lighter, and the largest extreme ones are light.  The greater the number of petals in your flower, the more voluminous it will turn out. </p><p>  So, the petals were cut, now on a candle flame process them so that the edges melt, but do not turn black! </p><div class="photo" data-original="fabricflowers.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="processing petals over a candle" class="if uuid-2725359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2725359.jpg"></div><p>  Insert elements into each other, starting from large to smaller.  Carefully sew and attach stamens purchased either from a bundle of thread, or sew on beads and stones. </p><p>  From a thick, non-crumbling fabric, cut out a circle that is suitable in size and glue it while attaching the clasp.  Done! </p><p>  Such a flower uncomplicated in manufacture will become an excellent decorative accessory for everyday occasions, as well as for a celebration! </p><h2>  Bright flower made of chiffon ribbon </h2><p>  The accent in clothes will be a voluminous, unusual element that will attract the attention of others. </p><p>  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  dress or t-shirt; </li><li>  2.65 m chiffon ribbon about five centimeters wide; </li><li>  40 cm of a narrow green ribbon; </li><li>  needle with thread. </li></ul><p>  We cut a wide ribbon into 10 segments of 25 cm. We process the edges with fire so that they do not crumble.  Now each piece must be folded in 4-7 layers, fixed from one edge with pins. </p><p>  On the bodice of the dress, lay out the first 5 petals in a circle.  The middle remains free.  Sew with a needle and thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing petals" class="if uuid-2725000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2725000.jpg"></div><p>  Next we sew another 5 petals, securing them closer to the center. </p><p>  We make the middle of the fifteen centimeters of the remaining tape, folding it with a bow. </p><p>  Cut the green ribbon into 2 parts and sew them as stems. </p><p>  That's all, a bright flower is made! </p><p>  It can be located anywhere - in the middle, side, down on the skirt - as you like! </p><h2>  Flowers on a fabric dress, photo for inspiration </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers on a baby dress" class="if uuid-2725383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2725383.jpg"></div><p>  You can embroider the entire fabric of your dress with fabric colors, choosing a shade of fabric for their manufacture that is well suited to the main fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brassyapple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers on dress" class="if uuid-2725389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2725389.jpg"></div><p>  And you can attach such an accessory only in one place, for example, on the shoulder. </p>
