This city lured many influential personalities to itself, inspired new achievements and left a good mark in their activities.  What is so in the described area and whether it is worth visiting - read on. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Bad Ischl is located in Austria, namely, in the federal state of Upper Austria, in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSalzkammergut (translated from German means ‚Äúpantry of salt‚Äù).  It is here that there are many salt and mineral springs whose properties will help to improve health. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.interkultur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salzkammergut. This city" class="if uuid-3123552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3123552.jpg"></div><p>  Bad Ischl is washed by two rivers: Traun and Ischl.  In addition to them, you can swim in local lakes, of which there are more than seventy (some of the water is even suitable for consumption).  Also, the area can be viewed from above thanks to the Eastern Alps mountain range. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  At first, Bad Ischl was a famous center where salt traders gathered.  Which is not surprising, because the territory is rich in relevant mines.  A small province was slowly but surely becoming a popular resort. </p><p>  People came here not so much for beautiful views and wonderful heritage of architecture, as for a healthy vacation.  Doctors examined the composition of the water sources and concluded that there is a lot of similarity with seawater, but with a higher level of mineralization.  This contributed to greater treatment effectiveness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city received universal recognition in 1827.  The Habsburg couple decided to visit the place with healing power, and the result was the birth of the future ruler and his three brothers.  It is worth noting the fact that before the arrival of Archduke Sofia Habsburg suffered from infertility. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelscherer.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bad ischl how to get" class="if uuid-3123538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3123538.jpg"></div><p>  About twenty years later, Franz Joseph I arrived in Bad Ischl. Here, the man met his future wife Elizabeth.  Maybe here not only health is stabilized, but love is also located?  For more than thirty years, Franz and his empress spent time in the described town, in the Imperial Villa, which, without hesitation, was called a real paradise on earth. </p><p>  Not only the ruler came to taste this land.  Many composers drew inspiration from the environment and leisurely people.  So, Franz Lehar, while living here, wrote twenty-four operettas. </p><h2>  Healer City </h2><p>  In the twenties of the last century, Bad Ischl was proclaimed a therapeutic balneological resort.  Why? </p><p>  As previously indicated, the city is rich in healing springs (sulfur, salt and mineral).  A specific composition is able to positively affect different systems of the human body.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  Sulphate, chloride, sodium and sulphide waters are used for baths and drinking.  They treat gastrointestinal diseases and gynecological ailments, stabilize the nervous system. </li><li>  Silt sulphide muds are especially good in applications and wraps. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.interkultur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bad ischl austria" class="if uuid-3123535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3123535.jpg"></div><p>  The environment also has a beneficial effect on the functioning of the respiratory tract, the cardiovascular system and the strengthening of the musculoskeletal system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The attractions of Bad Ischl impress with their scale.  So, the mast-s list includes: </p><ol><li>  The summer residence of Kaiser Franz Joseph.  The villa has a beautiful course with columns and a tympanum.  Around the building is a landscaped English park with a fountain and a small house of white marble. </li><li>  The ruins of the castle Wildenstein.  The remnants of the palace themselves may not surprise, but the observation deck is another matter.  The location of the former castle offers a wonderful view of the valley along Traun. </li><li>  Villa Lehara is the place where the famous Austro-Hungarian composer lived.  The building itself is quite modest and stylish, but here you can feel the creative atmosphere. </li><li>  Photo Museum in the Marble Palace.  True admirers of photography will appreciate the collection of works by Hans Frank, as well as fall in love with old cameras. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bad ischl sights" class="if uuid-3123549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99521/3123549.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, one should also see the parish church of St. Nicholas, the tea house of the Empress Elizabeth and the confectionery ‚ÄúZauner‚Äù. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Enthusiastic reviews of Bad Ischle indicate that there is something to do.  The first in the list of entertainment will be the cable car to the alpine pasture Catherine (at an altitude of 1,400 m).  From here, human eyes are invited to enjoy the breathtaking panorama of the area. </p><p>  Speaking of mountains.  Fans of extreme sports will definitely appreciate the following entertainment.
