    <p>  In connection with the events of the last decade in the North Caucasus, journalists often used the name ‚ÄúTaman Panzer Division‚Äù.  This is not entirely correct, since the motorized rifle division, however, has a tank regiment in its composition.  There are both missile and self-propelled artillery, but from this the division did not become either missile or artillery. </p><p>  However, few people today know that during the war there was another <span>military unit</span> with a very similar name. </p><p>  One of the elite units of the Russian (formerly <span>Soviet) army</span> will soon be returned to its formidable form of name, glorified by glory.  At the suggestion of the President of the Russian Federation, the 2nd Guards Taman Division will be revived, the status of which in the process of military reform was reduced to brigade.  This unit should not be confused with the 89th Armenian division, which distinguished itself at about the same time and fought there, in the Kuban, in the North Caucasus.  A further story will go about her. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the Red Army of the pre-war period, some combat units were formed on a national basis, in particular, there were six Armenian divisions in the Soviet armed forces.  Their specifics consisted of a good level of preparation for warfare in the highlands.  <span>The military doctrine of the</span> late 30s implied decisive offensive actions, and for their successful implementation it was necessary to overcome the mountain ranges and master the oil fields in Romania.  The nationality of most of the personnel was not advertised, but the future Taman division received the unofficial name of the 89th Armenian Rifle. </p><p>  For their intended purpose, they failed to apply mountain skills, had to fight on their territory, and the losses were considerable.  Since 1943, Nver Gevorkovich Saforyan was appointed 89th Commander.  His name is associated with the heroic page of the military annals of the unit, which has become a legend. </p>

    <p>  August 1943  The headquarters of the Supreme High Command voices the task: to crack the Germans' defense on <span>Mount Dolgaya.</span>  This height has become the key to mastering the Taman Peninsula.  The regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yervand Karapetyan, fearlessly launched an attack.  <span>Senior sergeant</span> Avetisyan repeated the feat of Alexander Matrosov, he closed the embrasure with his body.  In those hot days, ordinary Karakhanyan and Arakelyan, showing heroism, were awarded the golden stars of the <span>Hero of the Soviet Union.</span>  The result of these bloody battles was the liberation of Taman.  In honor of this peninsula, the division received its formidable name in October of that year. </p><p>  Then there were difficult milestones of war, the liberation of Kerch, Crimea.  For manifested mass heroism, the two regiments were awarded the title of Sevastopol.  One of the first 89th Taman divisions reached the Soviet border, crossed Poland, and then rushed to the enemy‚Äôs den, to Germany.  Here, on the steaming ruins of the Reichstag, her warriors celebrated Victory by dancing Kochari (Armenian folk dance). </p><p>  Of course, during the war years the ethnic composition of the unit changed.  The Armenian Taman division suffered losses, received replenishment, and again went into battle. </p><p>  In the postwar years, the national units of the Soviet army were abolished.  In 1956, the 89th Taman Division was disbanded. </p>
