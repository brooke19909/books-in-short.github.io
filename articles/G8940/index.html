Photos and Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  China is a mysterious country.  The poverty of its indigenous population, ability to work and fertility, as well as the quality of the goods produced by them, are included in the proverbs.  There are legends about the Chinese mafia with the telling name "Triad".  <span>Eastern wisdom</span> and philosophy nurtured here can be discussed for hours.  Symbols of the country are tea cups, graceful pagodas, majestic temples.  And another city, more precisely, the administrative center, called Hong Kong. </p><h2>  First impression </h2>

But it was Hong Kong that became more widespread.  Photos of this unique region of the <span>PRC (People</span> 's Republic of China) can be found in all travel guides and brochures of travel agencies.  There is nothing surprising in the wide popularity of the region.  After all, the financial center of all of Asia is concentrated here.  By the way, one of the largest economic centers in the world is also Hong Kong!  Photos of the business part of the district are impressive with the number of banks, representative offices of various international companies and corporations.  It is also noteworthy that, being populated by record densely, this part of China is the greenest and most environmentally friendly.  Here, 80% of residents use public transport, and the personal one is dominated by bicycle.  At peak times, the streets are literally laden with brisk two-wheeled "cars."  At this time, a fascinating sight is Hong Kong.  Photos of <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãlandscapes</span> taken in the morning when people go to work, or in the evening when they get home, attract with their unusualness.  And we got used to kilometer traffic jams of cars!

It stretched along the Kowloon Peninsula and spread out on another 260 islands.  On three sides - western, southern and eastern - the sea is washed by the territory (South China).  In the north, its borders are in contact with Shenzhen (Guangdong Province).  Hong Kong (photos make it possible to join its exoticism) is territorially divided into 3 unequal parts: the island of the same name, as well as the Kowloon Peninsula and New Territories.  Impressive residential skyscrapers rise above the first island.  And the streets of the second are a continuous live stream.  There is Hong Kong on the left bank of the picturesque river, the third largest in China, - Pearl River.  Pronounced, of course, the name is quite complicated, but it translates very romantic and elegant - pearl!  And the name of the island and the region itself sounds no less attractive and attractive - the fragrant harbor.  It is connected with long trading traditions: once the best incense and fragrant wood were sold here in China.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The center of Hong Kong, however, like most of this area, is a highly urbanized territory.  It is famous for a huge number of skyscrapers, in their region 1223 are built, most of which are located on the central island.  In general, the place is unique in its unique flavor.  If you are looking for that corner of the earth where East and West meet, then go to the center of Hong Kong, you will find many amazing discoveries.  Here on neighboring streets peacefully coexist small Chinese restaurants with national dishes, incense shops, traditional medicine and luxury hotels, luxurious, state-of-the-art cinemas, European-style cafes, the ubiquitous McDonald's, and even <span>Catholic churches.</span>  Western culture is closely intertwined in Hong Kong with eastern traditions and philosophical teachings.  Such tolerance can also be learned by Europeans!  The island has its own Avenue of Stars, the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, the Museum of Art, the Philharmonic and many other national and cultural heritage.  Well, of course, we must not forget about nightlife.  Cantopop-style music flourishes in Hong Kong, and most nightclubs and bars have a must-have karaoke center.  Every night, the sky above the center is colored with all the colors of the rainbow thanks to the laser air shows that have become traditional here. </p><h2>  Skyscrapers, skyscrapers ... </h2><p>  And now the famous <span>skyscrapers of Hong Kong.</span>  The photo, of course, cannot convey their impressive and majestic sizes, but still ... To the curious: for their number in the Chinese region exceeds the number of these buildings in New York!  The height of 272 skyscrapers exceeds 150 m, 112 climbed under the clouds themselves, to a height of 180 m, and 52 altogether surpasses 200 m. Their inhabitants literally side by side with birds.  The main part of the skyscrapers is built in the northern part of Hong Kong, they filled with Kowloon.  In the remaining regions there are fewer skyscrapers, but also enough.  And now, the numbers and facts: the tallest building in Hong Kong is the first tower of the International Commercial Center (484 meters, 118 floors, 4th place in the world in size), then comes the same structure, but its second tower (415 meters, 88 floors and even a two-story elevator).  On the third place of the high-altitude Olympus is the Central Plaza, which has the shape of a triangle.  Building parameters: height - 374 m, floors (above ground) - 78. The roof is decorated with a one-of-a-kind light clock.  In addition to those listed, Hong Kong boasts many other equally original and impressive towers! </p>
