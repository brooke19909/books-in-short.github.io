Beeline has a huge number of such services.  But today we have to learn how to connect and disconnect just one additional opportunity - the ‚ÄúHome Region‚Äù (‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù).  How to connect it?  Why is it needed at all?  Is this offer profitable?  And what if you want to refuse to use this option?  We have to find out about all this now.  Let‚Äôs get down to business as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline home region how to connect" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879431.jpg" width="581"></div>

    <h2>  About option </h2><p>  Before using the tariff "Home region" ("Beeline"), you must clearly understand how it operates.  Indeed, sometimes some options are simply not needed by everyone. </p><p>  The thing is that the opportunity we have chosen today is what will help us communicate with the Central Region of Russia at the cost of your home region.  Of course, depending on the available tariff plan.  For connection you have to pay only 10 rubles. </p><p>  Next you will have to pay a monthly fee.  It is 90 rubles per month.  Not so much, considering all the benefits.  Of course, this tariff is ideal for outgoing customers, those with relatives or close friends living in the Central region of Russia.  As you can see, the Beeline company has the Home Region, the description of which we gave - this is a great opportunity to save and extend conversations with a certain area at the same time.  Very good offer.  But now it‚Äôs worth talking about how to connect this option.  And now we will figure it out. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  The first option that you can offer is nothing more than the use of communication offices in your city.  They will help you not only connect any additional features, but also learn important information for the subscriber. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activate the service Beeline home region" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879432.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In order to bring the idea to life, just bring along your passport (just in case) and a mobile phone, and then visit the nearest communication office of our today's operator.  Say that you are interested in the service "Home region" ("Beeline").  How to connect this option to the phone?  This is actually not your concern.  Give the phone to the office worker, and if necessary, provide your passport data.  This is a completely normal process - it is with it that you can identify the true owner of the SIM card. </p><p>  All you have to do now is wait a while.  An office worker will independently do all the necessary processes, after which he will give you a mobile phone with an already connected option.  That's all the problems are solved. </p><p>  In fact, this option is not very popular.  After all, for him, as a rule, a rather large period of time is required.  And for this reason, customers are thinking about other connection methods.  Which ones?  Let's try to understand this difficult matter. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Special combinations </h2><p>  The second method, already more suitable and popular, is the sending of special requests.  They are activated using the so-called USSD commands.  Each mobile operator has such combinations.  But how to use them? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff home region beeline" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879433.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <p>  You decided to get the service "Home region" ("Beeline").  How to connect it without visits to cellular offices?  Just dial * 110 * 241 # on your mobile phone, and then press the call key.  After that you can activate the service. </p><p>  You will begin sending the request.  Its processing, as a rule, takes about 5-10 minutes.  After it is completed, you will receive a special SMS notification that will help you figure out whether the option is connected or not.  And if not, for what reasons. </p><p>  It should also be noted that the cost of connecting the service is 50 rubles.  If you do not have enough funds on your mobile, it is better to replenish your account in advance.  Otherwise, you will receive a notification asking you to deposit the required amount to the balance, and then try again.  That's all the problems are solved.  Only this is far from all that can be offered.  After all, the operator <span>"Beeline" ("Home Region") connects in</span> different ways.  And there are quite a few of them.  Let‚Äôs figure out what else is offered to customers. </p><h2>  We call the operator </h2><p>  Well, here's another pretty interesting approach.  The thing is that you can always call the operator, and then connect / disconnect a variety of additional service packages.  In fact, it is quite simple and fast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deactivate the service Beeline home region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879434.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Do you want to start using the "Home Region" ("Beeline") service?  How to connect it to yourself and start using?  Just dial 0611 on your mobile phone, and then press the call button.  Now wait for the response of the operator. </p><p>  As soon as they answer you, let us know that you would like to activate the service.  Further (if necessary) inform the operator of your passport data.  He, in turn, will tell you the details of the selected tariff, as well as inform about the cost of connection.  Simply agree with him and then wait a while. </p><p>  After you finish the conversation, it remains to receive an SMS alert.  It will say that you have successfully started using the "Home Region" ("Beeline") service.  How to connect the opportunity in other ways?  Let's try to find out about them. </p><h2>  Team Calls </h2><p>  There is also an approach that helps customers quickly start connecting additional services.  With all this, you do not have to talk to the operator or go to the nearest cellular office.  After all, a certain team comes to the rescue.  And this is far from a USSD request. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline home region description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879435.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that some telecom operators come up with additional activation numbers for certain services.  They "call" during which the request is sent and connected.  The action of this approach is somewhat similar to a USSD request. </p><p>  So, you wanted to try the service "Home Region" ("Beeline").  How to connect it to yourself?  To do this, dial the combination 0674 09 241 and press the call button.  Now it remains only to sit and wait for the result.  Incidentally, he does not require a long wait.  After all, such a ‚Äúcall‚Äù is processed very quickly - 1-2 minutes.  Receive an SMS alert, and then enjoy the results.  The main thing is that you have more than 50 rubles on your phone.  But there is one more modern and already popular approach to the solution of the task set before us today.  Deactivate the service "Home region" ("Beeline"), as well as connect it using the Internet. </p><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  But how to do that?  To implement the idea, go to the official Beeline website and go through authorization there.  It should be noted right away that it is available only to subscribers of this mobile operator. </p><p>  After that, go to the "Services" section.  Find "Home Region" there and click on this line.  You will see a list of possible actions.  You can activate the service "Home region" ("Beeline") by clicking on the appropriate command in the list.  It turns off in a similar way.  That's all the problems are solved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline home region connection" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/879436.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What do customers choose? </h2><p>  Today we met you with possible options for connecting additional options (in particular, "Home Region") on a mobile phone from the Beeline operator.  As you can see, there are a lot of them.  But what do customers choose? </p><p>  As a rule, now many advanced users prefer to use the Internet and the web page of a mobile operator.  In second place are USSD requests and special command numbers.  Next are personal visits to the office.  In last place is a call to the operator.  All this is because now when you try to talk with a living person, you can run into an answering machine.  And then the whole connection process takes 20-30 minutes.  And this is not very happy.  It‚Äôs not so difficult to activate the ‚ÄúHome Region‚Äù (Beeline) service, as it may seem at the very beginning. </p>
