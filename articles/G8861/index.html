(China): product overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is unlikely that any of the users of the Meizu brand smartphone purchased it in a regular store.  Such units, as a rule, are bought through the Internet, which causes a feeling of mistrust in the buyer.  Will everything be all right with the phone?  But will something happen on the road?  Is it worth trusting a Chinese-made device?  As for the first two questions, then you are unlikely to get an answer in the near future, since the phone is released relatively recently.  But on the account of the Meizu manufacturing country and brand quality, we will talk further. </p><h2>  Where did Meizu come from? </h2><p>  Meizu Technology is one of the most high-tech and reliable companies in the modern market.  This brand has successfully established itself since 2003.  Under the name "Meizu" began to be produced all kinds of portable devices and communications.  Particularly noteworthy are branded smartphones that are distinguished by functionality, quality and an interesting design.  Of course, prejudice against the manufacturing country ‚ÄúMeise‚Äù noticeably reduces the number of customers, however, phones are still successfully sold in many European countries and even in the United States. </p><p>  Until some time, under this brand, no more than one smartphone was produced per year, however, today the company has significantly accelerated the production pace.  The expansion of the assortment benefited the organization, significantly increasing the place of the Chinese brand among the top European and American smartphones.  Today, it can be said with a great deal of certainty that the Meizu mobile phones fully justify their value.  This is also evidenced by many positive reviews, which you can read in the following sections. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The advantages of Chinese smartphones </h2><p>  To make it easier for readers to trust the little-known Meise brand, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the main advantages of Chinese phones, which can be purchased at a much lower price than any iPhone.  These smartphones are a good combination of the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>  excellent performance; </li><li>  high build quality; </li><li>  wide functionality. <div class="photo" data-original="www.expertsystem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cube with plus and minus" class="if uuid-3174410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3174410.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Due to the high level of competition, Meizu is forced to annually produce more and more smartphones that differ from their previous counterparts in their functions and improved parameters.  In addition, the design of the phones is changing. </p><p>  Also an important factor for buyers is the price.  Thinking about how much the Meizu phone costs?  As a rule, the figure varies from 6 to 40 thousand rubles (depending on the characteristics and available functions).  Therefore, each buyer will be able to choose a phone to his taste, based on individual preferences and pricing. </p><h2>  Characteristics of the latest smartphones </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, Meisu products are constantly being improved in order to remain on par with well-known brands.  However, adding the amount of internal memory to the phone and using a more powerful processor is far from all that the company needs to maintain its place in the production race.  The manufacturer must constantly develop new, unique things that will become not only useful, but also in demand among a wide range of users.  Here are just a few of the enhancements that are characteristic of new smartphone models: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the use of a steel supporting frame, ensuring the strength of the device; </li><li>  introduction of a multifunctional touch button; </li><li>  application of a proprietary Flyme shell, which gives a stylish design. </li></ul><p>  Also of particular note is the operating system, which has absorbed all the best innovations from iOS and Android.  Phones do not lose performance even with a small amount of RAM, and the number of simultaneously open applications has virtually no effect on the quality of their work.  Therefore, if you decide to find yourself the best model of the Meizu phone, then it will be extremely difficult to do this, since almost all of them fully justify their value.  In the following sections, you will find a more detailed overview of the most common smartphones of this brand. </p><h2>  Meizu MX2 </h2><p>  This model is one of the most successful creations of Meizu Technology Co., Ltd, which embodied the most daring ideas.  Built-in additional features of the smartphone will forever forget about the long and tedious search for the necessary application on the network.  Simply download a special program and enter the name of the application in it.  After that you need to start the download. </p><p>  Also, this phone is considered one of the first in which the capabilities of the central touch button were expanded.  From now on, the user can perform a lot of useful actions using one convenient menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techandgeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu MX2 in the hands of the owner" class="if uuid-3174379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3174379.jpg"></div><p>  Also, the potential built-in high-speed camera, which will capture the most significant moments of your life, deserves the attention of potential customers.  You don‚Äôt have to worry that the device‚Äôs memory will not be enough to save all the photos.  Sixteen gigabytes is not only enough to save several thousand high-quality pictures in 1080p format, but also to upload several films.  Well, the price of 15 thousand rubles will please even the most picky buyer.  Although, if this amount seems to you too large, you can always choose a simpler model.  In this case, the phone will have less internal memory, but the basic functions will remain the same. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Meizu MX2 smartphone is one of the most frequently bought on the Internet.  Most owners are extremely positive about this brand and the MX line.  However, you can still find dissatisfied buyers who say that their device often turns off by itself or starts to work slowly while connected to the Internet.  True or not, it is difficult to verify.  However, the manufacturer assures that it will easily replace defective devices with new ones if the buyer can prove the presence of technical problems.  It will be enough to shoot a short video in which it will be shown that the smartphone does not work at all as stated by the company. </p><h2>  Meizu MX3 </h2><p>  This model of the Chinese phone is one of the most reliable and harmonious.  By technical characteristics, the smartphone is not inferior to even the most popular branded counterparts.  Of the characteristic features, it is most often customary to highlight a neat appearance, a large display and excellent sound, allowing you to enjoy your favorite tracks even without using headphones.  The Meizu phone is also capable of working offline for quite some time.  This is a great option for an experienced user who appreciates not only high reliability, but also multifunctionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone Meizu MX3" class="if uuid-3174384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3174384.jpg"></div><p>  A few words should be said about the camera phone.  It allows the user to take high-quality photos and videos in 4K format.  In addition, there is an action shooting mode that makes this model incredibly useful for those people who like to travel or engage in extreme sports.  A special case made of durable steel will allow the phone to withstand falls even from great heights.  Well, armored glass will protect the touch screen from most mechanical damage.  As for the cost of such a gadget, it varies from 15 to 24 thousand rubles. </p><p>  According to online reviews, the Meizu smartphone of this model is one of the best on the market and can even compete with iPhones.  Of course, most buyers will be flattering to speak about the device just purchased, but there are those people who write reviews after a few months or even years after operation.  The main problem of the device is the poor build quality of the charger.  It simply breaks down after several months of operation, after which you have to order a new device via the Internet.  In other cases, customers note a nice design, user-friendly interface and useful phone features. </p><h2>  Meizu MX4 and MX4 Pro </h2><p>  Meizu (China) also offers customers to purchase one of two modern models that do not have fundamental design differences, but diverge in some details.  For example, the professional model uses a more advanced hardware platform, and the screen resolution is slightly higher.  This phone is usually bought by professional photographers who do not want to carry an expensive camera with them everywhere, but at the same time do not refuse high-quality photos taken from a mobile device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pocketnow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smartphone Meizu MX4" class="if uuid-3174387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3174387.jpg"></div><p>  As for the classic version, its main difference from the third model is the presence of a hardware button, which has a built-in fingerprint scanner.  This function instantly won the attention of lovers of innovation, since it is not in every device.  The model has a good indicator of internal memory and has a good processor, which allows the phone to work as quickly as possible.  Also, one cannot fail to mention the increase in resolution of the front camera, which is so appreciated by photography enthusiasts. </p><p>  A few words need to be written about the reviews about this device.  Many buyers are delighted with the fingerprint scanning system, which, judging by their words, is in no way inferior to the iPhone.  In addition, users often compare this model with Samsung Galaxy, but at the same time claim that the design of the Chinese smartphone is much more attractive and suitable for both sexes.  But the number of negative reviews is extremely small.  Unless some customers are unhappy with the overpriced cost of the product, which is almost 30 thousand rubles.  However, do not forget that on different sites a smartphone can cost differently. </p><h2>  Meizu MX5 and MX6 </h2><p>  These two phones should be divided into one category, since they are not much different from each other and even have almost the same price.  Both devices use the Android 5.1 operating system and have a 5.5-inch screen, which allows you to watch videos with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels.  The sensor is protected by a special convex glass, which has a special coating.  As for the camera, a choice of 13 and 5 megapixels.  A large amount of RAM and a powerful battery allow the smartphone to never let its owner down.  How much is the Meizu MX5 and MX6?  It all depends on the amount of internal memory, but the price rarely exceeds 35 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stuff.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu MX5 and Meizu MX6." class="if uuid-3174390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3174390.jpg"></div><p>  Many people admire the fact that in the manufacturing country Meizu managed to create such a high-quality product.  Of course, few are satisfied with the price of 35 thousand, but let's be honest - the phone has the same functions as the new iPhone models, which often cost more than 70 thousand.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the price is quite high.  By itself, the "filling" of the device will cost at least 30 thousand.  A Chinese company at least does not overestimate the price of a brand. </p><h2>  Meizu M5c </h2><p>  A stylish and inexpensive smartphone, which is an excellent continuation of the M-series.  The design is made of special polycarbonate, which allows the phone not only to get a unique appearance, but also to protect itself from falls.  The device is equipped with two slots for SIM cards, switching between them is carried out with one touch.  Well, a large amount of internal memory allows the phone to work properly even with a constant Internet connection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tehnot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu M5c - a budget smartphone" class="if uuid-3174398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3174398.jpg"></div><p>  Most reviews about this device are written by users who are businessmen or entrepreneurs.  Most often, they note the ability to quickly switch between a "working" and a "home" SIM card.  Also, users are delighted with the possibility of connecting to WiFi, which eliminates the need to spend Internet traffic during a lunch break in a cafe or in hotel rooms. </p><h2>  Meizu Pro7 and Pro7 Plus </h2><p>  These devices have been specially designed for those people who need a single screen.  On the rear panel there is another sensor with images, which can be used to view time, weather or other functions.  In addition, this phone is characterized by high performance, which provides one of the best Helio P25 processors and a large amount of RAM.  Despite such impressive characteristics, power consumption remains at a minimum level, so it turns out to use the phone for a longer time than any analogs based on the Android operating system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadgetbytenepal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu Pro 7 with two displays" class="if uuid-3174403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3174403.jpg"></div><p>  In most cases, the device is purchased by young girls who particularly appreciate the stylish design.  Many buyers believe that it is quite similar to Apple's style.  In their reviews, buyers focus on the beautiful rear panel, which is made of special steel.  It shimmers in the sun and even gives a slight reflection.  Of course, users just can't help but mention the dual-screen feature and how best to use it.  The only drawback of the phone is the weak camera, which does not always allow you to take a high-quality picture or video. </p><h2>  Meizu M6s </h2><p>  The manufacturing country "Meizu" produces quite good processors, which many cellular companies are actively using to produce their gadgets.  A vivid example is the M6s phone, which is based on the Exynos processor with a fingerprint scanner located on the side panel of the gadget.  Another distinctive feature of the model is its widescreen display with rounded edges, which gives the phone an additional appeal.  Well, the front camera with 8 megapixels will not leave indifferent any person who likes to take selfies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beetelbite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu M6s blue" class="if uuid-3174405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97863/3174405.jpg"></div><p>  Particularly picky users note that the company is too much copying the products of Western companies.  In addition, judging by online reviews, the cost of the device is a bit overpriced.  As for the positive comments, they mention the quality of the camera, a convenient display, as well as the ability to quickly unlock using the already mentioned sensor.  This is a very good phone for those who want to purchase a high-quality model that will last for many years. </p><h2>  Video and conclusion </h2><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="rzfm3wke4YA" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzfm3wke4YA" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/2/6/7/16267.jpg"></div><p>  We hope that our article helped you understand that phones from the Meizu company are a pretty good alternative to modern high-tech gadgets, which often cost too much.  However, do not forget that you can buy smartphones of this company only on the Internet.  Therefore, it is best to order courier delivery so that no troubles happen on the way with the phone.  Also, do not forget that Meizu phone repair services can only be found in China, and this imposes very serious restrictions.  Indeed, in the event of a breakdown, you will have to send the device at your own expense back to the country of origin of the goods. </p>
