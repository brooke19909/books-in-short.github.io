    <h2>  Classification </h2><p>  The exhumation of the body, like many other processes, has its own classification.  It was proposed back in 1966.  There are officially permitted exhumations, which are also called legitimate.  These are those that are carried out with a forensic purpose due to the transfer of a corpse or a whole cemetery to another place in order to identify a buried person (these are cases that are in no way connected with the investigative or criminal investigation).  And finally, such an exhumation of the body can be carried out for historical or scientific purposes.  This is the most extensive class.  There are two more - this is random exhumation (i.e. body detection during the dismantling of a building or during excavation works), as well as criminal.  The latter is usually carried out with the purpose of abuse of the corpse, looting and, no matter how terrible it may sound, necrophilia. </p>

    <h2>  Documentary position </h2><p>  Exhumation is a very responsible and serious process, and, based on its specifics, it is certified with documents.  First of all, the authorities who appoint the process directly establish the place where the body is buried.  During exhumation, a forensic expert, a representative of the court or the investigating authorities, witnesses, a person working in a cemetery, and loved ones of the deceased must be present.  An appropriate protocol is also being drawn up.  It designates the place where the exhumation was carried out (this is most often a cemetery), describe the tombstone (sometimes attach a photograph), note the state of the coffin and at what depth it is located.  The next step is a description of the contents of the coffin.  Everything that is in it should be recognized by the relatives or friends of the deceased.  The exhumed body is subjected to either a primary or secondary autopsy.  Often thanks to this it turns out to obtain very important information, which sometimes becomes even evidence in the case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Reason for </h2><p>  Most often, exhumation is a way to find evidence by <span>opening a corpse</span> or re-identifying it.  The reasons for its conduct are the availability of information about the criminal burial of the body that is conducting the investigation.  They also decide to conduct exhumation if a forensic or pathological study has not been conducted.  There may still be a need if the information obtained during the initial examination turned out to be incomplete or during the investigation there were reasonable doubts about their plausibility.  And finally, it may have been necessary to extract any objects that were buried with the deceased.  Often it turns out to find what should not be in the grave. </p>

    <h2>  The exhumations talked about </h2><p>  There are such cases of the extraction of a deceased person, which have long been talked about.  These include, for example, the exhumation of Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol.  This was done in order to transport the ashes of the great writer to the Novodevichy cemetery.  And how many rumors gave rise to Hitler's exhumation, about which they spoke literally last year?  Although in fact a little later it turned out that this was not the Fuhrer‚Äôs body, but just a person very similar to him.  However, despite this, an entire expedition went to Brazil (it was there that Hitler was exhumed, or rather, a copy of him).  A couple of years ago, even the idea arose of extracting the remains of Stalin from the earth.  But what significance this would have for science was never found out, so this idea had no continuation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Training </h2><p>  Exhumation requires prior preparation.  First, the goal pursued by the researchers should be indicated.  Secondly, it is necessary to determine how realistic it will be to achieve it.  You also need to remember that the buried body will not be the same as on the day of its burial - after all, over a certain period of time, it decomposes and undergoes other changes that can affect the course of research.  They are both insignificant and quite significant.  It all depends on how long the body has been in the burial place, what are its conditions (geographical and meteorological), where the deceased is buried (in the ground, in a funeral urn, in water or in a crypt).  What matters is what kind of clothes the corpse was wearing. </p>

    <h2>  Burial Act </h2><p>  And finally, a few words about how to bury the body again after the exhumation of the corpse was carried out.  A whole funeral law has been drafted, which presents certain environmental and sanitary requirements.  It is necessary that a place with good soil be chosen - it must be dry, and at least 2 meters deep.  It is not permitted to bury a corpse where there may be a chance of collapses and destructions.  If necessary, it is necessary to carry out engineering training at the place where the burial is planned.  And finally, you need to choose a good coffin - either from wood or from a material that is subject to the influence of mineralization.  And, of course, this burial is recorded by the employee of the cemetery, indicating that the body was exhumed earlier.  Of course, an ordinary person will not do all of the above - there are appropriate authorities for this.  However, one should still know about the specifics of this process, especially if it is to be. </p>
