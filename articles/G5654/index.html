Note that this brand has a good reputation.  Domestic consumers have more than once had the opportunity to verify the reliability and quality of this product.  However, there are also not very successful models from this manufacturer, which received many complaints from the owners.  Let's take a closer look at what AEG brand products are, and also look at reviews of some models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theplymouthkitchencompany.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trademark logo" class="if uuid-2234948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2234948.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of washing machines </h2><p>  In the model range of the manufacturer AEG there are no budget items.  All products belong to the middle segment and premium class.  They, of course, differ in content and functionality.  However, all devices have a number of undeniable advantages.  Let's look at them. </p><ul><li>  Great build. </li><li>  Durable materials. </li><li>  A large assortment.  <span>Narrow</span> AEG <span>washing machines</span> are popular.  In the reviews, buyers also highlight devices with vertical loading. </li><li>  Long service life.  The manufacturer claims that the equipment will work flawlessly for at least 10 years. </li><li>  Durable tank material.  It is made of polymer alloy. </li><li>  The wash is of high quality, there are special modes for dealing with stains. </li><li>  High degree of protection. </li><li>  Low noise. </li><li>  Convenience and ease of use. </li><li>  Stylish design. </li></ul><h2>  Consider the disadvantages </h2><p>  Unfortunately, even such quality products have disadvantages.  What exactly are users talking about in the comments? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Pretty high cost. </li><li>  It may be difficult to obtain spare parts.  Most often you have to order them. </li><li>  There are models in the line that are equipped with low-quality seals and bearings.  Problems with them arise after 2-3 years of operation. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.midacucine.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="AEG Washing Machine Reviews" class="if uuid-2234947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2234947.jpg"></div><h2>  AEG L87695 WD </h2><p>  An excellent washing machine with a frontal type of loading laundry.  It has standard dimensions: 850 √ó 600 √ó 600 mm.  The dimensions of the case, of course, are rather big, but they are justified by the volume of the drum (up to 9 kg).  The device is equipped with a drying function.  In one cycle, you can load no more than 7 kg, otherwise the laundry will be wet at the exit.  The performance classes of all parameters are A. The developers have installed complete leakage protection.  Automatic programs (14) are enough to wash things from any kind of fabric. </p><p>  What is the advantage of an AEG washing machine?  User reviews helped compile a list of benefits: </p><ul><li>  Possibility of washing a large number of things. </li><li>  Steaming and drying. </li><li>  Timer. </li><li>  Temperature correction. </li><li>  The quality of the wash. </li></ul><p>  This model has only one drawback - noisy operation in the drying mode. </p><h2>  AEG L58527XFL washing machine: reviews and brief specifications </h2><p>  The average cost of this model is about 66,000 rubles.  And many buyers consider this a significant drawback.  In addition, other disadvantages were noticed.  The owners include the following points to them: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Noisy pump. </li><li>  High sensitivity to power surges. </li><li>  Poor bearing.  Its replacement costs about 20 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Non-separable tank, which significantly increases the cost of repair in case of breakdown. </li></ul><p>  But even with such disadvantages, this model has a lot of fans.  This group of people responds positively to the impeccable quality of washing, a huge number of programs, the ability to make adjustments to the temperature regime and change the spin speed.  They did not forget about the stylish design, so that the washing machine becomes an adornment of the bathroom or kitchen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-collantes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews on the washing machine AEG L 58527 XFL" class="if uuid-2234946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2234946.jpg"></div><p>  Now let's talk briefly about the characteristics. </p><ul><li>  Drum capacity - 7 kg. </li><li>  Efficiency: washing - A, food - A ++ (0.11 kW * h / kg), water consumption - 49 l, spin - B (1200 rpm). </li><li>  The display is digital. </li><li>  Management is intellectual. </li><li>  Automatic programs - 16. </li><li>  Leakage protection is complete. </li><li>  Delayed start - up to 20 hours. </li><li>  The material of the tank is plastic. </li></ul><h2>  AEG L574270SL </h2><p>  Let's look at the reviews of the AEG L574270SL washing machine.  Like most models of this manufacturer, this instance deserves the attention of buyers.  Its cost, of course, is not low (about 45,000 rubles), but the functionality and quality fully justify the price.  Up to 6.5 kg can be loaded per wash.  Although the device does not belong to a narrow category, it has small dimensions - the height and width are standard, but the depth is only 45 cm. The hatch is located on the front panel.  The door opens 180 ¬∞, making it very convenient to put even large items in the drum.  Users are offered 16 automatic programs.  Of these, the most popular: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  for denim items; </li><li>  for down jackets, blankets, pillows; </li><li>  antiallergic regimen; </li><li>  quick wash - the process takes only 20 minutes. </li></ul><p>  Are there any drawbacks to this model?  No weighty!  But some comments nevertheless slip through in the reviews.  Unfortunately, the AEG washing machine with the L574270SL index is not equipped with programs for 40-60 minutes.  If you do not use the fast mode, then the shortest cycle time will take as much as 1.5 hours.  Some owners also complain about the noise the pump makes when draining water.  Well, if you find fault with a lot, then the disadvantages include the size of the compartment for detergents.  Some users say that it is somewhat small and therefore inconvenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jak-zrobutu.pp.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews on the washing machine AEG AMS7000U" class="if uuid-2234949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2234949.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews on the washing machine AEG AMS7000U </h2><p>  In the comments, buyers praised the AMS7000U washing machine very much.  It has attracted the attention of many thanks to its original design and quality assembly.  Although its price varies within 40 thousand rubles, the device is really worth the money.  Owners in the comments focus on the efficiency of the device.  Electricity consumption is limited to 0.13 kWh / kg (class A ++), and water - 49 l per cycle.  Spinning things up is of high quality, even if the speed is not the highest.  The maximum model capability in this mode is 1000 revolutions.  According to the owners, this is the only drawback, since for 40 thousand rubles there are already devices developing a speed of 1200 rpm.  The rest of the reviews on the AEG AMS7000U washing machine are positive.  The model is equipped with perfectly selected automatic programs with optimal values.  Users noticed that even having the ability to change the temperature, they do not, because there is simply no need.  But besides these points, there is another significant advantage.  It's about quiet work.  Surprisingly, even when spinning things, the device does not vibrate and does not make loud sounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.topocentras.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews on the washing machine AEG L61470WDBI" class="if uuid-2234950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2234950.jpg"></div><h2>  AEG L61470 WDBI </h2><p>  Positive feedback on AEG washing machines is left not only by women, but also by men.  And as you know, the latter are not guided by emotions, so you can trust their opinion.  In the assortment of this manufacturer there are not only stand-alone instances, but also built-in ones.  According to most, the L61470 WDBI is an excellent model.  It is quite roomy (7 kg), but not bulky (height - 820 mm, width - 600 mm, and depth - 550 mm).  The model has many advantages.  Users consider them functionality (drying, a large number of washing programs), a high level of efficiency (class A), and complete protection against leaks.  You can also change the temperature of water heating manually, which allows you to gently wash things from different fabrics.  In the comments, the owners pay attention to the fact that the manufacturer has provided special modes with which you can save up to 20-25% of electricity. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there were some shortcomings here.  Users noticed that if the drum was heavily filled with things for drying, the result was crumpled and wrinkled laundry.  The maximum load in this operating mode should not exceed 4 kg (according to the instructions), but in fact it is better to use 2.5-3 kg per cycle. </p><h2>  Top Loading Washing Machine Reviews </h2><p>  Vertical washing machines AEG reviews also get great.  The lineup is filled with interesting specimens.  For example, consider the low-cost device L 60260 TL.  You can buy it on average for 25 thousand rubles.  For this money, the user gets an excellent washing machine with a spacious tank - up to 6 kg.  Moreover, we note that this did not affect the dimensions.  The device has a small width - only 40 cm. Users say that this model can be installed even in the smallest bathroom.  What else did you like this machine?  First of all, an effective extraction (1200 vol.) And a high class of washing (A).  As for efficiency?  Responses of owners say that this model allowed them to reduce, and significantly, the cost of electricity (A +) and water (45 l).  Achieving such efficient resource consumption has become possible thanks to the implemented OptiSense option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.getprice.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vertical washing machines AEG" class="if uuid-2234951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2234951.jpg"></div><p>  There is another interesting model in the arsenal of this manufacturer - AEG L 76260 TL.  This AEG washing machine is also not offended by reviews.  Most buyers drew attention to it because of a very valuable function.  It's about steaming.  Given that you can purchase the device for only 25-30 thousand rubles, this functionality can be safely called ideal.  The owners noticed another technology - Protex Plus.  What is it for?  Thanks to this option, any fabrics, even the thinnest, never deform when washing, as the process itself is very careful.  In terms of efficiency, this device suits the most demanding customers.  Despite the fact that steam processing is implemented here, electricity is consumed rather economically (A ++) - approximately 180 kW / h will be spent per year. </p>
