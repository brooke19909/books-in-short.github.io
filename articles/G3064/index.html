  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uprising of 1113: Prerequisites and Exodus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the history of Kievan Rus, 1113 is known as the date of the Kiev Uprising.  These events were relatively short-lived, but brought significant changes to both the ordinary people and the ruling elite. </p><h2>  The foreign policy of the princes until 1113 </h2><p>  Vladimir Monomakh was actively fighting the Polovtsy, who often raided the cities and villages of Russia.  In 1109, Dmitry Ivorovich led the Russian army against the Polovtsy, during the campaign the army passed along the Seversky Donets, ruining the camps of hostile Polovtsian khans along the way. </p><p>  In 1111, a new campaign was undertaken, the result of which was another victory over the army of nomads.  During a fierce battle, the enemies were driven back far from the borders of Kievan Rus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="history-doc.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1113 year" class="if uuid-2510680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2510680.jpg"></div><p>  Thanks to active hostilities and the use of a tactical plan, the people managed to achieve peace for some time in relations with neighboring states.  However, during this period, relations between the princes became hardened. </p><h2>  The situation in the country </h2><p>  Before the events of 1113, social tension in Russia increased every day.  The clergy, princes, warriors, and boyars constantly increased requisitions and taxes levied on peasants and artisans.  Ordinary people were in distress.  Many farmers, due to a complete lack of money, were forced to borrow tools, seeds and land from the rich.  At the same time, it was not possible to repay debts with a constantly growing interest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this respect, usurers in large cities were especially distinguished.  They gave people money on loan at prohibitively high interest rates.  Grand Duke Svyatopolk was no exception. </p><p>  Endless exactions for military operations worsened the situation of the people, because the entire contents of the squad also fell on the shoulders of ordinary people.  During the period of wars, Polovtsy often raided, burned entire cities and villages, took people prisoner, took away property. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bukvi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1113 year event" class="if uuid-2511263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2511263.jpg"></div><h2>  Death of Prince Svyatopolk </h2><p>  The situation was aggravated by the death of Prince Svyatopolk.  According to the records of those years, she was extremely strange and suspicious.  A day ago, the prince completely defended the Easter service, and already after dinner he began to complain about a strong malaise.  The next day he died.  Immediately after this event, a struggle for the throne broke out.  3 powerful clans claimed power, such events became the prerequisite for the riots of 1113. </p><p>  One of the applicants was Oleg, the oldest of the descendants of Svyatoslav, but he was constantly seriously ill.  His brother Davyd did not fight for the throne, since he completely departed from politics.  Here was Yaroslav of Murom.  Numerous boyars spoke for the Svyatoslavichs.  For them, these candidates were ideally suited, since the Svyatoslavichs defended the interests of them and the Jewish community. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the other hand, <span>Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh</span> could have entered the struggle for power <span>,</span> but he decided to step into the shadows.  He explained his actions by reluctance to contradict the decision of the <span>Lubech Congress,</span> which states that "everyone owns his own homeland." </p><p>  The son of the late prince Svyatopolk and the Jewish concubine Yaroslav Volynsky acted as the third applicant. </p><h2>  Course of the uprising </h2><p>  Each applicant for power had support in the person of princes and clergy.  Many were against the reign of the Svyatoslavichs, since with them there was a great probability of unrest, civil strife and wars.  However, the heirs of Svyatopolk also did not suit many.  Hatred for Svyatopolk, all his entourage and Jews, for a long time found a way out - the inhabitants of Kiev staged a pogrom in the estate of the thousand Vyshatich and went to the Jewish quarter.  It was this event that the uprising of 1113 began. </p><p>  Moneylenders of Kiev managed to hide in the synagogue, but their houses were destroyed.  After this turn of events, representatives of the clergy, the boyars and the family of the late prince became worried.  All of them were afraid to lose their property and suffer during the riots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="history-repetitor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1113 uprising" class="if uuid-2508701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2508701.jpg"></div><p>  Help in establishing peace could Vladimir Monomakh.  He was supported not only by the top authorities, but also by ordinary people.  During his life, Monomakh has gained a reputation as a judicious, fair prince and a brilliant commander.  As soon as Monomakh agreed to rule and arrived in Kiev, the riots immediately stopped. </p>
