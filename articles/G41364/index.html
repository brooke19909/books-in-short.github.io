After all, impressions from the rest largely depend on this.  Especially if most of the vacation is planned to be held at the hotel.  Therefore, <span>modern travelers</span> try to take care of the hotel ahead of time.  They study the official description, consult with managers from travel agencies, and also try to get acquainted with the reviews left by real people who have visited this or that place.  Thanks to this, you can learn not only about the advantages, but also about a number of disadvantages, which will help you not to make a mistake in choosing.  After all, no one wants, having arrived on a long-awaited vacation, to experience disappointment and regret the money spent.  To save you time and effort, we bring to your attention the generalized comments of tourists from Russia who recently had a rest in the Happy Life Village Dahab hotel.  The reviews of our compatriots, we immediately notice, are overwhelmingly positive.  So, travelers were satisfied with the hotel, service and cost of living.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="happy life village dahab reviews" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1038233.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, all apartments are quite spacious, clean, bright.  They have good furniture, all appliances are in working condition.  If some kind of breakdown happens, then after contacting the reception it will be eliminated as soon as possible.  As our compatriots note, despite the fact that the maids regularly replenish the supplies of shower gel and shampoo in the bathroom, it is advisable to take them from home.  The fact is that for many tourists they seemed to be not of high enough quality. </p><p>  As for cleaning, the guests were generally satisfied with its quality.  Guests also note that maids regularly make funny towels on the beds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="happy life village dahab 4 dahab" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1038234.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  As for the location of Happy Life Village Dahab 4 *, here the opinions of travelers are somewhat divided.  So, some guests did not like the fact that the hotel is located at a fairly large distance both from Sharm El Sheikh and the airport, and from the nearest city of Dahab.  However, most tourists argue that this fact should be considered at the planning stage of the trip.  So, if you want to walk around the neighborhood every day and visit bars, restaurants, shops, bazaars, etc., then it makes sense to choose a hotel in Sharm El Sheikh or another resort city.  And Happy Life Village welcomes travelers who want to relax for a few days from the noise and relax in a relaxed atmosphere, enjoying the bright sun and magnificent sea.  However, according to them, you can also leave for Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh if ‚Äã‚Äãyou wish.  So, in Dahab, a bus leaves the hotel three times a day, travel on which is free.  And in Sharm El Sheikh you can take a taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="happy life village dahab 4 reviews" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1038235.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, almost all guests were satisfied with their own territory of the Happy Life Village Dahab 4 * hotel <span>(Dahab, Egypt)</span> .  So, according to them, there are a lot of places for walking.  The territory itself is clean, well-groomed.  Despite the fact that it is large enough, it will not take you a lot of time to get from one infrastructure object to another.  Therefore, travelers are advised vacationers traveling here not to focus on exactly in which building to settle.  Indeed, even from the most distant building you can reach the sea in five minutes. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In general, this paragraph did not cause any particular complaints from our compatriots.  So, most hotel guests claim that the food here is very tasty, the menu is quite diverse.  Every day you will have the opportunity to try some new dish.  Of course, you don‚Äôt have to rely on any delicacies here, because this is a budget four-star hotel.  However, you will definitely not be able to stay hungry here. </p><p>  By the way, experienced travelers advise choosing the option ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù rather than ‚Äúhalf board‚Äù when booking a room.  The fact is that in the first case, you can eat at the hotel around the clock and order almost any drink.  But for guests who have paid half board, even water is provided for a fee.  By the way, as tourists note, the staff of Happy Life Village strictly follow this, so it is unlikely that it will be possible to conduct the employees of the bar and restaurant.  So it will be much easier to pay a little more for a ticket, but at the same time not to experience difficulties during your stay at the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Since the Happy Life Village Dahab 3 * hotel (by the way, in Germany, for example, it is regarded as a "three" and not a "four") is located on the shore, its guests will be able to fully enjoy the sun and sea.  So, you can reach the hotel‚Äôs own beach in a maximum of five minutes from anywhere in the hotel.  There is a bar and there are many sun loungers and parasols.  Mattresses are also provided.  The beach worker will bring them to your deck chair.  By the way, as some tourists say, if you want to sit on a deck chair closer to the pontoon, then it makes sense to occupy it early in the morning.  However, free sunbeds in other places you can find at any time of the day. </p><p>  The beach itself is sandy, clean.  You can enter the water both from the shore and from the pontoon.  But in the first case, you will have to go to the depth for quite some time.  The bottom is rocky, corals are found.  Therefore, it is not recommended to enter the water without special shoes.  From the pontoon, you can go down immediately to the depths.  Near the coast is a fairly large coral reef with a variety of interesting inhabitants.  Therefore, be sure to "arm yourself" with a mask for snorkeling and optional flippers. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Since Happy Life Village Dahab 4 * is mainly designed for a relaxed, calm and leisurely vacation, there is no special entertainment program here.  So, on the territory of the hotel there are several sports grounds where you can play tennis, volleyball.  In addition, during the day, animators offer everyone to do aqua aerobics, gymnastics, water polo.  Once a week, the hotel complex hosts a show of visiting artists. </p><p>  Our compatriots in their reviews note that they were satisfied with the hotel pools.  There are several of them, in one there are water slides.  According to the guests, the water in the pools is very warm and clean.  Next to them are equipped with sun terraces, there are sun loungers, there are also bars where you can both have a snack during the day with junk food and treat yourself to your favorite drink. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  As for the work of the staff of Happy Life Village Dahab, then in general it is quite satisfied with the guests.  However, there are some nuances.  So, according to tourists, almost none of the employees speak Russian.  Therefore, you will have to explain yourself in the hotel in English.  No special knowledge is required for this, but some of our compatriots expressed some dissatisfaction with this matter. </p>
