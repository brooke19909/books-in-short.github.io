And this can be understood.  After all, Spain is a sunny, friendly, vibrant country, with a rich history and cultural heritage.  So the desire of people to move to these places is understandable.  Well, it is worthwhile to consider in more detail the question regarding how much the property in Spain costs, where to buy housing and, finally, what is needed to design a home abroad. </p>

    <h2>  Price factors </h2><p>  So, it‚Äôs important to understand that houses in Spain have different costs.  And it, according to reviews, depends on where the property is located, in how popular the place is, what is its total area, as well as the arrangement itself.  So, for example, those objects that are located on a quiet coast, far from megacities, cost much less, unlike those houses that are located in prestigious areas or developed, densely populated cities.  Also, the price varies depending on the number of floors, distance from the sea, the presence of a garage, pool or a separate, private parking. </p><p>  But there is a choice, and a lot.  And all because houses in Spain have long become a kind of trend.  Such objects, especially in rich and prestigious areas, are acquired by wealthy people and connoisseurs of beauty from around the world.  And the reason here is not only in fashion.  Reviews indicate that it has a very pleasant, mild climate, an abundance of clean, spacious beaches, a high standard of living and a well-developed infrastructure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  One of the most popular resorts </h2><p>  Costa Blanca is one of the most popular Mediterranean ‚Äústripes‚Äù of the Spanish coast.  Here, perhaps, the most prestigious houses in Spain.  But the cost is appropriate.  Perhaps not for a well-fed European wallet, but for Russians, especially with average earnings, certainly.  For example, a two-story villa in Calpe, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe plot is 1237 square meters, five living rooms, four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a swimming pool, a fully landscaped plot and 200 meters to the sea.  Pretty luxurious description!  But the price is the same: such a house in Spain will cost approximately 280,000 euros, and this is only the cost of real estate (not including paying for the work of a realtor, preparation of documents, etc.). </p>

    <h2>  Expensive options </h2><p>  In principle, any home in Spain by the sea is not cheap.  But as they say, there is no limit to perfection, and this expression also applies to real estate.  You can find a mansion for a million euros - this is not the edge.  But take, for example, a house with more modest "indicators" than the above-described villa.  It will have only three living rooms, only two bedrooms, the same 2 bathrooms, and to the sea not 200, but 1500 meters.  The plot area is smaller, and much more, it is only 800 square meters.  But why then is this house in Spain worth 370 thousand euros?  100,000 more expensive than the previous, richer in description.  It all depends on the design of the site.  Palm trees, exotic plants and trees, the villa‚Äôs special style, good restaurants and clubs nearby - that‚Äôs why you have to pay extra money for which you can also buy a nice apartment in Spain.  So, reviews warn, choosing a property in this resort country, it is necessary to carefully study all the offers and pay attention to all such nuances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Selection up to 100,000 euros </h2><p>  Not every person who wants to become the owner of a house on the <span>coast of Spain</span> has hundreds of thousands of euros.  At first glance it seems that this is not so much.  But if you recall what the course is today, then a comparison immediately appears: 100,000 euros - this is 7.8 million rubles.  If you plan to spend approximately the same amount on the purchase of real estate in Spain, then you can rejoice: such offers are also available. </p><p>  For example, a house for 95,000 euros, located in Almeria.  A small town in the south-east of the country with a population of 200,000 people.  Cozy, resort, well developed - here you can buy a house 100 meters from the beach with a view overlooking the sights at a very reasonable price (compared to the options described above).  Three rooms, 85 square meters of living space - this is enough to feel like a happy host of life. </p><p>  In the same Costa Blanca you can find a small cottage with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã109 square meters.  m and right on the seashore.  140,000 euros - the real price for such a house. </p>

    <h2>  Luxury for Millionaires </h2><p>  But what is the most expensive house in Spain?  Its price can be tens of millions.  It all depends on the whims of the rich man who wished to become his master.  But for sale put up cottages with mansions, designed for real buyers.  For example, a villa in Barcelona for almost two million euros.  Suburb, 200 meters from the sea, a picturesque view of the forest.  360 sq.  m of living space, six comfortable rooms, fashionable style will completely satisfy the request of a person who appreciates the style and fashionable design of houses. </p><p>  In Girona, according to reviews, no less cheap real estate.  The house, erected in a modern, luxurious style, whose total area is 400 square meters.  m, can cost 2.3 million euros.  1,500,000 euros - the price of a villa located on a hill in Barcelona.  In Spain, this is called a "mountain house".  This cost has to be paid for a gorgeous view of the sea, six rooms and 620 square meters of living space. </p><p>  Spanish designers love to create designs of houses in space and neoclassical style.  The huge villas that our simple-minded Russian people have published will be taken for some office center.  Indeed, such houses can boast a <span>living area of</span> 1200 square meters!  Moreover, there will be only six rooms inside.  Such a house is sold in Gava for 13 million euros ‚Äúonly‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose a property? </h2><p>  So, about what the price of a house in Spain on the seashore can be maximum, it has already been said.  And now I would like to talk about how to choose real estate.  If you believe the reviews, then, of course, you need to pay attention to infrastructure, remoteness from the sea, the orientation of the house in relation to the sun and the quality of the residential complex.  They are called residences in this country.  It was said above that in one house there can be six rooms, a sauna, a spa, a sports ground, and in another there is a modest pool and a neat front garden.  It is logical that all this affects the so-called communidad - something like a rent.  It can vary from twenty to 1500 euros per year!  Water with electricity, by the way, is always paid separately. </p>

    <h2>  Features of choice </h2><p>  Also, considering houses in Spain by the sea, it is worth paying more attention to options that are located in the green zone, near schools, playgrounds, shops.  It is better if the windows of the house are placed perpendicular to the coastline.  Choosing such a house, a person gets the opportunity to enjoy the fresh sea breeze, which is not only good refreshing, but also useful (because it will contain particles of iodine, minerals and salt).  Reviews recommend buying a villa with a pool, because swimming in the sea in summer is too exhausting, as the water sometimes heats up to excessively high temperatures.  But the pool can be filled with such water as you want: even ice, at least boiling water. </p><h2>  Clearance process </h2><p>  The first thing that is necessary for registration of real estate in Spain is a reliable agent, a specialist in this field, who will deal with the settlement of all issues arising in the process.  The second is to fly to the country in advance, about a week before the planned purchase, in order to view the maximum number of options and choose the most suitable one. </p><p>  Then - make an advance payment.  3-6 thousand euros are sent to the seller‚Äôs account, after which the person receives a villa reservation agreement.  Then you need to open a bank account (required in Spanish) and put on it the amount that will be required to pay for the purchase.  And then get the NIE.  That is the tax number of a foreigner.  This is a necessary document, since only if it is possible to activate a bank account.  And then the date and time of the meeting is already set for signing the main contract.  The completion of the registration process is considered the moment the buyer passes the bank check for the indicated amount in exchange for which he is given the keys to the cottage. </p>

    <h2>  Documents </h2><p>  In order not to worry about whether something was forgotten or not, you must first check all the documents.  The first, most important is a valid passport.  The second is a certificate of employment.  It should include data such as full name, salary, and also the position held.  Still need a certificate of income.  If a person is not officially organized, then you can show any other confirmation of his viability, for example, a contract for the sale of a car, garage, apartment: it does not matter what it will be, but the most important thing is to prove to the representatives of the Spanish bank that there is money to buy. </p><p>  And in order to get the notorious NIE, you will need to fill out a questionnaire, present a passport, two color photographs (size 3 x 4), booking tickets for the return trip, bank statement and a preliminary reservation contract for the cottage.  That's basically it.  Not so difficult as it might seem at first glance. </p>
