There are a lot of reasons.  The first, of course, is the need to improve and facilitate existence.  Next come indicators such as fashion, reaction to advertising and PR campaigns.

    <h2>  "Indesit Company" </h2><p>  Today we will not talk about new products.  We will discuss those interior items that have become commonplace, namely the Indesit laundry units. </p><p>  A washing machine of any manufacturer can receive a review both positive and radically opposite, negative.  It is unlikely that anyone will dispute this fact that there are no comrades for the taste and color, therefore product reviews are diverse.  Let's try to systematize all the information and get your personal idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe technique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="indesit washing machine reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10813/356067.jpg?1395209367666" width="500"></div>

His father was engaged in the manufacture of scales and gas cylinders, electric water heaters and bathtubs.  It is worth noting that he succeeded in this matter, but after his death, the three brothers divided the enterprise among themselves.  Vittorio went to part of the enterprise, on the basis of which he opened the "Merloni Elettrodomestici" in 1975. </p><p>  It was this corporation that supplied large household appliances to the world market under the brands ‚ÄúHotpoint-Ariston‚Äù, ‚ÄúScholt√®s‚Äù and, naturally, ‚ÄúIndesit‚Äù.  By the way, the company, which occupies a leading position in the production of refrigerators, washing machines, cooker hoods, etc., received its last name in 2005.  From this period, everyone in the world knows the Italian corporation under the name Indesit Company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine automatic indesit" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10813/356065.jpg?1395208661912" width="396"></div>

    <h2>  Range </h2><p>  The <span>models</span> on the <span>market are</span> able to satisfy the needs of any consumer.  On average, about 27 models with different loading options, washing modes, and design solutions are offered to customers at a time.  The range includes both conventional and <span>narrow washing machines.</span>  Indesit (expert reviews) is one of the most sought-after brands on the washing machine market.  The products of this company are distinguished by an adequate (not overpriced) price, high class of washing (A).  Among the undoubted advantages of the models, it is possible to note the ability to use the ‚Äúsport‚Äù and ‚Äúsports shoes‚Äù modes. <strong></strong></p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Buyers </h2><p>  What does Indesit washing machine offer consumers?  Customer reviews about this product are very mixed.  Claims mass both in appearance and in operation of the device.  But ... How adequate are they?  Let's think and figure it out. </p><p>  It seems that few will dispute the fact that you have to pay for everything.  So in this case: the corporation is developing economy-class washing machines, trying to satisfy the needs of a huge mass of the population, offering a maximum for minimal money.  Is it really not worth evaluating?  Units of other companies with exactly the same indicators are much more expensive.  It seems that it is necessary to adequately assess the ratio of price and quality, and in this particular case it is ideal, at least that is what all those who have already acquired "helpers" of this manufacturer say. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Indesit washing machine reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10813/356064.jpg?1395208702530" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Sellers </h2><p>  Any model proposed by the manufacturer will find its final consumer - those who are engaged in the promotion of goods on the market assure us.  The Indesit washing machine, of course, is no exception.  In relation to the products of this company, even advertising is inappropriate.  On the merits and quality of information is transmitted by word of mouth.  Roughly speaking, word of mouth works.  It sounds a little rude, but it is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Who saw an advertisement for Indesit washing machines?  Maybe once upon a time there was something similar, but at this stage of time, these products do not need mass advertising and public relations campaigns.  Coming to the store, buyers approximately know what they can get for their money.  The maximum number of modes, the highest washing class for small investments can only be offered by Indesit. </p><h2>  The experts </h2><p>  Indesit washing machines (we have collected the reviews of specialists especially for you) - this is the most adapted technique for our conditions.  All devices are equipped with high classes of washing.  The energy saving mode is also high and saves on average about 20%, compared with models of other companies.  The Eco Time system, introduced into the technology, allows owners to spend less water.  The average savings are approximately the same as electricity - about 20%.  Without exception, all models have a "stop flow" system.  Menalux water hoses, which all machines are equipped with, reduce the possibility of breaks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews about the washing machine indesit machine" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10813/356063.jpg?1395395424125" width="367"></div>

    <p>  An important role is played by such modes as ‚ÄúEasy Ironing‚Äù and ‚ÄúExpress 15‚Äù.  The first allows the laundry to straighten out after spinning, which greatly reduces the number of folds, and the second produces the fastest possible wash, spending only 15 minutes on it.  One of the advantages of technology can be considered modes of ‚ÄúOuterwear‚Äù and ‚ÄúJeans‚Äù.  Manufacturers did not forget about delicate fabrics, introducing Silk and Wool modes into the standard set. </p><h2>  Popular models </h2><p>  1. According to a survey conducted among buyers of a large Russian network distributing household appliances, the WIUN 102 (CSI) model can be called the leader.  This is an Indesit narrow washing machine.  Reviews of customers who have preferred this unit are unambiguous: the ideal price / quality / design ratio. </p><p>  The average cost of a device in Russian stores ranges from 11-12 thousand rubles.  The machine was produced in Russia at the Lipetsk plant, has a front loading type.  If possible, wash 4 kg of laundry at a time and has miniature dimensions.  People who prefer this model unanimously note this very characteristic of it. </p><p>  2. Next in popularity is WIUE 10 (CSI), the Indesit washing machine.  Reviews about her are no worse than about her previous "relative".  They choose it most often also because of the size.  I must say that it is slightly narrower than the previous one, and the ability to wash at the same time is limited to 3.5 kg of laundry, which is slightly less than the model WIUN 102. But its price is almost one thousand more.  This is due to the fact that WIUE 10 has several additional washing modes, in particular, it has the ability to store the program in memory and postpone the start for 24 hours. </p>

    <p>  3. The third on the list of popularity is MISE 705 SL (CIS) - Indesit washing machine.  The reviews left by consumers are unambiguous: too noisy, but at the same time its maximum load is 7 kg.  And this is not for everyone "on the shoulder."  Moreover, buyers note that the quality of washing is at the highest level.  The machine has the maximum number of functions and modes of those that the manufacturer can offer, while the price of the unit is quite concise and amounts to only 13-14 thousand rubles. </p><p>  4. The fourth among those proposed for discussion will be the IWDC 6105 (EU) model.  This unit is not at all modest in size.  This is a full-size washing machine, equipped with the "Drying" mode.  Buyers note the quality of drying, after which the clothes can be safely folded into the closet, this will not cause any negative consequences. </p><p>  The maximum load of the machine is 6 kilograms.  If you plan to use the "Drying" mode, then the mass should be slightly less and not exceed 5 kg.  By the way, consumers are offered three options for drying clothes, depending on its type.  It is also worth mentioning that this model is made at a factory in Italy. </p><p>  5. The last of our discussions will be the narrow model IWUB 4085 (CIS), also an Indesit washing machine.  Reviews about it are all in the same perspective as in the previous ones: it erases perfectly, lasts a long time.  It is distinguished by a fairly concise price.  It fluctuates around 8-9 thousand rubles.  The maximum load is four kilograms, and the spin cycle is not more than 800 revolutions per minute.  In the previous variations we examined, it was 1000. </p><p>  The washing class for all the models listed by us is A. Here is the difference in <span>water consumption</span> and the degree of extraction for each individual, since these indicators depend on the load weight and power. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  From the foregoing, we can conclude that there are practically no complaints against the manufacturer, except for individual flaws.  But reviews about the Indesit washing machine are also very unpleasant. </p><p>  Marriage is everywhere.  Among the products of this company, he also occurs.  The company can not do anything about it, as the corporation has grown to an incredible size.  Its plants are located in several states.  The goods sold in the CIS are most often made here. </p><p>  By the way, the abbreviation CIS speaks of the place of production, which is literally translated from Italian and stands for the Commonwealth of Independent States.  The only thing the corporation has in its power is to develop a network of service centers that allow repairing equipment in any corner of the world. </p><h2>  PS </h2><p>  The reviews we have provided about the Indesit washing machine are nothing more than an opportunity for you to draw your own conclusions.  Do not take everyone‚Äôs word for it.  Maybe you will have a long and strong friendship with a little "laundress" from Italy. </p>
