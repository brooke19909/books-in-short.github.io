Today, the story of Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan, the first <span>girl who changed the</span> life and orders of the Ottoman Empire, is considered quite popular.  Some even call the period in which the famous beauty lived, the time of the “female sultanate”.  That is why everyone is still interested in the question: “Why did Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska die from?”

    <p>  There are legends about the girl’s beauty and her life.  She was considered the most powerful, inimitable and stubborn woman of the <span>Ottoman Empire.</span>  As you know, from the very beginning Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska was a concubine of the Sultan, and then became his legal wife.  She could influence the decisions of the great ruler, gave advice to which he listened, was desired and loved for many years.  Sources answer the question of what died Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan in different ways.  Some argue that the beauty fell ill.  At first she tried not to pay attention to her poor health, then the pain became stronger and soon became completely unbearable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan actress" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/254648.jpg" width="600"></div>  When Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska with her husband returned to Istanbul, she could no longer stand on her feet.  In a fainting state, Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska lay on the lap of her master.  So the beauty tormented for several years - she could not get out of bed ... But a <span>loving husband</span> never left her, was always there, he had the hope that everything would get better, and his wife would recover.  The history of Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan ends in April 1558 in Istanbul.  She was dying with the words: “Suleiman, I love you, and I will always love ...”

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan was a great woman who in a short time learned a foreign language for herself, became interested in politics, develop strategies and respond to letters from foreign rulers.  The woman gave birth to six children of Suleiman, of which five were boys, which made her husband very happy. </p>

She would have lived for many more years, but because of her beauty, education, intelligence and logic, a woman simply “interfered” with many people.  But the sultan himself overly loved his wife: when he was away from home, he really yearned for her (this is clearly seen in the correspondence between Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska and Suleiman).
