He was born in Rome in 63 BC.  He was a politician in ancient Rome and founded the Roman Empire.  The biography of Guy Octavian Caesar is very eventful.  As many as 13 times he was elected to the post of consul, was a great pontiff, had the authority of a tribune and was awarded the title "father of the fatherland".  It seems that the story of Guy Octavian Caesar is worthy of attention - we will talk about him today. </p><h2>  44 BC  e.  - situation in Rome </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mrayford2018.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The assassination of Caesar" class="if uuid-2534150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2534150.jpg"></div><p>  After Julius Caesar was killed in Rome in 44 BC, two main political groups formed there.  The first was led by the assassins of Caesar - Brutus and Cassius, to whom Cicero joined.  She advocated the restoration of the republic. </p><p>  The other was for the monarchy.  It included the associates of Caesar, led by Mark Anthony, consul of 44 years.  He at that time was the most influential person in Rome and a contender for real higher power.  Emilius Lepidus, who commanded cavalry, and later governor in one of the Roman provinces, joined him. </p><p>  The emergence of new political forces was evidence of a split within society, the continuation of the long crisis characteristic of the late Republican period. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Caesar's Nephew </h2><p>  At this time, nineteen-year-old Guy Octavian, the grand-nephew of the murdered Caesar, whom the latter adopted, appeared on the political scene.  After which the first adopted a new name - Guy Julius Caesar Octavian. </p><p>  Formally, he was the heir to the dictator, but no one saw a real successor to him.  Whereas <span>Mark Anthony</span> believed that only he himself is the only person who is able to take the reins of government into his own hands.  And in this regard, did not transfer Caesar's inheritance into the hands of Guy Octavian Caesar.  But in his support were persons opposed to Anthony.  Among them was Cicero, who hoped that the fading republic would gain support. </p><h2>  Second triumvirate </h2><div class="photo" data-original="incolors.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guy Octavian defeated Anthony" class="if uuid-2534149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2534149.jpg"></div><p>  For these reasons, young Guy stood at the head of the troops gathered by the Senate to fight Mark Anthony.  In 43 BC, in the battle of Mutin, the troops of Anthony were defeated.  Guy Octavian Caesar demanded that he be given consulate, to which the Senate refused.  It was believed that he played his role in the victory over Anthony and will no longer be useful to them. </p><p>  Then Guy joined Anthony in an alliance with a recent adversary.  Thus, this year the second triumvirate was created, which included Octavian, Anthony and Lepidus.  Octavian at the head of the army entered Rome, and the senate had to go on the recognition of a new union.  This power was legislated, in contrast to the first triumvirate, which was an informal association. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New repression </h2><p>  The newly-made triumphs began their reign with scriptures.  They were primarily affected by people who were democratically inclined and who advocated the revival of republican rule.  Prosecutions in ancient Rome were lists of persons who were outlawed.  Those who betrayed or killed those included in these lists were awarded a reward, and those who covered them were executed. </p><p>  The property of the victims of reprisal was subject to confiscation, and their descendants were deprived of all honorable rights and their condition.  But the main goal of the newly unleashed repressions was not so much the enrichment of the members of the triumvirate as the destruction of the opposition.  Among the first who got on the prohibition list was Cicero, who was considered the most active of those who supported the restoration of the republic. </p><p>  After their accession, the members of the second triumvirate turned out to be masters of the state and began to redistribute it.  As a result of this redistribution, the following occurred: </p><ul><li>  Mark Anthony inherited part of the territory of Gaul and rich provinces in the east. </li><li>  Emilius Lepidus acquired former Carthage and the province of Africa. </li><li>  At the disposal of Guy Octavian Caesar was Spain, as well as Italy, which was for him a big trump card in politics. </li></ul><h2>  Defeat Anthony </h2><p>  From 34 BC  Octavian secured the powers possessed by the plebeian stands.  And Antony at that time took a step, which was for him a great miscalculation, which led to his death.  He announced marriage to Cleopatra, began to distribute state land to her sons. </p><p>  The Egyptian Queen and Marcus Anthony, the Senate declared war.  As a result of the lost naval battles, both Anthony and Cleopatra committed suicide, and Egypt became a Roman province. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Maneuvers of Octavian </h2><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Octavian with a crown" class="if uuid-2534144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2534144.jpg"></div><p>  At the age of 33, Octavian, who became the sole ruler of Rome, was given the title of emperor.  In 27 BC  during a speech in the Senate, Guy Octavian proclaimed the end of civil wars.  He believed that his mission was completed, order and peace restored.  Therefore, he resigns and asks to accept the renunciation of power. </p><p>  However, this was only a tricky move with which Octavian sought official recognition for his power.  As a result, senators asked him for mercy - not to leave the state to the mercy of fate and return to control, since otherwise a new civil war is inevitable. </p><p>  Guy Octavian Caesar gave his consent and was approved as a princeps.  By itself, this post did not give much authority, one of its main characteristics at that time was the ability to be the first to vote during the Senate vote. </p><h2>  Principle Age </h2><div class="photo" data-original="co2islife.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Praetorian Guard" class="if uuid-2534176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2534176.jpg"></div><p>  The reign of Guy Octavian Caesar as the head of the Principate began in 27 BC.  This was the beginning of the imperial era, which was called the principate, but in fact was a monarchy disguised as a republic.  Octavian ruled until his death, which followed in the year 14 AD.  Based on these data, we can calculate how many years Guy Julius Caesar Octavian ruled.  It turns out pretty impressive figure - 41 years. </p><p>  Outwardly, many former institutions have been preserved.  So, the national assembly, the senate continued to gather, and consuls and tribunes were elected.  But at the same time, nothing significant could have happened in the empire without an indication of the princeps himself; in fact, the state was ruled by Octavian. </p><h2>  The policy of "bread and circuses" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ancientrome.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Libya - wife of Augustus" class="if uuid-2534148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2534148.jpg"></div><p>  The popular assembly has completely lost its meaning.  The policy of satisfying the demands of ‚Äúbread and circuses‚Äù was aimed at the maximum removal of people from politics. </p><p>  Although several unsuccessful conspiracies were drawn up, the political struggle subsided.  The people were tired of feuds, the rule with an ‚Äúiron hand‚Äù came in handy.  The reign of Guy Octavian Caesar was a rare period of peace, prosperity and tranquility, albeit relative. </p><p>  From the very beginning of the reign, Octavian did not rely on the people, but on the guard chosen by him.  This was a characteristic feature of the era of the principate and the entire subsequent imperial era.  Then the power was not based on the masses, but on the military, including the <span>Praetorian guard</span> created by Guy Octavian.  In later times, it was the Praetorians who became the support of the palace coups. </p><h2>  Senate Cleaning </h2><p>  Octavian carried out another purge of the Senate, which he reduced, but at the same time formally magnified, since he was a symbol of republican statehood.  His dignity and legal equality with Princeps was constantly emphasized by him. </p><p>  For example, all Roman provinces were divided between the Senate and Princeps.  Some of them were ruled by Senate proteges, and some by imperial ones. </p><p>  In fact, all political problems were resolved by the Princeps Council, although the latter was not legislatively formalized.  Octavian invited a narrow circle of people close to him to discuss government affairs. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúSlave‚Äù and ‚Äúfamily‚Äù reforms </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kipaperymrk.antiquevillage.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Princesps welcomed the family" class="if uuid-2534159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2534159.jpg"></div><p>  One of the important social reforms carried out by Octavian was the reform related to the relationship of slaves and slaveholders.  He forbade the freeing of slaves before the expiration of their twenty-year service to the master.  He revived the ancient custom, according to which they executed not only the slave who killed the master, but also the rest of the slaves in the house.  And also an audit was made in slave prisons and the one who was enslaved illegally was released. </p><p>  Guy Octavian Caesar sought to strengthen the Roman family.  To this end, he announced that aristocrats could not count on a serious career if they were not married.  He introduced the ‚Äúright of three children,‚Äù according to which promotion was possible with a wife and three legal offspring. </p><p>  A law was also passed under which adultery was punished.  Interestingly, the relatives of the princeps, his daughter and granddaughter, were the first to fall under his action.  They were sent in exile for frivolity in behavior. </p><h2>  Traditions and Foreign Policy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.forumancientcoins.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Silver Dinar of Augustus" class="if uuid-2534145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2534145.jpg"></div><p>  Octavian recreated many traditional festivals, cults and customs that had previously been neglected.  Just a few days after the fictitious abdication took place, he was given a new title, and he became known as Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian Augustus, where Augustus means ‚Äúsacred‚Äù. </p><p>  It is interesting that Octavian himself never called himself emperor.  During his lifetime, he was called either Princeps or Caesar.  After him, emperors became traditionally called Caesars. </p><p>  As for foreign policy, here Octavian preferred peaceful diplomacy.  He concluded a series of treaties that created new Roman provinces - in Egypt, in the southern regions of Yugoslavia, in parts of Bulgaria, in Albania, in Balkan Greece and Judea.  The Gospel of Luke states that Octavian conducted a census in Syria and Palestine. </p>
