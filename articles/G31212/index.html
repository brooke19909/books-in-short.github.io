Couples in love often walk here, you can meet the newlyweds, which is why the bridge has another name, and people call it the "bridge of lovers."

    <p>  The bridge has long been considered a special place for walking.  Previously, if a young man invited a lady to walk along it, this meant that his intentions were very serious.  In addition, in the last century, dueling between beautiful tipsy ladies took place on this bridge because of beautiful ladies, and several years ago one of the episodes for the Russian movie "Men's Women's Game" was shot on it. </p><p>  The stone bridge, the pride of the local <span>architecture of Voronezh,</span> was erected in September 1826.  The project was handled by the city architect I. A. Blitsin, who hardly suspected that after almost two centuries this humpbacked bridge would be the main symbol of loving hearts. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The stone bridge in Voronezh, the history of which began back in the Petrine era, is located in a very picturesque place, in the historical center of the city, at the intersection of Chernyshevsky and Karl Marx streets (previously these streets were called Bogoslovskaya and Staromoskovskaya respectively). </p><p>  In those days, the construction of the Azov fleet was underway, and cargo flows passed at the site of the future construction.  From this, the road along Bogoslovskaya Street began to gradually erode with water, and subsequently a ravine formed in the ground, which became an obstacle to travel.  In the XIII century, the streets ceased to function for the "transport" of those times - carts drawn by horses.  It became apparent that a bridge was needed at the intersection of the aforementioned streets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, financial resources for its construction were found only in 1826.  Then, at his own peril and risk, the city governor Nikolai Krivtsov allocated the necessary amount.  The construction was carried out without the permission of the emperor, for which the official was subsequently punished.  The governor was reprimanded and fined for performing unscheduled work and spending money, and his reputation also suffered noticeably after such an act. </p><p>  The bridge was the first in the city, which was built of brick, and not of wood.  Hence the name.  If you believe the preserved documentation, 5 thousand 596 rubles were spent on the construction of a ferry from the treasury of the city. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The construction is one of the cult places of such a city as Voronezh.  The stone bridge is small in size, its length is not more than ten meters, but, despite this, it constantly attracts the attention of both city residents and its guests. </p>

    <p>  People walking along the bridge, which last year celebrated its 190th anniversary, have a magnificent view of the Sunday Church.  Under the bridge you can see the descent to the embankment of the city reservoir. </p><h2>  Restoration </h2><p>  Today, the monument is protected by the state and the administration of such a city as Voronezh.  The stone bridge has been partially restored; six years ago, repair work was carried out on it.  Railings and fences made of metal, which appeared in 1986, when the appearance of the bridge was completely updated on the 400th anniversary of the city (designed by A. V. Pospeev), was replaced.  Now in their place appeared brickwork, as much as possible reminiscent of its historical appearance. </p><p>  In order not to violate the tradition of Voronezh newlyweds to close <span>wedding locks,</span> a special construction was constructed according to the project.  Curbstones and handrails for lanterns were lined with granite chips and plates.  And now the symbol of old Voronezh appeared before the guests and residents of the capital of the Black Earth region in a new guise. </p>
