Moreover, there are so many product models that everyone can find something to their liking.  There are options for both women and children, and for men.  However, novice knitters to understand the technology is not always possible.  Therefore, we have prepared this article.  It provides detailed and step-by-step instructions for translating ideas into reality. </p><h2>  How to identify the perfect tool </h2><p>  Professional needlewomen often say that those who managed to choose a good tool, crocheting a summer hat or other thing brings much more pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picsnaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="children's summer hat" class="if uuid-2933316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2933316.jpg"></div><p>  All because the work is progressing quickly and easily, but it turns out qualitatively.  However, it is difficult for novice masters not to be confused in the abundance of tools.  Therefore, we propose to focus on standard criteria: </p><ul><li>  material - metal; </li><li>  length - comfortable for the hand (the hook should lie well in the palm of your hand); </li><li>  appearance - the absence of chips, "burrs", roughness; </li><li>  size - one and a half to two times thicker than the thread. </li></ul><h2>  How to choose the right yarn </h2><p>  There can be no strict recommendations regarding this parameter.  Therefore, the needlewoman has the right to purchase any knitting thread.  However, professionals recommend crocheting cotton or linen yarn for a summer hat.  The reason is understandable: other species are more suitable for warm products.  Therefore, we leave them for autumn-winter things.  You can choose the color of yarn, focusing on your taste.  The only thing important to consider is the pattern.  On the motley yarn, various textures will not be visible, which means that it is better to use a plain one.  And vice versa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="thewhoot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet hat" class="if uuid-2933314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2933314.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, it should be noted that knitting threads for summer hats are much thinner than those usually used by needlewomen.  Therefore, working with them can be inconvenient.  But this is only at the beginning, and then things will go easier and faster. </p><h2>  Building patterns </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen recommend that beginners sketch their idea on a piece of paper.  This will help to think through all the important nuances of the work and, accordingly, to avoid possible errors.  Therefore, we take a notebook and pen, and after that we draw the style of our hat.  Next we indicate all the important parameters: </p><ul><li>  Head circumference; </li><li>  accessory height; </li><li>  field width if available. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, for crocheting a summer hat, it is necessary to indicate the dimensions of the product, first in centimeters, and then in loops and rows.  We will familiarize the reader with the translation technology a bit later. </p><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  To knit a product that fits exactly in size, do not use standard parameters.  It is better to determine the ones you need.  To do this, we invite a model on which we will crochet a summer hat, prepare a centimeter tape and a pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat for a girl" class="if uuid-2933315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2933315.jpg"></div><p>  Then we measure the following parameters: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Girth of the head.  It is determined by placing a centimeter tape horizontally just above the eyebrows. </li><li>  Accessory height.  Measure the distance from the base of one ear to a similar point on the other hand.  In this case, a centimeter tape passes through the crown.  The total value must be divided into two and only then written on the pattern. </li><li>  The width of the margins (if provided) is measured from the forehead to the intended edge of the product.  There is no minimum or maximum width.  But with the definition of the latter, you must be careful.  So that the fields do not hang and do not close the review, they will have to be starched.  However, too broad and this will not help.  In this case, you need to prepare a special frame - a plastic circle.  It can be purchased at the needlework store.  In extreme cases, it is permissible to use a thin wire.  But such a product may not be safe for children. </li></ol><h2>  How to convert centimeters to the desired units </h2><p>  When crocheting an adult or children's summer hat, the needlewoman takes into account loops and rows.  For this reason, at the preparatory stage, it is required to calculate them.  It is very easy to do: </p><ol><li>  We knit a sample of the selected pattern - a square with a side of ten centimeters. </li><li>  We count the number of loops and rows in it. </li><li>  Divide the head circumference by 10. </li><li>  Multiply the resulting value by the number of loops in the sample. </li><li>  Similarly, we calculate the parameters for the height of the accessory and the width of the margins. </li><li>  Divide each value by 10. </li><li>  Two new numbers are multiplied by the number of rows in the sample. </li><li>  All parameters found must be fixed on your pattern. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet hat for men" class="if uuid-2933328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2933328.jpg"></div><h2>  Main part </h2><p>  The technology for making a summer hat crocheted for a woman, man or child begins the same way.  Therefore, having mastered the technology described below, you can safely take on any such product.  So, so that the reader does not get confused in their actions, we offer instructions: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we knit a chain, the number of loops in which we previously calculated for the girth of the head. </li><li>  We close it in a ring, that is, we connect the first and last loop. </li><li>  Then we knit, moving in a circle.  We do not add or decrease anything. </li><li>  You can run single crochet. </li><li>  At the beginning of each row, it is important to climb one loop.  To knit not in a spiral, but in a circle. </li><li>  We advance until 15-20 rows remain until the end of the product. </li><li>  Then we begin to reduce the loop.  To do this, divide their total number into the remaining rows.  Distribute the extra loops evenly in each row.  And remove them by knitting two adjacent posts together. </li><li>  Having shaped the upper part of the product in this way, we break off the thread and fix it from the wrong side. </li></ol><p>  In principle, the needlewoman, following the steps described in the description of the summer hat, the hook can delay and finish knitting.  Because such options for accessories are also considered very popular.  They are especially common in children's models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat for baby" class="if uuid-2933317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2933317.jpg"></div><h2>  How to tie a hat to the brim </h2><p>  The main part of the hat is knitted according to the instructions described above.  Then it is necessary to make mathematical calculations: </p><ol><li>  Divide the head circumference by 3.14. </li><li>  Round the resulting number. </li><li>  Add 2 field widths to it. </li><li>  Multiply the new value by 3.14. </li><li>  Also round to the whole. </li><li>  So we find out how many loops should be at the end of knitting. </li><li>  Subtract from them those that are equal to the circumference of the head.  We must add them to get beautiful fields of the desired width. </li><li>  The total number is divided by the width of the fields in the rows. </li><li>  As a result, we find out how many loops you need to add in each row. </li></ol><p>  Having figured out the calculations, we proceed to knitting.  We also form the part, moving in a circle.  Add loops evenly.  For readers who are better guided by the scheme, the following is an image. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hat scheme" class="if uuid-2933330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2933330.jpg"></div><p>  Here we figured out how crocheted summer hats are made.  The technology is available not only to professional needlewomen, but also to beginners.  Therefore, you can safely choose the right products for yourself and proceed to its implementation.  The main thing is not to quit work if something does not work out. </p>
