  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Lighthouse" - cross-stitch</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every person in the world has a dream.  Whether you are a kid or an adult, a woman or a man, it doesn‚Äôt matter.  Inside everyone there is that very cherished desire that burns with fire and makes you move forward.  Such a desire is made under the chiming clock, throwing a trifle into the fountain, or when a star falls.  But there is another way to make a wish, and it will almost certainly come true.  This method is embroidery.  But not every image will work - only the embroidery of the lighthouse helps fulfill wishes. </p><h2>  Embroidery History </h2><p>  Embroidery is one of the most popular types of needlework.  Embroidery appeared many centuries ago.  And if then during this occupation they spent mostly winter days and evenings, now this type of needlework has become a national treasure.  The earliest embroideries were found in China - this country is officially considered the ancestor of this type of needlework.  The very first works are dated to the V century BC.  e.  And they survived.  This is surprising given that embroidery is a very delicate work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="enacademic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient embroidery of China" class="if uuid-2863463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2863463.jpg"></div><p>  Embroidery is divided into several types, namely: stitch embroidery, cross stitch, workshop embroidery and more modern embroidery - ribbons.  Perhaps the most common is cross stitch.  It all began in antiquity, when embroidering crosses was not yet a form of needlework, but was intended to create amulets.  After all, the symbol of the cross itself is a figure of a talisman, therefore, things embroidered with such a sign were considered almost totemic, they averted evil and drove away spirits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient chinese vishivka" class="if uuid-2863381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2863381.jpg"></div><p>  Embroidered items are sold in many markets and in stores.  Clothes, bags, wallets, as well as home textiles, such as curtains, tablecloths, napkins, sofa cushions, and, of course, one of the most common types of embellishments at home with embroidery, are decorated with embroidery - paintings.  Everything is embroidered on the paintings, starting with their own photos and ending with dreams.  There is also a belief that if you embroider an object, then you will definitely have it.  There are even special images that are advised to embroider to those who want to marry or conceive a child.  They say they are very effective. </p><h2>  What to embroider for the fulfillment of desires </h2><p>  To give birth to a child, everyone is advised to embroider three angels.  For marriage, you need a picture with peonies.  But for a meeting of a beloved, fantasy can take off.  In this situation, a man and a woman are embroidered together, they can dance in a picture, laugh together, hold hands or merge in a kiss, the main thing is that they are together.  If you want to find a certain object, a car, for example, then you need to embroider a car, embroidery even just a trademark of a car brand helps a lot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brwnpaperbag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House embroidery" class="if uuid-2863405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2863405.jpg"></div><p>  To buy new housing, not only a house is embroidered, but also a mill.  It is not necessary to choose the embroidery of the mansion that you want, just embroider any house. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why embroider a lighthouse? </h2><p>  But if it is not possible to specify, or the desire is more vague, then it can be made with the first stitch of embroidery of the lighthouse.  For some reason, it is believed that this image will fulfill a desire.  Maybe the whole thing is in the lighthouses themselves?  They, as a symbol of hope for salvation, have been encouraging thousands of people for centuries in a row before returning home.  Lighthouses serve as a guide for travelers, indicating the safest way.  But not only at night, as many believe.  At night they burn continuously or shine with flashes.  In the afternoon they serve as a visible reference.  According to their height and shape during the day, sailors distinguish their location by coordinates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wyszykowane.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidered picture with a lighthouse" class="if uuid-2863415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2863415.jpg"></div><p>  Cross stitching a lighthouse is much easier than stitching.  And the picture is much more diverse and beautiful.  Stroke does not add as many details as possible with a cross.  Given the fact that embroidery of lighthouses is usually made from real places, it turns out just incredibly beautiful and textured paintings. </p><h2>  Pattern or embroidery kit? </h2><p>  Cross-stitching lighthouses is very common, and therefore you can find a lot of patterns with different beacons: free patterns and paid, small and large, on which, the lighthouses are depicted day or night, at dawn or at sunset.  The choice is so wide that everyone can find something to their liking.  That's just the complexity of a single scheme is the correct selection of threads to it, even if the scheme has a list of recommended threads.  Finding the right ones often becomes a special problem that slows down the work of the wizard: either because of the missing color you can‚Äôt start work, or without it you don‚Äôt finish.  Some manage to do without some shades, but for others this method is not possible. </p><p>  To prevent such embarrassment, experienced embroiderers advise taking a set for embroidery.  There are a lot of them on sale now, and they meet all the necessary criteria.  In addition, a big plus is that everything you need for embroidery in one box: fabric, threads and a pattern.  It will be very convenient and easy to work with a set of embroidery with a beacon even for beginners. </p><h2>  What is included in the Dimensions embroidery kit </h2><p>  One of the best-equipped is considered to be the embroidery kit for the lighthouse Dimenshens - Lighthouse at Dawn. </p><p>  This set includes: </p><ul><li>  Detailed instruction translated into different languages. </li><li>  A few needles for embroidery. </li><li>  Scheme.  When the circuit is large, it is divided into several sheets.  The scheme is both color and with symbols. </li><li>  Organizer for threads.  Insanely convenient thing for work.  Each thread in its cell, and so do not confuse them. </li><li>  Threads.  When there is a lot of one shade, they are separately folded, and not a huge lump on the organizer. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.stitchkitsgalore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery with a lighthouse on the mountain" class="if uuid-2863434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2863434.jpg"></div><p>  You will be happy to embroider a lighthouse to fulfill a wish, if all the accessories are at hand.  And, of course, for the fulfillment of desire it does not matter at all whether an experienced master or not, the first is an embroidered picture or a hundredth.  Only the mood and faith are important, and then your embroidered lighthouse will surely bring you good luck and a fulfilled desired desire so quickly and incredibly that you won‚Äôt have time to come to your senses. </p><h2>  Why do they value embroidery in the world? </h2><p>  Embroidery is a unique way of needlework.  It helps to distract from physical and mental work.  To develop speech centers that are at your fingertips and it is precisely when embroidering that they are actively involved in the work.  Embroidery develops imagination, trains memory and improves observation.  Embroidery needlework, first of all, is appreciated not only for the fulfillment of desires, but also for the ability to protect a person, as ancient people believed.  Now it is uniqueness, beauty and, of course, handicraft, in which enormous forces and good thoughts of the craftswoman are invested. </p>
