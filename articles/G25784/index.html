    <h2>  Preparation of materials and tools </h2><p>  A variety of flowers can become elements of spring applications - from crocuses and snowdrops emerging from under the snowdrifts to daffodils and tulips growing on flower beds, flowering trees, melting snow, running streams and much more.  And if planning to do this type of creativity, you still do not know exactly what you want to portray, then it is best to stock up with all the tools and materials that may be needed during the work.  At the same time, if you will make spring applications with your child, it is important that there are two sets of tools.  In this case, the little master will be able to repeat the necessary actions for you, for example, draw petal patterns, cut stems or leaves. </p><p>  Of the materials you will need colored paper, cardboard, preferably white and colored, standard sheets, corrugated paper, quilling tapes, white and pink napkins.  Now about the tools.  You need convenient scissors, glue (you can use both a pencil and PVA), a stapler, simple and <span>colored pencils.</span>  Well, do not forget about the small towel that can be used to wipe hands stained with glue during the manufacture of the applique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Application: bouquet of spring flowers </h2><p>  In spring, forest glades and flower beds are full of a wide variety of colors.  These are bells, and tulips, and daffodils, and lilies of the valley, and snowdrops.  So why not combine them all in one bouquet? </p><p>  First you need to cut <span>flowers</span> out <span>of</span> <span>paper.</span>  To do this, you can pre-prepare templates from cardboard, which is especially important if, for example, you make lilies of the valley, or draw flowers directly on the back of colored paper.  In addition, the application "Spring Flowers" implies the presence of stems and leaves.  When all the parts are ready, it remains only to stick to the base in the appropriate order.  It is important not to forget that the flowers must be arranged in such a way that they look like a bouquet.  That is, they should be superimposed on each other, creating the effect of volume. </p><p>  The application "Spring Bouquet" will look even more original if the flowers are placed in a vase or basket.  To do this, you need to cut out a container from colored paper that you prefer, and stick on top of the bouquet in such a way that the stems are half closed. </p>

    <h2>  Making spring flowers </h2><p>  At this stage, you need to decide what colors your spring applications will consist of.  The most common in spring are tulips, bells, lilies of the valley and snowdrops, which is why they will be discussed later.  Let's start with the bell.  To make this flower, you need to fold a sheet of blue paper in half and draw half of the product on it, cut it out, and then lay it out.  As a result of such actions, a symmetric bell is obtained.  According to a similar scheme, you can create a lily of the valley.  True, white paper will be needed and on applications, unlike a bell, it should have a much smaller size. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The application “Spring Flowers” ​​made of paper may also consist of tulips and snowdrops.  It is worth noting that both of these flowers are cut in the same pattern.  Differences between them are their size, color and location on the stem.  The first "look" up, and the second - down.  In order to make it more clear for the child <span>how to draw the flowers</span> of which the application will consist, it is worth preparing pictures with their image in advance.  It makes no sense to demand maximum accuracy from the little master, the main thing is the manifestation of his work. </p><h2>  Making sepals and stems </h2><p>  Now sepals and stems.  Cut them out of green paper.  For stems, the usual color is suitable.  The tulip stalk will be a straight strip 12-15 cm high and 1 cm wide. But for a snowdrop and a bell, it is necessary that their “heads” “look” down.  To do this, the stem should have a slight rounding at the top.  These two flowers also have sepals.  They can be cut out of a square, about the same size as a bell or a snowdrop, as follows: fold the figure diagonally and make a triangular depression on one of its open sides with scissors. </p><p>  As for the lily of the valley, its stem consists of several elements - one long, bent in the upper part, and 5-7 short ones attached to it, on which the flowers "hang". </p>

    <h2>  Leaves for spring flowers </h2><p>  The application "Spring Flowers" must also have leaves.  For some plants, for example, lilies of the valley, it is better to cut them out of corrugated paper, since it looks more like real ones in texture, but the usual color is suitable for the rest.  In the snowdrop and bell, the leaves are pointed at the top, but the first are narrower and the second wide.  The leaf for the tulip should have the same height as the stem, be wide (2-3cm) in the middle and pointed at the end.  It can only be attached to the base with the lower part, and the upper one can be bent.  Lily of the valley leaf resembles an elongated oval, slightly rounded in the upper part.  For its manufacture, as already mentioned, it is best to use corrugated paper. </p><h2>  Volume application "Spring Fantasy" </h2><p>  Spring applications do not have to consist of flowers.  Indeed, at this time of year there are many other phenomena that deserve attention.  For example, melting snow or flowering trees.  It is on them that it is worth stopping attention and creating a volumetric application. </p>

    <p>  For the base you need cardboard.  It should be placed horizontally.  Snowdrifts will occupy the lower part of the base, and a flowering tree branch will occupy the upper part.  To make snow notes, you need to take two paper rectangles of white and <span>blue colors</span> with a height of 5-6 cm and a width that matches the base.  Both blanks must be folded together and, using scissors, give their upper part undulation.  First, the white part must be glued to the bottom of the base, and then, slightly shifted down, the blue part. </p><p>  Now a flowering branch.  From brown or gray paper, it is necessary to cut strips, one 1.5-2 cm thick and 5-8 pieces of 0.5-1 cm each. The branch should be glued to the right side of the base, and there are already flowers on it, made as follows: white and pink napkins should be folded into a square and fastened in the middle with a stapler.  Then draw a 5-petal flower on it, so that the bracket is in its center, and cut it out.  Next, expand the product and stick to the branch.  There can be as many flowers as you wish.  At the final stage, you will need to cut out the leaves of green paper and place them on the same branch.  The application "Spring Fantasy" is ready! </p>
