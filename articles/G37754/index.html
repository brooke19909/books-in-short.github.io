Each of them has its own unique name.  But once at the time of the USSR, most often it was Lenin Square or Revolution Square. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.15948814044323" data-lng="61.402581028558416" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/8/2/2/3822.png"></div><p>  As well as one of the main streets, they gave the name of the leader of the Great October Revolution - V.I. Lenin. </p><h2>  Once upon a time ... </h2><p>  From the very foundation of the city, the center was Cathedral Square (now E. Yaroslavsky Square near the Glinka Opera and Ballet Theater).  The square of the Chelyabinsk Revolution in its history was originally called South, since it was located south from the original city center, the outskirts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yablor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="South Square, late 19th century" class="if uuid-2511665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2511665.jpg"></div><p>  But even here there were festivities on New Year and Christmas holidays, on Easter weeks.  Trade fairs were organized, as the area is located at the intersection of major trade routes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the district there were the People‚Äôs House (1903), the State Bank, and the customs building from 1901 to 1919 in the former house of engineer A. Pertsev, as well as shopping arcades, merchants' shops, the Odigitrievsky Convent on Bolshaya Street (now ul. Zwilling) and a beautiful birch grove. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kulturologia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Youth Theater on the square" class="if uuid-2511604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2511604.jpg"></div><p>  Time passed, the city grew and developed.  The buildings were thoroughly demolished, old, but not in line with the new ideology.  Gradually, the center of events shifted to the modern Revolution Square in Chelyabinsk.  This name was defined on May 1, 1920 in honor of the third anniversary of the great event. </p><h2>  At the beginning of glorious deeds </h2><p>  Gradually, beautiful and even pompous buildings began to be erected, the architecture of which can be called "Soviet monumental classicism" or "Stalin's empire." </p><p>  These include houses built or rebuilt in the first half of the 20th century: </p><ul><li>  modern Arbitration Court (Vorovskogo St., 2) in 1934; </li><li>  residential building at 54 Lenin Ave., better known as the ‚ÄúCentral grocery store‚Äù - in 1938; </li><li>  instead of the Odigitrievsky monastery demolished in the late 1920s, the modern building of the South Ural Hotel was erected on its foundation in 1941; </li><li>  pompous building of the Office of the South Ural Railway - in 1942. </li></ul><h2>  Plans must be implemented! </h2><p>  Back in 1947, a project was developed and approved for the development of the territory in the city center, where the Chelyabinsk Revolution Square is now located.  In the postwar years, the active development of free space began.  Were built: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  residential building (53 Lenin Ave.) with the musical instrument store "Rhythm" - 1953; </li><li>  Chelyabenergo building (5 Revolution Square) - in 1955; </li><li>  The building of the modern city hall (2 Revolution Square) - in 1958. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="yablor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="State Bank building, early 1900" class="if uuid-2511652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2511652.jpg"></div><p>  In 1959, a monument to V.I. Lenin was erected in the center of the square, which no one is going to clean up to this day.  Chelyabinsk residents respect and honor the history of the country and their native land. </p><p>  Behind the monument, a pretty square with blue spruce trees, paved walkways and a beautiful fountain dressed in traditional Ural Kaslin casting is broken.  In 2014, as a result of the reconstruction, the fountain became musical and color. </p><p>  Closes the <span>square of the Revolution of Chelyabinsk</span> from the south Theater Square.  Here in the period from 1973 to 1984.  It was built the building of the Drama Theater.  Nauma Orlova.  And along its edges in the similar style of ‚Äúsocialist realism‚Äù two houses of political education, identical in appearance and purpose, were erected. </p><h2>  The final touches to the portrait </h2><p>  The completion of the unified image of the city center was the construction of the Investbank building in 1997 and the construction of the unique Nikitinsky shopping complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="grig.org.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Place of festivities" class="if uuid-2511981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2511981.jpg"></div><p>  The Chelyabinsk Revolution Square in the photo has been preserved in many generations of families.  All the parades took place here.  Ice towns were built, various festive fairs, military parades, and sports competitions were held. </p><p>  And now the square and square located here is a place where pensioners and young people still like to spend warm summer evenings. </p>
