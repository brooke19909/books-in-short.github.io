We know about <span>Greek mythology</span> from the tablets of Aegean culture, which were recorded in a linear letter B. During this period, the first mention of the <span>gods appeared.</span>  <span>Greek</span> goddesses are mentioned in a later, Crete-Mycenaean period.  Then the first information appeared about Athena, Zeus, and Dionysus known to us.  In history, this time is called the "dark ages." </p><p>  Ancient civilization left us the most ancient cultural monuments in which humanoid goddesses and gods occupy a significant place.  In addition, there is a lot of information about the then existing heroes who entered into unequal battles with mythical creatures and even with the gods.  The divine creatures that inhabited Olympus had their own hierarchy.  The top of this mountain was the place where they were led by Zeus. </p><p>  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> and finds allow us to find out where and which Greek goddesses and gods were worshiped.  For example, in Athens it was Athena Pallas, on Samos - Hera, in Olympia and Dodon - Zeus, in Delphi - Apollo, and in Epidaurus - Asclepius, etc. </p><p>  The legends and myths of ancient Greece are full of interesting adventures and events.  The heroes of Hellas were glorified in the literary works of Homer, which provide an opportunity to get acquainted with the amazing events of those years.  They often mention the names of ancient gods, each of which had a certain sphere of influence.  Let's get acquainted with the most famous and revered of them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The names of the ancient gods should be listed, of course, from Zeus, because he is the head of the ancient Greek pantheon.  In Roman mythology, it is called Jupiter.  He is the god of heaven and thunder.  In his arsenal is a single-tooth, lightning and an eagle. </p><p>  The lord of the underworld is Hades, also known as Hades and Pluto.  For the Romans, it is Diet and Orc.  His attributes were the dog Cerberus with three heads, guarding the entrance to his kingdom, and a two-pronged dog.  His wife's name was Persephone. </p><p>  The Greek goddess Athena is the daughter of Zeus, born of his head, the patroness of sciences and crafts.  She is the goddess of just war and wisdom and is also known as Pallas.  The Romans called it Minerva.  She looks like a warrior with the emblem in the form of the head of a <span>Gorgon jellyfish</span> on her chest.  This goddess is a virgin, and her symbols were an owl and a snake. </p><p>  Apollo or Phoebe is the god of sunshine and truth.  He patronizes art, science and medicine.  On his head is a <span>laurel wreath,</span> and in his hands is a bow with a quiver. </p><p>  Ares is the bloodthirsty god of an unjust war.  In Roman mythology, it bears the name Mars.  He is wearing a helmet, has a sword and shield. </p><p>  Such mythological Greek goddesses as Aphrodite and Hera are no less remarkable in mythology.  Aphrodite is known as Cyprida, and in Rome it was called Venus.  This is the <span>goddess of beauty</span> and love.  Her attributes are a belt, a dove, a mirror, an apple and a rose.  Hera is the wife of Zeus (in Rome - Juno).  She patronizes marriage and family.  A diadem and a single tooth are what are associated with her name. </p><p>  The god of eloquence and commerce is the messenger of Zeus himself, a guide of souls to the kingdom of the dead.  It bears the name Hermes and patronizes merchants, artisans, shepherds, travelers and thieves.  He is dressed in winged sandals and an invisible helmet with wings and has a caduceus or staff with two intertwined snakes. </p><p>  An important place is also occupied by such Greek goddesses as Hestia (Vesta among the Romans) and Demeter.  Hestia is a virgin, the patroness of the family hearth.  Its attribute is a torch.  Demeter - the goddess of fertility and agriculture, always depict her with a staff in the form of a stalk. </p><p>  <span>God of blacksmithing, the</span> patron saint of fire and artisans Hephaestus (Volcano among the Romans) and was the husband of Aphrodite.  His name is associated with blacksmith furs, ticks and pilos. </p><p>  Dionysus (Roman Bacchus or Bacchus) in ancient Greek mythology is known as the god of agriculture, winemaking and viticulture.  He is the patron saint of the theater and is traditionally depicted with a wreath of <span>vines</span> and a bowl of wine. </p>
