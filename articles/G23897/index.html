Cost, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most of the inhabitants of our country do not know that the most <span>expensive coins</span> can be made not of precious metals, but of the most common, such as nickel or copper.  But despite this fact, there are modern coins that have a value higher than the gold <span>money of the Russian</span> Empire.  It is important to understand here that the value of metallic money depends on its rarity, and not on the material from which it is made.  For beginners who want to understand this difficult issue, a special catalog of such rare coins has been created. </p><h2>  Significant events on coins </h2>

But the heyday of commemorative coins came only in the sixteenth century.  To date, the release of such money is actively supported by the main banks of various countries.  The theme of these coins remains the same: anniversaries of various departments and organizations, historical events, anniversaries and anniversaries of cultural and political figures.  Natural, sporting and geographical orientations are also very common.  Basically, all coins have the shape of a circle, but in some countries they can be square coins, and rectangular, in the form of leaves, octagons or with holes.

The first anniversary bimetallic money was issued at the beginning of our century.  Issued as part of commemorative programs, they attract collectors with various reverses.  This is a fairly massive phenomenon that constantly attracts new people.  In addition, such an activity is a good investment, which can bring a pretty good income.  But the main thing here is not material values ​​from collecting, but cultural ones. </p><h2>  Ordinary commemorative coins </h2><p>  To date, the attention of many attracted the most expensive <span>jubilee coin "10 rubles."</span>  And this is no coincidence, their size and original beautiful design attracts and makes you save, while removing them from circulation. </p>

At the same time, many numismatists argue that if the monetary reform begins, the jubilee coins of Russia “10 rubles” will go into circulation in large quantities due to the fact that they will become unnecessary, and their cost will naturally become much lower.

In any case, they will cost no less than the face value. </p><p>  Ordinary commemorative coins have approximately the same cost (maybe up to two hundred rubles).  But even among them you can find quite rare specimens.  What are they, jubilee coins "10 rubles", the cost of which can be much higher?  It depends, first of all, on the region.  After all, here they are distributed very unevenly.  For example, it is rather rare to see today coins of the series "Ministry and Departments", "Gagarin" or "Politruk" and some others.  Their value is now growing rapidly due to the beginning of the second wave of collectors who did not have time to withdraw the necessary money from circulation.  It is still difficult to say how many 10 rubles jubilee coins are in the hands of numismatists.  The above coins are practically not found in our time, and those that are are in poor condition. </p><h2>  Three leaders </h2>

    <p>  Initially, these coins were no different from other bimetallic coins, so at the time they went into circulation, they could be purchased for just <span>five hundred rubles</span> from those who managed to catch them in circulation.  But as soon as the Central Bank of the Russian Federation decided to specify the circulation for these 10 rubles commemorative coins, their cost began to rise, and still it continues to grow. </p><h2>  Ten rubles "Chechen Republic" </h2><p>  Quite a rare coin, the demand for which is getting higher, but the supply also takes place, despite the fact that today it has become cheaper.  The minimum that can be obtained with such a coin is one and a half thousand rubles.  But there are also collectors who are ready to give four thousand.  This rather low cost is due to the fact that about two years ago, some seller or sellers began to sell "Chechen coins" at a price below two thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Ten rubles "Perm Territory" </h2>

Despite the fact that this ten-ruble money was issued in the same circulation as the “Chechen” ones, the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District has a much higher cost due to the fact that it was not put into circulation.  Now it is the most expensive 10 rubles jubilee coin.  There is a rumor that some very enterprising person at one time bought these bimetallic money at face value, thereby setting its price and a great stir on them.
