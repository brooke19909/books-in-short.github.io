Using this plastic, beautiful jewelry, various casts, souvenirs, dolls and other crafts are created.  Clay figurines of this brand have increased strength and a beautiful structure.  The range is represented by an expressive color palette. </p><p>  The material is intended for heat treatment at a temperature of between 110-130 degrees.  The palette consists of 70 colors, 36 of them give products a variety of effects. </p><h2>  Brand Benefits </h2><p>  Many handmade masters appreciated the plastic of this brand. </p><ul><li>  It has thermal sensitivity: after firing, plastic regains flexibility if it is warmed in hands. </li><li>  Lightens up when mixed with white. </li><li>  <span>Leaves no marks</span> on used tools and hands. </li><li>  Finished products do not crack or break during processing. </li><li>  Obtaining other shades is easily achieved by mixing clay of different colors. </li><li>  Paints easily fall on the product before firing and after. </li><li>  Plastic is non-toxic and completely safe. </li><li>  The price of Cernit polymer clay is quite reasonable. </li><li>  It does not lose its properties over time, even when stored open. </li></ul><h2>  Number One Base Line </h2><p>  It includes standard opaque colors.  A distinctive feature of this line is the increased density of plastic.  The material is significantly heavier than clay from other Cernit brand lines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is used for the manufacture of small elements and work with small parts.  Having a certain viscosity and elasticity, plastic is difficult to grind. </p><p>  The Namber Van series is represented by hard clay.  It does not flow and does not stick to hands, and also does not leave fingerprints on itself.  However, it is not recommended for smoothing joints. </p><p>  Cernit Number One gives the product a waxy effect that can achieve translucency.  It all depends on the specific shade.  This has a definite effect on the final color.  After firing, it becomes darker and richer. </p><p>  Heat treatment makes the clay very durable.  She is also able to tolerate small pepek.  However, in this case, the shades become much darker, and the material is even stronger. </p><h2>  Cernit Translucent Review </h2><p>  This line is represented by translucent plastic.  By its properties, it is more plastic and soft.  Cernit Translucent polymer clay has an almost gel-like texture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.malaysiaclayart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Products from Cernit Translucent" class="if uuid-2828828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2828828.jpg"></div><p>  The plastic of this series is more homogeneous, it almost does not form “flakes”, and during overheating it will “leak” in the hands.  However, it is not recommended to use the method of drying clay between two paper sheets, as it can turn into crumb or give excessive brittleness to finished products. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cernit Nature - imitation of natural elements </h2><p>  The plastic of this series is perfect for creating jewelry, various miniatures and decorative elements.  It creates the effect of imitation of natural stones and earth in products.  Plastic is characterized by a dense texture, which during work with it becomes soft like wax.  It is easy to sculpt from it thanks to its shape stability.  Plastic is well detailed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Products from Cernit Nature" class="if uuid-2828853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2828853.jpg"></div><p>  Roasting is carried out in an oven at a temperature of 110-130 degrees.  The recommended time is 30 minutes, but it all depends on the thickness of the product.  After firing, the figures are durable and hard.  They can be engraved, drilled, painted and varnished. </p><h2>  Glitter and shine of Cernit Glamor </h2><p>  The composition of this plastic contains metal powder and crushed glitter.  The palette of the Cernit Glamor line consists of 12 tones with a pearlescent shade and another 6 with a metallic effect.  The range contains colors that are unparalleled by other brands that produce similar materials for modeling.  Polymer clay "Zernit Glamor" is used to create miniatures, decor elements and jewelry.  The line was created specifically for the Mika Shift and Mokume Gan techniques. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thanks to the use of Cernit polymer clay in this series, the final products are distinguished by a spectacular and smooth gradation of shades.  Tones are perfectly combined when mixing the plastics of this line, as well as in combination with an assortment of similar brand rulers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.femme2deco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Products from Cernit Glamor" class="if uuid-2826867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2826867.jpg"></div><p>  A distinctive feature of Glamor is the brightness of color pigments, which is achieved due to the content of metallized particles and microparticles of mica.  Fingerprints do not remain on wet plastic. </p><p>  Polymer clay when heated in the hands turns into a homogeneous and plastic mass.  Heat treatment does not deprive the color of intensity, as a result of this the product acquires a beautiful glossy shine.  Firing makes the plastic very hard and strong, and it is difficult to break manually.  During heat treatment, a temperature of 110 to 130 degrees should be observed. </p><p>  Finished products can be glued, polished, drilled, painted and varnished. </p><h2>  Cernit Shiny - The Perfect Mother of Pearl </h2><p>  The difference of this series from the Glamor line is that the reflective particles of mica are larger, as a result of which the plastic acquires an even mother-of-pearl shine. </p><p>  The Cernit Shiny line was released specifically for the mika-shift technique.  It is recognizable due to the creation of the effect of nacre and light translucency in finished products that appear after baking.  Raw plastic has a slight sheen, and heat treatment gives it a bright flicker when light enters the product.  It does not change color after firing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lafourmicreative.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Products from Cernit Shiny" class="if uuid-2826902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2826902.jpg"></div><p>  The texture of “Zernit Shayni” is dense, but when rolled, it easily takes any shape, becomes soft and plastic. </p><p>  Finished products lend themselves well to grinding, gluing, drilling, decorating with acrylic paints, sparkles and decorative powder. </p><h2>  Glowing Neon Light </h2><p>  The polymer clay of this line has fluorescent properties.  Finished products are particularly bright due to the existing palette of neon colors.  They glow under ultraviolet lamps. </p><p>  Plastic is ideal for making jewelry and design elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lafourmicreative.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Products from Cernit Neon Light" class="if uuid-2826873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2826873.jpg"></div><p>  Polymer clay “Zernit Neon Light” is distinguished by its elasticity, it is very pleasant to the touch.  It does not stick to either hands or tools and almost does not leave fingerprints on it. </p><p>  Firing makes it very durable.  Heat treatment slightly reduces the color brightness, but the fluorescent effect becomes more pronounced.  It is possible to bake it in a home oven, while you need to control the temperature with a special thermometer. </p><p>  After hardening, the product can be drilled, polished, coated with paints and varnish. </p><h2>  Doll line Cernit Doll </h2><p>  The series was created to model dolls with an imitation of the shade of human skin.  The palette contains 7 naturalistic colors, the mixing of which allows you to create unique tones.  It is designed to create figures of dolls.  Polymer clay has an elastic and resilient texture.  However, kneading it will require some effort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Products from Cernit Doll" class="if uuid-2826884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2826884.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the fact that clay does not leave fingerprints and makes the surface of the product smooth, it is ideal for creating puppet figures.  Paints go well on it.  An additional advantage is that when using plastics of this series, the seams are easily smoothed out and the clay is ideally greased. </p><p>  Heat treatment makes the material hard and durable, it gives the product a pleasant wax effect.  At the same time, clay retains its flexibility. </p><h2>  Final processing of plastic models from the Cernit series </h2><p>  The Belgian manufacturer also created a special varnish for the final processing of polymer products, which gives them a real glossy shine.  Its packaging is very convenient.  Made of thick plastic, it minimizes the risk of fluid loss in case of accidental dropping of the jar.  Attached is an instruction in Russian on its use, which is contained in a multilayer label. </p><p>  By its consistency, Cernit <span>polymer clay</span> varnish is rather viscous.  Due to this, extra drops do not drip from the brush, and it lays well on the product, without creating unevenness in the coating. </p><p>  The ideal effect can be achieved by applying varnish in 2-3 layers, provided that each of them dries for at least 1 hour. </p><p>  A feature of Cernit polymer clay varnish is that it does not change the color of the product, but as if merges with it in one piece.  This effect is achieved due to its absolute transparency. </p><h2>  Users recommend </h2><p>  Reviews about Cernit polymer clay are rather mixed.  The plastic of this brand is probably the most controversial on the market.  Some scold her, others are her real fans. </p><p>  It is recommended to purchase it for adults, not for children.  Due to its elasticity, it is suitable for people who do not have joint diseases, because it will take some time to knead plastic. </p><p>  To work with many types of polymer clays, it is recommended to have a paste machine due to the fact that when they are rolled on a surface into a thin sheet, they tightly stick to it.  For such a manual method, powder or talcum powder can be used, however, this makes it impossible to further fasten the parts together without using a special gel.  According to user reviews, with Zernit polymer clay, such problems will not arise. </p><p>  The plastic of this brand is suitable for the manufacture of beautiful jewelry, small figures and decorative elements. </p><p>  As for the price of Zernit polymer clay, it does not belong to the budget category of goods.  For example, a small bag weighing 56 grams from the Number One series costs 125 rubles.  A plastic set of 10 colors (10 g each) is already pulling at 800 rubles.  The market offers plastic at a lower cost.  However, Zernit polymer clay is highly valued by needlewomen due to its strength, quality and rich color scheme. </p>
