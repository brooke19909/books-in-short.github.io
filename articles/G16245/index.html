    <h2>  Comments from travelers about the hotel itself, its location and territory </h2><p>  Our compatriots described Nelia Gardens as a small and comfortable hotel.  The tourists considered the proximity to the sea to be a big plus for it.  So, go to the nearest beach no more than five minutes.  The territory of Nelia Gardens 4 * is small and very well-groomed.  There is a swimming pool (it is regularly cleaned), a sun terrace with new comfortable sun loungers and a children's playground. </p><p>  The rooms in the hotel are very spacious and stylishly decorated.  The apartments are furnished with modern furniture and appliances.  A big plus, our compatriots considered the excellent soundproofing in the rooms.  So no noise from discos from nearby establishments will not interfere with your vacation.  There is also a safe in the rooms.  Almost all apartments have spacious balconies with beautiful views.  They are equipped with convenient clothes dryers.  Room cleaning is carried out every day.  If you are in the apartment and do not want the maid to drop by, just put a ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù sign on the door. </p>

Everyone also liked the fact that they serve ice cream as a dessert for dinner in the hotel restaurant. </p><p>  If you plan to eat on the basis of "breakfast only" or "half board", then you can go to lunch and dinner in one of the restaurants located in the vicinity of the hotel.  All local catering establishments offer deliciously prepared dishes. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of our compatriots from beach recreation and entertainment </h2><p>  The Nelia Gardens 4 * hotel does not offer special entertainment.  On its territory you can only have a good time by the small pool on the sun terrace with comfortable sun loungers.  However, in its vicinity there are so many interesting places that you simply won‚Äôt be bored here.  In addition, experienced travelers recommend that all tourists coming to Cyprus rent a car, scooter or other vehicle and make trips to different parts of this island with an amazing history, culture and magnificent nature. </p><p>  As for the beaches of Ayia Napa, they are all in municipal ownership.  Therefore, you will have to pay for the rental of sun loungers and parasols.  The beach closest to Nelia Gardens is just a five-minute walk away.  It is sandy and very clean.  When entering the water there is a narrow strip where stones are found.  You can either carefully follow them, or go into the sea along a specially equipped path that stretches to the sandy bottom. </p>
