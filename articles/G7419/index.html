  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pattern clothes for the dog. How to dress your pet warm and beautiful?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The pet fashion industry is firmly gaining ground in our domestic market.  This is caused not only by an increase in the well-being of citizens who can afford expensive spa treatments and haircuts for their pets, not only by world fashion trends, but also by necessity, since expensive dog and cat breeds require special care.  Recently, clothes for dogs have become very popular, which are sewn to order, or bought at pet stores.  Dressing our pets in raincoats and overalls, we do not just follow fashion, very often there is an urgent need for it, since the ecology of big cities, street dirt and adverse weather conditions are increasingly harmful to the health of pets. </p><p>  Pattern of clothes for a dog is made according to special patterns.  Each breed has its own proportions and sizes, taking into account its anatomical structure, therefore, when buying costumes, it is important to choose them specifically for a particular dog.  For those who are well versed in patterns and able to sew, we recommend doing sewing on their own and making a suit in accordance with the individual proportions of your pet, as well as taking into account its temperament and needs.  You should not pay much attention to various embellishments and excessive decorative clothes.  For the dog, the main thing is the convenience and protective properties of the costume, and not the style and luxurious accessories. </p><p>  There are many sites on the Internet dedicated to modeling and sewing animal costumes.  Any <span>pattern of</span> dog <span>clothes</span> displayed on the site should be modified specifically for your pet.  Before making changes to the patterns, it is necessary to make measurements of the animal.  Typically, you need a back length equal to the distance from the collar to the tail, paw height and chest width equal to the distance between the ribs and front paws.  The standard pattern of clothing for the dog contains these parameters, which will require appropriate changes.  Now about <span>how to sew a jumpsuit</span> for a dog. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First we find a ready-made <span>pattern of overalls.</span>  It must be ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù to the size of our dog.  We measure the length of the back and the height of the paws and figure out how many centimeters you need to increase or decrease the finished pattern.  We draw a pattern on a piece of paper, taking into account the desired size, then apply it to the dog to check whether it fits.  If some discrepancies are noticeable, then make changes.  After the pattern completely satisfies us, we can proceed to cutting the fabric. </p><p>  There is another way to change the pattern.  If the finished pattern of clothing for the dog is not suitable in size, it must be cut in three to four places where it is necessary to increase or decrease the size and, when cutting the fabric, stretch or narrow by the required size. </p><p>  We recommend that you first cut the jumpsuit out of unnecessary fabric (for example, sheets).  Attach the cut detail to the dog, see if the patterns match, if everything is in order, you can cut from suitable material, and the rag pattern will come in handy next time.  At the neck we make a drawstring and insert the old collar into it, so the jumpsuit will hold on better.  We hook the wings on the lower parts of the legs and insert the gum into them.  To control the fit of the overalls, we do the fitting in the process of sewing and remove, if necessary, all unnecessary.  When cutting and sewing overalls for a dog, it must be taken into account that animals are very mobile, and clothing should not hamper their movements, interfere with running and jumping. </p><p>  It is much easier to sew a suit for a dog out of knitwear or knit it on knitting needles.  Any ready-made pattern for the dog is also suitable here.  Knitting for animals is convenient in that you can always attach the part in the process of work to the dog, dissolve several rows if necessary and tie them again. </p><p>  Sewing and knitting for dogs is not easy.  It will definitely take some experience.  But this can be not only a hobby, but also a good way to earn money, because beautiful and comfortable clothes for cats and dogs cost a lot of money. </p>
