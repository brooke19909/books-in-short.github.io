Fasten them in the middle with a stapler.  Now the fun begins.  Raise the first circle and fold it in the form of a wick.  This is the core of the flower. </p><p>  Lift the second circle, fold it, indicating 4 faces.  It should fit to the core, but not very tightly.  Twist the third circle in the same way, then all the others.  The last, twelfth, only bend slightly, without lifting it so that it becomes wavy.  The flower is ready, glue it to the bottom of the cone. </p><p>  Make a second rose, attach it in the same way.  After the first bottom row, go to the second, placing the roses in a checkerboard pattern.  But make flowers for him a little smaller diameter.  This also applies to the following series.  The closer they are to the crown of the cone, the smaller the diameter of the workpieces.  Attach the last rose to the top. </p><p>  You can leave the tree like that or decorate it with beads, beads, sparkles. </p><h2>  Colored paper is used </h2><p>  The following idea is suitable for those who want to quickly make a small copy of a conifer.  It can be hung as a talisman and decoration on the glass of the car, put on the desktop in the office. </p>

    <p>  To make a yellow Christmas tree, cut and glue three blanks for the cone, differing in size.  Put the largest on the table, put a smaller figure on it, on top - the smallest.  To fasten all these parts together, put glue on the top of the two lower cones, then press for 20 seconds, placing the workpieces in the indicated order - from large to small.  If you want to hang the tree, pierce the crown with a paper clip and tie a <span>decorative cord</span> to it <span>.</span>  You can leave a small hole at the top of each cone through which you will pass the cord.  To hold it tight, tie its two ends to a knot on the back. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Three-tiered openwork Christmas tree made of paper </h2><p>  In almost the same way, you can create two more small spruces.  For the first cut 3 circles, the diameter of each is less than the diameter of the subsequent.  Make scissors on the edges of these figures with a scissors, you can slightly bend it up to give fluffy to your creation. </p><p>  On the side of each of the three blanks, make an incision to the center of the circle, lay the incised sides with a slight odor on each other and glue, but not completely, leaving small holes in the center.  Through them you will also pass the cord and use it to fix the original craft in a hanging position.  Here's a creative tree.  With your own hands, you can make the second one almost the same, stick confetti, sparkles on it and arrange a trio of forest beauties, as shown in the photo. </p><h2>  Once a plank, two plank, there will be a Christmas tree </h2><p>  A creative tree from improvised materials is very original when a fantasy connects.  If the farm has slats 4-5 cm wide, they are perfect.  Since the fir trees are triangular in shape, cut thin boards in such a way that there is a smooth transition from small to large.  For example, the difference in length between the rails is 10 cm. </p><p>  Nail the largest rail vertically to the wall, fasten the rest with screws or nails to this horizontally.  They should be located symmetrically.  Knock them down at the junction of the middle of the main plank with the center of each.  Fix them through the same number of centimeters. </p><p>  In addition to the main one, which plays the role of the trunk, 7 boards are enough, which will be branches.  Here's a creative tree.  With your own hands, it is easy to wrap wooden branches with tinsel, including the crown.  On such wooden planks you can hang socks for gifts.  If the presents are large, they are placed under the spruce. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Do not throw away empty bottles </h2><p>  Under such a tall tree will fit many gifts.  The main thing is not to be naughty about him, so as not to break.  To create this grandiose magnificence, you will need many green bottles, circles made of glass or hard transparent plastic, plexiglass or plywood. </p>

    <p>  Start laying out the tree from its bottom.  First place the round base on the floor, then place the bottles on it with the neck up.  To make the structure durable, it is better to apply a little <span>glue for glass</span> to the bottom of the bottles and fix the container on the base.  Place them next to each other. </p><p>  On top, put a circle of slightly smaller diameter than the previous one, place and fix the bottles of the next tier on it.  Lay out the whole Christmas tree in the same way.  Each subsequent row will have fewer bottles than the bottom.  When there is one left at the top, attach to it a star glued from corks.  You can admire the glass tree! </p><h2>  Creative pasta tree </h2><p>  There are many ideas for New Year's fantasies.  In just half an hour, pasta will turn into a beautiful Christmas tree.  In addition to them, you will need a cone-shaped plastic bottle, a glue gun, and green and gold acrylic paints. </p><p>  Cut the bottom from the bottle so that the workpiece stands firmly on the table.  Cover the bottom of the bottle with glue, attach the first row of pasta.  To do this, use products in the form of bows, then a creative Christmas tree, decorated with your own hands, will look amazing. </p>

    <p>  After the whole bottle is covered with pasta, put it on the bottom.  If you have a stable round support, you can attach it so that you can see the leg of the New Year's beauty.  If not, the tree will look great too. </p><h2>  Decorating pasta miracle </h2><p>  Paint the bows with acrylics or with a spray can.  Such paints also dry quickly and are applied evenly.  The only thing you need to take care of is not to stain the surrounding objects.  Therefore, <span>spray paint</span> on the street or on the balcony, covering third-party objects with a tablet or piece of cardboard. </p><p>  To decorate the New Year attribute with toys, take openwork pasta.  They can be in the form of stars, circles, letters.  A creative Christmas tree made by yourself will help to arouse imagination, and you will figure out which items from the dough will turn into decorations.  If you don‚Äôt have those like in the photo, string small pasta on a strong string or string in the shape of a bead, paint them, and then wrap the Christmas tree around them. </p><p>  This is how a creative Christmas tree is made and decorated with one's own hands.  The photo shows what color you can paint and how to attach accessories to the New Year's beauty.  For this, you can also use spray paint in a gold spray can.  When it is completely dry, apply a drop of glue from the gun to each part and attach it to the base. </p>

In addition to it you will need sweets in shiny wrappers.  It‚Äôs good if they are green.  Attach the first candy vertically, attach it to the bottom of the cone with tape.  Next, attach another, draw a strip of duct tape to also stick to the base. </p><p>  After completing the first, proceed to the second and subsequent rows.  So stick all the candy down to the top of the cone.
