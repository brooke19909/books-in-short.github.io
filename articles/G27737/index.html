    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The exact date of the formation of Barcelona is impossible to determine, but, according to scientists, it was founded more than 2000 years ago.  First, a settlement called Barkenon appeared on the site of the modern city.  Then it was only a coastal plain surrounded by a ridge.  The geographical position of Barcelona was such that it connected Central Europe with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, and therefore was of great strategic importance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the reasons for the appearance of the settlement and, in fact, the founders, there is no definite answer.  Two versions are considered, each of which has the right to exist.  According to Carthaginian legend, Barcelona was founded in 230 BC by Amilcar Barka, who created a settlement near Mount Montjuic, naming it, as was already written above, Barkenon. </p><p>  A more romantic Roman legend, according to which the area was named Barca Nona, which translates as "ninth boat."  The story dates back to Jason's search for his Golden Fleece.  The expedition consisted of nine ships that were scattered across the sea due to a severe storm.  When they managed to get together again, it turned out that eight boats remained.  Then Jason asked Hercules to find the ninth ship.  An ancient Greek hero discovered a crew at the foot of Montjuic.  People who found shelter there after a shipwreck loved this area so much that they decided to stay here, symbolically calling the settlement Barca Nona. </p>

    <h2>  The main attractions </h2><p>  A lot of important and interesting sights of Italy are located in Barcelona.  The description of each of them can go on indefinitely - what are only the works of Gaudi?  Let us briefly consider the most important of them. </p><ol><li>  Gothic Quarter.  Located in Ciutat Vella (Old Town), it is a labyrinth of narrow streets that, alternating one after another, move a person to this or that era. </li><li>  Cathedral.  The main temple of Barcelona was built in 1460.  This building, like many other medieval buildings, is made in the Gothic style, and its interior and exterior are richly decorated with various decorative elements. </li><li>  Park Guell.  One of the works of Antonio Gaudi, in which the maestro designed gingerbread houses, cute fountains, statues and paid special attention to landscape design. </li><li>  <span>Casa Batll√≥.</span>  The building is amazingly beautiful, which stands out with its bright colors and winding lines.  As you might guess, it was designed by Gaudi. </li><li>  Mila's house.  No less futuristic building, which visually resembles a monument.  When designing, Gaudi did not use a single straight line. </li><li>  <span>Mount Montjuic.</span>  The area is very attractive for tourists, as a large number of interesting places are concentrated here.  For example, the famous ‚ÄúSpanish Village‚Äù is an open-air museum city.  There are also palaces and parks on the mountain.  It is recommended to come here in summer, when the climate in Barcelona is most pleasant for long walks. </li><li>  Rambla Boulevard.  Once there was a river, and now at the place where the water flowed, a pedestrian path was laid.  Street artists paint portraits, and actors show funny performances.  There are also summer cafes and souvenir shops on the boulevard. </li><li>  <span>Sagrada Familia.</span>  <span>The</span> Holy Family <span>Cathedral</span> is also the ‚Äúbrainchild‚Äù of Gaudi, the design of which the maestro put 40 years of his life.  The construction began in 1882 and continues to this day. </li></ol>
