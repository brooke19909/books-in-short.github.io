All kinds of double cottages with a common wall, but two completely separate entrances were originally built.  Subsequently, this idea began to be widely used, and today such buildings have gained incredible popularity among large families and individuals.  It is worth noting the fact that certain cities located in Western Europe, these days are almost completely built up with such houses, while townhouses in Krasnodar began to be built relatively recently.  However, in Russia the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconstructing such houses is well-deserved, so there is always a demand for such buildings. </p><h2>  What is it? </h2>

    <p>  In the vast majority of cases, the houses in Krasnodar are interlocked two-story or three-story houses, divided into several sections.  Thus, a peculiar combination of a country cottage and a full-fledged city apartment is formed.  By type, such houses can be: </p><ul><li>  end-to-end (when a separate entrance is provided, as well as a completely separate exit to the rear section); </li><li>  not through (when the entrances in several sections alternate and turn around the world). </li></ul><h2>  How are they built? </h2><p>  Traditionally, townhouses in Krasnodar are planned zoned.  In this case, on the ground floor there are various common areas, such as a living room, kitchen, hallway, pantry and others.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, it is customary to install bathrooms on each floor, and so almost any townhouses in Krasnodar are planned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the past few years, a fairly large number of villages with such buildings began to appear and develop.  However, many do not understand what is the reason for the popularity that even a townhouse in Krasnodar received from an economy class builder.  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Benefits of Townhouses </h2>

    <p>  Since in most cases it is customary to build such buildings in the suburbs, the cost of the section is consistent with a city apartment with a much smaller area.  At the same time, the cost of a townhouse is an order of magnitude lower compared to a separate cottage. </p><p>  Basically, the townhouse has its own garage or parking space, as well as a small plot of land.  This even has a townhouse in Krasnodar from an economy class builder.  Thus, there is no need to solve the problems with parking the car, and there is also the opportunity to fully equip yourself with a resting place on this site. </p><p>  In some buildings of this type, free planning is used, which allows the use of the useful area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe building at its sole discretion.  It is worth noting that the townhouses in Krasnodar (the photos of which you see in the article) are much cheaper and easier to operate compared to separately located cottages.  And if the building is equipped with its own heating, this detail will significantly affect the cost savings of the owners of such a home. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among other things, it should be noted a small number of neighbors.  Everyone usually knows each other, which reduces the risk of theft or attack. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2>

    <p>  But, having arrived in Krasnodar, economy class townhouses you will not immediately see, as well as prestigious houses.  Indeed, such buildings are not being erected within the metropolis - this is a suburban housing format, which in urban conditions is becoming disadvantageous.  Thus, you need to be prepared for the fact that you have to change your lifestyle to a suburban. </p><p>  Also of particular note is the transport accessibility of the home.  It is always good if there is some convenient access for a personal car or a large number of public transport, but in this case it may turn out that there will be no alternative to personal transport.  Do not forget about traffic jams in which you have to stand on the way to work. </p><p>  In such villages, far from the most developed infrastructure is present.  If you bought a townhouse in Krasnodar with repair, then schools, pharmacies, kindergartens, grocery stores - all this will most likely be at a fairly large distance from you.  That is, it will be necessary to purchase all the necessary goods in the city for future use, and children should always be transported to educational institutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unlike individual cottages, not so large house adjoining plots are located near townhouses, and it will be difficult for them to ‚Äúwalk around‚Äù for lovers of the home garden. </p><p>  Among other things, buying duplex townhouses in Krasnodar, you get in addition to your neighbors, and there is no longer that isolation and a kind of privacy that you can get to the owner of a separate private house.  True, in terms of cost, these types of housing are quite different. </p><h2>  What are they built from? </h2>

    <p>  It is worth noting some of the most common technologies that are commonly used in the process of building townhouses. </p><ul><li>  Brick-aerated concrete.  Such buildings are distinguished by a fairly high degree of reliability, as well as very, very good thermal performance. </li><li>  LSTK (quick-mounted structures).  An essential advantage of this type of building is that they are built in an extremely short time at a minimum price. </li><li>  <span>A porous block</span> that can be faced with plaster or brick.  The advantage of such houses can be called brick construction, which will definitely add a sense of reliability to the owner of such a building. </li><li>  Monolithic construction.  In this case, additional enclosing structures made in the form of external walls are used.  The advantage of this technology will be that it is extremely reliable, while being resistant to seismic manifestations.  You can also conduct the construction of premises with a completely free layout. </li></ul><h2>  Legal nuances </h2>

    <p>  If you are interested in town houses in Krasnodar, you should remember a few legal points and be sure to pay attention to them if you sign an agreement with the organization. </p><p>  Initially, you will need to see if your developer has an active building permit.  If the construction is not completed at the moment, you can also check the rights to the land and determine what they are trying to sell to you - the building itself or the building along with the land, and how it will all be completed. </p><p>  Be sure to check the type of permitted use, as there are certain legislative nuances regarding the land on which you can build townhouses in Krasnodar.  The feedback from some companies suggests that owners or developers sell such dwellings, despite the fact that they were not built in accordance with applicable law.  As a result, certain problems arise.  The construction of such buildings is permitted exclusively on land intended for individual or low-rise construction.  As an exception, construction of four-section buildings on country lands is allowed if no more than four sections are present in one row.  In any other situations, the construction of such buildings is illegal. </p><p>  In the predominant majority of cases, the sale of townhouses is carried out with a full set of communications leading to the risers in the place indicated in the project.  It is for this reason that the finished object should be accepted solely according to the specification of the project attached to the contract. </p><h2>  Is this option better than a city apartment? </h2><p>  Many people think about what is better - an ordinary city apartment or an apartment in a townhouse in Krasnodar.  The cost of such a home is approximately the same, so the choice becomes so relevant. </p><h2>  Townhouse Benefits </h2>

    <p>  If we compare the townhouse with the apartment, then the immediate proximity to nature, as well as the availability of its own land plot, on which you can show your abilities as a landscape designer, is an obvious advantage.  Owners of a city apartment do not have such an advantage. </p><h2>  Comfort </h2><p>  Special attention deserves the fact that all owners of such premises have approximately the same level of income.  People will always feel in their environment, which is important enough to ensure a truly comfortable and cozy stay.  At the same time, there are no neighbors who may periodically forget to shut off water or gas, as well as repair something around the clock. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe townhouse itself is more extensive, and at the same time, the owner has his own parking space or garage, which makes him feel much more relaxed and comfortable.  At the same time, in the process of acquiring this housing, it is possible to independently plan the layout, which is impossible in the case of a standard apartment. </p><p>  Fully autonomous heating is also an important advantage.  The presence of an autonomous heating system allows owners to always have hot water, which is often absent among residents of urban high-rise buildings, and this especially manifests itself during a planned summer outage.  Among other things, with the onset of cold weather, the owner of the townhouse always decides for himself when the "heating season" begins. </p><h2>  Safety and Improvement </h2><p>  For most residents of standard city apartments, a constant sense of security has turned into a utopia, and you are very lucky if your porch is clean enough, quiet and bright, and there are no obscene paintings on the walls or any stray animals. </p><p>  The well-maintained territory of the villages, as well as fairly reliable security, allows each resident to feel extremely protected.  This creates a safe and comfortable environment.  In the villages there are specialized sports and playgrounds, as well as guest parking, walking areas and much more.  At the same time, there are no risks that street racers will suddenly want to ride here or city transport will appear, as a result of which being on such a street becomes much safer. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the relatively low cost of townhouses, since the construction of such a building requires spending much less land compared to individual mansions. </p><h2>  What are the disadvantages? </h2>

    <p>  First of all, it is worth noting the higher costs necessary to ensure normal utilities, since the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhome ownership is somewhat larger compared to the apartment.  At the same time, all payments for utilities are made directly to the direct supplier at reduced rates. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there are all the advantages of living in the city, the villages themselves are located outside the metropolis.  This is both an advantage (nature) and a disadvantage (lack of the necessary infrastructure). </p>
