    <p>  If guests get, for example, a room located on the ground floor in a two-story building, they will find a fairly spacious bathroom, a table with a chair, a mirror, air conditioning, a wardrobe, two single beds with small pillows, a nightstand, and an LCD screen on the wall .  A window with a dense curtain opens onto a terrace, which is fenced off with concrete half-walls.  It has a table and plastic chairs.  TV shows Russian channels - First and RTR-Planet.  The antenna sometimes fails, in the evening the signal may even disappear altogether. </p><p>  Room amenities (hairdryer, refrigerator, tea set) are not provided.  Promotional slippers and bathrobes are also missing.  There is a safe in the closet, but paid.  But you can store everything in a bedside table or on the top shelf of the cabinet.  All valuable things will remain in place.  The air conditioner is aimed strictly at the bed, so at night you have to get up and turn it off so as not to catch a cold.  It works properly.  At the reception you can easily get a second key. </p><p>  There are usually no complaints about cleaning.  But at the Club Almoggar 4 * hotel (reviews contain a warning to future guests), you must definitely leave a cleaning lady for tea.  Leave 10 dirhams for tea - the cleaning lady will change towels and bed linen.  Do not leave - just take out the trash, wipe the floor and sink.  The number of towels - two for one resident: small (for the face) and large (bath). </p><p>  The walls in the room are very thin, everything that the neighbors say or do is perfectly audible. </p><p>  In the evenings, various concerts are organized near the hotel, the music sounds until late at night. </p><h2>  Tips for guests at Club Almoggar </h2><p>  Based on the reviews left, we can draw the following conclusions: </p><ul><li>  It is better to choose a room on the second floor for settlement, here the screams of gulls are not so worried. </li><li>  The first floor is not advised to choose: this is the entrance courtyard. </li><li>  According to former residents, the rooms located on the second floor are good.  They have ocean views.  But for them an extra charge is provided (5 euros per day).  In addition, in rooms with ocean views (2-3 floors) in the evenings, music from restaurants and cafes located on the waterfront can be a concern.  Nevertheless, it should be noted that the rooms on the second floor are much more spacious, they have a balcony. </li></ul><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  According to tourists, the territory of Hotel Club Almoggar 4 * is very beautiful and well-groomed, but there are obviously not enough rubbish bins on it, so sometimes you can see either a piece of paper or a plastic spoon, etc. Users in their reviews shared an observation: local they do not attach too much importance to cleanliness, they clean it rather casually. </p><p>  The hotel has a lot of greenery, there are different forms of trees and bushes, magnolias and palm trees. </p>

    <p>  There are swimming pools near the promenade, music always sounds there and animators hold their events.  Sunbeds by the pools have to be taken in the morning at eight o‚Äôclock, pulling them out of the nook where they are stacked on top of each other,  all loungers arranged by hotel staff are usually always occupied.  The towels lying on them testify to it.  Obviously, the residents of the hotel leave them there in the evening, or they have to wake up at four in the morning in order to reserve a place for themselves.  Throughout the territory of Club Almoggar, signs prohibiting the reservation of sunbeds are nailed down.  However, no one is following this, so tourists are forced to do this if they do not want to be left without a place by the pool. </p><h2>  About the beach </h2><p>  Across the road from the hotel is a private beach, provided for the services of residents.  This is a small, sand-covered, square, land area separated by a fence from the rest of the municipal beach.  Sunbeds here at 9 in the morning are arranged by a hotel employee.  Prior to this, they are all tied with an iron chain, so coming here earlier does not make sense. </p><p>  Sun beds on the beach are sorely lacking!  You can only take a seat if you come here at nine in the morning.  Anyone who arrives at 10-11 hours, will be forced to either go back to the hotel, or lay out their towels directly on the sand.  The ocean at first glance seems cold, in fact, the water is very warm, you can swim for a long time.  In the depths you can see small fish.  After lunch, the water becomes unclear, sometimes trash floats in it: plastic packaging or bird feathers.  Strong waves do not exist here.  For beach towels that are issued at the exit, you must leave a deposit: 100 dirhams per piece.  At the end of the rest, the deposit is returned.  Users are advised to take their own towels to the beach. </p><h2>  Tourists </h2><p>  The majority of tourists at Hotel Club Almoggar are French and huge Moroccan families.  A significant part of vacationers are Russians.  You can also meet Germans and Poles. </p><p>  Vacationers from among the locals are very friendly, conflict-free, but still white-skinned Russian tourists should be prepared for close attention. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  Club Almoggar provides breakfast and dinner exclusively.  The food here is not very diverse, but you don‚Äôt have to go hungry either.  A standard breakfast is a fried egg or scrambled eggs with vegetables.  Sometimes the menu contains thin pancakes, rather tasteless, fat donuts and semolina cakes.  Meals are prepared on the terrace by the restaurant.  Inside, a buffet is offered - cucumbers, tomatoes, salad, very salted olives, olives.  They also serve sausage, cottage cheese, cheeses, pastries, butter, jam.  Children can also take milk and cornflakes.  Drinks served for breakfast: coffee made with a coffee machine, cold milk, Moroccan mint or plain black tea.  The machine pours powdered orange juice. </p><p>  Dinner at Club Almoggar Garden Beach 4 * is always fish or chicken, pasta, vegetables, french fries, mashed potatoes or rice.  Sometimes sweet is served.  Almost daily for breakfast and dinner they give a watermelon.  Sometimes it is sweet, sometimes not particularly.  Usually in the middle of dinner, it ends and is replaced by oranges.  During dinner, all drinks are paid.  Even water is not free.  It is generally not free at the hotel, you have to buy at the store.  The price of 1.5 liters of plain still water in Agadir is 5 dirhams. </p><p>  Hotel Club Almoggar 4 * (Morocco) has a bar near the large pool.  There is also a fast food diner, bars where the prices, according to reviews, are acceptable.  In the absence of a desire to go out somewhere, you can dine there. </p><h2>  Boardwalk </h2><p>  The city has a large number of restaurants, cafes, brand stores, where it is always interesting to go to a tourist.  Users are advised to visit a fish restaurant near the port.  It is beautiful, clean, the prices are written on the menu in French and Arabic.  The waiters do not understand well both in English and in Russian.  Alcohol is not sold. </p><p>  You can visit restaurants with Lebanese, Turkish, Moroccan cuisine, pizzerias, etc. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The authors of the reviews do not recommend buying ‚Äúleft‚Äù cheap excursions that are traded at the exit from the hotel by Moroccans.  It is better to buy excursions from the guide.  They are not too expensive, but they are of high quality, in addition, they are covered by insurance. </p><p>  In Agadir, according to reviews, there is almost nothing to inspect.  There are no attractions in the city itself.  You can visit the free bird park marked on the map proposed by the guide.  In the distance you can see the mountain with flaming words in Arabic, on it are the ruins of an ancient fortress.  A taxi to the fortress and back costs 80 dirhams, and it is necessary to arrange with a taxi driver in advance so that he waits until the tour ends.  From there it is almost impossible to catch a taxi. </p><p>  From the mountain, Agadir offers a wonderful view. </p><h2>  Locals </h2><p>  Locals do nothing for free.  They are polite, do not speak Russian and English well.  If a tourist decides to take a hiking trip, for example, in Unipri and gets lost, the locals will show the way.  But they will require 20 dirhams for this. </p>
