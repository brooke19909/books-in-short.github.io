  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Message from Sberbank: "Cancel authorization." What is it, in what cases does an error occur?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When working with Sberbank cards, customers sometimes encounter a problem when their operation is not completed.  In this case, after payment, an SMS from 900 arrives with the message: "Cancel authorization."  Sberbank thus warns the owner of a malfunction in the system.  For what reason can an error occur, and how to solve the problem? </p><h2>  What is ‚ÄúCancel authorization‚Äù on a Sberbank card? </h2><p>  Authorization for "plastic" is a confirmation of the transaction by the issuer of the payment instrument.  That is, Sberbank.  Information about the cancellation comes to the client at the time or after the transaction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cancellation of authorization sberbank" class="if uuid-3234276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234276.jpg"></div><p>  If the cardholder received a similar notification from 900, he should check his balance.  Sberbank returns funds to cancel authorization within 48 hours.  If a cash refund has not occurred, it is recommended to contact the Contact Center.  The Sberbank hotline operates around the clock. </p><h2>  Reasons for Cancellation </h2><p>  Transaction cancellation notification comes in the following cases: </p><ol><li>  The client voluntarily refused the operation after confirmation with a PIN code.  For example, when paying at the office of Sberbank, after which the employee canceled the operation. </li><li>  A technical failure has occurred.  In this situation, the cardholder receives a notification from 900. The message indicates that the error occurred due to the fault of the bank. </li><li>  Reversal of operation.  In case of repeated debiting of funds, for example, when paying for a purchase at a point of sale, the Sberbank card holder may request a cancellation of debiting.  Sometimes reversal occurs automatically: in this case, you do not need to apply to the store administration. </li><li>  Problems with the POS terminal.  A payment terminal malfunction is the reason why money is first debited from the card and then returned to Sberbank's account. </li><li>  Internet connection issues.  During the payment process, especially through the Sberbank Online Internet service, funds may be debited, but the operation will remain at the stage of waiting for confirmation. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.coindesk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Hotline" class="if uuid-3234277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234277.jpg"></div><h2>  Why is Sberbank using authorization cancellation? </h2><p>  Authorization by bank cards is needed for additional protection of funds.  Thus, the issuer warns against unauthorized debit of cash in case of fraud. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the client received a notification from Sberbank with cancellation of authorization, the payment should be repeated to complete the operation.  A message from 900 arrives within 24 hours with a similar error.  Reversal in retail outlets is the reason why a notification can come with a delay of up to 48 hours. </p><p>  Sometimes the client does not receive SMS at all that his operation has been canceled by the issuer.  From 900, a notification may be received about crediting funds to the card account.  This is not a mistake: Sberbank can cancel authorization without notification, especially if the client has the Mobile Bank service blocked or the number is not tied to a card. </p><h2>  What to do in case of a refund? </h2><p>  When a bank cancels a payment, the money is returned to the client.  But if the payer wants to repeat the operation, he must first check the balance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cancellation of authorization sberbank" class="if uuid-3234281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234281.jpg"></div><p>  If the money has been received, you should carry out the same operation and, if necessary, confirm the payment on the Sberbank hotline. </p><h2>  When a transaction was canceled, money hung: what should I do? </h2><p>  When the bank does not confirm the payment, there is a risk that the funds in the card account will be blocked without the ability to continue the operation.  What to do if cancellation of authorization in Sberbank leads to a freeze in cash: </p><ol><li>  Wait 24 hours.  During this time, the bank can confirm the transaction or return the funds. </li><li>  If the wait did not help, you need to contact the employees of Sberbank to solve the problem.  When you visit the office, you need a passport and a bank card with which the client made the transaction.  To call the contact center, you must be identified by entering personal data, passport information and a code word. </li><li>  When contacting a bank or support service in case of cancellation of authorization, the cardholder, with the help of employees, must draw up a statement.  After completing the application, the client will receive a notification that his question is being considered by technical support specialists.  The SMS shall indicate the number of the appeal and the deadline for solving the problem. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="What is cancellation of authorization on a Sberbank card" class="if uuid-3234279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3234279.jpg"></div><p>  It does not matter where the payer made the transaction: the processing time may be increased to 45 days.  When paying through Sberbank Online, cancellation of authorization may mean that the client needs to confirm the operation using the contact center.  A 900 call is free. </p>
