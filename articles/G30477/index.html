    <p>  The city has a large number of hotels of various categories - ranging from two to five stars.  All of them are of high quality services.  As a rule, hotels are located on the first line, in addition, the greater the "star rating", the more likely it is that it has its own beach.  However, at the same time, at three-star hotels the entrance to the sea can sometimes be even better than at the "fives". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Paphos has both sandy and rocky beaches.  The best of them is the wide and long sandy Coral Bay located in the bay.  The resort hotels mainly work at breakfast, although some offer their guests two meals a day.  In winter, many of them close.  In those that operate in the low season, there are indoor pools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paphos Gardens Apartments" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/733007.jpg" width="460"></div>
