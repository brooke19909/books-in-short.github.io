  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rest in the Czech Republic</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most beautiful and interesting countries in Europe is considered to be the Czech Republic.  There are a lot of places without visiting which rest in the Czech Republic will be boring and bland.  The country is so diverse that here everyone can find something fascinating and memorable. </p><p>  A separate attraction can be called Prague, which is a favorite vacation spot for tourists from all over the world.  Here, literally every corner breathes history.  When planning a vacation in the Czech Republic <strong>,</strong> you must definitely include a visit to the Golden Street located in Prague.  This is a small quarter with miniature two-story houses where the guards used to live.  Later there was a prison, after which the district became criminal in nature.  Today it is a network of museums and shops located in extremely <span>unusual buildings.</span>  <span>The most</span> romantic place can be called <span>Charles Bridge,</span> on which there are 30 copies of statues.  The originals, due to their great age and the negative impact of the external environment, as a result of which they are destroyed, are safely removed. </p><p>  For tourists, the city of <span>Kutna Gora</span> will be very interesting <span>,</span> which was included in the UNESCO list of attractions of world significance.  It is here that the Church of All Saints was built.  This is perhaps the most original church in the world, since it is decorated with the remains of about 40 thousand people.  For its decoration, skulls and bones were mainly used.  After visiting such a place, you understand that rest in the Czech Republic will definitely not be boring.  To plunge into the history of the country <span>of the Middle Ages,</span> you need to visit Detenice.  This is the castle where the weapon exposition is located.  According to legend, the treasures of the knights of the Order of Malta are hidden in the dungeons of the castle.  The highlight of visiting this place is its restaurant.  Here, tourists will be somewhat shocked by such a deep immersion in history.  The organizers complied with all the traditions that existed in the Czech Republic at that time.  The waiter may roughly ask: ‚ÄúWill you eat?‚Äù  This is not a desire to offend the guest, but the usual treatment typical of the Middle Ages.  Almost all dishes need to be eaten by hand, and wine is served in large heavy glasses.  Do not be surprised if in the process of dinner a drunkard approaches a tourist or some warrior starts pestering.  This is all part of one big play played by professional actors. </p><p>  Wellness holidays in the Czech Republic are in great demand among tourists.  The most famous health resorts are located in Karlovy Vary, where for many years dignitaries from all over the world have come to improve their health.  In the same city are 2 of the largest production of Czech beer ‚ÄúKuruszowice‚Äù and the Jan Becher factory.  Beer can be safely called a national drink.  Hundreds of pubs work daily throughout the country, where you can try this drink of the most unusual varieties. </p><p>  It is very difficult to buy last-minute <span>tours to the Czech Republic</span> at the height of the holiday season or for holidays, since this destination is very popular among tourists.  They are attracted by the relatively low price of accommodation and excursions.  Families with children come here to relax, big noisy companies, <span>couples in love.</span>  Everyone can find for themselves entertainment in this country.  Buying last-minute trips to the Czech Republic on international holidays is a great success for the traveler, since he gets the opportunity to visit the most beautiful places on the planet for a relatively small amount.  Despite the pomp of architectural constructions of this <span>country, the Czech Republic is</span> an amazingly fun and hospitable state.  It is impossible to recognize him in one trip.  It will take a single year.  It is worth noting that for her, in fact, there are no certain tourist seasons, since you can get acquainted with the Czech Republic at any time of the year.  Have a nice rest! </p>
