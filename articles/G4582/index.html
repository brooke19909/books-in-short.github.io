What to do in this case?  Do not worry, they may not be lost forever.  How to restore photos on the iPhone?  The article describes in detail some methods that will allow you to find and return deleted images to the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to restore photos on an iPhone" class="if uuid-3191248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3191248.jpg"></div><h2>  How is this possible? </h2><p>  Experts recommend trying each method in order, since the first is the easiest.  Nevertheless, you can go directly to each step using the instructions below.  If you accidentally deleted photos from iPhone, how to recover them?  This can be done in one of the following ways: </p><ul><li>  Via Recently Deleted Photos. </li><li>  Retrieve lost photos from backup using iBackup Extractor. </li><li>  Download them from iTunes backup. </li><li>  Copy from iCloud backup. </li><li>  Revert files using iMyFone D-Back. </li></ul><h2>  Method 1. Recently deleted photos </h2><p>  First of all, this is the fastest and easiest way to recover deleted photos on the iPhone.  If your iPhone runs on at least iOS8, you will have the Recently Deleted folder in the Photos app.  Even if you delete the images, they will remain on your iPhone for 30 days before they are permanently erased. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="recoverit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to recover photos on iPhone after deletion" class="if uuid-3191636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3191636.jpg"></div><p>  Please note that this option only covers photos that you have deleted.  If you lose data due to software or backup problems, images will not be restored.  In this case, go to method 2. </p><h2>  How to do it? </h2><p>  How to restore photos on iPhone using this method?  This is done as follows: </p><ul><li>  Open the Photos app. </li><li>  Scroll down to the Recently Deleted folder. </li><li>  It will show all deleted photos for the last 30 days, as well as the number of days remaining until the final erase. </li><li>  Click ‚ÄúSelect,‚Äù then check all the images that you want to restore to your device. </li><li>  Click on ‚ÄúRestore‚Äù to copy your photos to the device. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.imobie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to recover deleted photos from an iPhone" class="if uuid-3191252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3191252.jpg"></div><h2>  Method 2: Retrieve Lost Photos from a Backup </h2><p>  How to recover photos on the phone?  An iPhone is different in that it can have backup copies of all data.  If your photos have been permanently deleted from the device, you need to check all its backups.  If one of them contains images that were then erased, you can perform smartphone recovery to return the files back. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, restoring from a backup will overwrite the data that is currently on the phone.  Thus, you can lose your latest photos and other information.  Can I restore photos on iPhone without losing other data?  There is such an opportunity. </p><h2>  How to perform this process? </h2><p>  To do this, you will have to use the popular iBackup Extractor tool to retrieve deleted data from backups.  This is done like this: </p><ul><li>  Download and install iBackup Extractor. </li><li>  Select a backup copy of the device from the list to view its contents. </li><li>  Click on the Photos tab in each of them to find deleted photos. </li><li>  Once you find the images you want to restore, select them and click "Copy Photos." </li></ul><p>  The free iBackup Extractor demo allows you to extract 50 files.  They will be copied to your computer.  If you want to return photos to your iPhone, just connect it to your computer and open iTunes.  Click the device‚Äôs icon, then Photos, to open the sync options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover deleted photos on iphone" class="if uuid-3191243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3191243.jpg"></div><p>  Select the ‚ÄúSync photos‚Äù checkbox, then select the folder on your computer from the drop-down list where you copied the photos using iBackup Extractor.  Having made your choice, click ‚ÄúApply‚Äù to copy the images from the PC to the iPhone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Method 3: Restore from iTunes </h2><p>  Is it possible to recover deleted photos from iPhone without using special tools if more than 30 days have passed?  If you do not want to extract images selectively, you can simply restore the iPhone backup.  As mentioned earlier, this will overwrite the contents of your device with what was previously saved. </p><p>  For this reason, it is recommended that you copy important iPhone information to your computer before restoring the backup.  You can transfer photos, messages, music and much more from your smartphone to your computer using TouchCopy. </p><p>  How can you restore your iPhone backup using iTunes: </p><ul><li>  Connect your iPhone to your computer with a USB cable. </li><li>  Turn on iTunes if it doesn't open automatically. </li><li>  Click the icon of your device when it appears in iTunes. </li><li>  Select "Restore backup ...". </li><li>  Make a selection of the copy you want to download and click Restore. </li></ul><p>  Keep your device connected until the procedure is complete.  Your smartphone will reboot and then sync. </p><h2>  Method 4: Restore from iCloud </h2><p>  How to recover photos on iPhone after deletion?  If you back up iPhone on iCloud, you can return the data from there. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, restoring a backup will overwrite the existing contents of your device.  If recovering from iCloud, you need to delete the current contents of your iPhone before starting the recovery process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="softdroid.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deleted photos from iPhone how to recover" class="if uuid-3191644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3191644.jpg"></div><p>  For this reason, we recommend that you copy important information from your iPhone to your computer beforehand.  You can transfer photos, messages, music and more. </p><h2>  How is the recovery process going? </h2><p>  How to recover photos on iPhone using iCloud?  This is pretty simple. </p><p>  Before you begin, double-check that you have an iCloud backup to restore on your iPhone.  After that, follow these steps: </p><ul><li>  Erase your device.  Go to Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Delete All Content and Settings. </li><li>  Enable device reset. </li><li>  Follow the on-screen instructions until you reach Applications and Data, and then select Restore from iCloud Backup. </li><li>  Using your existing Apple ID, sign in to Iceland. </li><li>  Click on the backup you want to restore, and the recovery process will begin. </li></ul><p>  When you back up your iPhone to iTunes and iCloud, even some permanently deleted data, such as photos, is saved. </p><h2>  Method 5. Using the iMyFone D-Back Service </h2><p>  How to recover photos on iPhone?  D-Back allows you to return this data.  The fastest way to permanently delete deleted photos on your iPhone is to use the iMyFone D-Back app.  First you need to figure out how to use this service. </p><p>  Download the iMyFone D-Back app to your Mac or PC.  Installation file name: iMyfone-data-recovery-for-iphone_setup.exe.  Click on it to start the download.  Choose a free trial.  Upon completion, the interface will automatically start. </p><p>  Choose where you want to restore your photos from iTunes or iCloud (backups).  In the vertical menu on the left side of the screen you will see several recovery options.  If you have never backed up your iPhone to iTunes before, select Restore From iOS Device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deciphertools.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recover deleted photos from iphone" class="if uuid-3191263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3191263.jpg"></div><p>  Even if you have never backed up your photos, you still have the opportunity to restore them.  But returned images may be scaled down.  Connect your device to the computer and wait until the D-Back recognizes it. </p><p>  If you backed up iPhone in iTunes, select Restore from iTunes Backup.  You may have several iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.) for which you made a copy of this account.  If so, you will see a list.  Select the copy from which you want to recover information.  Click on "Next." </p><p>  If you backed up your iPhone to Icicle, select Restore from iCloud Backup. </p><p>  Log in to your iCloud account, then select the appropriate item from the list.  There may be several backups for one device.  Click "Next". </p><p>  Select only the type of data that you want to recover (photos).  If you need only your permanently deleted images, click the ‚ÄúSelect All‚Äù button at the top of the screen to deselect all.  Then click ‚ÄúPhotos‚Äù and ‚ÄúApplication Photos‚Äù in the third row.  Click Scan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ios.gadgethacks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover photos on iphone phone" class="if uuid-3191253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3191253.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not take this step, the ‚ÄúSelect All‚Äù box will be checked by default, and D-Back will search for all lost data.  It will take more time. </p><p>  When scanning is complete, images will appear on your screen.  To restore permanently deleted photos, select ‚ÄúShow only deleted files‚Äù in the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.  Select "Restore."  Then all that remains to be done is to create or select a folder for D-Back, where the program should place the recoverable data. </p><p>  After that, connect your iPhone to the computer and copy the restored data to it.  This can be done in any of the available ways. </p>
