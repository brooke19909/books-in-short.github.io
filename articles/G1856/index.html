    <h2>  Hotel Residential Fund </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of our compatriots, they were pleased with the rooms offered by them at the Vistasol Punta Cana Beach Resort &amp; Casino <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Dominican Republic, Punta Cana)</span> .  So, according to them, the apartment was recently renovated.  They are spacious, clean and comfortable.  Furniture and appliances are in good condition.  If you find any malfunction, then report it to the reception, and the problem will be fixed as soon as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the location of the rooms in the hotel, according to tourists, they differ only in the presence or absence of ocean views.  After all, the road to the beach from all residential buildings will take about the same time.  Many of our compatriots are advised to use the safe in the room.  This service costs only ten dollars for the entire stay, but your documents and valuables will be safe.  True, according to travelers, there are very few cases of theft here, but it is better to once again protect yourself from such a risk.  As for the minuses of the apartments, some hotel guests note poor sound insulation.  According to them, if you come across neighbors who like to talk loudly, then you will be aware of all their affairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vistasol punta cana beach resort casino 4 pics" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1064001.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Room cleaning </h2><p>  Most of the guests had no complaints about the work of the maids of the Vistasol Punta Cana Beach Resort hotel.  So, according to them, the cleaning was carried out efficiently and every day.  The maids change the towels in the rooms if they throw the dirty ones on the floor.  Bed sheets were updated several times a week.  Also, as they were used, the maids replenished supplies of personal hygiene products (shampoos, shower gel, soap, toilet paper, etc.) and reported bottled drinking water to the refrigerator.  If you find that you forgot to put something, then inform the reception about it.  In addition, you can always ask the maid for what you need if you meet her in your building. </p><h2>  Internet access </h2><p>  Access to wireless Internet at the Vistasol Punta Cana Beach Resort &amp; Casino 4 * hotel <span>(Dominican Republic), reviews</span> of which we are considering, is provided in the rooms for an additional fee.  Moreover, the cost of such a service, according to our compatriots, is quite high - about $ 50 in 10 days.  However, our compatriots claim that free Wi-Fi is available in the theater area in the hotel complex, as well as in the restaurant adjacent to it.  True, the connection speed here leaves much to be desired.  Many tourists, if necessary, went to one of the Russian shops located on the beach.  According to them, the owner can be asked for a password from the Internet, and use it calmly, conveniently sitting right on the chairs in the shade of the trees.  The connection quality here, according to travelers, is very good.  Wi-Fi is also available at some cafes in the surrounding area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vistasol punta cana beach resort casino 4 dominican punta cana" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1064002.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Judging by the stories of our compatriots, regardless of the time of your arrival at Vistasol Punta Cana Beach Resort, you should not count on checking in before three in the afternoon.  Therefore, if you plan to arrive at the hotel in the morning, then be prepared for the fact that you will be given room keys only after lunch.  However, this does not mean that you have to spend all this time in the lobby next to the reception.  So, you can leave your things in the luggage compartment and go to a restaurant, bar, swim in the pool, take a walk around the hotel complex or go directly to the beach.  After lunch, you will need to go to the reception again, take the key to the apartments you are due and transfer your suitcases and bags there. </p><p>  On the day of departure, the room should be vacated before noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel in the evening, then your stay can be extended at an additional cost.  However, few of the guests do this.  After all, you can again leave things in the luggage room, and continue to enjoy your vacation yourself, using the entire infrastructure of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vistasol punta cana beach resort casino 4 dominican republic" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1064004.jpg" width="600"></div>

Both adults and children enjoyed watching these representatives of the fauna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vistasol punta cana beach resort casino 4 traveler reviews" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1064005.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, in many ways it even corresponds to a five-star hotel.  During the day, you can eat here at the main buffet restaurant.  Here you will be offered a variety of dishes of both local and international cuisine - soups, meat, poultry, seafood, snacks, salads, pastries, desserts.  The menu does not repeat every day, so you can always try something new.  Guests note as a plus the fact that here you will be offered several types of freshly squeezed juices, a lot of fresh fruits, as well as ice cream that you can eat all day. </p><p>  In addition to the main restaurant, vacationers can eat in the beach bar.

Our compatriots were quite satisfied with their quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vistasol punta cana beach resort casino 4 dominican republic reviews" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1064006.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  According to travelers, this item will definitely not disappoint those who plan to spend their holidays in Vistasol Punta Cana Beach.  Indeed, next to the hotel is a large sandy clean beach.  There are many sun loungers.  According to our compatriots, free sunbeds on the beach can always be found.  However, if you have arrived on vacation with a large family or company, it is advisable to occupy the sun loungers early in the morning, since later it is likely that you will not be able to find a large number of free sunbeds next to each other.  As already noted, the beach has a bar and snack bar where you can enjoy refreshments and alcoholic drinks, eat ice cream and have a snack during the day.  There are also several shops, tour agencies, souvenir shops. </p>
