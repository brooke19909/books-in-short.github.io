This solemn event for the citizens and guests of the UAE happened on September 9, 2009 at 9 hours 9 minutes and 9 seconds in the evening.  Then only one red line was launched.  September 9, 2011 and earned green.  The project involves the construction of 4 lines on which 99 trains will run.

    <p>  The metro in Dubai is a miracle of technology that even the New York subway cannot compare with.  Cleanliness and order reign around, policemen are on duty at the stations, although there is no particular need for them, because everything is calm around, people behave culturally.  The metro is equipped with toilets that amaze with their impeccable appearance, after almost every visitor an employee enters the room and cleans everything up.  The floors are everywhere polished to a shine, the cars are spacious, bright and comfortable.  And most importantly - no noise, fuss and erratic crush, even at rush hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Features of the subway in the UAE </h2>

How to pay the fare, where to go, how to get to the numerous stations, how to determine which car to enter - all this worries foreign tourists.  If you look at these issues, it becomes clear how thoroughly everything is thought out in the UAE.  Many travelers buy a one-day subscription to simply ride the subway and explore the main attractions of the city, because the stations are made taking into account the personal preferences of passengers traveling for shopping or to explore interesting places.

    <p>  The main feature of trains is that they travel automatically, without a driver.  Most of the time they ride to the surface.  Almost all the main stations are located on the ground, so passengers can explore the surrounding landscapes during the trip.  Only some remote stations are underground.  It‚Äôs unrealistic to get lost in the subway, because different trains run on the red and green branches, and the names of the next stations are announced in advance. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Terms of use </h2><p>  How to use the metro in Dubai?  Paying for the metro can be "zero" with cards and tickets.  In Arabic, the word "zero" is translated as "fare."  Cards are issued in gold, silver and blue colors, but tickets are only red.  A significant difference between these payment methods is that the cards are an electronic wallet that can be replenished from time to time.  In addition to the metro, they can be used in water and surface buses, in parking lots.  The validity of smart cards is 5 years, which is very convenient for the indigenous people of the UAE.  Tickets are purchased on only one route for a fixed number of trips.  The validity period of one of them is 3 months. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

A subscription must be bought for each passenger, different people cannot use the same card, because payment is charged depending on the distance.  The funds are debited at the exit station.  Children under 5 years old can ride for free, but there is a caveat: they must be below 90 cm. Some foreign craftsmen, trying to fool the miracle technique, buy one card, planning to slip into the car.  But having missed one passenger, the system no longer accepts the second with the same card, so no one succeeds in such a trick.

    <h2></h2><h2>  Types of cars </h2><p>  Foreigners who come to the UAE need to know how to use the metro in Dubai.  All cars are divided into three types: "gold", the usual for women and children.  Standard seats make up about 80% of the entire train, they are almost inferior to the Gold class, they have an air conditioning system.  The cost of the subway in Dubai is almost twice as high if you ride in a high-class carriage.  In every train he goes first.  There are no special differences from ordinary places in it, only there are always fewer people, which is connected with the price, and you can also look in the windshield, imagining yourself a machinist or just enjoying the views that open to your eyes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

One of them is intended exclusively for women and their children, men are not allowed to enter there, so you need to be careful.  However, women can ride in the same carriage with men, it is recommended only to adhere to the dress code in order to protect themselves from troubles.  To get to the right part of the composition will help inscriptions above the glass doors to the entrance to the train.

Most stops are on or above the ground, and only four are below it.  The train mainly moves along overpasses at an altitude of 15 m. On the red line, stations 27 through 30 are skipped, apparently they will be built in the future. </p>

The train returns to its original stop after half an hour.  Now there are 18 stations, two are under construction.  The city authorities are doing everything possible for the comfort of guests who have arrived in Dubai.  The metro scheme in Russian will help to organize the trip correctly and not get lost.  It should be borne in mind that the stations, in addition to names, also have numbers.

    <h2></h2><h2>  Fare </h2><p>  The cost of the metro in Dubai directly depends on which car the passenger chooses.  It should be noted that the "Gold" class is almost two times more expensive than usual.  The fare also depends on the number of metro zones crossed.  For many tourists it will be advantageous to purchase a subscription for one day or month for an unlimited number of trips.  If you often have to use the subway, go shopping, see the sights, then this is an ideal option.  A 1-day subscription for an unlimited number of trips can be purchased for 14 AED, a one-time Gold class ticket costs from 4 to 13 AED (depending on the number of zones), a one-time standard ticket is from 2 to 6.5 AED.  Prices are current for February 2014. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Basic driving rules </h2>

It is also forbidden to transport strong drinks, and smoking rooms are equipped with special facilities, as smoking is not allowed in public places.  No pets are allowed on the subway, even if they are placed in special cages and bags.

    <h2></h2><h2>  The main differences between the Dubai and Moscow metro </h2><p>  The first noticeable difference between the metropolitan subways of the two states is that trains run automatically in the UAE, and the drivers do not operate them.  In Dubai, fare is charged per zone, short trips are subject to a separate fare.  There is a maximum charge.  If it is debited from the card, then the passenger can continue to travel as much as desired, but for free. </p><p>  There is a difference in the location of the aprons.  In Moscow, it is located in the middle, and trains come from different directions.  The metro in Dubai has two different aprons, as trains run in the center.  To get on them, you need to climb them or go down on the elevator, escalator or stairs.  Before choosing a descent / ascent, you should decide which way to go.  In the UAE, the platform is separated from the rails by a transparent wall, which opens only when combined with the doors of an approaching train.  It should be recognized that this innovation protects passengers from accidents. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Arabs cleanliness </h2>

It‚Äôs a pleasure to be in the cars, they are executed in blue and white colors, comfortable seats and huge windows allow you to fully enjoy the trip.
