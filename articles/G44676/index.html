    <h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  In ancient times, this city in France was called differently - Arelat.  Its first inhabitants were ligurs.  Over time, the city became a trading port, which later (123 BC) was captured by the Romans.  After the construction of the canal connecting the city with the Mediterranean Sea, Arelat became a strategically important settlement, although it was still inferior to Massilia (present-day Marseille), located on the coast. </p><p>  During the war of Caesar against Pompey, the townspeople took the side of Caesar, who, after the victory, granted Arelat numerous privileges.  A camp of the sixth region and a colony of veterans appeared in the city.  Over time, the present Arles became an important religious and cultural center of Narbonne Gaul - a province of the Roman Empire.  From here began the spread of Christianity in Galia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãin france" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1753850.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the IV-V centuries, Emperor Constantine I built a bath in the city.  Soon his son, Constantine II, was born.  In the VI century the Visigoths conquered and devastated the city, and in 739 the power in Arelat passed to the Arabs.  From 934 to 1032, Arles became the capital of the Arles kingdom.  The city lost its political independence in 1239 and was annexed to the county of Provence, giving way to the main port of Marseille. </p><p>  Since 1481, the city has been part of France.  The economy of Arles fell into decay at the end of the 15th century, and it became one of the provincial cities of Southern France.  Today it is an important industrial and agricultural center of France.  There are many museums, historical and architectural attractions, many of which are included in the UNESCO cultural heritage list.  To get acquainted with them, you must make a trip to the south of France.  It is here that you can admire the unique monuments and enjoy the ancient atmosphere. </p><h2>  Arles, France: Attractions </h2><p>  What is remarkable about this city?  The south of France is characterized by traditional urban development for these places - cozy small houses of white brick, which are covered with red tiles, with blue shutters on the windows - this is how the residential neighborhoods of Arles look today.  Shady alleys are broken between the houses, where it is always pleasant to relax on comfortable benches. </p><p>  And in the center of the city are ancient Roman buildings, with which many travelers associate Arles. </p><h2>  Amphitheater </h2>

    <p>  The pearl and one of the main attractions that this city is famous for in France is the Roman amphitheater.  Researchers claim that it was built in 46 BC.  In ancient times, it was an arena in which gladiatorial battles took place.  The amphitheater accommodated almost 25 thousand spectators.  The legendary Hollywood movie "Gladiator" was shot here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the VI century AD, the amphitheater was converted - it was turned into a fortification.  All arches and passages were laid, watchtowers were built on top.  Inside the fortress were two chapels and about 200 residential buildings.  The main arena was the central square. </p><p>  And only in the XIX century began to restore the original appearance of this ancient structure.  Today it is a symbol of the city, one of the most popular and most visited monuments.  They stage operas, stage theatrical premieres and twice a year bullfights. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  If you happen to visit the south of France, then you will probably be surprised by the huge number of temples and churches located in this relatively small territory.  Another attraction of the city, which is always visited by tourists, is the Cathedral of St.  Trofima. </p><p>  It is located in the very center of the city, next to Roman antique buildings.  The cathedral in Arles (France) was built on the site where there used to be a more ancient structure - St. Stephen's Cathedral (V in A.D.).  In those days, Christianity was still banned in Europe, and Saint Trofim became his first propagandist, for which the bishop paid his life - Trofim was brutally stoned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arles" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1753846.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The priest who received martyrdom was counted among the saints.  His relics were transferred to the temple in 1152, and at the same time the cathedral was renamed.  Since 1981, the cathedral in Arles entered the UNESCO World Heritage List.  The Resurrection of Christ, the Old Testament, as well as stories from the earthly life of Saints Trofim and Stephen became the main themes of the design of the monastery. </p><h2>  Necropolis </h2><p>  Aliscamp is a Roman ancient necropolis where noble citizens were buried.  Here St. Trofim also found his last refuge.  In the Middle Ages, wealthy citizens of Arles wanted Aliscamp to be their last refuge. </p><p>  The city of Arles gradually expanded, in the XI-XIII century the number of its inhabitants increased significantly.  Several small churches appeared on the old cemetery, of which only ruins have survived today.  Already by the 18th century, Aliscamp turned into <span>an open-air museum.</span>  But in 1848 a section of the railway was laid here, which violated the integrity of the ensemble. </p><p>  Due to the fact that over time this city in France significantly expanded its borders, the necropolis turned out to be one of the central areas of the city.  Today, the museum complex is an alley that is surrounded on both sides by numerous sarcophagi.  It leads to the temple of St. Honorat.  This place inspired the work of Gauguin and Van Gogh, who depicted him on their canvases. </p><h2>  Roman theater </h2><p>  The oldest building in Arles (France).  The Roman theater was erected during the reign of Emperor Augustus.  He had 33 landing stages, accommodating about 8 thousand spectators.  In the Middle Ages, the theater turned into a quarry: a city wall was built from the stone that was brought from the Roman theater.  Today, several columns have survived from the back wall of the stage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arles france sights" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1753844.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most of the artifacts discovered by archaeologists in the theater, today can be seen in the Art <span>Museum of the city</span> and in the Louvre.  The sculpture of Arles Venus, as well as the sculpture of the <span>goddess Diana,</span> which was discovered in 1651, are considered the most valuable finds. </p><h2>  Thermal baths </h2><p>  This complex will definitely recommend you to visit the townspeople if you come to Arles.  France has several similar structures on its territory, but this complex, according to experts, has been preserved best of all.  Thermal baths bearing the name of Emperor Constantine were built in the northern part of the city.  To this day, from the once huge complex of buildings that resembled a magnificent palace, little has been preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cathedral in arles france" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1753894.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Abbey of Montmajour </h2><p>  This impressive building, located 5 km from the city of Arles (France), is located on a rocky hill.  Outwardly, the abbey of Montmajour resembles a fortress.  It was erected in the X century and was considered in Europe (in the Middle Ages) one of the most visited pilgrimage sites.  The remaining monasteries in this region were founded by monks who came from the abbey of Montmajour. </p><p>  In ancient times, the valley surrounding the hill was swampy, but before the construction of the monastery it was drained.  At the beginning of the XVIII century, baroque buildings appeared in the abbey, since buildings built in the XII century fell into decay.  In 1786, Abbot Roan was charged with the ‚Äúnecklace‚Äù and the abbey was closed, most of the church property was confiscated by the city authorities and sold out. </p><h2>  Museums </h2>

    <p>  There are many interesting places in this French city.  Do not think that only ancient Roman buildings can surprise you Arles (France).  What to see in the city, besides these monuments?  We recommend visiting the Arlatan Museum, founded in 1896 by Nobel Prize winner writer Frederick Mistral.  A monument to him was erected on the Forum Square. </p><p>  The museum exhibits a rich collection of documents, paintings, clothes and personal belongings of the inhabitants of Provence.  Here is the evolution of the clothes of the inhabitants of Arles of all social classes, starting from the XVIII century until the First World War. </p><h2>  Reattu Museum </h2><p>  In Arles, you should definitely visit the Reattu Museum, which is located in a picturesque monastery of the XV century, opposite the term Constantine.  Most of the exposition consists of strict artworks of the 18th century. </p><p>  The sculpture ‚ÄúWoman with a violin‚Äù by Picasso, as well as 57 of his drawings, made with colored pencil and ink, are especially popular among museum visitors.  Among clowns and bifurcated faces, you can see a portrait of his mother, amazing in its simplicity and originality.  Behind the Reattu Museum, a series of lanterns stretches along the promenade.  Here, Van Gogh loved to walk. </p><p>  Most of the waterfront with its bistro and bars during the war (1942) was destroyed.  The Nazi Germany became a victim of airstrikes and the ‚ÄúYellow House‚Äù, located on Lamartine Square, in which Van Gogh lived for a long time. </p><h2>  Camargue Park </h2><p>  Nature lovers can enjoy the beauty of the Camargue National Park.  Here you can watch how graceful pink flamingos, wild ducks, horses of a rare Camargue breed behave in natural conditions. </p><p>  This park will enchant you with lush and varied vegetation.  You will enjoy walking along its shady paths and breathing in the crystal clear air. </p>
