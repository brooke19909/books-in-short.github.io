So, the most publicized of them are management (labor organization) and marketing (promotion of goods or services).  You can continue for a long time.  But there are those about which only experts have heard.  And such is ergonomics.  As a science, this is often a clearly underrated discipline.  In the framework of the article, a definition will be given to her, directions and implementation in practice will be considered.  We can say that there are brief basics of ergonomics.  So, let's get down to the topic of the article. </p><h2>  What is ergonomics and what does it study? </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is agronomy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30555/1206123.jpg"></div>  This is the name of the scientific discipline that deals with the features of interaction between people and various elements of systems, that is, it considers the labor process.  There is a profession of ‚Äúergonomics‚Äù.  People who possess it should have knowledge of the theory, laws, data, and design methods that ultimately can ensure human health and optimize the overall functioning of the system.  Ergonomics is quite important in design processes.  It evaluates tasks, work, products, the environment and systems in order to harmonize everything regarding the needs, abilities and physical capabilities of people.  Here we take the landfill.  If we place it within the city (or even in the housing estate), then we will have to:

Therefore, purely in terms of efficiency and lesser problems, it would be better for us to place a garbage dump outside the city limits.  Thus, we also fulfill the requirements of ergonomics.  As a result, the task is completed, and with a high result. </p><h2>  What are the directions of ergonomics? </h2>

Despite this, ergonomics uses and actively develops a holistic approach that includes consideration and consideration of cognitive (mental), physical, organizational, social and many other important factors.  An ergonomist practitioner should have wide erudition in all of the above areas (at least).  Therefore, people of a similar profession are often prepared to work in a particular sector of the economy (or <span>subject area,</span> if we talk about science).  Ergonomists constantly have to evolve in their skills and abilities.  After all, new directions are being created, and the old ones receive development prospects.  Despite a wide variety of factors, the possibilities and requirements of ergonomics have been compiled in three areas:

She works out task poses, monotonous movements, loading / unloading something, layout of a functional place, health and safety of personnel.  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãergonomics should do everything possible to avoid negative consequences for a person due to work or minimize them.  As an example, we can cite musculoskeletal disorders that occur during prolonged work at the computer.  For this, a special assessment of jobs and the comfort of the functions performed by the staff behind them can be carried out.

    <h2>  Mental </h2><p>  This area is closely related to various thought processes.  She pays attention to such human qualities as memory, perception, reasoning and motor reaction.  The processes of interaction between a person and other elements of the system with which he works are also being worked out.  The study of mental workload, how decisions are made, works that require high qualifications.  The reliability of a person, his interaction with various equipment is also being worked out, and a decision is made on the necessary training and willingness to withstand work stress.  A special assessment of <span>jobs is</span> needed to ensure that decision-making is not affected by third-party processes.  So, knocking behind the wall of the press is not suitable for a design and engineering bureau, and care must be taken to ensure that the best conditions are.  That's what ergonomics are in practice.  But that is not all. </p><h2>  Organizational </h2>

She is engaged in the optimization of socio-technical systems.  Organizational ergonomics addresses issues of structure, policy, and processes.  This is achieved by influencing labor resources, project activities, teamwork, communication, remote work, and monitoring quality and making appropriate decisions.

In fact, this is a very time-consuming process, as it deals not only with issues of improving quality, but also accompanies the implementation of best practices.  Just imagine that a new technology has appeared that will improve the economic efficiency of the enterprise through the use of fewer resources.  This is clear to you, but the higher authorities still need to prove it.  Calculate everything with the help of formulas, depict on diagrams where, what, and how to place and watch, so that everything is done as it should.
