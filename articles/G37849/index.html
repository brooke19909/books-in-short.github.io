    <h2>  What is attractive for agritourism in this country? </h2><p>  All year round, more than 10,000 Italian villas, estates and farms lovingly host lovers of this type of tourism.  Guests are attracted here: horseback riding, walks through variegated flower fields, the aroma of which extends for many kilometers, visits to vineyards, and if you are lucky to participate in the harvest and observe the process of making wine, etc. However, the majority of tourists who come for agritourism to Italy, pleased with the opportunity to try various culinary delights from absolutely natural, as they are called today, organic products, and even better - to take part in their preparation.  Such a journey will long remain in their memory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How it all began... </h2><p>  More intensively, this industry in the country began to develop after the Second World War.  The history of agritourism in Italy, as locals say today, began with how one rich foreigner went to the Apennines in order to relax and live on an Italian farm.  After he said that he just wanted to diversify his life. </p><p>  It must be said that then Italy was in decline, and <span>Italian villages</span> were completely devastated.  And then one day an eccentric foreigner appears on one farm, asking him to be sheltered, allowed to participate in agricultural work, and offers the landlord a lot of money.  Of course, no one had heard of such an unusual vacation in Italy (agritourism) in this village, but the farmer, of course, accepted his offer and let him in. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agritourism italy reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1896090.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúWord of mouth‚Äù </h2><p>  After a rich foreigner left the country, he told all his friends how wonderful it is to relax in a picturesque Italian village, how interesting it is to participate in agricultural work, to see with your own eyes, and to take part in the production of various delicacies, including pasta, famous cheeses, sauces, and wine.  In a word, he advertised agritourism in Italy, and shortly afterwards other ‚Äúseekers of rural joys and adventures‚Äù began to come to the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In principle, this wonderful country, rich in historical sights and art values, has always attracted travelers, but agritourism in Italy has become a new direction.  ‚ÄúWord of mouth‚Äù did not disappoint, and every year the number of tourists coming to Italian villages began to grow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agritourism tuscany italy" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1896087.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of agritourism in Italy </h2><p>  Among the farmers of the Italian provinces there were many who clung to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping this type of tourism.  They began to prepare their villas, farms, houses for receiving guests both from abroad and from large Italian cities.  They also began to come up with various entertainments for them.  After all, the most important thing is that visitors do not get bored, and that every day they are filled with new adventures and impressions. </p><p>  So, in the early 70's in the provinces of Italy there were new farms - acrylics, which were ready to receive guests.  Here, tourists could not only enjoy gorgeous rural landscapes and silence, but also learn the secrets of making olive oil, famous <span>Italian cheeses,</span> wine, etc. At the same time, the prices of Italian agritourism were surprisingly cheap.  All this was explained by a characteristic feature of local residents - love and hospitality.  Indeed, many of them would be happy to host guests for free, but business is business.  The cost of agricultural tours to Italy today pleases with the democratic prices, in return tourists receive the highest level of service.  Perhaps because of this, their popularity never decreases, but, on the contrary, increases every year.  Guests can book entire villas as well as rooms in the houses of the farmers themselves.  The cost of tours for 6 days ranges from 270 to 500 (and higher) euros. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Official recognition </h2><p>  Since 1985, agritourism in the country has received support from the Italian government.  Moreover, there is a special decree that clearly spells out instructions for running this business.  And in order to get a license for it, Italian farmers must take a special training course lasting 100 hours.  During these classes, all those "businessmen" who wish to engage in agritourism in Italy receive knowledge of the basics of law, accounting, management, sanitary and hygiene standards, etc. </p><p>  More than two million tourists come to Italy annually precisely for the purpose of relaxation in the countryside.  This is a great achievement for this country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agritourism in italy tuscany reviews" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1896086.jpg" width="600"></div>

Most recipes include olive oil.  Moreover, the Tuscans cook it in a special way and the oil here is the best in the country. </p><p>  The signature dish of local housewives is also a <span>Florentine style steak.</span>  It is made from bovine meat, which is pickled in olive oil with the addition of various spices and herbs.  Well, all the goodies are washed down with young Tuscan wine.  For special occasions, long-aging wine is served.  Probably, it was thanks to these culinary delights that agritourism in Italy and Tuscany reached such popularity.  Reviews that can be found on tourist portals, most of all leave real gourmets who describe in great detail everything that they managed to eat or drink while in this country. </p><h2>  Agritourism in Trentino </h2><p>  Together with the beautiful Tuscany, the championship in the number of agricoles is shared by the resort of Trentino, which is located in South Tyrol.  What is the key to the popularity of this province?  Trentino is also the largest center for skiing and mountaineering in all of Europe.  The infrastructure is superbly developed here.

    <h2>  Local culinary traditions </h2><p>  By the way, Terentino is famous for a special variety of pasta called pizza maker.  It is made from buckwheat flour, and potatoes and Savoy cabbage are served with it.  As a sauce, this dish is served with sauces from cheeses and herbs.  Delicious beef is cooked in South Tirol.  There is one traditional Terentine dish - tagliata, which is first marinated with spices and then grilled.  In Italy, it is also customary to eat jerky beef called bresaola.  When serving, it is cut into very thin, almost transparent slices. </p><h2>  Piedmont - another Italian paradise for agritourists </h2><p>  This region is located in the north of Italy.  Since he glorified this wonderful country with his special culinary delights, fans of both gastro and agritourism like to come here.  After all, many tourists are interested not only in the taste of great dishes that you can taste when you are in Piedmont, but also how they are cooked by local housewives.  And the attractiveness of local agricols is in no way inferior to Tuscan ones. </p><p>  By the way, it is here that the most famous variety of mushrooms grows - white truffles, which are considered a delicacy in all corners of the world.  Many tourists come here just to stay with the legendary "hunters" for these original mushrooms.  Believe me, it is an incredibly interesting sight to watch our smaller brothers, namely pigs, digging out these very mushrooms from the ground, which are then served in the most expensive restaurants in the world at a fabulous price.  There are many farms where mushroom pickers are bred, in the province of Lange, near the city of Alba.  Winemaking in Piedmont also has a leading position.  It is this province that is considered the birthplace of such famous varieties of wines such as Asti Slumante and Prosecco.  Wonderful cheese varieties are also produced here: Castelmagno, Gorgonzola, GranaPadano and others. Tourists who have arrived can combine business with pleasure - heal in the thermal waters of the springs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agritourism prices italy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1896091.jpg" width="375"></div>
