  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lisbon Treaty</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The EU, being the largest political center, currently has 27 states.  However, in 2004, when it had only 25 states, it became uncontrollable and began to lose its democratic character.  Therefore, at that time, the question arose of adopting a constitution for the <span>European Union.</span>  Several years of its development allowed to obtain a very democratic law, which was subsequently to be signed by all participating countries.  But only 18 states signed it.  Therefore, most of the rules of the law had to be either deleted or amended. </p><p>  The new reform document was called the ‚ÄúLisbon Treaty‚Äù, it did not use the word ‚ÄúConstitution‚Äù and was signed on December 13, 2007 in the capital of Portugal by all twenty seven states that are <span>part of the European Union.</span>  Thus, this agreement replaced the old Constitution of the <span>European Union</span> and had the goal of reforming the EU governance system, and also became the basis for the functioning of the EU in the next twenty years. </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>  The Lisbon Agreement has established a balance between the interests and goals <span>of the EU member states</span> , thus giving the latter the status of a ‚Äúgreat power‚Äù. </p><p>  The text of this agreement amended the main three documents of the European Union: the Rome Treaty, the Maastricht Treaty and the <span>Atomic Energy</span> Treaty <span>.</span>  The legal basis of the Union is two updated acts: DES and DFES, both of which have equal legal force. </p><p>  DES includes the main objectives and goals, principles and principles of the EU.  It describes the methods of cooperation of the participating countries, as well as outlines the foreign policy of the Union and its security policy.  DFES considers the direction of the EU policy, its freedom, legality and security, as well as the system of regulation of external relations, finance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>  <strong>The Lisbon Treaty</strong> has a number of protocols that form an integral part of the main treaties.  So, they either clarify the provisions of the treaties, or form the position of certain states on various issues.  In addition, this Treaty systematizes the principle of competence, that is, the European Union does not have the right to go beyond the competence that the participating countries provide it. </p><p>  The Lisbon Treaty also provides for a three-tier system of governance of the European Union, which consists of institutions with authority, other bodies that are created on the basis of decisions of institutions, and so-called institutions. </p><p>  Two structures were added to the institutes: the Council, which is the highest body of political power, and the Central Bank.  The Council has a president who is elected for two and a half years, as well as the EU High Representative for Security Policy and Foreign Affairs.  The number of members of the Council of Deputies shall not exceed seven hundred fifty-one. </p><p>  The Lisbon Treaty provides that the three states form the so-called Presidency of the Council, this post is occupied for 18 months. </p><p>  The participating States have the right to conclude treaties with each other in the event that they do not contradict the agreements signed by the European Union or will not go beyond its competence. </p><p>  Thus, the Lisbon Convention enabled the European Union to determine and implement foreign and security policies, including dealing with the functioning of the domestic market and the customs union, commercial, economic, territorial and <span>social policies.</span>  In addition, the EU has the right to deal with energy, law and order, transport, environmental and health issues and many other issues.  The EU is committed to providing assistance and support to all participating States in education, culture, tourism and medicine. </p>
