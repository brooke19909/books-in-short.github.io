  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Basmanny dead end in Mosc: location and history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow has many streets and alleys, and each of them has its own story.  Some street retained its old name, but many of them were renamed at different times.  And one of these streets is the Basmanny impasse. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The reasons for renaming streets are different: some are renamed for political reasons, while others - for domestic.  In this case, everything happened for a political reason - since the street originates from the old Basmannaya street and rests on the new one of the same name, it is quite logical that the street was called a dead end.  Previously, the Basmanny impasse was called the Ascension impasse, as it belonged to the possessions of the Ascension Monastery. </p><p>  The renaming itself was carried out by the Bolsheviks in 1922, then not only streets, but also cities were renamed throughout the country. </p><p>  Note that the street, in fact, is not a dead end, but runs along the Kalachinsky railway lines and ends on Novaya Basmannaya Street. </p><p>  A dead end is located in the territory of the Basmanny district and is territorially subordinate to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="regionzz.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Basmanny impasse" class="if uuid-2369375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62045/2369375.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the street? </h2><p>  The fastest way to get to the street is to use the metro.  You must take the <span>Sokolnicheskaya</span> metro <span>line</span> and get off at the Krasnye Vorota station.  It is this station that is closest to the other than this street, it remains to walk about 500 meters, and you step on the Basmanny dead end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also get by trolley, you need to take the 24th route and go to the stop <span>"Bauman Garden".</span>  It remains to walk a few hundred meters. </p><p>  You can also get a minibus, along the street there are 325m and 534m routes. </p><p>  If you want to use the bus service, you will need to take routes 40 or 78. You need to get off at the Zemlyanoy Val stop, you will need to walk about ten minutes more. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7672049" data-lng="37.657161299999984" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/9/7/1/1971.png"></div><h2>  What is located on the street? </h2><p>  The Basmanny dead end in Moscow is not only of historical importance; a number of administrative centers are located on its territory.  So, on the street is the Giprotransstroy Institute and several departments of the Ministry of Railways. </p><p>  Also here is the apartment building, well known in Russia. </p><p>  Since the Basmanny impasse is located in the historical part of Moscow, you should not be surprised if you often meet walking tourists here.  The street also attracts ordinary Muscovites, since there are many different shops and cafes on it, which means there is where to have a good time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basmanny Dead End" class="if uuid-2369386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62045/2369386.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know that, despite its name, the Basmanny impasse does not justify its name, but only retained part of its historical name. </p>
