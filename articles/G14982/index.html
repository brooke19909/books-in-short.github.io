A considerable merit in this belongs to designers and architects who are trying to make each residential complex being built in the capital special and exclusive.  LCD "Park of the World", built almost in the center of Moscow, next to one of its main avenues, is surprising in that it does not have the currently popular skyscrapers and skyscrapers.  On the contrary, all of its buildings are low-rise, with each erected on an individual project.  The complex is especially decorated with spectacular lighting, and numerous flower beds and green spaces make this place look like a paradise. </p><p>  In the Moscow region there is another complex with a similar name - LCD "Mira Park".  Serpukhov is the city in which it is being built.  It offers economy class housing.  The complex consists of seven high-rise buildings with a monolithic frame and brick walls, landscaped courtyards with playgrounds and a parking lot, and infrastructure facilities located on the ground floors of the houses.  In this article we offer a detailed description of only the Moscow new building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD World Park" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1692272.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  RC "Park of the World" was built in the CAO of the capital, on Prospekt Mira, approximately in the middle between the metro stations "Riga" and "Alekseevskaya".  To both from the complex - no more than 800 meters.  In addition to the avenue, in the immediate vicinity of the residential complex are 2nd Mytishchinskaya Street and two lanes - Droboliteyny and Kuchin.  The Park of the World residential complex has a single address for all its 26 buildings - Mira Avenue, 102, but each house has an individual number and letter to make it easier to navigate.  For example, building number 102k2 or building number 102s31.  There are no other housing complexes in the vicinity of the Peace Park, only offices, district infrastructure facilities and single residential buildings of various years of construction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport Amenities </h2><p>  Residential complex "Peace Park" was built with the expectation that its residents could easily get anywhere in the capital, including parks, exhibition and entertainment centers, historical monuments and, of course, to work.  Everyone who uses the metro can reach the Alekseevskaya station in 5 minutes with a calm step, and 7 minutes to the Riga station.  On Prospekt Mira literally opposite the LCD there is a bus stop, minibuses and trolley buses that can be used by those who do not suit the metro.  Right after the intersection of Prospect Mira and Murmansky Proezd, there is a railway line.  The nearest passenger platform "Riga" is also relatively close.  Residents of the complex who need to use the train will need to walk about 800 meters to the platform on foot. </p><p>  For motorists, the advantage of Peace Park is its proximity to the central avenue, through which you can get to the center of Moscow or go to the suburbs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lc park world reviews" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1692268.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  From the point of view of environmental cleanliness, the Park of Mir residential complex is not very well located.  Moscow is a beautiful city, but heavily polluted by exhaust gases.  A particularly unfavorable situation is right in the center of the capital.  Prospect Mira, to which from half of the buildings of the complex 30-50 meters, is known not only for its beauty, but also for daily traffic jams created due to the large flow of cars.  On the one hand, the location of the LCD near such a large transport artery is convenient, and on the other hand, it creates excessive noise for residents and negatively affects air purity.  The buildings, which are more than 50 meters from the avenue, stand almost close to Pyatnitsky cemetery.  This is especially true for houses No. 102c 21, 22, 32 and 38. Near the cemetery the Trinity Church was built, a workshop for the production of tombstones was opened. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pleasant features of the location of the LCD are Sokolniki Park, which can be reached on foot, and the Botanical Garden. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Mira Park Serpukhov" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1692261.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  Who builds and how </h2><p>  The project for the construction of the LCD "Park of the World" is implemented by the <span>development company</span> Sminex, which <span>entered the Moscow construction market</span> in 2007.  It mainly deals with the implementation of projects for the construction of shopping centers and business offices.  In the piggy bank of the commissioned facilities of the company are the popular business centers "Chameleon", "Kaleidoscope", business quarters "Atmosphere", Bankside, apartment offices and other similar objects.  A distinctive feature of Sminex is that it puts on the market objects that are almost completely ready, which minimizes the risks of equity holders and investors. </p><p>  The company erects the new Park World complex using the "monolith-brick" technology, in each building it performs panoramic glazing of facades, and makes front doors according to individual designs.  On the territory of the complex, the company is building its own boiler and <span>transformer substation in</span> order to uninterruptedly provide residents with heat and electricity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Park of the world photo" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1692259.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure and Design </h2><p>  The Park of the World LCD looks stylish and exclusive.  The photo shows the building from the side of the courtyard and with <span>a roof terrace.</span>  The developer Sminex reconstructed the old building of the Stalin era, equipping it with modern communication systems.  Now it is one of the residential buildings with access to the avenue.  The remaining 26 buildings are new club-type buildings with a number of storeys from 4 to 7. The territory of the complex is very beautiful.  Alleys were created here among trees and flowering shrubs, fountains were built, benches and arbors were installed, an underground parking and a guest parking lot were built.  On the ground floors of the buildings will be opened cafes, bank branches, clinics, shops, clubs, office centers and agencies.  Four houses were erected in a style called ‚Äúeco-fusion‚Äù.  Their facades and entrance areas are finished with natural materials.  In all buildings, the facades are ventilated, and the entrance areas are made according to individual pilot projects. </p><p>  It is difficult to find a new housing complex in which such a rich infrastructure would immediately exist.  Residents of the Peace Park can enjoy all the benefits of large cities, since kindergartens, schools, gymnasiums, universities, dozens of shops and supermarkets, beauty salons, development centers for kids, sports clubs and much more are located near their complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD World Park address" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1692279.jpg" width="490"></div>
