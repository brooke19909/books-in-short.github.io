    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not all characteristics can be considered satisfactory when it comes to Golden Park Hotel 4 * (Budapest).  Reviews of tourists note such negative moments that accompany a stay in this hotel: </p><ul><li>  the hotel does not justify its high four-star status (the institution pulls no more than a three-ruble note); </li><li>  most of the hotel staff, who are native Hungarians, are very reserved and uncommunicative; </li><li>  the hotel does not provide heating, and oil radiators do not save in cold weather; </li><li>  when you exit the room, the electricity is completely turned off, and therefore you can‚Äôt expect that the room will heat up in your absence; </li><li>  in some rooms the carpet that is present on the floor is dirty and full of holes, it is unpleasant to walk on it barefoot; </li><li>  the door leading to the bathroom is very old, some patches are nailed to it; </li><li>  old TVs with poor image quality; </li><li>  stocks of toilet paper and other hygiene items are not replenished; </li><li>  towels in the bathroom are washed and have an unpleasant gray color; </li><li>  poor quality instant coffee in the lobby bar; </li><li>  there is no sausage on the buffet during breakfast; </li><li>  the hotel almost never has the possibility of early check-in; </li><li>  too small room area; </li><li>  on the table in the room there is a bottle of mineral water, but it is paid (and several times more expensive than in a regular supermarket); </li><li>  breakfasts are constantly repeated, and therefore for several days they are very annoying; </li><li>  the restaurant serves delicious yogurt; </li><li>  the prices in the gift shop of the hotel are much higher than in the city; </li><li>  most of the outlets in the room are non-working; </li><li>  there are some problems with the safe (in some rooms it just does not close); </li><li>  the hotel is located so that the windows of some rooms look at the wall of the neighboring building, which makes the room very dark; </li><li>  the shower room is not fenced with walls (there is only a curtain), but because the water during bathing is sprayed throughout the bathroom, which creates constant dampness; </li><li>  the location is convenient only for those who are interested in transport hubs, and there are practically no attractions within walking distance; </li><li>  the old furniture in the rooms has a lot of scuffs, and also smells strongly of dust; </li><li>  it is very unpleasant to sleep on gray washed bedding; </li><li>  the lobby bar is open only until 22:00, and if you want to sit somewhere in the company of friends, you have to get out of the hotel; </li><li>  weak pressure of water in the shower in the mornings and evenings (only a thin stream pours, and therefore it is almost impossible to swim normally); </li><li>  in the rooms located on the upper floors, hot water appears only in the evening; </li><li>  near the hotel are constantly undergoing repairs that interfere with rest, and also spoil the appearance of the street; </li><li>  the tram terminus is located next to the hotel, and therefore, from the early morning, a characteristic ringing and noise are heard here; </li><li>  maids do not change bed linen for the entire stay of the guest at the hotel. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you are looking for an inexpensive and comfortable accommodation option, pay attention to Golden Park Hotel 4 *.  Hungary is a pretty attractive tourist destination, and staying in a historical building, you can best experience the atmosphere of the area.  The first thing that attracts tourists is affordable prices for accommodation.  Well, of course, do not forget about the advantageous location near many transport hubs.  Hotel Golden Park Hotel 4 * (Budapest), unfortunately, requires redecorating, but as an overnight stay for an active tourist this option is perfect. </p>
