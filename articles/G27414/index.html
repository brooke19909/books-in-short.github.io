Mogilev defense</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Soviet Union, one might say, entered the Second World War, to put it mildly, unsuccessfully.  The advancing German forces literally swept away sluggish, poorly organized resistance in its path.  A crushing blow fell on the BSSR: the history of Belarus began to replenish with tragic pages from the very first days of the war. </p><h2>  Panic organized retreat </h2><p>  Now the idea has spread that the USSR was preparing to attack fascist Germany itself.  In some circles, it causes a certain skepticism: after all, after the declaration of war, the Red Army showed very weak fighting efficiency.  What can I say if a week after the outbreak of hostilities the enemy already took Minsk? </p>

    <h2>  Fighting morale </h2><p>  Comrade Stalin reacted to what had happened in his own manner, declaring at a meeting of the Politburo about the ruined (if censored) Leninist inheritance.  And already on July 22, the commander of the Western Front, Pavlov and six other generals involved in the defense of the capital of Belarus, were arrested and shot for treason.  Major General Kopets preferred not to wait for the inevitable terrible fate and shot himself, learning about the losses suffered by aircraft on the very first day of the war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such measures did not help much.  After an extremely painful defeat, the Red Army was demoralized, unable to provide qualitative resistance.  The Nazis moved almost inland inland, the surrender of Mogilev seemed inevitable. </p><h2>  Readiness for defense </h2><p>  Preparation for the defense of the city was feverish.  On July 5, General Bakunin took command of the 61st Corps, whose tasks included the defense of Mogilev.  On the same day, corps divisions took part in the battles. </p>

    <p>  The weak supply is evidenced by the memories of the direct participants in the events.  So, Colonel Voevodin recalled that arming the militia was a daunting task.  The military depots, apparently, were so crowded that volunteer formations had to go to battlefields and collect trophy (mostly German) weapons. </p><p>  The militia held their borders, while it was possible, by titanic efforts to protect their native land: the defense of Mogilev lasted 23 days and ended in defeat, but the miracles of heroism shown by the defenders of the city were not in vain.  Every minute of desperate resistance played against the Germans: a huge country received a reprieve to mobilize forces. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Feat of arms </h2><p>  The Germans began their attack on Mogilev on July 12, choosing their favorite tactics of “ticks”.  From the north side, the city managed to get around relatively easily: the 53rd Infantry Division, which came under the main blow, was completely defeated, communication with its command was interrupted.  But on the other side of the Nazis an unpleasant surprise awaited: here they were in wait for the heroic 172nd division under the command of <span>Major General Romanov.</span> </p><p>  On the Buinichi field (nearby the village of Buinichi) the battle was taken by the 388th Infantry Regiment, Colonel Kutepov.  The identity of this commander has become legendary.  It was a military man, as they say, from God: a talented, courageous, competent person, not afraid to take responsibility. </p>

Of the 70 <span>German tanks</span> thrown to the breakthrough, Soviet soldiers managed to destroy 39. Participants in the events later recalled that the artillery support was inadequate, the supply, especially with regard to ammunition, was unsatisfactory (and wherefrom, if it had been carried out only from mid-July, and there in 1941, the Luftwaffe reigned supreme).  But even though Molotov cocktails should not be weapons of a regular, well-armed army, the well-equipped fascists had to retreat.

This time the battle lasted 10 hours.  The 172nd division held the Buinichsky field until July 22 (street battles had already begun in Mogilev at that time). </p><h2>  Unsigned German Awards </h2><p>  The resistance of the Soviet troops was an unpleasant surprise for the Germans, who considered it necessary to hide the bitter truth from their dear Fuhrer.  They reported on a local victory won at the beginning of the month, and this caused several curiosities.  When the Buinichsky field shuddered from the explosions of shells, and Mogilev was still controlled by Soviet troops, one German military official, who was about to take a break in the city, which he believed to have been taken long ago, came straight to the local headquarters of the Red Army. </p>

    <h2>  Everlasting memory </h2><p>  It should be noted that the Buinichsky field has repeatedly witnessed how people kill each other with enthusiasm.  As far back as 1595, there was a bloody battle between the forces of peasant rebels led by Severin Nalyvaiko and the troops of the Principality of Lithuania.  The rebels could not win (the forces were too unequal), but managed to escape.  In 1812, the Russians fought here with the Napoleonic army.  During the Second World War, Buinichskoye field was again soaked in blood. </p><p>  On May 9, 1995, at the place where Soviet soldiers fought fiercely, a memorial complex designed by architects Chalenko and Baranovsky opened. </p>

    <h2>  Memorial Complex </h2><p>  It occupies more than 20 hectares and begins with an entrance decorated with an elegant arcade.  From it, one of the four alleys leads to the central part of the composition - the chapel, in which the remains of the deceased defenders of the city are buried.  Their names (those that are known) are carved on marble slabs placed along the walls of the room. </p><p>  The complex has a small artificial pond called <span>Lake Tears.</span>  This is a symbolic tribute to the tears and grief of mothers whose children were taken away by the war.  Not far from the chapel is also a museum of military equipment, some of whose exhibits are unique. </p>

Here a stone with a commemorative inscription is erected, the poet’s ashes after his death are scattered over the Buinichi field. </p><p>  Simonov really witnessed the fierce fighting: he was near Mogilev on July 13-14 and personally knew Colonel Kutepov, whose spiritual and <span>professional qualities</span> he rated very highly.  During the war years, Simonov served as a war correspondent for Izvestia, and the battle on the Buinichsky field was his first combat experience, which cut deep into his heart. </p><p>  The heroism of the city’s defenders made such a deep impression on Konstantin Mikhailovich that he even bothered to confer Mogilev the title of a hero city, repeatedly came and met with participants in the events. </p>

    <h2>  “Yes, we live, not forgetting” </h2><p>  Simonov's note “Hot Day” was published in Izvestia on July 20.  Eight days remained before the fall of Mogilev, which was called the city of D for secrecy, but the courage with which the Soviet troops defended the occupied lines was a good incentive to strengthen the fighting spirit of the Red Army.  Subsequently, Mogilev was even called the father of Stalingrad, and the Buinichsky field forever became a symbol of courage, unbroken will, the desire to protect his native land from the enemy. </p><p>  Militarily, the heroism of the city’s defenders was not in vain either: their efforts served as a deterrent to the invaders, who lost precious time here, which was worth its weight in gold for both sides. </p><p>  The Buynichskoye Pole Memorial Complex is a visited place.  Belarusians, in general, take their history very carefully: they look after the monuments to fallen soldiers, even in remote villages, showing respect for the feat of those who sacrificed themselves for the life of future generations. </p>
