But, despite this, the price for all cannot be the same.  This is due to increasing OSAGO ratios, which depend on various parameters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.parkers.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drivers agreement" class="if uuid-2708944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2708944.jpg"></div><h2>  CTP </h2><p>  The cost of the MTPL insurance policy consists of the base rate and various factors.  These tariffs affect the final price of the policy and can both increase the <span>insurance</span> coefficient of <span>compulsory motor liability insurance</span> and lower it. </p><p>  Car insurance ratios: </p><ol><li>  MSC or bonus malus to the client (can reduce the cost of the policy by up to 50 percent and double the price). </li><li>  Territory (depends on the place of registration of the vehicle, as well as the owner of the car).  For drivers registered in districts and villages, the coefficient will be much lower compared to those registered in the metropolis.  This is due to the fact that a large number of accidents occur in megacities. </li><li>  Age and experience.  The price of the policy increases for drivers under 22 years of age and with little experience.  This is due to the fact that they create much more accidents compared to other drivers. </li><li>  Limit (this factor is affected by the number of drivers included or the list is unlimited). </li><li>  Power.  The larger the vehicle, the more expensive the insurance. </li><li>  Violations (in case of violation of traffic rules and the presence of traffic accidents, the cost of compulsory motor liability insurance will increase). </li></ol><p>  The base rate (set by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and is the same for all insurance companies) is multiplied by all existing coefficients, and the final premium for the CTP insurance policy is obtained. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  KBM </h2><div class="photo" data-original="federalautoloan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car insurance" class="if uuid-2708946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2708946.jpg"></div><p>  In order to improve road safety, the legislation allowed insurance companies to use a special KBM tariff, which can adjust the insurance premium.  MSC may reward drivers with an added bonus or downgrade due to an accident.  The meaning of its use is to increase the motivation of drivers to drive without traffic accidents.  And insurance companies with the help of KBM protect themselves from losses when concluding an agreement with newcomers or with drivers who ignore the rules of the road. </p><p>  MSC consists of two parts: bonus and malus.  A bonus is a coefficient that reduces the insurance premium.  And it is provided to the driver only if there is no traffic accident.  An exception is an accident in which he becomes an injured party. </p><p>  Malus is a compulsory motor liability insurance coefficient that is used depending on the presence of an accident.  The more accidents (in which the driver was the culprit), the greater the coefficient. </p><p>  MSC affects the final insurance premium under the contract.  Data on the increasing OSAGO coefficient after an accident are in a single SAR system.  Each driver has its own coefficient, and if the owner of the vehicle wants to change the company in order to reduce the premium, then he will be mistaken.  Since the coefficient is in the common SAR system, it will be the same for all insurance companies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The increased coefficient of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance after an accident can be applied only to those responsible for the accident.  For example, if the owner of a car got into a traffic accident due to the fault of another person, then the KBM will remain unchanged.  But if the driver of the vehicle was the culprit in an accident, then the accident rate will decrease, and, accordingly, the KBM will increase.  For example, the culprit had a maximum class of 13, due to one traffic accident there will be a decrease of 7. The lost discount will be approximately 30 percent.  In order to return to the previous class, it is necessary to carry out driving without any accidents for about six years. </p><h2>  CBM Lowering Conditions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.eccos.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The increasing coefficient after an accident" class="if uuid-2708941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2708941.jpg"></div><p>  In 2015, there was a jump in the price of OSAGO.  This was due to a decision to increase the insurance amount under the contract.  At the moment, the maximum insurance amount under the contract is 400,000 rubles.  Due to its increase, there was an increase in the premium on the contract.  In order for vehicle owners to be able to purchase OSAGO insurance policies at a lower price, it is necessary to operate the car without accidents.  Under this condition, the class of drivers will increase by one per year, and an additional discount of five percent will appear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The maximum discount is 50% of the total cost of insurance, respectively, the largest class will be 13. In order to get the maximum discount, you need to ride without an accident for ten years. </p><h2>  Increased MSC </h2><p>  In case of an accident, an increase in the CMTPL coefficient and a drop in class occur.  How much the class goes down depends on the position the driver was originally in.  If he had 13th grade, then due to one accident, a decrease of 7 will occur. For drivers with the third grade, they will be reduced by two points.  That is, the higher the driver class was originally, the more it loses in levels. </p><p>  For example, if the driver applied to the insurance company for payment within one calendar year, then the tariff will increase depending on the length of service: </p><ul><li>  from the third to the fourth - 1.55; </li><li>  from the fifth to the seventh - 1.44; </li><li>  from the eighth to the thirteenth - 1; </li><li>  the driver, who during the year had an accident more than three times, receives the maximum increase in compulsory motor liability insurance - 2.45, which will increase the cost of insurance by 250%. </li></ul><p>  To return to the previous accident class, you need to drive without accidents for several years and gradually increase it. </p><h2>  MSC for the victim </h2><p>  What is the increasing coefficient of compulsory motor liability insurance after an accident if the driver is injured?  The indicator should not increase if the driver is the injured party.  But sometimes you have to prove your innocence.  When providing information to the PCA by insurers, an error may occur, and the increased coefficient is tied to an innocent person.  To do this, you must contact the RSA with the conclusion of law enforcement agencies.  Insurance companies cannot reduce tariffs on their own, as they use SAR information. </p><h2>  The timing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalfashionist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Experienced driver" class="if uuid-2708945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2708945.jpg"></div><p>  The standard term of the policy is one year (if necessary, the policyholder can buy a contract for up to twenty days and from three months).  Reducing or increasing the coefficient of compulsory motor liability insurance applies only to contracts that are valid for one year. </p><p>  For example, the owner of a vehicle with a fourth accident rate and a five percent discount has issued a six-year policy.  After this period of time, he did not renew it, but issued a new one, counting on a new discount of five percent.  In the process of applying for a new policy, he found out that the accident rate remained the same, and the size of the discounts did not increase.  The ratio has remained the same since the contract did not have a standard term. </p><p>  Also, if the driver terminates the policy for certain reasons (for example, the sale or disposal of a vehicle), the coefficient will not change and will remain the same. </p><h2>  Extended Ratio </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.svmseguros.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auto insurance" class="if uuid-2708942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2708942.jpg"></div><p>  How long does the MTPL coefficient increase after an accident?  In the standard situation, MSC is valid for the policy year.  But after a traffic accident, there is a sharp decrease in class and an increase in the coefficient.  Moreover, the duration of the coefficient after the accident is tripled. </p><p>  If the driver had an accident class of 3 before a traffic accident, then after that he dropped to one.  Accordingly, the tariff for the unit is 1.45.  The driver will have to pay almost twice as much for insurance. </p><p>  How much does the increased OSAGO ratio after an accident in this case work?  This tariff will be valid for three years.  That is, the driver will have to overpay for insurance during this period of time.  After four years, he will be able to receive the first discount of 5%. </p><h2>  Is it possible to change the increasing coefficient of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance after an accident </h2><p>  If there was a traffic accident, one of the drivers of which was the culprit, will he be able to further reduce the MSC?  This tariff cannot be immediately changed and reduced.  How long does the MTPL coefficient increase?  The increased coefficient is subject to change only after three years.  The main task of the culprit is careful driving during this period of time.  Often beginners get into accidents several times a year.  Accordingly, the KBM will be increased several times.  Therefore, it is important not to get into an accident for three years. </p><p>  Some drivers, unknowingly after an accident, are not included in the list of the CTP insurance agreement.  For example, the owner of a vehicle included his son in the list of drivers.  An accident occurred, the culprit of which was the son of the owner of the car.  The next three years, the owner of the car acquires insurance without limitation of persons.  After this period, he decides to include his son, since, in his opinion, the effect of the increasing compulsory motor third-party liability insurance for road accidents should disappear.  But the increased tariff remained with the culprit unchanged.  This happened due to the fact that no driving information was received, therefore, no changes occurred. </p><p>  An important condition for lowering the coefficient after three years is the inclusion of the culprit in the list of drivers.  And only after that there will be a change in the value of the MSC. </p><h2>  The cost of the insurance policy and a list of drivers </h2><p>  The final price of the MTPL policy depends on the drivers included in the management of a particular vehicle. </p><p>  For example, the owner drove a car for a long time on his own and last paid 4000 rubles.  For life reasons, he decided to include his spouse in the list (her experience is 2 years).  The total premium of the agreement became equal to 6800 rubles.  The increase in the cost of insurance occurred due to the inclusion of the spouse in the list of drivers.  When calculating the cost of the policy, the program uses the highest driver coefficient.  In this case, the accident class of the owner of the vehicle has not changed, but it will not be considered during the calculation of the policy. </p><h2>  Pic </h2><p>  When calculating the price of the MTPL insurance policy, the coefficient of age and length of service is also used.  This tariff, like KBM, is of high importance for the cost of insurance.  If the driver has more than three years of experience, and the age is from 22 years, then this coefficient will be equal to one. </p><p>  <span>Increasing</span> OSAGO <span>coefficient</span> by age will be applied if the driver is less than 22 years old.  In this case, a tariff equal to 1.8 or 1.6 will be applied - depending on the length of experience of the motorist. </p><p>  The senior <span>MTPL coefficient</span> will be if the driver has less than three years of driving experience.  And, depending on age, it will be equal to 1.7 or 1.8.  The FAC tariff is important for the calculation, since it can almost double or increase the cost of insurance. </p><p>  The table for calculating the coefficient depending on age and length of service is given below. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Drivers age </p></td><td><p>  Driving experience </p></td><td><p>  Final rate </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Less than 22 years old </p></td><td><p>  Up to 3 years </p></td><td><p>  18 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Less than 22 years old </p></td><td><p>  More than 3 years </p></td><td><p>  16 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  More than 22 years </p></td><td><p>  Up to 3 years </p></td><td><p>  1, 7 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  More than 22 years </p></td><td><p>  More than 3 years </p></td><td><p>  1 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Specialists approved the threshold for driving experience, which is equal to three years.  It is believed that three years of continuous driving will lead to more professional driving. </p><p>  The table shows that persons under the age of 22 years, or without relevant driving experience, will have to purchase a compulsory motor liability insurance policy at a higher price. </p><h2>  PCA </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lamkinelderlaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The coefficient of age and length of service" class="if uuid-2708947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2708947.jpg"></div><p>  The PCA system stores all information about the drivers who insured the car or were included in the list under the CTP insurance agreement.  Many drivers claim that their accident rate should be higher, as the driving experience is large.  Drivers believe that insurance companies deliberately raise the cost of the policy.  In order to deal with the accident class, you can contact the PCA system.  To do this, go to the official website of the Union of Insurers and leave a request for consideration of the class.  To do this, enter in the fields all the necessary data about yourself. </p><p>  A response from the PCA will come to the driver‚Äôs email.  If there really was a loss of discounts, then you need to print a letter and go to your insurance company.  Employees will be able to upgrade their class and return excessively paid money. </p><p>  In order for the accident class not to decrease, it is necessary to check all the data entered before signing the insurance agreement.  Loss of discounts may occur due to an error in the driver‚Äôs personal data.  Also, when changing a driver‚Äôs license, you need to go to the insurer's office and make changes to the policy.  So, discounts on old rights will be transferred to new ones, and there will be no losses.  If you come with new rights after the expiration of the policy, then all the accumulated discounts will be lost, the accident class will be three. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.autoinsurancequotesave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Boost factor" class="if uuid-2708943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2708943.jpg"></div><p>  In order to reduce the cost of the insurance policy, you can not include in the list of drivers those persons whose fault caused the accident.  For example, if the spouse has a raising coefficient, then the husband may exclude her from the list.  But in this case, she will not be able to drive a car.  You also need to remember that the more the driver drives without an accident, the lower the fare. </p><p>  If the driver became the culprit of a traffic accident, but he needs to drive a vehicle, then the owner of the car can purchase insurance without limiting the list.  In this case, any drivers who have the right can drive a car.  But it is worth noting that the cost of insurance will increase by 80%. </p><p>  All reliable insurance companies use the PCA database.  Therefore, it makes no sense to contact other insurance companies to reduce the tariff.  If the company claims that it can provide a policy at lower prices, then it is worth checking the license of this insurer and its settlement of losses. </p><p>  You can avoid the increase factor with careful and careful driving.  After all, a traffic accident is not only an increased coefficient in insurance contracts, but first of all it is people's lives and health.  According to statistics, the Russian Federation is in first place in the number of traffic accidents resulting in the death of participants.  No need to look for workarounds in order to reduce CTP insurance.  Better to give preference to road safety. </p>
