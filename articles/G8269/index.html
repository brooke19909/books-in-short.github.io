    <p>  Hydropark (Kiev) is located on two Dnieper islands - the Venetian and Dolobetsk, which are connected by a bridge.  This entertaining place covers an area of ​​365 hectares.  Directly above the park is the red branch of the <span>Kiev metro.</span> </p><p>  In 1965, work began on two islands of the Dnieper on the planning and improvement of the future recreation area.  The authors of the project were architects I.P. Shpara and V.L. Suvorov.  Three years later, the Hydropark in Kiev was ready for operation.  At the same time, it can accommodate at least 75 thousand people. </p><h2>  Hydropark, Kiev: entertainment and beaches </h2><p>  There are several beaches in Kiev Hydropark: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  "Youth"; </li><li>  "Venice"; </li><li>  "Bridge Bridge"; </li><li>  "Gold"; </li><li>  as well as nudist. </li></ul><p>  What conditions can Hydropark (Kiev) offer passive recreation lovers?  Youth Beach is located near the Venetian Bridge.  It is free and there are several cafes and restaurants nearby.  Venice Beach is also free, but it is more comfortable: you can rent a sun lounger or an umbrella here.  There is also a disco on site.  But on the "Golden" beach, as a rule, families with small children relax. </p>

    <p>  <span>Entertainment in Kiev</span> Hydropark is also abound.  The most favorite type of leisure for both children and adults is karting.  The track, which is equipped here, is designed for beginners.  Its total length is 350 meters.  There is also its own sports ground, in particular, an open-air gym, which is deservedly called the most severe and brutal in all of Ukraine! </p><p>  There are places to roam the islands and nightlife lovers.  There are at least a dozen clubs operating in the Hydropark, the most popular of which is the UAM Beach Club. </p><h2>  Gidropark, Kiev: attractions </h2><p>  In May 2015, a new amusement park opened here.  The price of tickets ranges from 20 to 50 hryvnia, depending on the type of entertainment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It has its own "room of fear", "wild train", as well as carousels for adults and children.  Young people are very fond of the attraction called "Extreme", whose height is about 17 meters.  Adults who come to Hydropark with young children can leave their children in the playpen.  Also in the park there is a huge trampoline with a diameter of 18 meters.  The pleasure of jumping on it will cost you 25 hryvnia. </p><h2>  <span>Museum "Kiev</span> in miniature" </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Gidropark (Kiev) is not only swimming on the beach, night clubs and other entertainments.  There are other attractions here.  In particular, we are talking about an open-air museum - "Kiev in miniature." </p>

    <p>  The idea to create such a museum arose among activists in the capital in 2000.  However, the project and the search for sponsors took as long as six years.  As a result, on June 23, 2006, the Kiev Miniature Museum in Hydropark received its first visitors. </p><p>  Here is a real mini-Kiev.  All models of architectural buildings are made on a scale of 1:33.  In the park you can see the most outstanding metropolitan sights: Independence Square, St. Nicholas Church, Boryspil Airport and others.  There is also its own Dnieper, through which the layouts of the most famous Kiev bridges are thrown. </p><p>  In the future, the organizers of the museum plan to create miniatures in Hydropark of other cities of Ukraine - Odessa and Lviv. </p><h2>  Venetian bridge </h2><p>  In 1966, the two islands of the Hydropark were connected by an arch bridge 144 meters long.  It got its name from the island of the same name, which locals have always compared with distant Venice.  The fact is that the local area is very often flooded by the waters of the Dnieper.  Therefore, the inhabitants of the Pre-Bridge Sloboda (a settlement that is no longer on the map of Kiev) built houses on stilts here.  In addition, each had a roomy gondola boat, on which they cut through the streets in case of floods. </p>

    <p>  The Venetian bridge is not as beautiful as its name.  However, it offers a wonderful view of the right-bank Kiev. </p><h2>  Hydropark metro station </h2><p>  In 1965, the <span>Kiev metro station</span> Hydropark was commissioned.  This is a ground type station that has two exits to the city.  Simple architecture and a single color scheme perfectly fit it into the park landscape of the islands. </p><p>  Initially, the Hydropark station had only one (western) exit.  But due to the very high passenger flow in the summer, the second (eastern) exit to the park was equipped here.  At the height of the hot season, as well as on weekends, up to 250 thousand people a day pass through the turnstiles of this station. </p>
