    <p>  The interior is decorated in bright colors.  Each room has a comfortable bed, a work area, Wi-Fi, a hairdryer, toiletries, a minibar and coffee and tea making facilities. </p><p>  As you know, in the rhythm of the metropolis there is practically no place to relax.  The hotel has a 24-hour business center, a mini market and a modern fitness center.  Hilton is focused on business people - for events of any scale there is a suitable hall.  The largest ballroom is designed for 400 guests, business meetings can be held in conference rooms or meeting rooms, and to celebrate the conclusion of the next contract go to the Garden Grill &amp; Bar restaurant. </p><h2>  On a note </h2><p>  No matter how modern and “advanced” the capital may seem, it should be remembered that Astana is primarily an eastern city with its own traditions.  For example, during religious holidays, guests should stop drinking alcohol. </p><p>  For outings and sightseeing, choose your outfit carefully.  Sporty style and bright, defiant clothing are a sign of bad taste. </p><p>  Urban residents are not punctual, because of this the start of business meetings and even large events is often delayed. </p><p>  Smoking is allowed in Astana, and there are special places in shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.  When checking into a hotel, if necessary, it is worth separately voicing a wish for a non-smoking room. </p><p>  Local drivers often do not follow the rules of the road, so even when moving in the right place, be careful. </p>
