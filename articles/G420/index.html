    <h2>  Item Definition </h2><p>  For transparency of the microloan market in the financial openings of Russia, it is allowed to create two types of mini-credit structures. </p><p>  A microfinance organization is a company with equity of $ 70 million or more.  The laws of the Regulator allow them: </p><ul><li>  to attract free cash funds of legal entities and citizens; </li><li>  invest <span>borrowed funds</span> ; </li><li>  lend to borrowers up to one million Russian rubles; </li><li>  issue bonds - bonds. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, microcredit organizations with a capital of less than 70 million rubles function in the legal field.  MCOs are allowed to work only on the basis of their own funds.  For them, a ban has been imposed on attracting and investing funds of the population.  The maximum amount of micro-loans from MCOs is 0.5 million rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why and who needs a serial number </h2><p>  Consumer confidence is enjoyed by stable working structures that fulfill financial obligations on time and in full.  In a tightly packed space of micro-loans you can‚Äôt figure it out without a clue who is reliable and who should be avoided and forgotten. </p><p>  The problem is solved by the classification of organizations according to agreed rules.  The line in the listing of a significant agency is already a signal to the borrower and investor about the transparency of internal procedures in the company. </p><p>  An MFI rating helps expand the client base and build trust in investor relations. </p><p>  Reliable lenders give loans to everyone. </p>

    <h2>  Parameters for calculation </h2><p>  When determining the level of reliability rating of MFIs, the following parameters are used: </p><p>  1. <em>The amount of the loan receivable.</em>  Pay attention to how many credit companies bear the name with the words ‚Äúborrow until payday‚Äù or ‚Äúloan week‚Äù.  There are no big loans here, the maximum trust in the consumer of services is 30-50 thousand rubles.  Only companies with a sound financial base are able to provide large-scale services. </p><p>  2. <em>The interest rate of the loan.</em>  Evaluate your loan servicing capabilities.  If it is impossible to return within the time period specified by the contract, at a rate of 1% per day, a minimum of 30% will be charged for a month, and with a loan of 5000 rubles.  the consumer will be forced to give 6.5 thousand <span>Russian money</span> in a month <span>.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  3. <em>For how long is a micro-loan issued.</em>  Day, week, crescent - the conditions for all organizations are different. </p><p>  4. <em>A variety of ways to obtain microcredit money.</em>  Some organizations work only with bank cards, so as not to complicate the life of cash problems.  Others offer a choice - cash or card.  The list of third ones contains cards, bank accounts, and electronic wallets. </p><p>  Look closely at the cost of each parameter.  Additional costs add to the credit burden. </p>

    <h2>  Money for the urgent needs of residents of the capital </h2><p>  Before you buy a product or get a service, a potential buyer studies the reviews.  In the financial sector, consumer feedback is equally important.  The rating of MFIs is a formalized parameter that does not take into account the nuances of the professional qualities of staff and management.  The serial number on the authority list sometimes does not meet expectations. </p><p>  Researchers of the microloan market revealed a pattern - the wider and deeper the requirements of the company to the counterparty, the more correct the cost of the loan.  And vice versa, the construction of the procedure on the principle of ‚Äúone identification card - and after five minutes of cash in the hands of the client‚Äù results in fabulous interest payments for the received service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A listing of indicators of reliable credit firms in each region contains information about different market participants.  The rating of <span>Moscow MFIs</span> differs, for example, from a similar registry in Chelyabinsk.  In the capital, microcredit offices grow like mushrooms after rain: some grow, others are sent for processing. </p><p>  Before applying for a mini-loan, residents of any city should evaluate not only the public indicator of the organization‚Äôs success, but also the experience of functioning in the field of financing and popularity among people.  And then make your own informed decision. </p>

    <h2>  Leader in Russia </h2><p>  Microfinance business is built on the fact that citizens of a huge country regularly borrow money.  In place of the disappeared credit company, another team is immediately registered.  The rating of MFIs of Russia already contains not 10, but 208 items. </p><p>  The Central Bank of the Russian Federation cleans not only banking institutions, but also microfinance organizations.  Therefore, leaders change, and the list itself as a whole undergoes changes from time to time. </p><p>  Now the first in the list is Ezaem (Ezayem) with interest conditions: </p><ul><li>  0.00 for the first loan up to 4 thousand rubles; </li><li>  2.18 per day for other loans. </li></ul><p>  Why this company became the Russian leader is not clear, since negative reviews about the quality of its work flooded the Internet.  It is not even a matter of predatory interest; the investor has been warned about them in advance.  Clients signal about the strange actions of the company: debiting money from the card without notifying the counterparty, charging debts for non-existent violations;  failure to meet loan repayment terms;  false calls about events that did not occur. </p><p>  There are also positive reviews about the organization, for example, how quickly the money went to an electronic wallet, or how nice it is to get 4 thousand in debt without interest. </p>

    <h2>  Investment Rules </h2><p>  Interest rates of deposits vary in banks depending on the size of the current rate of the Central Bank.  Current figures are becoming less attractive.  In these conditions, offers to place free money at an annual rate of 20, 25 and even 30 percent look attractive. </p><p>  Both for lending services and for investment operations, MFI deposit ratings are calculated and published.  Based on this indicator, we must remember that not all small companies are able to bear the cost of calculating comparisons with competitors. </p><p>  Therefore, before transferring your own money to outsiders, you should check: </p><ul><li>  feedback on the quality of work; </li><li>  OGRN number in the State Register on the site tax.ru; </li><li>  registration number in the self-regulatory organization of microfinancing "Unity" or "World". </li></ul><p>  The population can give money in growth to microfinance offices.  But here there are restrictions on the volume of investments.  The law allows individuals to invest in MFIs in an amount of at least 1.5 million rubles. </p><p>  <em>Example: at a rate of 20% of investments in one and a half million Russian rubles, a profit of 300 thousand rubles is generated.</em>  <em>Upon receipt of investment income, the client must pay income tax in the amount of 13%.</em>  <em>Clean hands investor will receive 261 thousand rubles.</em> </p><p>  An honest MFI notifies the depositor that it assumes the duties of a tax agent, withholds the necessary funds, transfers it to the treasury, and, upon request, issues a personal income tax certificate. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go to investor </h2><p>  MFI ratings on deposit reliability should be considered in conjunction with other parameters.  For example, in transparent systems, information about withholding income tax and its amount is posted on the company's website and in flyers.  Lack of information about personal income tax should alert a potential contributor. </p><p>  To reduce deductions and lower the entry threshold, there is a way: register as an individual entrepreneur.  This is a citizen with special tax status - and not an individual or a legal entity.  The tax deduction on investment income will be already 6%, and the deposit may be less than 1.5 million rubles. </p><p>  The rating of MFIs on <span>deposits in Moscow is</span> regularly reviewed.  But the leader is Home Money.  Three hundred people invested in its activities about three billion rubles. </p><p>  Invested wealthy and wealthy men aged 40 years and older, with higher technical, economic and legal education.  There are 83 percent of such investors, according to the organization.  The gender proportion of business is maintained, there are also no more than 20% women. </p><p>  The client must carefully weigh the risks of investing.  Bank deposits have an undeniable advantage - the funds are protected in the Deposit Insurance Agency DIA.  Whereas in the event of bankruptcy of an MFI, an investor will most likely not be reimbursed a single ruble. </p><p>  Some firms indicate that deposits are insured by IC Derzhava or IC Alliance.  Check the approval on the sites of <span>insurance companies.</span>  Investing is subject to the principle of "seven times check." </p>
