    <h2>  A few words about yarn </h2><p>  When choosing material for knitting children's sweaters, you should understand what is the purpose of these products.  If you need them at once, for example, for some holiday or photo shoot, acrylic or other artificial yarn is quite suitable. </p><p>  It is much cheaper than wool, but does not have the characteristics that are necessary for warm winter clothes.  At the same time, a knitted sweater for a boy, designed for walking in the fresh air, should be uniquely warm, ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù, light and, of course, beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sweaters for boys knitting" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1372766.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Traditionally, for children choose yarn from alpaca or merino wool.  These materials are of high quality and considerable price.  However, the baby will need very little yarn (literally 300 grams). </p><p>  Sheep wool mixed with acrylic or cotton can also be used. </p><h2>  How to work with instructions? </h2><p>  Often sources suggesting <span>knitting a sweater</span> for a boy with needles provide specific data on the density of the fabric, as well as the number of loops and rows.  This is relevant only for those craftswomen who plan to use exactly the yarn that was used by the author of the model. </p><p>  In the case when the thickness, composition or torsion of the thread is different, all parameters will be different. </p><p>  It is most convenient to perceive the description as recommendations and focus on the drawing with dimensions.  Below is such a picture, with its help knitting a sweater for boys with knitting needles will become a fairly simple task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="drawing for cutting patterns" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1372769.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sample making </h2><p>  To understand how many loops to collect at the beginning of the work, you need to knit a small fragment of the yarn that was chosen by the craftswoman, and using a specific pattern.  Then the sample is washed, dried (so that it takes its real size) and measured.  The data obtained will be used to calculate the product.  For example, according to the sample it turned out that 10 loops account for 22 loops (in width) and 18 rows (in height).  So, to start knitting the front part, you need to dial 40x22 / 10 = 88 loops.  This figure is just an example, because each craftswoman will have her own density indicator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting details </h2><p>  Given the number obtained, you need to dial on the knitting needles of the required number of loops and knit five centimeters with an elastic band.  Here you can apply absolutely any pattern: 1x1, 2x2 or even French gum. </p><p>  Then you need to calculate how many loops the pattern will take, with the help of which the sweater for the boy will be decorated (with knitting needles).  The diagram below is designed for 58 loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for a man's sweater" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1372770.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  Here, an empty cell denotes the front loop, a square with a black dot is the wrong one.  The icons illustrating the crossing give a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow many stitches and in which direction to move. </p><p>  If we take as a base the previously used example (88 pet.), The sequence of knitting the first row after the elastic will look like this: </p><p>  1 <span>edge loop,</span> 14 front, 58 in the pattern, 15 front. </p><p>  Instead of facial loops, you can apply almost any simple pattern.  The main thing is not to be too smart and not to get confused in the drawings and diagrams, otherwise a simple job will turn into an endless correction of errors. </p><h2>  Neck </h2><p>  A sweater for a boy with knitting needles knit exactly without additions or cuts.  To form the neck, they calculate how many loops should remain, add three to five to form a round neckline and multiply this figure by two. </p><p>  For example: 12 cm x 22/10 = 26. This is the number of loops that will remain in the last row of each shoulder.  We add five more to them (they will be cut in the first five rows after closing the neck loops and will allow to form a bevel of the canvas): </p><p>  26 + 5 = 31 </p><p>  Total, left on the neck (88-31) x2 = 26.  Rollout formation algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Knit 31 stitches in a pattern. </li><li>  The next 26 loops can be freely closed or transferred to the auxiliary knitting needle (or thick thread).  When the details of the front and back are sewn together, these loops will become the basis for the collar. </li><li>  Knit 31 stitches in a pattern. </li><li>  Turn the work and perform 29 loops according to the pattern of ornament. </li><li>  The last two stitches to knit one.  In subsequent rows so cut 4 loops, leaving 26. </li><li>  Knit the fabric to the desired height, then close all the loops (or retake to the auxiliary knitting needle if the shoulders will be sewn with a <span>knitted seam).</span> </li><li>  Similarly perform the second shoulder.  Here, contractions are made in mirror image (at the beginning of the row).  Sometimes the fastener is transferred to the shoulder, as in the photo at the beginning of the article.  But, as a rule, this is inconvenient.  It‚Äôs easier to make regular sweaters. </li></ol><p>  A sweater for a boy (2 years) with knitting needles can be knitted according to a simplified pattern, so the neck can not be made on the details of the back.  After the elastic, the fabric is knitted with the <span>front stitch</span> or with the selected pattern and closed when it reaches the desired length. </p><h2>  Sleeves </h2><p>  Depending on the desire of the craftswoman, the details of the sleeves can be decorated with a pattern or be knitted with a simple stitch. </p><p>  Sleeves with a single decorative element in the center, such as a large braid or weave of braids, look good and relatively simple.  At the edges of the canvas, it is better to place the simplest pattern, because it will have to be expanded. </p><p>  Hinges are added evenly after the cuffs are finished.  For example, the calculations showed that you need to add 17 cm. This will be (17/2) x (22/10) = 19 loops on each side.  Since the sleeve height is also 19 cm, through each centimeter the canvas should expand by two loops (at the beginning and at the end of the row). </p><h2>  Product assembly </h2><p>  When all the details are ready, a sweater for a boy with knitting needles can be sewn.  First, the front and back parts are connected, then the sleeves are sewn in, loops for the neck are gathered (they are knitted to a height of 2 cm to 15 cm) and all the loops are freely closed. </p><p>  The described algorithm is perfect if you need to make a sweater for an adult man.  In this case, the proportions and sizes of the pattern will be different, but the sequence of work will remain the same. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sweater for boy" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1372767.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <p>  The pattern can be located in the center of the front part, then at the edges there will be wide sections connected by the front surface.
