Then you will find useful information on how and what to get there.  There are a lot of questions about the future trip.  How many km are from Moscow to Minsk?  What is convenient to get around?  What documents are needed?  Now let's look for the answers together. </p><h2>  Transport options </h2><p>  The following travel options are available to the traveler: </p><ul><li>  airplane; </li><li>  a train; </li><li>  car. </li></ul><p>  By far, the fastest way is to fly a plane.  The flight will take a minimum of time: less than 1.5 hours on the road - and you will see the <span>capital of Belarus.</span>  The main disadvantage is the high cost of air transport. </p><p>  Travel by train will become less costly, but the trip is not the most convenient.  About 11 trains leave for Moscow daily from Moscow.  Travel time is from 9 to 11 hours. </p><p>  A fascinating option, especially for an avid motorist, will be traveling to another country by car.  If you know how many kilometers are from Moscow to Minsk, then you can find out what time you will arrive in the capital of Belarus.  In a word, nothing complicated. </p>
