  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How did I buy a health insurance policy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most valuable thing that each of us has is health.  Even working in a large company and getting a pretty good salary, I could not afford high-quality treatment in necessary cases.  Most often I had to apply for a fee.  Each time, it significantly affected monthly expenses.  Two months ago, I heard from a work colleague that you can visit highly qualified doctors without paying anything extra.  Of course, at first I did not believe it, but then I found out that such an option really exists.  It is called ‚ÄúVoluntary Health Insurance‚Äù (VHI). </p><p>  <strong>Great opportunities</strong> </p><p>  It turned out that in our country there are many insurance companies where you can buy a medical insurance policy.  Such a document entitles its holder to high-quality medical care.  At first I was a little confused, because I was not particularly well versed in all these nuances.  However, having looked at the necessary information on the Internet, he soon realized how things were going on in this matter.  It turns out that <noindex>  <span>medical policy</span> </noindex>  is an independent document.  It does not apply directly to compulsory health insurance (MHI).  Nevertheless, such a policy provides an opportunity for the insured person to receive compensation for their costs of treatment and consultations with specialists. </p><p>  In fact, VHI allows you to insure not health, as, for example, "in case of an accident", but the costs of a person for various medical care.  Having understood this issue, I was surprised to learn that <noindex>  <span>health insurance</span> </noindex>  This type has very great advantages over compulsory medical insurance.  In particular, you can choose the medical institution that is most suitable for the treatment of the disease.  In this case, the insurance company monitors the quality of such a medical service.  You can also choose a comprehensive version of VHI.  It includes both the help of doctors in the clinic, and a number of dental services. </p><p>  I liked another feature of this type of insurance.  The current difficult situation in our economy provokes a constant rise in prices.  The cost of medical services is also often more expensive.  However, having acquired a VHI insurance policy, you don‚Äôt have to worry about inflation.  The cost of this document will not change throughout the whole year.  At the same time, the quality of medical care will remain as high.  All this helped me make the only right decision: be sure to purchase such a medical insurance policy, and as soon as possible! </p><p>  <strong>Advantageous option</strong> </p><p>  On the Internet, I found all the necessary information about the largest and most reliable insurance companies.  Asked off at work, I went to one of them.  However, upon arrival at the office of this company was disappointed.  It turned out that I was not the only one who chose such a profitable option.  There were a lot of people in the corridors of the company.  The reception was slow, since the employees of the insurance company worked very carefully, and the clients were not always well-versed in what they would like to choose.  As a result, I spent an hour and a half waiting, but could not get to the specialists.  It was necessary to return to work, and therefore I had to leave. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the right option was found the very next day.  In fact, everything can be done via the Internet!  It turned out to be very simple.  It was enough to go to the website of the desired insurance company and apply for the policy online.  The modern possibilities of the Internet are huge, so now each of us can purchase an electronic policy.  Such insurance online is no different from the one that many draw up in the offices of insurance companies.  However, it is much more convenient to do this via the Internet: a lot of time is saved and there is no need to go anywhere, while wasting energy on waiting in traffic jams or crushing on public transport. </p><p>  Try it yourself and you can easily see it! </p><p>  Your Peter. </p></div></article>
