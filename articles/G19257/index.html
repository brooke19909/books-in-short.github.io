At the beginning of the two thousandths, the bank became widely known in many cities of Russia.  Reviews about his work were not always positive.  However, this is due to the fact that Russian Standard was one of the first to focus on mass consumer lending, which in a short time expanded its client base to six-digit values. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian standard deposits" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60138/2163406.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About the bank </h2><p>  Today the bank continues to develop and expand its capabilities.  Currently, 9 full-service branches and more than 270 representative offices across the country are engaged in customer service.  In addition, the bank has agreements with thousands of outlets that offer customers the retail products of the Russian Standard.  Also, the bank not only lends, but also accepts <span>funds</span> as deposits.  It is about deposits that will be discussed in our article. </p><h2>  Basic terms and conditions of deposits </h2><p>  Deposits offered by Russian Standard Bank for individuals have one of the most favorable conditions on the market. </p><p>  So, the contribution ‚ÄúMaximum income‚Äù allows you to get up to 10 percent per annum.  And this rate is fixed.  Many banks in terms of deposit involve a change in interest and conditions in different periods.  Thus, in the first few months, the maximum interest on the deposit is accrued, and these are the numbers voiced by advertising to attract customers.  After this period, the rate decreases, and by the end it can be completely reduced by one third, in contrast to the conditions of deposits of the Russian Standard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, the average deposit rate for the entire term is much lower than what was originally stated and what the client had hoped for.  Russian Standard Bank offers a transparent and understandable deposit system without pitfalls.  To make a contribution, it will not take long and complicated calculations of profit and future profit. </p><h2>  Several programs </h2><p>  Deposits of the ‚ÄúRussian Standard‚Äù include several types, which involve a number of different options, including partial withdrawal, replenishment, interest payment on a monthly or quarterly basis, opening a foreign currency deposit in dollars or euros, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian standard bank deposits" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60138/2163412.jpg"></div>

    <p>  All deposits are insured, which ensures the safety of invested money.  At the moment, the bank's customer base for deposits is more than half a million people. </p><p>  At Russian Standard Bank, deposits for seniors are subject to a special savings program.  One of its main advantages is the affordable down payment of 10,000 rubles. </p><p>  Next, we consider each deposit program separately. </p><h2>  "Maximum income" </h2><p>  <span>The maximum deposit rate</span> in the "Russian Standard" is, as mentioned above, 10 percent.  You can get it by investing from 10 thousand rubles for a period of one year.  The assigned percentage of the deposit amount and currency depends.  It is allowed to open a deposit in dollars, euros and rubles at the discretion of the client. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A high rate of 10 percent is assigned only in case of opening a deposit through the Internet banking.  If you open a deposit in the office, the interest rate will be lower by half a percent per annum.  To withdraw a contribution even partially, as well as to replenish it, is not allowed. </p><p>  All accrued interest is paid at the end of the deposit period.  Of the pleasant moments when opening a deposit in the financial institution under consideration is the MasterCard Worldwide card when concluding an agreement as a gift. </p><p>  The drawback of the deposit is the large amount for opening a foreign currency deposit of the ‚ÄúRussian Standard‚Äù, which starts from 5 thousand.  At the same time, even a senior citizen with very modest incomes can make a contribution in rubles.  The term of the deposit starts from three months to two years.  A contribution to the euro can be made for a period of six months to two years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian standard deposits for individuals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60138/2163411.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  "Replenished" </h2><p>  This program of Russian Standard Bank will certainly be beneficial for those who gradually save up money for a large purchase in small amounts.  Moreover, in addition to savings, there is also an increase in the form of interest. </p><p>  The rate for this program is slightly lower than in the "Maximum Revenue", and equal to 9.5%.  Such a percentage can be calculated with a deposit of 30 thousand rubles for a period of one year.  The opening amount of this deposit of "Russian Standard" is 30 thousand rubles or 5,000 dollars or euros. </p><p>  The term of the deposit may be equal to six months or a year, which will affect the interest rate.  All accumulated savings, including interest, are paid out upon expiration of the deposit.  The method of opening this contribution does not matter.  You can open it on the same terms and through a personal account on the bank‚Äôs website, and by visiting the company‚Äôs branch.  The rate from this will not change. </p><h2>  "Comfortable" </h2><p>  This deposit offers convenient conditions for those who plan to replenish this <span>type of deposit</span> of the Russian Standard Bank and partially withdraw money.  This is especially true in times of crisis when unforeseen events, such as job cuts, can occur.  The ability to withdraw part of the money from a deposit in such a situation would be most welcome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deposit rates in the Russian standard" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60138/2163410.jpg"></div>

    <p>  You can open a deposit under the program both through the bank online, and in the department in person.  Currency can be selected in any convenient option: in euros, dollars and rubles.  However, it should be borne in mind that the minimum deposit amount in foreign currency is 10 thousand.  Of course, such a large amount is available for deposit only with large entrepreneurs. </p><p>  In rubles, the minimum amount is much more democratic and is equal to 30 thousand rubles.  The contribution can be made for a period of three months to a year.  The deposit rate depends on the currency, term and balance, which cannot be cashed before the deposit expires.  Interest is paid at the end of the period. </p><h2>  "Rentier" </h2><p>  There is a category of citizens who live on the interest earned on deposits.  Although there are not many, there are such ones.  Moreover, this trend is gradually gaining momentum. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card Russian standard deposit rates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60138/2163409.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Some people prefer increased risk and invest in "PAMM-accounts" and "Forex".  However, the risk of losing invested funds is excessively great.  Therefore, many still trust only deposits, opening deposit accounts with banks.  The risk in this case is minimal, since deposits are insured. </p><p>  If the client has a large amount of money with which he expects to receive income on a monthly basis, then the ‚ÄúRentier‚Äù deposit is what you need.  Having invested their money under this program, the client receives a monthly payment.  This is especially true during times of unstable economic situation in the country. </p><p>  The deposit rate is 8.5 percent per year, which is a good indicator for such a program.  Naturally, the amount of the contribution should be more than decent, so that it is enough for a comfortable existence.  This deposit of the bank "Russian Standard" suggests the possibility of <span>replenishment of the account.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian standard bank deposits for pensioners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60138/2163408.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The minimum possible contribution for this program is 30 thousand rubles.  The foreign currency contribution starts from 5 thousand.  The agreement provides for the transfer of interest received back to the deposit account, that is, the capitalization of the deposit.  One of the advantages of this program is receiving a VIP client card as a gift. </p><p>  For more information about the range of services, various types of lending, tariffs, deposits, Russian Standard cards, contact one of the bank‚Äôs branches, visit the official website, or call the hotline. </p>
