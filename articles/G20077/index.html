What it is?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many people are interested in chess, but not everyone is familiar with the rules.  Therefore, before playing your first game, you must carefully study the basic rules of the move.  Especially important are the provisions, which include <span>checkmate, check and</span> stalemate.  Naturally, for an experienced chess player the differences are obvious.  But it is difficult for a beginner to understand the features.  According to the rules, the check is the position of the pieces, where the opponent‚Äôs king is clearly at risk.  There are three possible ways out of the situation: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's checkmate in chess" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12720/346245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  - create protection against the shah; </p><p>  - beat the figure that makes the check; </p><p>  - put the king in a position where he will be without the threat of attack. </p><h2>  Determine the concepts </h2><p>  Mate is the situation when the pieces are in such a position that the opponent‚Äôs king is clearly at risk.  The latter is in a <span>hopeless position</span> and has no way to retreat.  There is also a stalemate situation where the king does not have the opportunity to retreat, but the enemy has not yet declared a check.  The player does not have the ability to make moves, since he has no pieces left except for the king. </p><h2>  Is it possible to avoid such a mat <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chess how to put a child‚Äôs mat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12720/346247.jpg?1394049834037" width="541"></div></h2><p>  In order not to immediately suffer defeat, you need to clearly understand for yourself which combinations lead to a losing situation.  The most common among beginners is a children's checkmate in chess.  This technique is quite tricky, and it comes across those who do not have experience and knowledge.  Implementing it is quite simple.  Here the calculation is made on the fact that the opponent does not know the final position.  Of course, it is important to know before playing a game of chess how to put a child‚Äôs checkmate, but it‚Äôs not worth hoping that the opponent will make a mistake.  The main thing is to try to win on your own.  If you know in advance how to put a child‚Äôs mat, then you can predict how events will develop.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a tricky trick is that the opponent tries to bring the queen to the field f3 or h5.  In order for this move to take place, you must first go by pawn from the king either to the e3 square or to the e4 square.  So you can walk both black and white pieces.  Next, the bishop needs to be rearranged on the c4 square, after which the pawn is under attack on the f7 square.  It is here that the enemy must concentrate seriously, otherwise a mate in chess will be waiting for him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What you should pay attention to </h2>

The player‚Äôs task is to learn to see the future and be able to predict all possible scenarios.  One of the most important points for any chess player is knowledge of theory.  Only in this way will he be able to avoid such a development of events as a children's checkmate in chess.  Such a loss is considered rather stupid and insulting, because it is very easy to calculate it.  This situation is most common among chess players.  If you are planning to play with an experienced opponent, you should not try to put him a child's mate in chess.  If a player is strong enough and has extensive experience in such games, he knows very well how to defend himself against such a situation and will certainly use the appropriate technique.  It is especially important to remember the following: in no case should such a situation be created during tournaments or important competitions.  It is well known to all experienced players, and you can put yourself in such an act in a silly position.
