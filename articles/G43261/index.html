It is gratifying that independent tourists do not have any problems with accommodation.  There are many hotels here, so the choice depends only on your preferences and financial capabilities.  Regardless of the category of hotel, service is always on top.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  The rooms are always clean and comfortable. </p><p>  You can also choose the beaches at your discretion: free, but crowded or paid - more well-groomed and comfortable.  The town leaves a very pleasant impression, and many tourists plan to come here again and again. </p>
