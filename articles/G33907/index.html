    <p>  Each time, not tired of wondering at the variety of different drawings that come out of the hands of experienced craftswomen, you want to learn and apply them in your own product.  This article will help novice needlewomen understand the system for executing various variants of such a many-sided pattern. </p><h2>  How to knit a braided pattern: getting to know the pattern </h2><p>  Wicker patterns imitate the dense and not very dense weave used in various crafts.  A knitted fabric knitted with a ‚Äúwicker‚Äù is a spectacular and often used pattern both in models as a whole and in fragments and details.  Accessories look great, based on the ‚Äúwicker‚Äù pattern.  With knitting needles it is carried out or crocheted, the knitted product in any case looks original.  In our article, we will talk about knitting "wicker" patterns with knitting needles, so let's start by preparing for work and selecting the necessary materials and tools. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  For such patterns, too thin or, conversely, a thick thread is not suitable, the best option is yarn of medium thickness of any manufacturer, domestic or foreign.  The reference point can be considered the number of meters in a hundred-gram skein.  It should not be less than 250-300 m. </p>

    <p>  The composition of the thread can be any: wool, wool blend yarn with the addition of silk or acrylic.  The low content of stretch fiber or lycra in the structure of the yarn will benefit the future knit fabric, as it will make it more plastic and lively.  The ‚Äúbraiding‚Äù pattern with knitting needles is very dense, even thick, has a beautiful convex-embossed surface and is well combined with other types of weaves: braids, aranes, tows, various tracks and bumps, or with a canvas made with <span>front stitch.</span> </p><h2>  Knitting tools </h2><p>  The choice of yarn also dictates the tools necessary for comfortable knitting of a knitted fabric.  Threads of medium thickness correspond to spokes No. 3-3.5.  The material of which they consist does not play a special role, since each master follows his own preferences.  Therefore, they are selected purely individually.  Experienced craftsmen recommend light knitting needles: not steel, but bamboo, wooden or teflon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the set of two basic needles, it is also necessary to prepare an additional knitting needle of the same size, since it participates in the creation of the pattern as an additional tool and is very important.  If you intend to knit a wide fabric, it is more convenient to work with knitting needles on a fishing line or a thin and durable metal cord.  It is necessary to approach the choice of a tool seriously, since the mismatch of the thickness of the yarn and knitting needles will cause certain inconveniences during the work, and can not only delay the knitting, but also negate the satisfaction of the creative process itself. </p><h2>  Loop test calculation </h2><p>  Before we figure out how to knit a ‚Äúwicker‚Äù pattern with knitting needles, we recall that this pattern is one of those for which it is necessary to calculate the required number of loops.  Since such patterns consist of many weaves, it is difficult to guess the required number of loops.  Calculation of a loop test is done as follows: they knit a sample whose sides exceed 10 cm. Since the samples are performed for each type of yarn and weaves, it will be important to make a simple template for calculation.  It is a regular square with sides of 10 cm, cut out on a leaf in a cage.  The bound sample is steamed and applied to the fabricated template, counting the number of loops in the horizontal row and the number of rows in the vertical on the sides of the square.  By dividing by 10, the number of loops of 1 cm is obtained and their required number is calculated, then correcting it in accordance with the pattern repetition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  <span>Knitting:</span> pattern "braid" </h2><p>  The pattern is based on weaving in one front row of the same number of loops in one direction, and in the next - in the other.  We start the review with the simplest drawing and consider the first option - the ‚Äúbraid‚Äù pattern, made with knitting needles with inclined loops with a frequency of 2/2. </p>

    <p>  To bind the sample, dial the number of loops, a multiple of 4, + 2 edge loops.  When carrying out work, they are guided by the basic requirements: from the face, knitting is done with facial loops, from the inside - from the wrong. </p><ul><li>  1st row: 1 cr., Rapport is repeated until the end of the row - transfer 2 p.

In these cases, the number of rows between rows in which weaving was performed is increased.  Consider the "braid" pattern with 3/3 knitting needles. </p><h2>  Second option </h2><p>  For the sample, the number of loops is multiplied by a multiple of 6, + 2 edge, and the work begins as follows: </p><ul><li>  1st row: 1 cr., * 3 loops move to extra.  the needle, leaving the front of the working canvas, knit 3 persons., and then 3 persons.  with add.  needles * 1 cr .; </li><li>  from the inside, knitting is done with the wrong loops; </li><li>  3rd row: all loops - front; </li><li>  5th row: 1 cr., 3 persons., * 3 loops are left behind the fabric, 3 persons are knitted., Then 3 loops with add.  needles, complete a row of 3 persons., 1 cr .; </li><li>  7th row: all facial. </li></ul><p>  In this embodiment, the rapport consists of 8 rows, i.e., the pattern is repeated from the 9th row.  The "braid" with knitting needles, the scheme of which is presented, can be tied with rapport, which includes more rows. </p>

    <p>  For example, not only the 3rd row, but also the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th can be knitted with facial ones, and weaving can be done in the 3rd and 9th rows.  In other words, it all depends on the master, his preferences and the chosen model.  For knitting products of large shapes, for example blankets or bedspreads, weave of 4, 5 or more loops is used.  In these cases, the number of loops in the sample should be a multiple of twice the number of loops involved in the weaving + 2 edge.  The multifaceted and democratic knitting pattern, the knitting workshop of which is presented above, is often performed in models of clothes, accessories, even household items. </p><h2>  Where are woven weaves used? </h2><p>  The knitting pattern, the scheme of which is described above, is performed in the manufacture of clothing models.  For example, cardigans, coats, dresses and sweaters, connected by such a pattern, have a dense and inextensible structure.  They are warm and effective, but it must be remembered that the consumption of yarn for a model made with such a pattern increases by about 1.5 times precisely due to frequent weaves.  Accordingly, the weight of the product also increases. </p><p>  Individual details of clothes or even fragments made by ‚Äúwicker‚Äù and organically inscribed in the silhouette of the author‚Äôs model look no less beautiful.  Often, masters use this pattern to design flirts or waist lines.  This is an excellent way to simulate a set-in belt: the woven fabric shrinks strongly in relation to the main one and keeps its shape, emphasizing the silhouette. </p><h2>  Design ideas </h2><p>  In addition to knitting clothing patterns, the ‚Äúwicker‚Äù pattern is successfully used in the manufacture of accessories: belts, bags, scarves, snoods, gloves and mittens.  The relief of the resulting knitted fabric and its good density are two conditions that ensure the demand for a woven pattern.  Another trendy trend - knitting sofa cushions - makes modern interiors not only warm and cozy, but also unique.  Poufs covered with knitted fabric, plaids and decorative pillowcases - unforgettable and interesting ideas embedded in household goods, have long replenished the designer's arsenal. </p>

    <p>  The basis of a beautiful track-arana, the photo of which is presented above, is also a "braid" made on the wrong field.  For the sample in accordance with the scheme gain 24 loops + 2 cr.  The rapport height corresponds to 16 rows.  The track looks like a complex braid, the side faces of which consist of two loops, and the middle is made by a sparse "braid". </p><p>  Arana with similar intertwining elements is a frequently used method that emphasizes the variety of such type of needlework as knitting.  The ‚Äúbraid‚Äù pattern, the diagram of which is presented above, is an example of the many faces of one type of weave. </p>
