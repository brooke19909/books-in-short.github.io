  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotel "Golden Rhine" 2 *, Nha Trang: traveler reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years, Vietnam has been a worthy competitor to Thailand, so we can say that this direction is also becoming widespread.  What attracts tourists to this country?  Friendly to the Russian holidaymakers, the Vietnamese remember the assistance provided by the USSR peacekeeping forces during the war, which ended in 1975.  The hospitality and hospitality with which the inhabitants of this country meet our compatriots are certainly captivating.  To this you can add the beauty of beaches and nature, <span>local flavor,</span> exotic dishes and, of course, a comfortable hotel base.  Even hotels of inexpensive categories (2 *, 3 *) are distinguished by excellent service, worthy of the number of rooms.  The article will discuss one of these hotels - Golden Rain 2 * (Nha Trang, Vietnam). </p><h2>  What do tourists need to know when traveling to Vietnam? </h2><p>  The only negative point for travelers who will have to put up with is a long flight (for example, from Moscow the travel time will be about 9 hours).  But, as noted in numerous reviews about holidays in this country, this discomfort is worth it. </p><p>  Vietnam will certainly cause associations with the Soviet past of our country.  Here, too, there is a mausoleum with a leader, cheerful and friendly pioneers with reddish ties, red flags on administrative buildings, low prices for food and entertainment.  Simplifies the opportunity to visit the country and the lack of visa requirements for Vietnam for Russians whose stay in this country does not exceed 15 days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the resort of Nha Trang you can relax all year round.  However, in October and November it is better to refuse to visit this place - the period is officially considered the rainy season.  The rest of the year there is a rather dry and warm tropical climate - average temperatures in the afternoon are about 27 <span>¬∞ C, the</span> water on the coast of the South China Sea warms up to about the same level.  Fans of surfing come here from November to May - during this period quite strong winds blow, and on a turbulent sea you can catch an excellent wave. </p><h2>  A brief overview of the country's resorts </h2><p>  Most often, Vietnam is divided into northern, southern and central.  If you are a connoisseur of exciting excursion programs, then you need to go to the provinces located in the north of the country.  Here you can see numerous temple buildings, religious and cultural attractions, reserves and the capital of the country - the city of Hanoi.  The north of the country is especially wonderful in the middle of spring, when everything is literally dotted with flowers, fragrant shrubs;  tea and coffee plantations shimmer with wondrous greenery, and the gentle sun does not yet create intense heat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vietnam-service.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="South China Sea" class="if uuid-2286935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2286935.jpg"></div><p>  In the center of the country you can see endless beaches, and Danang is famous for its discos and clubs.  In the south of Vietnam is the fashionable island of Phu Quoc, where lovers of luxury and relaxation come together.  In the same part of the state are Ho Chi Minh City and Nha Trang.  The latter is more relevant to youth recreation, the resort has many bars, cafes, disco clubs.  Fans of pacifying rest seek Fantie, which is also located in the south of the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nha Trang - relaxation for every taste </h2><p>  The main thing is to choose the location of the hotel.  It should be remembered that the largest infrastructure is in the center of the resort.  The beaches here are crowded, which cannot be said about the outskirts of Nha Trang, stretching for a strip of 7 km along the seashore. </p><p>  Young people come here to hang out in clubs, parents with children find a variety of entertainments (on Monkey Island, in amusement parks), people of more mature age choose quiet areas of the resort (for example, near the northern Hong Chong beach). </p><p>  The hotel base of Nha Trang (as well as the whole of Vietnam) has a relative star system.  Hotels of the highest category are located on the first line of the coast, the rest on the second (across the road from the sea).  Comfortable accommodation can be obtained by booking even an inexpensive hotel 2-3 *.  By the way, the Golden Rain 2 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) on ‚Äã‚Äãmany booking sites is positioned as a 3 * hotel.  All hotels have hot water and Wi-Fi, which for most of us has become an integral part of life. </p><h2>  Features and location of the hotel "Golden Rain" 2 * (Nha Trang) </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.2328501" data-lng="109.19538769999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/4/0/1040.png"></div><p>  This is a city-style hotel, which (like other similar hotels) is deprived of its own territory.  Most reviews of the Golden Rain 2 * in Nha Trang indicate a very convenient location of the hotel - in the very center of the European quarter, on the second coastline (the distance to the beach is about 500 m).  The main infrastructure is concentrated nearby: large shops, shopping centers, markets, clubs and restaurants, a water park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The tall, modern pink building stands out spectacularly from other buildings in the area.  It meets all safety requirements, is built from environmentally friendly materials, and on the roof there is an open-air pool. </p><h2>  Accommodation facilities </h2><p>  When describing the Golden Rain 2 * rooms in Nha Trang, tourists note that the order in all categories was perfect.  You can choose one of the following types of accommodation: </p><ul><li>  Superior </li><li>  Suite </li><li>  Deluxe </li></ul><p>  The first two types of rooms differ in size (the suite is slightly larger than the superior).  The deluxe suite also has a jacuzzi in the bathroom.  All rooms have a very modern look and uniform design.  Design can be attributed to the style of classical minimalism, harmoniously combined with folk elements of decor. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.ivivu.com/blog/2016/01/vi-vu-choi-tet-khong-lo-het-phong-khach-san-nha-trang/" data-original="www.ivivu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="number fund" class="if uuid-2286846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2286846.jpg"></div><p>  The rooms have comfortable furniture, medium-hard mattresses on the beds, modern TVs with satellite channels, safes, air conditioning, telephones, Wi-Fi, and a minibar.  The last element of the atmosphere is filled for an additional fee, and our quick-witted tourists used it as a refrigerator. </p><p>  Bathrooms are equipped with toilets, sinks, showers, hairdryers, and toiletries.  All guests receive slippers. </p><h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  As in many other hotels in Vietnam, in the Golden Rain 2 * (Nha Trang) tourists are offered only breakfast.  Many people like this because they are "not attached" to the hotel, they can have lunch and dinner at any place they like.  There are a lot of them, by the way.  Often vacationers visit restaurants with Russian or European cuisine, which is more familiar to us. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.ivivu.com/blog/2016/02/khach-san-nha-trang-gia-tot-con-phong-dip-tet-binh-than-2016/" data-original="www.ivivu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="breakfast at the hotel" class="if uuid-2286871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2286871.jpg"></div><p>  In the restaurant of the hotel "Golden Rain" 2 * you can try both traditional dishes and international.  Travelers with children note that breakfasts were very high quality, nutritious and varied.  For younger guests, the assortment of dishes is not limited to cereals and cereals, you can choose other dietary dishes (for example, light soup, pastries, etc.).  Fresh products are delivered to the kitchen daily; no cases of poisoning were recorded at this hotel. </p><h2>  This marvelous beach ... </h2><p>  To reach the sea, judging by the reviews of the Golden Rain Hotel 2 * in Nha Trang, you can take a calm step in 5-7 minutes.  The beach is municipal, so umbrellas and sun loungers can be used for an additional fee (the cost of renting a sunbed will cost 40,000 dong, at the rate of about 100 rubles).  The territory is very clean and well-groomed, covered with light fine sand.  A shallow approach to the sea, this fact is very popular with parents resting in the resort with small children. </p><div class="photo" data-source="http://zaodich.webtretho.com/forum/f2766/suc-hut-cua-du-an-golden-peak-nha-trang-2536154/" data-original="zaodich.webtretho.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="seafront in Nha Trang" class="if uuid-2286891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2286891.jpg"></div><p>  A little further (if you travel by bus) there are two more beaches: Paragon and Ponagar.  The first is compared with Anapa and it is recommended to go there with the children, and on the second you can rent a boat and go on a short excursion along the coast. </p><h2>  What place does the hotel take in the ranking? </h2><p>  The Golden Rain 2 * in Nha Trang receives a solid ‚Äúfour‚Äù out of five possible points on the main booking sites (booking.com, tophotels.ru).  The hotel's infrastructure, its location and service make it possible to speak of an excellent price / quality ratio.  Many tourists were satisfied with the opportunity to relax on the roof of the hotel near the pool, where a breathtaking view of the city and the sea opens.  Others were pleasantly surprised by the availability of a fitness center with modern fitness equipment.  After a workout, you can use the sauna.  The food was also not satisfactory; most tourists were satisfied with a variety of dishes and their quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="muabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rooftop pool" class="if uuid-2286834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2286834.jpg"></div><p>  Many say that the hotel does not meet the declared category 2 *.  For all the opportunities for vacationers and the service it can be safely put on a par with 3-4 * hotels. </p><h2>  Guest reviews for the last 2 years </h2><p>  The main plus of the Golden Rain Hotel 2 * (Nha Trang), which is often mentioned in reviews, is the impeccable cleanliness of the rooms and other common areas.  Cleaning is carried out daily; cosmetic accessories, towels and bed linen are regularly updated.  The hotel staff speaks Russian, so all the problems that arise (even the most minor) were resolved very quickly. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.jetcost.com/hotels/125936-vietnam/42244-nha-trang/1619324-golden-rain-hotel/" data-original="www.jetcost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gym" class="if uuid-2286879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2286879.jpg"></div><p>  Another positive feature is called the location - you can walk to the sea in five minutes, there are many places of public catering for every taste, entertainment venues.  Parents who come to rest with young children are advised to visit the Winperl and Gorky Park. </p><p>  Guests of the Golden Rain 2 * in Nha Trang note that almost until nightfall music was heard from the open windows, which interfered with full sleep.  To avoid this, it is advised to take rooms higher and with a view of the city (or, in extreme cases, use ear plugs).  Others did not like the too small room area, "there was nowhere to turn around." </p><p>  In the photo "Golden Rhine" 2 * (Nha Trang), which tourists are actively posting along with reviews, sometimes you can see dripping air conditioners, uncleaned rooms.  It is worth repeating here that any problems arising during the holidays can be solved with the hotel administration (some contacted the hotel owner directly by the name of Grisha). </p><h2>  What sights should you visit in Nha Trang? </h2><p>  The most popular places that are located near the hotel are mud baths and Winperl.  In the health center it is better to take a VIP ticket - this includes the full range of services (massages, peels, spa treatments, mud therapy, swimming pools, etc.), it turns out very profitable.  In the water park, vacationers really liked the electric sleds, a show program with dolphins, a huge number of water slides and charming fountains, which are especially beautiful in the evening. </p><p>  Very good reviews leave tourists who visited the Bin Chau crocodile farm.  The chic nature of Vietnam can be seen in the Yang Bay Ecological Park.  Excursions to thermal springs and waterfalls left no one indifferent.  Visit Monkey Island will be remembered for a lifetime. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><div class="photo" data-original="muabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modern setting" class="if uuid-2286841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2286841.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a hotel, tourists usually rely on photos and reviews of experienced travelers.  "Golden Rain" 2 * in Nha Trang advise young couples, families who go on vacation with children, friendly companies of any age.  Here is a great balance between price and quality.  The staff speaks Russian, so all problems are resolved very quickly.  The hotel is located close to the beach, shopping and entertainment venues.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, the food is excellent.  What else is needed for a good rest?  A sense of proportion and caution.  It must be remembered that in the midday heat one should protect the head with a piece of clothing, cover the knees and shoulders.  In Vietnam, you can get sunburn even on a cloudy day - do not forget to bring sunblock with you. </p><p>  Experienced tourists advise in Vietnam to be vigilant in crowded places where thefts often occur.  It is better not to leave phones and bags on the beach or in the cafe unattended.  Going on a trip around the country, at the very beginning you need to write a price and show it to the driver.  Otherwise, the cost of a "walk" can be repeatedly overstated by sneaky Vietnamese. </p><p>  Precautions must be observed in any country, as well as to honor the culture and traditions of another people.  If you listen to these simple rules, your vacation will not overshadow anything. </p>
