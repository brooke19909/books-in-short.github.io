This discipline plays a huge role in modern production, without which human civilization could not exist.  But she achieved such a high level of development only thanks to the works of <span>famous scientists who</span> devoted their lives to chemistry. </p><h2>  Avogadro: a closed genius </h2><p>  One of the prominent chemical scientists is <span>Amedeo Avogadro.</span>  He was born in Italy, in the family of an official.  In 1792 he received a law degree.  His father was also a renowned legal specialist.  Having started working in the legislative field, Avogadro is engaged in the study of physics and mathematics in his free time.  Only in 1820 he received the title of professor of physical and mathematical sciences. </p>

    <p>  Well-known chemists of that time note that Avogadro was a very reserved person, so many of his ideas remained incomprehensible to them.  Avogadro received recognition in scientific circles after confirming his famous theory, which later became known as the Avogadro Law.  Avogadro also established the quantitative composition of many chemical elements, created a method for determining molecular weights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Boyle's biography and scientific interests </h2><p>  A significant role in the formation of chemistry is played by the achievements of Robert Boyle.  He was born on January 25, 1627 in Ireland.  In childhood, he received home education, and then was sent to the Eton School, specially created for the children of wealthy aristocrats.  In 1656, <span>Robert Boyle</span> moved to Oxford, where he began to show his interest in physics and chemistry.  There, Boyle established friendly relations with young scientists who were keen on science.  Together they created something like a secret society, which later became the Oxford Scientific Society. </p>

    <p>  Well-known chemists of that time confirm that Boyle did not like disputes, and even avoided scientific polemics, which often had a humorous character.  Boyle formed the concept of the so-called "primary corpuscles" (basic elements) and "secondary corpuscles (complex bodies).  In his book, entitled ‚ÄúThe Skeptic Chemist,‚Äù Boyle first defines the elements - ‚Äúthe original bodies that are not made up of each other.‚Äù  In addition to chemistry, Boyle's studies were devoted to the fields of optics, acoustics, and electricity. </p><h2>  Werner Research </h2><p>  Alfred Werner was born December 12, 1866 in the family of a turner.  After graduating from elementary school, Werner enters a technical school and enjoys chemistry.  He begins to put chemical experiments right at home.  In addition, the young scientist is interested in literature and even architecture.  Chemist Alfred Werner received the Nobel Prize for authorship of the so-called coordination theory.  In addition, Werner created his own theory of acids and bases, and also proposed his own version of the periodic system of elements.  In 1913 received the Nobel Prize. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Niels Bohr Achievements in Chemistry </h2><p>  Famous chemists around the world to this day use the achievements of Niels Bohr, who was more famous for his research in the field of physics.  Niels Bohr created the quantum theory of the hydrogen atom.  In it, he explained the features of the rotation of electrons and mathematically described the various states of the atom. </p>

    <p>  Niels Bohr was born on October 7, 1885 in Copenhagen into an <span>intelligent family.</span>  Discussions on burning scientific issues were often held at his parents' house.  While studying at the University of Copenhagen, Bohr received a medal from the Danish Academy of Sciences.  Other well-known chemists - mainly Ernest Rutherford - studied together with Bohr the questions of the radioactivity of elements and the structure of the atom. </p><h2>  Svante Arrhenius - chemist from Sweden </h2><p>  Another outstanding chemistry researcher is Svante Arrhenius.  He was born on February 19, 1859 in Uppsala.  In 1876 he entered the university, and six months earlier received the degree of candidate of philosophical sciences.  Since 1881, Arrhenius begins the study of aqueous solutions of electrolytes at the Stockholm Physical Institute.  In 1903, the scientist was awarded the Nobel Prize for authorship of the <span>theory of electrolytic dissociation.</span> </p>

    <p>  It is known that Arrhenius had a good-natured and cheerful character.  At one time he was known not only as a scientist, but also as the author of textbooks and articles on astronomy and medicine.  Chemists for a long time did not recognize his achievements: for example, his theories were sharply criticized by Mendeleev.  Subsequently, it turned out that the views of both researchers constitute the basis of a new, so-called proton, theory of bases in chemistry. </p>
