What was the reason for the beginning of the <span>peasant war,</span> and how did this event affect the further development of the state?  Read about it later. </p><h2>  China on the eve of the uprising </h2><p>  At the beginning of the XIX century, China entered a period of deep crisis, which covered all spheres of state life.  Its political manifestations were an increase in anti-Manchurian sentiments (since the end of the 18th century the Qing empire, led by the Manchu dynasty was in power) and the rise of the rebel movement.  The crisis has become the main reason for the "closure" of the country to trade with English and Indian merchants.  Self-isolation of China led to the First Opium War with England.  As a result of the aggressive actions of European states, the policy of "closure" was over.  China began to turn into a semi-colony. </p><p>  The defeat in the First <span>Opium War</span> and the further active invasion of foreign capital in the country's economy undermined the prestige of the ruling dynasty.  And it was at this time in China that a new opposition ideology was emerging, the father of which is Hong Xiuquan. </p><h2>  Taiping ideology </h2><p>  Hong Xiuquan is the main ideologist of the Taiping movement.  He was born in 1813 near Guangzhou.  His father was an impoverished Chinese official.  The future leader of the Taiping uprising repeatedly tried to pass a special exam to fill a public post.  However, all his attempts were unsuccessful.  It was during his studies in Guangzhou that he became acquainted with Christian ideas that actively penetrated the country through the activities of European missions.  Hong Xiuquan began to study a religion unfamiliar to him.  Already in 1843 he created a Christian organization called the Society of Heavenly Father. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Consider the basic ideas of the teachings of Hong Xiuquan. </p><ol><li>  It was based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Holy Trinity.  At the same time, Hong Xiuquan included himself in her composition as the younger brother of Jesus Christ.  In this regard, he interpreted all his actions as "the designation of God." </li><li>  Hong Xiuquan was also impressed by the Christian idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe "kingdom of God."  It corresponded to the ancient Chinese ideas of a "just society."  In this regard, the Taipins brought to the fore the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãequality and fraternity. </li><li>  A characteristic feature of the Taiping ideology was its anti-Manchu orientation.  In his sermons, he said that <span>the Qing dynasty</span> should be overthrown.  In addition, the Taiping called for the physical destruction of Manchuria. </li><li>  The followers of Hong Xiuquan opposed Confucianism and other alternative religions, but at the same time borrowed some ideas from them (for example, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúfilial piety‚Äù). </li><li>  The main goal of the organization is the creation of Taiping Tianguo (Heavenly State of Great Welfare). </li></ol><h2>  The beginning of the uprising and periodization </h2><p>  In the summer of 1850, the Jintian Uprising began.  The Taiping people found the situation in the country favorable for openly speaking out against state power, led by the Qing Dynasty.  10 thousand rebels concentrated in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Jintian in the south of Guangxi province. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  January 11, 1850 was officially announced the beginning of the uprising. </p><p>  At the first stage of the struggle, the Taiping set their main goal to free China.  The Qing (a dynasty that has ruled here for over 100 years) was proclaimed an enemy and must be overthrown. </p>

    <p>  In general, researchers agree that the Taiping uprising in China went through 4 main stages in its development: </p><p>  Stage 1 covers 1850-1853.  This is a time of brilliant success for the Taiping Army.  In September 1851, she captured the city of Yun'an.  It was here that the foundations of the Taiping state were laid. </p><p>  Stage 2 - 1853-1856  The beginning of a new period of struggle marks the seizure by the rebels of the city of Nanjing.  At this stage, the Taipins sent their main forces to expand their state. </p><p>  The 3rd period of the peasant war in China lasted from 1856 to 1860. In time, it coincided with the Second Opium War. </p><p>  Stage 4 covers 1860-1864.  It was marked by an open military intervention of the Western European powers in China and the suicide of Hong Xiuquan. </p><h2>  First stage of the war </h2><p>  In 1851, the Taiping moved north to Guangxi.  Here they occupied the city of Yun'an, where they created their own government. </p><p>  Yang Xiuqing became the head of the new state.  He received the highest position under the name "Eastern Prince" (he also received the title "herald of God") and concentrated in his hands the administrative management and leadership of the army.  In addition, at the head of the Taiping state were 3 more princes (Western - Xiao Chaogui, Northern - Wei Changhui and Southern - Feng Yunshan) and their assistant Shi Dakai. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In December 1852, the Taiping Army moved down the Yangtze River, to the east of the country.  In January 1853, they managed to occupy a strategically important region - the Wuhan Tri-City, which included cities such as Wuchang, Hanyang and Hankow.  The military successes of the Taiping army contributed to the growing popularity of Hong Xiuquan ideas among the local population, so the rebel ranks were constantly replenished.  By 1853, the number of rebels exceeded 500 thousand people. </p><p>  After the capture of the Three City of Wuhan, the rebel army moved to Anhui province and occupied its most important cities. </p><p>  In March 1853, the Taiping stormed one of the largest <span>cities in China,</span> Nanjing, which then became the capital of their state.  This event marked the end of the first and beginning of the second stage of the peasant war. </p>

    <h2>  Taiping State Organization </h2><p>  The peasant war in China began in 1850, and a year later the Taiping State was created in the south of the country.  Consider the basic principles of its organization in more detail. </p><ul><li>  Since 1853, the city of Nanjing was considered the capital of the state. </li><li>  By its structure, Taiping Tianguo was a monarchy. </li><li>  By their character - a theocratic state (the rebels insisted on the complete merger of the church and the institutions of power). </li><li>  The bulk of the population were peasants.  Their requirements were usually complied with by the government. </li><li>  Hong Xiuquan was considered the nominal head of state, but in fact all power was in the hands of the "Eastern Prince" and the "herald of God" Yang Xiuqing. </li></ul><p>  In 1853, the most important document was published, entitled "The Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty."  In fact, it became the constitution of the newly formed Taiping State.  This law approved not only the foundations of agricultural policy, but also the basic principles of the administrative structure of the country. </p><p>  The "Heavenly Dynasty Land System" provided for the organization of paramilitary patriarchal communities.  So, every 25 peasant families constituted a separate community.  From each family, one person was required to perform military service. </p><p>  Since the summer of 1850, a system of so-called "sacred pantries" was established among the Taipins.  Of these, the rebels and their families received food, money and clothing.  "Sacred pantries" replenished due to military production.  At the same time, private property was banned in the Taiping state. </p><p>  The new Constitution of the Taiping State, in fact, embodied the dreams of the peasants about the equality and destruction of large land holdings of the landowners.  However, this document was written in a "book" language, unknown to most of the population.  That is why the Constitution did not become the basis for a real policy of the leaders of the Taiping uprising. </p>

    <h2>  Second stage of the war </h2><p>  The Taiping uprising since 1853 is gaining new strength.  The beginning of a new phase of the war marked the seizure of the largest Chinese city of Nanjing by the rebels.  During this period, the Taiping fought actively to expand the borders of their newly formed state. </p><p>  In May 1853, it was decided to begin the Northern Campaign.  Its main goal was the capture of Beijing - the capital of China.  Two armies were sent to the Northern Campaign.  In June, the unsuccessful capture of Huaiqi took place.  Then the troops moved to Shanxi, and then - Zhili. </p><p>  In October, the Taiping Army approached Tianjin (the last outpost on the way to Beijing).  However, by this time the troops were greatly weakened.  In addition, a harsh winter came.  The Taipins suffered not only from the cold, but also from a lack of provisions.  Taiping army loss of many fighters.  This all led to the defeat of the rebels in the Northern Campaign.  In February 1854, troops left Tianjin Province. </p><p>  In fact, simultaneously with the North, the Western campaign of the Taiping army began.  Rebel troops led by Shi Dakai.  The purpose of this campaign was to expand the borders of the Taiping state west of Nanjing and capture new territories along the middle reaches <span>of the Yangtze River.</span>  In June, the rebels managed to return the previously lost city of Anqing, and then other important points.  In the winter of 1855, Shi Dakai‚Äôs army conquered the cities of Wuhan Trehgrad again. </p><p>  On the whole, the Western campaign was very successful for the Taiping.  The borders of their state have expanded significantly west of the capital of Nanjing. </p>

    <h2>  Taiping State Crisis </h2><p>  Despite a number of successful military campaigns, in 1855 a crisis began in the newly-formed state, which covered all spheres of society.  The Taiping uprising swept over vast territories and met with great popular support.  However, its leaders could not realize most of their plans, and the Constitution of the state became, in its essence, utopian. </p><p>  At this time, the number of princes increased significantly.  In 1856 there were already not 4, but more than 200 of them. In addition, Taiping leaders began to move away from ordinary peasants.  By the middle of the war, no one had already spoken about universal equality and fraternity. </p><p>  The crisis has embraced the very system of power.  In fact, the Taiping destroyed the old state system and, in return, could not organize the correct system.  At this time, disagreements between the rulers intensified.  The apogee of this was the coup.  On the night of September 2, 1860, Yang Xiuqing and his family were killed.  The country was swept by a wave of terror.  Destroyed not only the supporters of Yang Xiuqing, but also other van (Shi Dakai).  The coup on September 2, 1860 was a turning point in the history of the peasant war and marked the beginning of its third stage. </p><h2>  Second Opium War </h2><p>  The beginning of the third stage of the Taiping struggle against the Manchu dynasty was marked by the Second Opium War.  The Taiping uprising at that time lost its power, and the newly formed state was forced to exist in the conditions of military aggression of Western states. </p><p>  The reason for the outbreak of hostilities was the arrest of the British ship Arrow in China. </p><p>  In 1857, the combined Anglo-French forces captured Guangzhou.  A year later, they occupied Tianjin, a strategically important point on the outskirts of Beijing. </p><p>  In 1858, the Tianjin Peace Treaty was signed.  The Qing Empire was forced to capitulate.  However, before the ratification of the peace treaty, the emperor of China announced the continuation of the war. </p><p>  In August 1860, the Anglo-French troops again occupied Tianjin.  The decisive battle took place on September 21 at the Balitsiao Bridge (in the Tongzhou area).  The Chinese army was defeated.  In October 1860, the combined Anglo-French forces approached Beijing.  The Chinese government was forced to start negotiations. </p><p>  On October 25, 1860, the Beijing Convention was signed.  Its main results were reduced to the following provisions: </p><ol><li>  England and France received the exclusive right to establish their embassies in Beijing. </li><li>  In China, 5 new ports were opened for foreign trade. </li><li>  Foreigners (merchants and diplomats) received the right to move freely throughout the country. </li><li>  Tianjin was declared an open city. </li></ol>

    <h2>  The fourth stage and the end of the rebellion </h2><p>  Taiping rebellion in 1860-1864  was no longer so powerful.  In addition, the newly formed state was forced to move from active hostilities to defense.  The fourth period of the peasant war in China is characterized by the transition of the United States, Britain and France to open military intervention in the country. </p><p>  In the early 60's, despite the weakening of the army, the Taiping managed to win a number of major victories.  Troops led by Lee Xucheng went to the coastal provinces.  Here they managed to conquer large ports - the city of Hangzhou and other centers of Zhejiang and Jiangsu.  In addition, the Taiping made two trips to Shanghai.  However, they failed to capture the city. </p><p>  In 1861, the offensive of the counter-revolutionary forces began. </p><p>  At the same time, England, France and the United States switched to open intervention against the Taiping.  In 1863, the northern coast of the Yangtze River came under the control of the Qing Dynasty.  The Taiping was then forced to leave all coastal provinces. </p><p>  In 1864, Manchu units with the support of Western European troops surrounded Nanjing.  As a result, more than 100 thousand taipins were destroyed.  The city began a severe famine. </p><p>  Hong Xiuquan realized the hopelessness of the situation and committed suicide.  After his death, the leadership of the defense of Nanjing passed into the hands of Li Xucheng.  In July 1864, the imperial troops blew up the city walls and broke into the capital Taiping Tianguo.

    <h2>  The results and consequences of the peasant war </h2><p>  For the Qing Empire, the Taiping uprising was a major shock.  It undermined the foundations of the feudal system and the country's economy.  Cities and large ports were destroyed, the uprising led to the mass extermination of the population of China. </p><p>  Taiping Tianguo became a great social experiment in which the broad peasant masses were involved. </p><p>  The peasant war also had a significant impact on the situation of the Qing Dynasty.  Her positions in the country were shaken, and the support of the population was lost.  To suppress mass protests, the ruling elite was forced to turn to large landowners for help.  This led to the strengthening of the position of the landowners.  As a result, ethnic Han Chinese (Chinese) increasingly began to take part in the governance of the country, and the number of Manchurians in the state apparatus decreased.  In the 60s.  In China, regional groupings are being strengthened.  It also leads to a weakening of the position of central authority. </p><p>  In addition, the middle of the 19th century in the history of China was marked by a number of other major uprisings. </p><p>  For more than 18 years, the Miao war lasted in Guizhou.  In 1862, a major uprising of the Dungan people began, which swept the provinces of Shanxi and Gansu.  In 1855, an anti-government war broke out in the Yunnan area.  The Hui people who professed Islam took part in it.  All these uprisings had a significant impact on the further development of China and its relations with Western European states. </p>
