Comfortable climate, wide coastline with fine sand, warm and gentle sea make this city a favorite resort, especially for families with small children.  Unfortunately, in Russia there are not many comfortable resort towns with a sandy beach and convenient entry into the sea, which is why Anapa receives hundreds of thousands of vacationers during the season.  Real estate here is very popular.  If you relax every year in Anapa, it's time to think about buying a property.  LCD "Marine Gorgippia" is an excellent residential complex, which takes into account the requirements of most modern residents.  Our task - within the framework of this review, to evaluate the project from all sides and answer the question of how suitable it is for living and recreation in the southern city.  Our review is useful not only for vacationers, but also for those who live in the city all year round. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  The concept of the residential complex "Marine Gorgippia" (Anapa) is thought out literally to the smallest detail.  All efforts of the developer were made to create a modern complex with the most comfortable living conditions.  For the construction of the residential complex, one of the most beautiful, picturesque and environmentally friendly places of the city of Anapa was chosen.  The city is actively being built up, its borders are expanding.  The new complex "Marine Gorgippia" will appear in a new residential neighborhood, spared from the old buildings.  Nearby there are no industrial and agricultural enterprises, it provides the necessary ecology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Water supply, electricity, gas - all the necessary communications are connected to residential buildings.  Accordingly, there will be no difficulties with servicing the microdistrict; hot water and heat will be supplied without any interruptions. </p><h2>  Architecture, Technology </h2><p>  Eight economy-class houses of varying number of storeys, erected using monolithic-panel technology, low-rise townhouses and cottages will appear on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 hectares.  This technology allows you to take into account the seismological features of the area and ensure the safety of each resident.  All houses have an unheated attic space and a basement floor, which is planned to be allocated for commercial infrastructure. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  How comfortable is it to live on the territory of the Sea Gorgippia complex (Anapa)?  Reviews of the first real estate buyers confirm that many of them gave preference to this complex because of the development of its infrastructure.  This is a new residential neighborhood, in the territory of which, in addition to kindergarten and school, there will be the necessary shops, service sector organizations. </p><p>  The builder, judging by the numerous reviews of the residents, took into account the fact that almost every modern family has a personal car that needs a parking space.  Wide courtyards with parking will provide each car owner with free space. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  The developer offered a variety of layouts for every taste.  All apartments in the residential complex "Gorgippia Morskaya" are rented with a fine finish, which includes painting the walls and wallpapering, cement screed on the floor and linoleum with heat and sound insulation, the ceilings are decorated with modern water-based paint.  The walls and floor in the bathrooms are lined with ceramic tiles, all the necessary plumbing and metering devices are installed.  A sink and stove will appear in the kitchen.  A great option for those who are not ready to wait and intend to call into their new family nest right after learning the keys. </p>

The developer offers many mortgage programs, which can be issued on favorable terms. </p><h2>  Is it worth buying </h2><p>  If you have been looking closely at Anapa's new buildings for a long time, we strongly recommend paying attention to the Marine Gorgippia residential complex (Anapa).

    <p>  A great place is what all shoppers celebrate.  Indeed, the sea is only 200 meters away, because every day you can enjoy the sound of the surf.  Today it is the only economy class housing project so close to the sea.  Finishing is another important argument in favor of this particular project.  The first residents of the complex, who managed to move into their apartments, note that the work was done, although not perfectly, but in general they are not satisfactory.  A typical repair is enough to comfortably exist for a certain time.  And, of course, the affordable cost of housing pleases. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  LCD "Gorgippia Morskaya" is an excellent economy class housing project in Anapa.  The developer was able to offer excellent conditions at a very affordable price.  Completion is scheduled for 2020, by which time all residential buildings, as well as social infrastructure facilities, will be erected.  At the moment, you can still buy an apartment in the house at the construction stage, thereby saving a substantial part of your budget. </p>
