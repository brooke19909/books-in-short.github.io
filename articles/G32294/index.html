    <p>  It was at this enterprise for the first time in the Russian Empire that such metallurgy innovations as the use of coke ovens and hot blasting were tested.  Industry in the region has developed rapidly.  Engineering, iron foundries were commissioned.  The working village, called Yuzovka, was growing.  And in 1917 he received the status of a city.  In the same year, a nitrogen plant was opened.  With the advent of Soviet power, the city was first renamed Stalin, and in 1961 it was given a new name - Donetsk. </p><h2>  Sights of Donetsk </h2><p>  Residents of the city in memory of the man who has done so much for the development of the region, erected in 2001 a monument to John Hughes.

    <p>  In December 2001, the Holy Iversky Monastery (Donetsk) was opened.  The white stone building with lush domes and a bell tower is surrounded by unique vegetation.  Some outlandish specimens were provided to the monastery by the Donetsk Botanical Garden.  In the building of the cathedral was an Orthodox shrine - a list of the Iveron Icon of the Mother of God, written on the legendary Mount Athos by the monk Janis.  Unfortunately, the monastery compound and buildings were badly damaged during the armed conflict in the Donbass. </p>

    <p>  In Donetsk there is a Muslim shrine - the Akhat-Jami mosque, which was opened in 1999.  Although the construction began much earlier than the Muslim community called the "Star of the Prophet."  It was the first mosque built in the Donbass.  After this, religious buildings appeared in other cities of the region.  By architecture, Akhat-Jami resembles some Muslim shrines of Istanbul.  This is a central, beige colored building with a dark dome.  On the sides are two graceful minarets directed at the sky. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
