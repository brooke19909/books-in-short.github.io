  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Singapore metro map: cost, tariffs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Singapore is a city and, at the same time, a state located on islands in Southeast Asia.  It represents an ultrahigh concentration of modern technological advances and is one of the largest Asian cities.  Everyone who has ever been to major cities knows very well about traffic jams on the roads.  That is why the metro is used here as the fastest, most convenient, safe and inexpensive mode of transport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top view of Singapore" class="if uuid-2271294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2271294.jpg"></div><p>  The Singapore Metro covers almost all residential areas of the city, as evidenced by a well-developed urban metro scheme.  The multi-kilometer length is not an obstacle to the movement of trains, but only, on the contrary, makes it diverse and interesting. </p><p>  In this article, we will introduce the reader to a detailed metro map of Singapore, the interior decoration of some stations and talk about the main types of electronic tickets. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of the Singapore Metro is not so great, because it appeared relatively recently.  The metro in Singapore is called Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), there is also the light metro Light Rapid Transit (LRT), located on the outskirts of the city.  The first MRT stations were opened in 1987, and the LRT stations in 1999.  At the time of the start of construction, the country's authorities doubted the profitability of the future metro, since the city had a fairly extensive bus network.  In the end, it was decided that bus routes were not enough for the development of the metropolis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Singapore metro map </h2><p>  The city metro is fully equipped with quality security and air conditioning systems.  The Singapore metro scheme has a unique clear structure that allows you to harmoniously distribute the load throughout the day.  Singapore is one of those cities where the metro directly starts at the airport.  Therefore, for many tourists who first arrived in Singapore, it will not be difficult to get to anywhere in the city </p><p>  On the streets of the city you can easily notice the Singapore Metro by a special yellow sign and the inscription MRT on the scoreboard.  To some extent, this designation will be unusual for residents of Moscow or St. Petersburg, for those who are used to recognizing the city metro by the red and blue logo. </p><p>  Singapore's metro scheme consists of four main lines, one adjacent branch and over 70 different stations.  Visually, metro lines are divided into green, purple, red and yellow.  Do not be scared if you notice an additional gray branch on the subway map - this is a light metro designation that is used in the city to further offload traffic. </p><p>  A separate Singapore metro scheme with tourist attractions can be provided by some local Russian-speaking guides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapsof.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro map" class="if uuid-2271279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2271279.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the car, all station names and other announcements are duplicated in English, Chinese and Indian.  Unfortunately, you can hardly find the Singapore metro map in Russian somewhere, but this is not particularly necessary, since the metro map is intuitively understandable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Metro cost </h2><p>  Any tourist who arrives in the country is interested in the issue of the cost of the local metro.  In Singapore, the price of underground transport services varies from 1.5 to 4 local dollars.  One-time trips are issued in the form of a plastic card, often many tourists think that they have issued a travel card for several trips, but this is an erroneous opinion.  The cost depends on the distance of your trip, you can also return part of the money spent for returning a plastic card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train in singapore" class="if uuid-2271286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2271286.jpg"></div><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  The best option for travelers is to purchase a full travel card.  Of course, this option costs a little more, but, on the other hand, you can save money on travel.  EZ-link and Singapore Tourist Pass cards apply to all public transport and help save up to 15% of the fare.  The ticket can be replenished at any time in specialized vending machines or Passenger Service kiosks. </p><h2>  Working hours </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Singapore Metro does not work around the clock, unlike New York.  But, nevertheless, his work schedule is quite intense.  On weekdays, the metro is open from 05:30 to 00:00, on weekends and holidays - from 06:00 to 00:00. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting that the subway in Singapore is a high-tech mode of transport.  All cars are clean and comfortable, and the train itself is automatically controlled without a driver.  An interesting feature of the local metro is the presence of elevators and toilets at each station.  In addition, local authorities equipped all stations with a special glass door that separates the waiting area from the tracks themselves, in order to maintain a microclimate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theindependent.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro inside" class="if uuid-2271318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2271318.jpg"></div><h2>  Wagons </h2><p>  As we already said, all the cars here are quite modern, but, surprisingly, there is no Wi-Fi inside.  The scheme of Singapore metro stations is presented inside each car, it is also possible to move freely throughout the train while the train is moving, since there are no walls separating the cars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="projectweekends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Singapore metro station" class="if uuid-2271338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2271338.jpg"></div><p>  All trains in Singapore are air-conditioned, so many tourists often complain about the low temperature.  Also, the metro has a number of rules that any visitor must comply with. </p><p>  The Singapore Metro prohibits: </p><ol><li>  To smoke. </li><li>  Carry flammable and explosive objects. </li><li>  Eat food. </li><li>  Carry Durian. <div class="photo google-map" data-lat="1.352083" data-lng="103.81983600000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/4/7/847.png"></div></li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Singapore Metro is many times superior to many European ones.  It can rightfully be considered one of the main attractions of this wonderful city-state.  Tropical landscapes are replaced by modern architecture, and all this is concentrated in Singapore alone. </p>
