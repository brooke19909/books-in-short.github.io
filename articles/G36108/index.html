    <h2>  Movenpick Resort Hurghada 5 *: 2015 reviews from Russian tourists </h2><p>  Many travelers experienced the need to carefully plan their trips abroad with all the care and attentiveness.  In particular, this concerns the issue of choosing a hotel in which you plan to spend several days, or even weeks.  Indeed, if you intend to live in a hotel operating in the ol inclusive format, you will most likely spend most of its time on its territory.  Therefore, her choice should be approached with special attention.  Invaluable help in this matter, according to many experienced tourists, is provided by studying the reviews of real people who have already visited this or that place.  After all, they try to communicate not only about the advantages, which in most cases are already obvious, but also mention the disadvantages that new guests may face.  Therefore, even at the planning stage of your trip, you can get a close-to-reality idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you during your vacation, thereby avoiding disappointments and negative emotions.  In order to save your time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots who vacationed at the Movenpick Resort Hurghada 5 * this year.  Reviews of the hotel are mostly positive, because almost all tourists were very pleased with their choice.  However, there were some shortcomings, but this is a completely normal situation for any hotel.  Well, now we offer to learn more about everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick resort hurghada 5 reviews" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1055881.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to tourists, almost all apartments in Movenpick Resort Hurghada 5 * (Egypt, Hurghada) are very spacious, bright, comfortable.  However, for many it became apparent that it was time to make repairs in them.  Perhaps next season the numbers will be updated.  And new guests will have the opportunity to stay in rooms with a fresh repair.  Otherwise, there were no complaints about the apartments.  So, from almost all rooms (with the exception of rooms located on the ground floor) a magnificent view of the sea opens.  The apartments themselves have everything you need for a comfortable stay: comfortable furniture (large beds, spacious wardrobes, etc.), a large flat-screen TV with five Russian-language channels, air conditioning, which you can adjust as you wish, a minibar, a hairdryer, a bathroom, Spacious furnished balcony or terrace.  As for the minibar, you can use it for a fee.  In general, travelers had no complaints about the operation of equipment in the rooms.  However, if something failed, the problem was quickly eliminated, it was only necessary to contact the administrator at the reception, describing the situation to him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick resort hurghada 5 reviews 2015" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1055880.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  This item also did not cause complaints from the guests.  According to them, the maids in the "Movenpic Resort" (Hurghada, Egypt) are doing their job well.  So, the quality of cleaning among tourists does not raise questions.  Moreover, it is completely independent of the fact whether you leave a tip or not.  However, it should be recognized that most vacationers preferred to thank the maids in this way for their work.  As for the towels, they are updated every day.  Bed linen is changed a couple of times a week.  Maids also replenish personal hygiene supplies in the bathroom as necessary.  If you find that you have forgotten to put something, you can either contact the cleaner, if you see him nearby, or the reception administrator.  In a matter of minutes, they will bring to your room the necessary. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this hotel has a checkout time, according to our compatriots, in most cases the administration does not adhere to this rule when settling new arrivals.  So, if you arrived at the hotel early in the morning, then most likely you will not be forced to wait two in the afternoon, but they will give you the room keys much earlier.  As for the day of departure, the occupied apartments should be vacated before noon.  However, if you plan to leave the hotel only in the evening, then you can try to agree on the possibility of extending your stay.  As tourists say, if we are talking about a couple of hours, then they may not take money from you.  If the extension is supposed to be longer, then you will have to pay extra for it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick resort ex continental resort 5 hurghada" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1055879.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, it is very green, beautiful, clean and well-groomed.  There are many picturesque trees, flowers, tall palm trees.  In a word, walking around the territory is a pleasure.  In addition, its relative compactness is a big plus, because guests do not have to spend a lot of time and effort moving between their rooms, the beach, pools and infrastructure. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This issue, according to many of our compatriots, is organized at a very worthy level in the hotel "Movenpic Resort" (Hurghada).  Of course, here you will not find delicacies, as in luxury hotels, but you can count on quality and varied food.  Main meals are held in the main restaurant, which is open in buffet style.  Here, visitors will be offered a variety of well-prepared dishes of meat, fish, poultry, soups, side dishes, snacks, sweets and fresh flavored pastries.  A big plus, according to tourists, is the fact that the dishes are constantly alternating.  So every time you can try something new. </p><p>  Travelers are advised to definitely visit the a-la-carte restaurants of this hotel.  Here you can choose your favorite dish from the menu.  There are two such restaurants in the "Movenpic Resort" - Italian and fish.  Prepare here, according to guests, just fine.

    <h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  Hotel guests who have paid all-inclusive meals can order all local drinks for free throughout the day.  If upon booking you chose the option ‚Äúhalf board‚Äù, then you will have to pay extra for them.  By the way, our compatriots note an interesting fact that during lunch and dinner in a restaurant you are in any case brought a bill for drinks.  If you rest according to the ‚Äúol inclusive‚Äù scheme, then the amount in it will be zero, but you still have to sign it.  In any case, this did not cause any difficulties for tourists. </p><p>  Drinks are available throughout the day at the lobby bar, as well as at the pool and beach bars.  Our compatriots were quite satisfied with their quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick resort hurghada 5 hurghada" class="if" height="482" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1055877.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  According to travelers, the Movenpick Resort Hurghada 5 * hotel offers its guests the opportunity to relax on the shores of the Red Sea.  So, almost all of our compatriots liked the private beach of the hotel complex.  Since the hotel is not very large, go to the coast from residential buildings to go very close.  The beach here is very spacious, fine sand, clean.  The entry into the water is gentle, smooth.  At the bottom is sand.  So here you can have a great rest even with young children.  On the beach there are sun loungers, sun umbrellas and special partitions that block tourists from the constantly blowing wind.  However, according to some guests, it is advisable to go ashore immediately after breakfast.  Otherwise, it may happen that you will not find a free sunbed.  Tourists urge the hotel to pay attention to this problem. </p><p>  The rest of the beach holiday guests were very pleased.  So, there is a bar and a snack bar where you can either treat yourself to your favorite drinks or have a snack during the day.  Holidaymakers especially liked the sea.  According to our compatriots, the water here has an amazing turquoise color.  Near the coast there is an artificial island, next to which is a coral reef.  It can be reached on a boat provided by the hotel in just five minutes.  True, the reef here is not as luxurious as the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh, but there is something to see here.  Therefore, when packing your suitcases, do not forget to grab a snorkeling mask and fins.  By the way, you can buy them both in Hurghada itself, and in the little shop at the hotel. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  As travelers note in their comments, the Movenpick Resort Hurghada 5 * hotel, photos of which can be seen in this article, offers guests a lot of opportunities for spending leisure time.
