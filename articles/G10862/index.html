Houses, wells, palaces, but a mill, a wheel, a tower ... But it is unusual that all this is made of matches. </p><h2>  Crafts from matches </h2><p>  This lesson is not expensive.  No need to purchase any special devices.  In addition, the material itself is inexpensive.  A few boxes, desire and free time, and crafts from matches without glue will become the original decoration of the room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crafts from matches without glue" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1072354.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  The technique for making such crafts is quite simple.  Having mastered it, you can first make simple models, and then proceed to create real masterpieces. </p><p>  Without significant costs, you can make interesting items.  And if you take into account the material of the craft itself, then in a hundred years you can sell these matches as rare. </p><h2>  Match House </h2><p>  First you need to master simple <span>crafts from matches for beginners.</span>  A matchstick house without glue will be a prime example of such work. </p><p>  The work is carried out by means of general fasteners.  It will take a few boxes. </p><p>  The cube hut will consist of eight matches at the base.  They are laid out perpendicularly at the same distance on two main parallel matches.  This is the first row of the flooring, on it we perpendicularly lay out the second row. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the third row, we begin the creation of a well: we place two matches perpendicularly, two matches in parallel, while the heads of each pair are turned in different directions.  Next, we need to make six more such rows.  On the last row of the well we again lay out a flooring of eight pieces. </p><p>  In the next row we place six matches perpendicularly.  Put a coin in the middle, use it to hold the structure with your finger and fasten it with the help of matches, which must be inserted vertically into the corners of the grate. </p><p>  We build a house of matches without glue on.  Now we take twenty pieces and carefully, heads up, along the perimeter we insert them into cells of five on each side.  Now you can pick up the house.  If everything is done correctly, it should not fall apart.  The walls must be compressed to make the structure stronger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="We build a house of matches without glue" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1072227.jpg" width="264"></div>

    <p>  We turn the house upside down and make the walls, inserting matches into the cells, then lay out the horizontal layer, alternating the heads and ends.  Then crimp the design again. </p><p>  At the last stage, we form the roof.  In the corners of the house we insert up to half four matches.  We raise the lateral verticals to their level.  Now we put the roof matches perpendicular to the upper deck.  We start with two, we add two, too.  To form the roof, we put it over the match with the heads towards the center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such a house will be the basis of all the crafts, which we will talk about later. </p><h2>  Different ideas for crafts from matches </h2><p>  And now let's see what <span>crafts from matches with their own hands</span> without glue can be done. </p><p>  The best crafts for beginners are a variety of houses and wells.  They are performed according to the previous scheme.  You can decorate them with windows, balconies, chimneys, drawings on the walls. </p><p>  An example of crafts made from matches without glue can be a well with a bucket.  For its manufacture we take a whole box, a skewer for canapes and a case from shoe covers. </p><p>  First we build a well (a house without a roof).  With a souvenir skewer we pierce the wall of the matchbox, which will also imitate a shop.  Install next to the well.  We hang the case from shoe covers on a thread to the handle of the skewer.  Optionally, you can install a bucket on a bench. </p><p>  However, there are many options for making a well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Matches for beginners" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1072826.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <p>  The Wheel is another example of a scheme without glue.  Matches master classes from matches often tell how to do this job.  This is a very serious occupation. </p><p>  First you need to complete the drawing.  On the cover of an unwanted book, draw a circle with a radius of 39 mm.  Starting from the zero point, we postpone serifs of 34 mm.  Get a heptagon, the sides of which are divided in half, we get 14 sectors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crafts from matches.

    <p>  At the points marked around the circumference, make a hole with a nail, insert matches there.  Between them we lay bearing matches.  Each next goes on top of the previous one.  At the end of each round we slip the last match under the first.  Thus, we spread four more rows.  Then carefully remove - and the wheel is ready. </p><p>  If you use skewers instead of supporting matches, you get a glass for pencils and pens.  In this case, it does not need to be removed from the base.  The bottom can be made wider (for stability) and decorated at your discretion. </p><h2>  Crafts from matches: schemes </h2><p>  When making crafts from matches without glue, they usually use a pattern.  It must be carefully studied so that during work there are no questions and does not have to redo anything.  Schemes, as a rule, contain step-by-step instructions.  At each stage, it is important to use the right amount of material correctly. </p><p>  When performing complex work, preliminary calculations are first carried out and drawings are made, according to which the creative process will go further.  The better the preparation is done, the more accurate the work will be. </p><p>  Using the basic scheme, you can add your own elements to the work on the craft.  This is possible in the case when the technique of working on crafts from matches is well mastered. </p><p>  Over time, you can learn how to craft a variety of crafts from matches: the best ideas and schemes will allow you to create real masterpieces, subject to all the requirements of the work. </p><h2>  Crafts from matches: instruction </h2><p>  If you decide to start making crafts from matches, instructions and diagrams that accompany the work will help you. </p><p>  The manual describes in detail what material and in what quantity will be needed, and which tools should also be prepared for work. </p><p>  Many crafts will look better if you pick up the same matchless match.  Therefore, the instructions also often contain advice on sorting them. </p><p>  To save work, it can be varnished.  So it does not darken and does not decay. </p><h2>  It is interesting </h2><p>  Match <span>drilling platform</span> .  This is an example of the largest crafts from matches without glue in load-bearing structures at the moment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY craft matches without glue" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39896/1076169.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Manufactured by her former oilman.  This is a copy of the rig on which he worked himself.  About 4,000,000 matches took to create it.  The work lasted 15 years.  At first, the rig was erected at home, but then the author moved it to the garage, where it shows everyone. </p>
