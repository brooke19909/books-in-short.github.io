    <p>  At the end of the distant 19th century, a doctor from Germany by the name of Ertel patented a method of therapy using therapeutic walks in slow motion.  According to his assumptions, this type of physical activity should contribute to a speedy cure for cardiovascular diseases, and also have a general strengthening effect.  Over time, this method took root among people and was called terrenkur. </p><h2>  Water and walking are the key to health </h2>
