    <h2>  Interesting places nearby </h2><p>  Any vacation, even a passive beach, should include elements of a cultural and entertainment program.  Excursions, shopping and independent walks in the program should be.  In the reviews, many note that the hotel has small shops with traditional souvenirs and various trifles, but the choice is small, so it makes sense to go to the city.  Basically, representatives of tour operators at the 5 * Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa hotel with pleasure and free of charge offer a convenient and comfortable transfer to the most famous and old markets, as well as to popular souvenir shops and boutiques. </p><p>  Of the nearby attractions, three are worth mentioning.  Firstly, the ancient temple of Apollo.  It was erected by the Greeks in the second century BC.  e.  and suffered significantly after 700 years during the earthquake.  Now the eyes of the viewer appear ruins.  The charm of the place from this does not lose, but, on the contrary, attracts to itself.  This place is especially beautiful at sunset time, when a snow-white stone begins to contrast, and coolness descends on the city. </p><p>  Almost every tourist, leaving a review of the Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel, does not forget to mention such a wonderful place as the Greek amphitheater, located near the first attraction.  Well-preserved ruins should be explored not only from the outside, but also from the inside, although the entrance there is paid, but the fee is purely symbolic, given the status and age of this building. </p><p>  And thirdly, it is worth mentioning the Sealanya water park, where everyone can spend time in the company of the inhabitants of the water world, including the good, very smart dolphins.  The incomparable pleasure of communicating with them will remain in memory forever. </p><h2>  Hotel Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  The beach is an important component of a pleasant stay.  Turkey, including Alanya, is a favorite vacation spot of our compatriots, every year thousands of tourists flock to this beautiful and hospitable country.  The experience of the army of fans of the all-inclusive system does not allow to doubt the truth of the ratings that they give the hotel, in particular the beach.  In all avenues, and in travel agencies, as many admit, they will tell you about a wonderful place, equipped and accessible.  In fact, the lion's share of the guests of the 5 * Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa hotel is outraged by this frank cunning from the administration of the complex.  According to them, there is a beach, but it is far from sandy, but with large pebbles and a poor approach to the sea, so it is recommended to use special shoes to protect against coral.  I was only pleased with the pier in the form of a trident, from which you can and should bathe.  Here are just umbrellas and sunbeds should be taken early, otherwise you risk being left without a good place. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is new, from the foundation to the last nail in the casing, tourists talk about some sloppy staff.  Settlement is quick, but the higher the floor of the room or the better the location of the windows, the greater the additional payment.  She, according to the guests, does not justify herself.  Many faced poor housekeeping when there were clearly signs of the presence of previous guests.  However, after contacting the administration, all the shortcomings are corrected quickly enough. </p><p>  We can say that Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa 5 * received very mixed reviews from tourists.  And if the first half of the guests sees numerous disadvantages, the second is ready to forgive them for the quick service and good location of the complex, clear sea and excellent infrastructure.  In contrast to the first opinion, it is said about new furniture and good furnishings of rooms, good plumbing.  Perhaps everything is not going smoothly in every apartment, which is why the impressions are contradictory. </p><p>  <span>The work of animators</span> (adults and children) is rated very well.  They note their wonderful mood, sociability and ability to cheer up.  They are pleased to hold various contests and show programs, both on their own and with the involvement of other teams.  In their reviews, vacationers also recommend using the excursion programs offered at the 5 * Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa, including sea ones (fishing, diving, etc.). </p>

    <p>  In this matter, tourists from Russia and the CIS countries for the most part have come to a common opinion.  They rate the kitchen and the service of the ultra all-inclusive system at a maximum of four, but certainly not at the stated five stars in the title.  According to the acknowledgment of many, the hotel, although it offered guests a wide selection, but there were no special frills on the tables.  It was delicious, variety was average, but no one was going to be hungry. </p><p> These are the diverse and not always unambiguous deserved hotel Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa 5 * reviews.  Turkey serves just a crazy flow of tourists, especially in the summer season, the hot season of long-awaited vacations.  Perhaps this affects in some places and the <span>quality of service.</span>  However, as many of those who visited this resort complex note, everything as a whole depends solely on the general mood, and if you do not allow yourself to notice some annoying little things, then you will spend your vacation perfectly. </p>
