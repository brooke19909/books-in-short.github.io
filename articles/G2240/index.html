Sooner or later, every young mother who cares about the healthy nutrition of her baby faces this difficult question.  To date, nutritionists have not yet reached a consensus on the benefits or harms of this substance.  However, before making your own opinion about gluten, let's first decide what it is. </p><p>  Gluten free: what is it? </p><p>  Gluten, or gluten, is a <span>plant protein</span> that can be obtained from the shells of cereal plants.  Gluten in its pure form is a grayish, tasteless, sticky mass of gray.  It is formed by a mixture of two <span>types of proteins:</span> glutenin and gliadin. </p><p>  Especially a lot of it is found in grains of oats, rye or wheat.  For example, wheat is 80% gluten-free. </p><p>  Gluten content is the main indicator that determines the <span>quality of flour:</span> the higher its content, the more elastic the dough will turn out.  Moreover, gluten is a natural preservative that significantly extends the life of bakery products. </p><p>  Now, having figured out the answer to the question of what gluten is, we can talk about the benefits and harms of products that contain this substance. </p><p>  The thing is that for an absolutely healthy person, gluten does not pose any danger.  However, in a small child (especially under the age of 6 months), various unpleasant consequences can occur due to the use of <span>gluten products</span> .  This protein is poorly processed by the body, therefore, allergic reactions often occur, incorrect intestinal motility, as well as changes in stool. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, the likelihood of diseases such as atopic dermatitis, diabetes mellitus or bronchial asthma is significantly increased.  In about 1% of cases, celiac disease or individual intolerance to plant gluten is manifested. </p><p>  Gluten is found in foods such as pearl barley, barley, oatmeal, wheat and semolina, pasta, pastries and bread, so to avoid problems with the digestion of babies before ten months of age, it is better not to feed them. </p><p>  Please note that even some meat and dairy products may contain gluten.  This is especially true for yogurts, sausages, as well as sauces - mayonnaise and ketchup. </p><p>  Moreover, if the baby is mainly breastfed, the mother can eat the above products without fear. </p><p>  Knowing what gluten is, you can choose for yourself and your baby a complete diet that will not harm your health. </p><p>  Gluten free porridge from millet, corn grits or rice. </p><p>  However, ‚Äúgluten traces‚Äù can be found in rice, as it is often processed using universal equipment designed to process a wide range of cereals. </p><p>  As a result, many, having studied the topic of what gluten is, completely excluded it from their diet.  The so-called <span>gluten</span> - <span>free diets are</span> becoming increasingly popular <span>.</span>  But it is worth paying attention to the fact that they are not suitable for everyone.  With limited use of cereal crops, the required amount of fiber necessary to maintain normal functioning does not enter the body. </p><p>  But what about patients who cannot tolerate gluten?  They can eat legumes, fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, as well as dairy products.  Do not limit yourself to sweets, since marshmallows, marmalade and chocolate also do not contain gluten.  If this substance is present in them, this must be indicated by the manufacturer on the package. </p><p>  Today on the market you can find foreign <span>products without gluten.</span>  Some of the domestic manufacturers also produce them, but so far they are very few. </p>
