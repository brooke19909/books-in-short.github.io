    <h2>  Difficult fate </h2><p>  For centuries, Crimea has been not only a favorite place for rest of powerful rulers, but also a kind of apple of discord, a tidbit.  From hunters to him there was no end.  He was a bridgehead for wars and changed hands repeatedly.  Cape Chersonese because of its location, since ancient times developed infrastructure and natural beauties has more than once become the arena on which the main events unfolded.  It extends into the Black Sea, which is why it is of strategic importance.  Of course, the conquerors of all time could not fail to be seduced by its beauty and convenient location.  He survived more than one change of power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city on the cape was founded in hoary antiquity by the ancient Greeks.  As early as the 5th century BC, the first buildings began to be laid here.  The big names of many great rulers are connected with the city on the cape.  This is King Mithridates, Emperor <span>Gaius Julius Caesar,</span> Prince Vladimir.  The name "Chersonesos" is translated from Greek as "peninsula."  His definition of "Tauride" means that he was on the land of Tauris.  The entire southern coast of Crimea in ancient times was called Taurica.  Old Russian chroniclers called this place Korsun. </p>

    <h2>  What are the ruins hidden? </h2><p>  Cape Khersones (Sevastopol) attracts not only tourists, but also scientists.  Archaeologists have been conducting prospecting work here for almost two hundred years.  <span>Tauric Chersonese</span> Reserve today is one of the most studied ancient cities.  The ruins of the city still have not revealed all their secrets.  They keep the secrets of many eras and are in no hurry to share them with people. </p><p>  Scientists know that Chersonesos was a city-state with a developed infrastructure.  He experienced his heyday in the period from IV to II century BC.  e.  Excavations and ancient chronicles indicate that in those days the slave system reigned there, however, the form of government was democratic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ruins keep traces of the Scythian culture.  Countless hordes of steppes descended there in the II century BC.  e.  The townspeople were forced to ask for help from the powerful king Mithridates VI Eupator.  The Scythians retreated, but the city lost its independence.  Then the policy became part of the Roman Empire and finally lost both independence and democracy.  History buffs seek to see Cape Chersonese not only for its beautiful nature, but also for antiquities. </p>

    <h2>  Outpost of Christianity </h2><p>  Beckon these places and pilgrims.  Christianity infiltrated Chersonesos in the 4th century.  Through the efforts of the holy bishops, the diocese was immediately founded here, the center of which was Cape Chersonese.  Archaeological finds dating back to the same time are often associated with Christian symbols: gravestones with epitaphs, body crosses, fragments of murals.  Especially many temples were built in the V century.  This is due to the intention of Emperor Justinian I to unite the whole vast country with the help of a single religion.  The first Christians were forced to hide in caves, but subsequently such a need disappeared.  Archaeologists have established that almost every district of the ancient city had its own temple. </p><p>  Visiting Cape Chersonese, the pilgrims go to the cave temple-mausoleum, the Six-pillared temple, the arched temple, the memorial of Our Lady of Vlachen, St. Vladimir Cathedral.  The Cruze Basilica is one of the oldest religious buildings in the city.  Nowadays, only ruins remain from it, past which many excursion routes pass.  On Cape Chersonese are the ruins of several ancient basilicas built in the early and middle Middle Ages. </p>

    <h2>  Echo of war </h2><p>  Keep these places and the memory of the tragic events of World War II.  You can visit the panorama "Defense of Sevastopol", take a walk around the Great Patriotic War Museum, go down to the catacombs, which once housed submarine repair shops.  Cape Chersonese has repeatedly become a film set.  In its vicinity, some scenes were shot of the sensational painting ‚ÄúThe Battle of Sevastopol‚Äù, which is dedicated to one of the milestones of the history of the region. </p><h2>  Nature reserve </h2><p>  Tauric Chersonesos in 1994 received the status of a national reserve.  Today it is a large-scale research center, which consists of many departments and expositions.  The main historical monument is the ancient settlement of Chersonesos, located on the cape.  On its territory there are the following objects that so attract tourists: </p><ul><li>  The central square of Chersonesos, which was laid during the construction of the city.  She retained her functions throughout the history of the city.  Temples were built on it at different times: first, antique, then Christian.  Currently, the majestic Vladimir Cathedral rises in the central square, which was restored on the site of the destroyed predecessor of the 19th century. </li><li>  Antique Chersonesos Theater.  It is unique in its kind.  It has no analogues in the CIS.  The beginning of construction dates back to the 3rd and 4th centuries.  The theater hosted public gatherings, festivities, and gladiatorial fights.  With the advent of Christianity, it lost its significance, was ruined and built up. </li><li>  The basilica in the basilica is famous for the fact that a new one was erected on the ruins of an ancient sanctuary.  In 2007 she was desecrated by vandals.  Several ancient columns are hopelessly destroyed. </li><li>  Zeno Tower, built in honor of the emperor. </li><li>  The ruins of the defensive city walls that in ancient times defended Cape Chersonese.  Photos of these ancient ruins are famous all over the world. </li></ul><p>  Most excursions are paid.  The cost depends on the scope of services of the guide, the duration and, of course, on the exhibits themselves.  100-250 rubles - the average price of a ticket for which you can visit one of the places that Cape Khersones is famous for.  Reviews of tourists convince that on the territory you will find stalls where you can buy souvenirs, choose local goodies for a snack, and top up your mobile account. </p>
