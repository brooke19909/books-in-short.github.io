  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phone BQ: reviews. Small phones BQ: photos, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years, mobile phone manufacturers have been struggling in the pursuit of gigahertz, megapixels, inches, gigabytes and sensors.  Most companies have ceased to produce simple and understandable button devices.  They switched completely to touch screens with just a few of the same keys.  And BQ produces button devices that are great for both children and the elderly.  The BQ phone is convenient to use as a worker.  Including due to the use of up to four SIM cards in it.  Let us consider in comparison two apparatuses brought to our country from China. </p><h2>  Options and specifications of the BQ BQM-2855 Washington and BQ BQM-2456 Orlando </h2><p>  Both phones contain headphones, a charger and instructions.  The first one has a classic case, support for two SIM cards, a resolution of 240 x320, a 2.8 "screen, a 0.1 MP camera, a 3000 mAh battery, Bluetooth and a microSD slot. The second differs from it only in a 2.4" screen and a battery for 1500 mAh  The appearance of both models is quite normal, except that plastic used for Orlando has bright colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq phone" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/604055.jpg" width="458"></div>  It has no buttons on the sides, and on top are holes for a lace and a diode flashlight.  There is a camera eye and speaker slots on the back, and miniUSB and a microphone hole on the bottom.  Under the back cover is a microSD slot and two full-size SIM card slots.  Washington has the same thing.  As we can see, small BQ phones are very reminiscent of the first mobile phones and differ only in the ability to use two SIM cards and additional memory.

In this regard, almost any BQ phone receives not the best reviews.  Many devices do not see such cards.  For example, there were cases that Orlando did not see 256 MB of memory, but without problems recognized 16 GB.  But the phone BQ BQM-2855 Washington - on the contrary.  Nobody expects anything worthwhile from such devices in the multimedia plan, except for a bmp-picture and amr / wav-melody. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone bq reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/605254.jpg" width="246"></div>  In this regard, buyers were surprised that their devices coped with jpg pictures and mp3 tunes.  Of course, the sound is not perfect at all, but you can listen to it as an alarm clock, call or in transport on the way to work.  The cameras are the same, the photos are similar, it‚Äôs just not clear why they are installed there at all.  What quality can a 0.1 megapixel device have?  Here are flashlights, which, quite unexpectedly, shine brightly enough.  Batteries, also worthy, are worth the money.  Orlando will have to be charged once a week, Washington - not more than once every two weeks.

    <h2>  System, contacts, SMS, applications </h2><p>  Management and interface are familiar and standard, we are well used to such in the old days.  And how does it work when we use a BQ phone?  Reviews say that far from the best way.  Even when dialing a number or SMS, wandering around a menu or searching for a contact, the menu often freezes.  T9 is absent, and typing sometimes turns into a painful procedure.  With contacts, everything seems to be normal at first, but then it turns out that, as they say, it did not do without a fly in the ointment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="small bq phones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/604051.jpg" width="375"></div>  The length of the name can consist of a maximum of ten characters, that is, say, Alexander Gavrilchenko, does not fit.  Nobody has managed to use the ‚ÄúE-book‚Äù function yet.  It opens neither xml, nor fb2, nor docx, nor txt.  Of the games you can only use the built-in.  Some disadvantages can be eliminated by updating the firmware, but for this you need to contact the service center.

You will not find anything better for such "funny" money.  It is not necessary to choose from the presented models, BQ has released a wide range of phones, calling them the names of different cities.  In addition, pay attention to their life without recharging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phones bq" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/604056.jpg" width="214"></div>  And this at the following cost: Washington - 1650 rubles, Orlando - 990. So if you are interested in a device with a powerful battery, choose the first model, if compactness and design - the second.  These BQ cell phones will live up to your expectations.

    <h2>  BQ Mexico - phone with four SIM cards </h2><p>  Consider another small Chinese mobile phone, the feature of which is the ability to work with four SIM cards.  It is useful for those who want to use separate numbers for accessing the Internet, working calls, personal conversations, communicating with relatives and friends abroad.  If this is about you, then the BQ phone is what you need.  In this regard, he has the only drawback - the presence of only one radio module.  This is a classic <span>mobile push-button phone,</span> it does not have Android OS installed, and it does not have a touch screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone bq" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/604054.jpg" width="600"></div>  The usual so-called dialer.  Resolution - 240 √ó 320 pixels, display - 2.4 ‚Ä≥.  However, it has an FM receiver, an MP3 player and a Bluetooth module.  The camera is slightly better than previous models - 0.3 megapixels.  Supports memory cards up to 32 GB microSD format.  The battery is not too powerful, has a capacity of only 800 mAh, provides a seven-hour continuous conversation.  Dimensions - 117 √ó 47 √ó 14 mm, weight - 78 grams.  There is a mobile phone BQ Mexico - 1350 rubles.  Available in three colors - brown, black and blue.

    <h2>  BQ Phone: Customer Reviews </h2><p>  As for the reviews on the products of the Chinese manufacturer, the buyers, for example, of the small BQ BQM-1402 Lyon phone are generally satisfied with their choice.  Two SIM cards, good connection, very loud speaker.  You can use it as an MP player by downloading music to a flash card.  Also a good battery that holds a charge of about five days with average use.  A couple of small flaws: a weak camera and the lack of a headphone jack.  I have to use an adapter.  This phone is available in different colors, the price is 1300 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq small phone" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/605245.jpg" width="482"></div>  But the smartphone BQ S-4003 Verona, the price of which is 2500 rubles, disappointed many buyers, despite its two cores, a touch screen and a camera with flash.  Literally on the day of purchase, many of these devices stopped responding to touch of fingers.  And nothing helped.  Customers as a result took them back to the store.  So remember, when buying cheap phones: the probability of running into low-quality devices is much greater than in the case of well-proven and well-known brands.
