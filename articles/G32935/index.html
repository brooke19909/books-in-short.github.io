    <p>  The cozy La Vaiencia Beach Resort is located in the northern part of Goa, almost on the coast - you can reach <span>Morjim Beach</span> in a few minutes.  <span>Dabolim International Airport</span> is about 62 km away.  But do not worry about this, as the hotel offers a shuttle service to its customers. </p><p>  It’s worth mentioning right away that the hotel is quite small - it covers an area of ​​1200 square meters and consists of two two-story buildings built in an interesting coastal style.  The hotel opened its doors for tourists not so long ago, namely in 2005.  The last thorough repair was carried out in 2010, so the hotel is well equipped and equipped with all necessary modern equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel La Vaiencia Beach Resort: photo and description of rooms </h2>
