Reviews of him as a beach resort make you pay attention to this place.  But we will tell you more about everything in our article. </p><h2>  A little about Dzhemete </h2><p>  Positive reviews about Dzhemete in Anapa probably inspired many to visit this cute corner of the domestic resort.  The village should be considered exclusively as a place for a wonderful beach holiday.  In general, according to reviews, the village of Dzhemete (Anapa) is a youth and family resort.  Here there is a fairly large selection of <span>pensions, resorts, hotels</span> and housing in the private sector.  In principle, tourists have the opportunity to choose the suitable option for their holidays in Dzhemete (Anapa), the reviews confirm this. </p><p>  Conducting a conversation about the village, it is worth mentioning that at present the infrastructure is already well developed in it, so vacationers will always find where to go and what to do.

And a taxi can deliver you to the resting place. </p><h2>  Pension Dzhemete (Anapa) </h2><p>  Pension "Dzhemete" (Anapa) - and reviews confirm this - is located on the first line of the famous Pioneer Avenue.  Its territory occupies about five hectares.  It has four-story buildings with rooms of different categories.  The hotel's park area is an ideal place to relax. </p><p>  Three meals a day in the form of a buffet are organized for tourists.  On the territory there are two pools for children and adults.  A playground is equipped for the smallest, a playroom with a tutor works. </p><p>  Near the boarding house operates a water park "Tik-Tak", nearby there are restaurants and cafes.  Reviews about the pension "Dzhemete" (Anapa) suggest that the institution is focused on family vacations with children of any age.  For this, all conditions are created. </p><p>  The territory of the complex is surrounded by coniferous and deciduous trees and is equipped with flower beds.  Near each building there are benches for rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pension dzhemete anapa reviews" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1990275.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel always has a representative of a travel company offering to make exciting trips to local attractions. </p><h2>  Hotel Dzhemete (Anapa): reviews </h2><p>  Taking into account the reviews of vacationers in 2017, we can draw some conclusions.  Hotel "Jamete", as before, pleases with its beautiful and green territory.  It is good to relax with children.  Letting go for a walk on the street, you can not worry, because the territory is closed.  The road to the sea passes through a neighboring sanatorium.  The beach is very nice and beautiful, swimming is just a pleasure. </p><p>  But regarding the number of tourists have a lot of complaints.  The number of rooms is in need of repair.  All apartments have a problem either with the plumbing, or with air conditioning or furniture.  Water does not always reach the top floor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa Dzhemete Holiday Reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1990283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Regular guests of the hotel note that the situation with food has changed.  Last year, the range of dishes on the tables was much more diverse.  Of course, you will not stay hungry, but you could take food more seriously, since the boarding house is crowded with children.  Holidays in it are chosen precisely by couples with kids. </p><p>  But children's and adult animations are worthy of praise.  Children play games and competitions throughout the day.  Animators arrange events on the beach.  In general, the pension is very attractive and has many advantages, but the number of rooms and meals spoil the whole impression. </p><h2>  Pioneer Avenue </h2><p>  Discussing reviews of Dzhemete (Anapa), it is worth recalling the main attraction of the resort, which is known to all tourists - this is Pioneer Avenue.  It is considered the longest street of Anapa.  Avenue begins at the Anapka River and stretches along the coast.  It built a considerable number of boarding houses, sanatoriums.  Most of them have been here since Soviet times.  The name of the street was due to the fact that the first on it began to build pioneer camps.  Since then, the prospectus has not changed its name.  It runs along a long beach with a length of about ten kilometers, for the sake of which tourists come here.  In recent decades, the number of hotels on Pionersky Prospekt has increased significantly.  Especially a lot of mini-establishments of the so-called private sector were built in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe towns of Vityazevo and Dzhemete. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anapa dzhemete guest houses reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1990285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The avenue runs along the coast and divides the coastline into first and second.  An interesting fact is that the beach is much wider precisely in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe avenue than in the center of the resort.  Reviews of vacationers about Anapa and Dzhamet one way or another are always connected with Pioneer Avenue, because an incredible number of hotels, hotels and pensions for every taste and budget are concentrated here. </p><h2>  Park Hotel "Cote d'Azur" </h2><p>  Good reviews about the Cote d'Azur Park Hotel (Anapa, Dzhemete) gives reason to include the institution in the list of possible places for recreation.  The complex is located on Pioneer Avenue, on the first line from the sea.  The hotel has its own beach, which is located next to the territory.  From the farthest building to the coast, the distance does not exceed 50 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel dzhemete g anapa reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1990288.jpg" width="600"></div>

Young tourists are so passionate about games that parents have the opportunity to relax and rest.  The hotel complex is focused on family vacations, so a lot of children always rest in it. </p><h2>  Anapa Lazurnaya </h2><p>  Good reviews of Anapa Lazurnaya in Dzhemete give reason to recommend it as one of the worthy options.

    <p>  In addition, the administration of the boarding house provides an opportunity for a fee to take a rehabilitation course at the neighboring health resort "Rodnik". </p><p>  There is a playground, swings and horizontal bars for the kids.  Guests are offered three meals a day in the restaurant of the complex. </p><h2>  Reviews for the boarding house "Anapa Lazurnaya" </h2><p>  Tourists recommend this guesthouse as a great place to relax.  The complex has a beautiful and green area with flower beds, hammocks, swings, fountains and relaxation areas.  The territory of the boarding house is closed, strangers are not allowed here.  Very nice beautiful clean pool.  The number of rooms is new and equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The dining room boarding house operates in three shifts, which is very convenient.  You can sleep longer.  The food is quite good and suitable for children.  Well, such a close proximity to the sea is the main plus of the establishment.  The boarding house staff is attentive and helpful, so the complex leaves the most pleasant experience. </p><h2>  Guest houses </h2><p>  Speaking about resort hotels, it is worth mentioning another incredibly popular option of accommodation, like guest houses in Dzhemete (Anapa).  Reviews about them are really very good, especially since the choice of such establishments is great.  Among them, many are all on the same Pioneer Avenue.  The private sector offers a variety of accommodation options from modern new apartments to modest rooms.  We will give just a few examples.  In fact, the number of mini-hotels in Jamet allows you to find rooms for every taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cote d'azur anapa jamete reviews" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1990310.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The guest house ‚ÄúProspect‚Äù, ‚ÄúFortuna‚Äù, ‚ÄúThree Sons‚Äù, ‚ÄúBaron Diana‚Äù, ‚ÄúTatyana‚Äù offer a good selection of rooms for living.  The advantage of guest houses is the presence in the courtyard of a shared kitchen, and sometimes in the rooms themselves.  This makes it possible for vacationers to cook on their own.  But at the same time, as a rule, the hosts offer the possibility of three meals a day. </p><p>  Rest in guest houses has its pros and cons.  The disadvantages include the small size of the rooms, a large crowd of people in a relatively small space, and a high level of audibility.  In such places, relaxation is unlikely to succeed.  It‚Äôs not for nothing that the spa people themselves call such places ‚Äúanthills‚Äù.  Nevertheless, many tourists are satisfied with their holidays in the private sector in Dzhemete.  But they recommend not to agree to the first available option, but to review at least a few, because living conditions can vary greatly. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews in Dzhemete </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, it is worth discussing the reviews about the village of Dzhemete (Anapa).  According to tourists, the resort is incredibly convenient for families with children, because there is a very shallow sea, which warms up quickly and makes it possible for kids to flounder in the water.  To some extent, Jamet is a little calmer than in the center of Anapa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="n jamete anapa reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1990322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, do not hope that the beach will be free and comfortable.  The local coast is pretty busy with tourists.  There are always a lot of people here.  Of course, as in any resort, there are a lot of water activities and other beach services.  The coast is equipped with sunbeds and changing rooms.  In general, the beach itself is very good.  However, in August, algae appear in the sea, there are a lot of them and, of course, they spoil the impression. </p><h2>  Benefits of a children's resort </h2><p>  As for Dzhemete itself, the village is a good alternative to larger resort towns.  The infrastructure is well developed here.  There are all kinds of entertainment, including a water park and a dolphinarium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anapa azure dzhemete reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1990320.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  An indisputable advantage is the proximity of Anapa, which makes it possible at any time by minibus to go to the resort center.  However, it is worth emphasizing that Dzhemete is a great place for a family vacation with children, but active young people may need to choose something else. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you plan to go on vacation to one of the domestic resorts with your child, then the village of Dzhemete near Anapapa can be a great place.  A shallow warm sea, good infrastructure and sun - all this awaits you on the coast of Dzhemete. </p>
