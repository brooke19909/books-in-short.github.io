Although this technology was not initially supported by this mobile device, there is still the possibility of making various contactless payments using such a smartphone.  It is precisely the use of such a mobile device that this small review will be devoted to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple pay on iphone 5s" class="if uuid-3102954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3102954.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Features </h2><p>  This smartphone was introduced in 2015.  In terms of design and screen diagonal, which was equal to 4 ‚Äù, it did not differ significantly from previous models of the same manufacturer.  The size of RAM in it was equal to only 1 GB.  But the capacity of the integrated storage could be 16 GB, and 32 GB, and even 64 GB. </p><p>  The first significant innovation in the device was a microprocessor.  His model is A7.  This chip included two blocks for performing calculations, each of which could increase the clock frequency to 1.3 GHz.  Another important feature of the smartphone was a fingerprint sensor, which was integrated into the main control button. </p><p>  The list of wireless communications of the mobile device is quite large, but there is no NFC transmitter in it.  Therefore, the answer to whether there is Apple Pay on the iPhone 5S without additional technical means will be negative.  But this limitation can be circumvented.  It is enough to separately buy any modification of smart watches of the same manufacturer and connect them to a smartphone.  Such a device already has a built-in NFC transmitter and this allows it to carry out transactions with purchases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="appleinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple drink" class="if uuid-3102955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3102955.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment system.  Her features </h2><p>  The Apple Pay payment system was introduced in 2014 and received full support only in the next generation of smartphones after the iPhone 5s.  That is, an electronic component such as NFC was added to them.  It can be found for the first time on iPhone Se, 6 and 6 Plus mobile devices.  Therefore, initially, as was previously noted, it is impossible to use Apple Pay on the iPhone 5S.  But with the advent of devices such as the Apple Watch, this survey resolved safely. </p><p>  The concept that underlies this wireless payment system is that the user's smartphone has an appropriate transmitter and a program is installed.  Supported cards have been added to the latter.  Then, in the store at the checkout, the owner activates his mobile device and confirms the sending of funds to another account.  The transaction takes place instantly and this method is more convenient than, for example, paying for a purchase using cash or a plastic card. </p><p>  A lot of time has passed since the presentation of this payment system.  During this period, she managed to gain popularity and receive multinational support.  One can speak with full confidence that the future lies with her. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.computerworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is there an apple pay on iphone 5s" class="if uuid-3102956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3102956.jpg"></div><h2>  Set up a device for making payments </h2><p>  Now you need to figure out how to install Apple Pay on the iPhone 5S.  Again, there is no need to install it on a smartphone for the reason that it does not have an NFC transmitter.  Therefore, you need to buy any modification of smart watches from the same manufacturer as your mobile device, Apple Watch.  Even their first version is equipped with the necessary type of transmitter. </p><p>  The next important step is software installation.  First, install the Apple Watch program.  Then using it we connect the smartwatch to the smartphone.  After establishing a connection, open the tab in the application of the first device in the interface of the second. </p><p>  Next, in the software part of the watch, you need to add the Wallet application.  After completing its installation, you need to add a payment card to the menu and send information about it for confirmation to a financial institution.  If necessary, bank specialists can request clarifying data.  To do this, they will contact the owner of the smartphone.  After that, the card will be added to the Wallet application menu, and from that moment it will be possible to pay for purchases wirelessly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to install apple pay on iphone 5s" class="if uuid-3102957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3102957.jpg"></div><h2>  Order of use </h2><p>  Next, you need to find out how Apple Pay works on the iPhone 5S.  When making a payment at the checkout, the owner of the smartphone must bring the clock to the terminal, select the desired card and confirm the transfer of funds by pressing the button on them and touching the screen.  After the appearance of vibration, the hand can be removed from the watch.  They must also be removed from the terminal.  This, in fact, ends the shopping with the use of such a tool as Apple Pay. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  Earlier in this review, the procedure for how to use Apple Pay on the iPhone 5S was outlined.  This is a promising technology that is gaining ground today.  After all, it is really very convenient, which is confirmed by the reviews.  No need to carry a wallet with money and plastic cards.  It is enough to take a smartphone to pay for purchases. </p><p>  Other companies, giants in the field of information technologies, have taken this very path.  Among them are Google and Samsung.  That is, mobile devices will become more universal and more often find their application in ordinary everyday life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple pay on iphone 5s how it works" class="if uuid-3102958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3102958.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This review described in detail <span>how to set up Apple Pay</span> on the iPhone 5S and start using this convenient technology for shopping.  Although nominally this technology cannot work on such a smartphone, but due to certain manipulations it can still be used on this device.  The algorithm presented in the framework of this review is quite simple and any owner of such a gadget can handle it.  And even without outside help. </p>
