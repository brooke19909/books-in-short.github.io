"Granelle Development" (GranelleDevelopment): employee feedback on work</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, despite the difficult economic situation, the real estate market is in a state of serious recovery.  In this niche, at least, there are hundreds of large developers who build thousands of square meters of new housing every day.  Overall, this is an excellent indicator of the market;  it means that this property is in demand and quickly bought up by the population. </p><p>  We will be discussing one of the companies involved in housing construction in this article (it is called the Granel Group of Companies).  Customer reviews of this developer, information from buyers of real estate in this company and other information that may become useful to you (especially if you plan to purchase something for yourself) will be presented later in the text.  We will try to make them as informative and simple as possible. </p><h2>  About company </h2>

    <p>  So, you should start, of course, with the submission of the developer and the publication of the information that is posted on its official website, and is also available in other open sources of information on the network.  After that, reviews will be described about the developer "Granel", as well as about those complexes that were built and commissioned by this company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that the company began its work back in 1992.  The initial region in which the company planned to conduct its business was Moscow.  Further, in the process of growing the customer base and with the gradual expansion of the development business, the company also began construction of facilities in the suburbs. </p><p>  The structure of the developer is quite complex: the entire business is divided into several companies;  moreover, the parent of all of them is GK Granel.  The reviews also note that in addition to it there is also Granelle Development, which is related as a subsidiary and at the same time organizes the planning of entire residential neighborhoods that the group is working on. </p>

    <p>  As for the lines of activity, the company can be called broad-profile, since its specialization includes not only the construction of residential real estate, but also the arrangement of infrastructure for it, as well as the construction of commercial facilities for business.  In addition, a wide profile of work is evidenced by the fact that the company's specialists oversee the entire construction cycle, from the creation of plans to the management of running facilities for a comfortable stay and work of people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In total, if we take into account all the commissioned objects, the company managed to build more than 3 million square meters of real estate, which is equivalent to more than 75 thousand apartments.  Agree, already these statistics make a serious impression! </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  As reviews about the Granel developer show, the company offers a number of other options for its customers.  In particular, in addition to the construction and commissioning of residential real estate with its further commissioning, the company also provides repair services.  They consist in the decoration of the premises and the complete transformation of the interior of the apartment to the taste of the owner.  This, of course, is an optional service, but even in this sense, the company can be safely called multifaceted. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the commissioning of facilities, they also offer assistance in the preparation of all necessary documents that will be needed to recognize ownership.  This is indicated in the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù section of the company‚Äôs website and, accordingly, is available for those who have already purchased their property in housing complexes built by the company.  It should be noted that here, on the website, a list of documents required for registration of ownership is published.  This is very helpful for customers who come here for the first time and don‚Äôt know what steps should be taken. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, as noted by reviews describing Granel, the company provides excellent support to its customers (and not only).  Here, of course, there is a service of representatives who are ready to consult on any issue;  It also provides several options for how to contact specialists and consult on a topic of interest to you. </p><h2>  Housing complexes </h2><p>  For any developer, the main visiting card is a list of objects that he completed and handed over to his clients.  Only on it can we say how serious the company is and whether it is worth contacting, purchasing housing and investing in construction. </p><p>  Due to the extensive experience in development, the Granel company (customer reviews confirm this) managed to develop a rather impressive portfolio consisting of several large housing complexes.  Some of the apartments in them have already been sold, while the other part is only at the construction stage. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the company‚Äôs policy, in terms of presenting the results of its work, is absolutely transparent: they show here that they were able to build and what is for rent in the near future.  In addition, here you can see the price grid for a particular object and, thus, choose housing in your pocket. </p><p>  And of course, the fact that some of the complexes were successfully put into operation plays an important role in the eyes of the buyer.  This is the most important moment, since it shows that the company works not only on paper, but is also ready to present the results of its activities.  Accordingly, this creates an additional <span>credit of trust</span> and, thus, is disposed to acquire real estate here.  As the reviews about the Granel developer show, the majority of clients are guided by the list of already constructed objects.  As we understand it, this is due to the question of the reputation and reliability of the company, to which a person trusts his money. </p><p>  Next, we will conduct a small analysis of each of the built complexes, so that if you want to buy an apartment here, you can learn something useful for yourself. </p>

    <h2>  RC ‚ÄúTheater Park‚Äù </h2><p>  The first on our list is a housing complex that combines the advantages of a country house combined with the rhythm of a metropolis.  The developer achieved such a balance through the construction of small (3-4 floors high) European-style houses, placing them in the small town of Korolev.  Despite the distance to the capital (several kilometers to the Moscow Ring Road), the complex has excellent transport interchange.  Having their own car, residents will be able to get to where they need it as soon as possible, without any difficulties. </p><p>  In general, the complex consists of 42 small houses.  They are located on a total of 26 hectares.  Since outwardly each of the objects has the same color scheme and the same design as the others, it seems that the company is building a whole town.  In general, as the reviews about the developer "Granel Development" describe, it looks very beautiful and modern. </p><p>  In addition to the aesthetic side, the Theater Park complex has other advantages.  For example, it boasts a flexible pricing policy due to the variety of apartments that are sold here.  In particular, we are talking about the types: studio (up to 26.7 meters), 1-room (up to 48.4 meters), 2-room (up to 64 meters) and 3-room (up to 76.8 meters).  Accordingly, housing prices here vary between 1.6 million - 5.4 million rubles.  As you can see, the buyer has plenty to choose from. </p><p>  As for the reviews that we managed to find on the Internet about this complex, the situation, as it turned out, is rather ambiguous.  On the one hand, the developer reviews describing the Granel company indicate that the place to house the houses is excellent, the quality of the houses and their decoration are pleasing, and the train is nearby, allowing you to get to Moscow even without a car.  On the other hand, there are a lot of comments about the unfriendly local population, who, living in private houses, suddenly found nearby, in the neighborhood, a huge residential complex of 42 houses.  Agree, their discontent can be understood, and because of this attitude, many people simply abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying an apartment here.  Whereas those who buy write that they have no regrets and are happy with everything. </p>

    <h2>  LCD ‚ÄúGosudarev House‚Äù </h2><p>  The next complex, which I would like to characterize, has a large <span>living area</span> and, accordingly, is located on an even larger land plot (80 hectares).  This time it‚Äôs not about small houses, but about full-fledged high-rise buildings of 7-9 floors high.  However, the complex, again, is located outside the city, which makes it attractive for those who are tired of the bustle of the city and loves nature and fresh air.  Both of them will be in abundance here, because around the housing complex there are forests that will delight the eye of home buyers here. </p><p>  Well, of course, do not forget about the price grid.  It offers studios, one-room, two- and three-room apartments at a price of 1.4 million to 5.5 million rubles.  As reviews of the Granel groups show, Sovereign House has a minimum area of ‚Äã‚Äãobjects of only 18.71 square meters and a maximum of about 72.42 square meters. </p><p>  If you are interested in the infrastructure of this complex, objects that will be nearby, then the developer takes on the functions of building two schools and 4 kindergartens.  In addition, the complex is going to build its own shopping center, business center, as well as a sports complex with a swimming pool.  A local clinic will also be launched, as well as a network of bike paths over 5 km long.  All this is being built by the Granel company. </p><p>  "Sovereign House" (reviews of which we were looking for in the process of writing this material), has a lot of positive recommendations from customers.  Many people on the Internet share their stories about the fact that they also bought an apartment in this residential complex and are happy that they managed to do this before the housing prices rose.  In addition, some note that they were able to purchase an apartment directly from the developer, bypassing the markups of intermediaries. </p><p>  From the negative comments, we managed to find information that the complex has an inconvenient transport interchange (you need to make transfers in order to get to Moscow).  However, if you have a personal car, there will be no problems with this, which is also indicated on the website of the company "Granel".  Reviews about the developer "Sovereign House" as a whole characterize on the positive side, so we would recommend buying an apartment in this complex, if you are thinking about such a decision. </p><h2>  LCD "Imperial Mytishchi" </h2><p>  An interesting solution is offered by the developer in his other complex, which is called "Imperial Mytishchi".  Small country houses are being built here, in which (for certain apartments) an exit to their terrace is provided.  Thus, the buyer receives not only housing in a beautiful and comfortable place, which is located in the very heart of nature, but also has the opportunity to get additional comfort for himself and his loved ones. </p><p>  The complex is located, as noted by the reviews describing the Granel Group, in the village of Pogorelki ( <span>Pirogovskoye reservoir</span> and the forest park are also nearby). Therefore, nature will literally be "at arm's length" for residents of the apartments of this complex. </p><p>  The houses here are similar to those being built in other residential complexes: 4-6-storey buildings, decorated in the same style.  From the side, they look like a mini-town, which creates a pleasant impression. </p><p>  Again, the reviews characterizing Granel Development suggest that the company‚Äôs plans include not only building houses for housing and selling apartments in them.  It will also build social facilities (schools, kindergartens and clinics) to provide local residents with everything necessary in the future. </p><p>  As for the transport interchange, from Moscow you can get to the village using buses No. 314 and 314K. </p><p>  The reviews left about the complex are positive: as in the case of other residential complexes, people are happy to share their impressions of buying an apartment and talk about how satisfied they are.  I am glad about the ‚Äúclosedness‚Äù of the complex, security measures in the form of private security points and surveillance cameras, the design of buildings and the builder‚Äôs concern for infrastructure. </p><p>  From the negative, it was possible to find that at rush hour people entering the capital may have problems with traffic jams. </p><h2>  LCD ‚ÄúValentinovka Park‚Äù </h2><p>  The complex with such a talking name, which was also erected by the Granel company, is located about 12 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  This, again, is an ecologically clean area, located in a cozy area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Moscow region.  The area on which the complex is located totals about 18 hectares.  Here (according to the plan) 23 houses will be built, which the developer will split into two stages.  The first, accordingly, has already been commissioned. </p><p>  The houses that are part of the complex will have a height of only 3-4 floors and at the same time will be made in the same architectural style.  The apartments that are available for purchase here are offered in 1-room and 2-room variations, ranging from 34.7 to 58.6 meters.  In some of the houses a three-room apartment is also offered (up to 84 square meters).  Their cost varies between 2.7-4.8 million rubles (and about 6 for a 3-room apartment). </p><p>  As for customer reviews, they can also be divided into two categories, separating the positive and negative.  If in the first people write about how happy they are with a perfect purchase;  secondly, they frighten by how bad things are going with the builder and what financial difficulties he faced.  Judging by the number of apartments sold in other complexes, it is really difficult to believe in the latter.  Therefore, it is possible that such negative information is disseminated specifically in order to discourage people reading it from buying housing here. </p><p>  Comments on groundwater, lack of free space and low-quality building materials, which were also written probably to scare Granel customers, should be added to such tricks.  Valentinovka Park (the reviews we analyzed) is actually in high demand among investors, which is the best indicator. </p><h2>  LCD "Alekseevskaya Grove" </h2><p>  Like the complexes described above, this LCD is built away from city noise and dust, at a distance of 7 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  It consists of 15 houses, which have 19-25 floors each.  Due to the fact that in this case we are talking about real skyscrapers, the company obviously deviated somewhat from its usual profile, which is represented by small cozy 4-story houses.  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAlekseevskaya Grove, given the height of the houses, is also an order of magnitude larger (and amounts to about 497 thousand square meters). </p><p>  The first 6 buildings, according to official information from the site of the developer, were commissioned back in 2014.  The construction of other houses that will be populated in the near future is ongoing. </p>

    <p>  It is not worth worrying that such a large complex is located on such a small plot of land.  Characteristics of the Granel Group reviews of the developer indicate that the complex provided for a wide infrastructure consisting of parking spaces for 1064 cars, as well as all kinds of shops, pharmacies, beauty salons and other places necessary for arranging the life of residents. </p><p>  As for the reviews and comments, they very highly appreciate this LCD, noting a lot of positive points.  These include affordable prices, proximity to the capital, the availability of everything necessary for a comfortable life in the apartments built here.  In addition, homeowners on the good side describe the construction period and the speed with which the buildings were commissioned. </p><h2>  LCD "Forest Town" </h2><p>  Finally, the last one on our list is the complex built by the company to which we dedicated this article - "Forest Town".  It is located in Balashikha and is probably the largest of all that were presented above.  Externally, the houses look very massive due to the large number of floors and are densely populated.  According to official information from the developer, the complex will include 2287 apartments located in 5 large houses (up to 25 floors high).  It is not surprising that for such a number of residents, as the reviews of employees characterizing Granel show, the company has built a 9-level parking lot, and also plans to build many social facilities.  To get to Moscow from this "town" will be possible using buses and minibuses (up to 15 minutes on the road). </p><p>  We found extremely positive customer reviews about the complex.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People praise the construction company, highly appreciate the pace of construction, positively characterize the location, as well as the quality of the facilities themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We could not find negative comments about the complex.</font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Employee reviews about the company </font></font></h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, in order to draw a logical line in the characteristic of ‚ÄúGranel Development‚Äù, the reviews of employees found by us in open sources will be given in this section. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, we are talking about those characteristics that the most diverse of its employees, having various specialties and positions, have left about the company. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the process of preparing the materials, we managed to find both a mass of positive and negative recommendations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first reviews of employees related to Granel Development called the company a great place to work, where you can get useful experience, learn a lot and at the same time make good money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone notes a good attitude, attention from the management, honest and transparent conditions for employment.</font></font></p><p> On the other hand, there are negative comments about working at Granel.  Feedback from employees of this type indicates that the group sometimes spends too much on promotions and creating an image, while it does not carry out the promised salary increase;  that there are too demanding of employees and set strict rules.  In general, we could not find any high-profile scandals regarding work in the company. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we can say that Granel is the largest Russian development group, which offers its customers excellent living conditions at an affordable price, mainly outside the city.  The company has a positive long-standing reputation, due to which it attracts new customers.  And, probably, all the negative that we managed to find on the Internet about this structure comes from competitive enterprises.  He is a normal reaction to the success that Granel achieved at this stage.  Apparently, the company does not intend to stop and at the same time continues to build its facilities, bringing them to the markets near Moscow. </p>
