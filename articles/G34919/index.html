    <p>  The master plan of the developer involves the competent placement of land for development, allowing you to combine everything on a fairly compact territory.  Also to build the necessary infrastructure: school, kindergartens, shops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Construction </h2><p>  There is no need at all to order a building contract and build a house urgently.  Anyone can buy a land plot, but the construction does not begin.  Or carry it out on their own.  But if there is a desire to trust the services of professionals, the developer will offer the most highly skilled workers who can translate into reality the most daring wishes of the customer. </p><p>  Ready-made houses are also offered for purchase, both with and without interior decoration.  Accordingly, the cost of such a home is negotiated individually. </p><p>  The developer plans to organize an artificial reservoir near the village - a pond.  Hence the name - ‚ÄúRostoshinsky Ponds‚Äù.  Only until now, this idea remains in the plans. </p><p>  Life in the fresh air is incomparable with life in a huge metropolis rolled into concrete and asphalt.  For those who appreciate leisurely communication with nature, who want to return to their own home and step on their own grass under their feet, a cottage village is created.  Own home is a dream of many people, but only a few realize it.  Someone does not have the money to execute it, someone lacks the determination to move.  But people who nevertheless solved all their problems (found money and courage) will enjoy every moment of life in the village in their own house, built exactly according to their project. </p><p>  And if the family has pets, imagine what paradise awaits them.  Life in the fresh air, the opportunity to be outdoors at any time.  Your pet will be very grateful to you. </p><p>  And what can we say about children.  First of all, they are provided with security in their small lives, since the territory of the village is under round-the-clock protection, equipped with a checkpoint.  And aliens in this enclosed area will be immediately noticeable.  They will not have to go to school far, since it is located in the very center of the village. </p>
