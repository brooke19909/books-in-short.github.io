  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quilling: paper roses</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quilling is a type of needlework that creates beautiful paper things.  This technique is a real storehouse for those who have the taste and talent for creating beautiful and elegant vases, frames, postcards and various panels.  Such paper crafts delight not only the eye, but also the soul. </p><p>  Anyone who likes to do something original with their own hands should try the quilling technique.  Roses, lilies, birds, animals and much more emerges from ordinary stripes of paper with the help of simple tools and hands.  First you need to stock up with colored paper, a rod or an awl, scissors, tweezers and ordinary <span>PVA glue.</span>  Paper is cut at a rate of 3 mm wide. </p><p>  The easiest and most interesting will be for beginners using quilling roses technique.  No wonder the rose is called the true queen of flowers, because the beauty and grace of this <span>delicate flower</span> never bothers.  In order to make a beautiful <span>rose out of paper,</span> you need to take a paper tape from 5 to 10 mm wide.  You can also use a wider ribbon, then the rose will become even more voluminous.  But in this case, it is better to plant it on a wire handle, otherwise it will protrude too much on a plain surface.  It is also necessary to stock up with a non-sharp stem, thanks to which the center of the rose becomes open. </p><p>  To start creating a rose, you need to take the stem and put on it a paper strip.  After that, make a couple of turns around the stem and fix them with a small drop of glue - this will create the center of the rose.  Then fold the paper back at a right angle and continue to fold the rose.  Do not forget to repeat the bending of the strip after each turn. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Carefully hold the center of the rose near the stem, while subsequent turns should be further from it - this will make your rose much wider.  Continue making turns until the strip of paper runs out.  When everything is ready, you can remove the rose from the stem.  Slightly loosen it so that it becomes magnificent, but do not let go, otherwise it will spin up and you will have to start all over again. </p><p>  To achieve maximum effect when creating flowers <span>using the quilling technique,</span> roses must be carefully bonded.  To do this, gently press on the central part so that it slides into the flower.  Fix the obtained position with glue.  For better fixation, you can use a small strip of paper.  Lubricate it with glue and cover the center of the flower.  Your gorgeous rose is ready!  Do not worry if it turns out to be imperfect, because skill comes with time, and soon you will be able to create your masterpieces easily and quickly. </p><p>  In order to complement your work in the quilling technique, roses need to be glued onto a sheet of thick cardboard and decorated with leaflets.  To do this, you will need several strips of paper in various <span>shades of green.</span>  Take two or three strips of different colors at once, fasten in the tool for folding rolls and gently twist.  The optimum diameter for the leaves is 15 mm.  Cut the inner strip slightly so that it does not protrude beyond the outer strip.  Then lightly fix the rolls with glue. </p><p>  The first roll should be in the form of a rhombus, and all the rest will be in the form of a crescent.  Now glue the items together.  It is best to start with a rhombus and a pair of crescents.  Gently squeeze the top to make something like a bulb.  Glue a couple more crescents to the top and squeeze the top again.  You will get a wonderful leaflet that will perfectly complement our roses. </p><p>  If you decide to make quilling roses on wire stems, then you can put them in a beautiful vase made by yourself.  To do this, take cardboard, a ruler, glue, scissors and a jar.  A vase is made very easily. </p><p>  Cut some rectangles from cardboard.  Then take the prepared jar and paste over with rectangles.  On top of cardboard rectangles, attach various decorations - leaflets, butterflies and flowers.  Let it dry, and you're done - the container for storing your unfading bouquet of roses is already in front of you! </p><p>  Quilling technique will always help to decorate your home.  Rose, lilies, cornflowers, butterflies and beautiful birds will turn any room into a fairy garden. </p>
