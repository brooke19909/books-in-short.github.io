  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a flanelegraph do it yourself?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Do-it-yourself flanelegraph for kindergarten is done by almost all educators since the days of the Soviet Union.  This is a flat large screen to which you can attach any picture with a simple attachment.  Previously, flannelographs were mainly made from children's monophonic flannel diapers, pulling them on a wooden or plywood frame.  Pictures were drawn separately, glued onto cardboard, and small pieces of velvet paper were attached on the back.  If the picture was large, then glued several pieces of such rough paper in different places, otherwise the picture fell to the floor. </p><p>  Nowadays, flannelograph can be purchased at the store, but it is expensive and consists of only one didactic game.  She quickly gets bored with children, the guys solve the educational task no longer thinking, but automatically.  Teachers still have to make their own flannelograph.  Now everything is much simpler than in the old days, as a wonderful material - felt - appeared on sale.  For the screen itself, you can purchase one plain piece of fabric, and cut figures and pictures from sheets of felt of different colors, which can be purchased in a large assortment at any sewing accessories store. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a flannelograph with your own hands in the form of a screen and in the form of an educational soft book.  Consider examples of solving didactic problems using such easy-to-use material, we will introduce parents and teachers of preschool institutions to the areas of application of flannel graph in different classes for the mental development of kids. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Large screen on the stand </h2><p>  It is very simple to make a flannelograph with your own hands on the basis of an old board.  In any group of kindergarten there is a wooden board, like a school board, only a small size with legs.  It can be rearranged and rotated with the back side.  Leave the front side untouched, as it is actively used by the teacher to work with chalk, and the teacher puts pictures on it for classes.  But on the back you can easily place a felt screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY flanelegraph" class="if uuid-3163911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3163911.jpg"></div><p>  What is convenient for working with felt is that it is perfectly sewn and glued.  It is desirable that the back side of the board be painted, then PVA glue will lie well on its surface.  The glue is carefully applied with a brush to the entire board and a piece of plain felt is applied.  It is advisable to do this procedure at night, laying the board on the floor lying down.  Stacks of magazines or books can be placed on top.  By morning, a self-made flannelograph is completely ready for use, it will be enough to cut out the details of the game from felt sheets.  In the photo above, children play the didactic game "Transport".  The training task is to place vehicles opposite their place of movement.  The child must explain in words his choice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Game "Collect the egg" </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself flanelegraph games for kindergarten can help parents do.

Then, in random order, they are cut into two parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="game for flanelegraf &quot;collect the egg&quot;" class="if uuid-3163914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3163914.jpg"></div><p>  The purpose of the didactic game is the development of the sensory and logical thinking of the child.  He should not only find a soulmate in the box in color, but also correctly attach it to the first part. </p><h2>  Table felt flannelograph </h2><p>  With your own hands you can make an excellent, learning the rules of the road, game.  A background is cut out of a black sheet, a road with intersections is made of blue felt and small stripes of yellow are used for marking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flanelegraph in the study of traffic rules" class="if uuid-3163909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3163909.jpg"></div><p>  Separately sew the details of the game - these are multi-storey buildings, various cars, trees, pedestrians.  You can cut traffic signs and traffic lights.  And flannelograph, and do-it-yourself templates are easy to perform.  Any experienced teacher will cope.  The main goal of this game is to teach children the rules of behavior on the road, the ability to cross the street in the right place and know the main road signs. </p><h2>  Didactic game "Collect a picture" </h2><p>  If the teacher or parents made a flannelograph with their own hands for kindergarten, then the games can be invented on its basis the most different.  The game "Collect Picture" is popular among kids.  Different pictures make an application.  It can be an animal, a fairy tale character or a cartoon character.

You can divide it into equal squares or complicate the task for senior preschoolers by cutting the whole into many arbitrary parts.  What makes a hand-made flannelgraph convenient is that you can constantly replenish the selection of pictures.  For their storage, a small box is selected or the game is made out in plastic folders. </p><h2>  Flanelegraph book for home use </h2><p>  Now soft books made of fabric are very popular.  They perform different educational tasks, each of which is located on a separate page.  So, in the photo below, the page is sewn from cotton fabric, and Velcro is attached to it.
