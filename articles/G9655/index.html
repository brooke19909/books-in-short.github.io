    <p>  When a <span>summer sarafan</span> is mentioned <span>,</span> the image of the product sewn from thin fabric, the length of which almost reaches the floor <span>,</span> often appears.  Such clothes are very popular in the summer, and many people purchase them for trips to hot countries.  Now in glossy magazines and on various thematic sites you can find information on how to sew a summer sundress.  You can buy a piece of fabric for this, or you can buy two silk scarves.  The main thing here is a pattern, then the finished product is perfect for any <span>type of figure.</span> </p><p>  However, such an exquisite element of women's wardrobe can also be made in another way.  If you tie a <span>summer sundress with your own hands,</span> then, of course, you can attract the attention and admiring glances of not only the strong half of humanity.  Such products have long occupied pride of place in the world of fashion, embodying the most daring thoughts and desires of designers.  You can easily find images of models that, as conceived by the couturier, put on knitwear. </p><p>  Before you begin to put your ideas into practice, you need to decide how you will knit a summer sundress.  If you want the finished product to be as thin as possible, then you should give preference to knitting needles.  And if you want to have a beautiful openwork thing in your wardrobe, which will also keep its shape perfectly, then choose a hook.  In addition, in this case, it is necessary to choose a knitting technique: whole fabric, ribbon or Irish lace.  If you are not very good at crocheting, then you should give preference to the first method.  The last two will allow you to create a unique thing that no woman has in her wardrobe. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth choosing a thread.  To do this, select the pattern and style of the finished product.  If your summer sundress will have a bodice, then it is better for him to choose threads that are identical in property to cotton-stretch.  For the rest of the product, select the composition of the threads at your discretion. Of course, when knitting, you can use threads of the same composition and color.  In this case, when crocheting, you will have to carefully observe the size of the pattern, since the finished product will not stretch well and, accordingly, take the shape of your body.  In addition to composition, pay attention to color.  It is not necessary to make such a product monophonic, especially if you decide to knit it for a little girl.  You can always find a beautiful combination of contrasting colors. </p><p>  In addition to threads, you should also buy materials for decoration.  It can be satin ribbons, beads and other elements.  If the finished product will fit tightly on the figure, be sure to buy a zipper. </p><p>  After you have the necessary tools and materials, you can begin to knit a summer sundress.  How and in what sequence you will do this depends on the chosen style and knitting technique.  Very often crocheting a single piece of fabric starts from the top.  In this case, the lower edge of the finished product will have a beautiful openwork shape.  If the sarafan is knitted using the technique of Irish or <span>ribbon lace,</span> then first you need to knit the required number of elements, which will then be connected using an openwork mesh or sewn with ordinary thread for sewing.  Everything will depend on your imagination. </p><p>  When knitting, the product can be knitted both from above and from below, as required by the style.  Often there are both directions in one product.  In this case, knitting starts at the waist level in both directions.  At the same time, the line of the set of loops must be decorated in some way.  The lower edge of the finished product knitted with needles can be crocheted to prevent it from stretching during wear. </p><p>  Thus, you should not think that a sundress can only be sewn.  Such a knitted product can be the pride of any fashionista! </p>
