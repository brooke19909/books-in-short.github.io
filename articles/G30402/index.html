There is nothing difficult in this matter, but you will have to stock up on time and patience.  In order for the collage to fit in well with the style of the room, you need to think over and buy the necessary details: frames, pictures, volumetric inscriptions, etc. At the same time, all complementary elements can be made independently. </p><h2>  A selection of topics </h2><p>  Most often, a collage is made in order to decorate a room, to remember an event, to present to friends and relatives.  It will fit perfectly into the interior, if you collect elements in a thematic collection.  Avoid mistakes: decorating with several frames of the same size and shape will not enliven the room, but will make it dull and boring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ptburnem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage on the theme of attractions" class="if uuid-2736556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43344/2736556.jpg"></div><p>  Almost every person has a lot of photos related to different life events.  Each of them can be arranged in the form of a collage: a meeting with classmates, a picnic with the family, the baby‚Äôs first birthday, New Year‚Äôs holiday, beach holidays.  As for the paintings, they are selected depending on the purpose of the room (for example, for the kitchen - still life). </p><p>  A few examples of wall collages: </p><ol><li>  For the living room and bedroom - landscapes, family photos. </li><li>  For the office - landscapes, portraits, photographs in retro style. </li><li>  For the kitchen - flowers and still lifes. </li><li>  For a children's room - a panel or a photo in the form of a short flight of stairs. </li></ol><h2>  Color harmony </h2><p>  You should know that the wrong combination of colors can spoil the overall impression of the room.  Therefore, here you will have to take into account some points: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  purpose of the room; </li><li>  the style and color of the surrounding parts; </li><li>  arrangement of composition; </li><li>  themes and the principle of making a collage on the wall. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="blog.zoomin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage and color palette of the interior" class="if uuid-2736553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43344/2736553.jpg"></div><p>  Frames for photographs and paintings play an important role in arranging the interior, so it is important to choose them correctly.  Their color and material should be in harmony with the interior of the room.  Frames can be multi-colored and black-and-white, plastic, wooden and metal.  You can make them yourself - just buy nice shells, buttons or other jewelry. </p><p>  You can make a collage on the wall from photographs and paintings framed in frames of the same color.  Moreover, they may differ in size, thickness, shape, texture.  Light and thin frames with black and white photos will look good in a bright room.  In bright rooms, you can use expressive and wide frames (black, gray-black or brown-black). </p><h2>  Design options </h2><p>  From a set of photographs or paintings, you can collect various compositions.  So, for example, you can organize your own collage on the wall using a clothesline painted in a suitable color.  You can fix the photo on it using decorative clothespins.  The method is convenient in that the composition is easy to replace with a new one. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="znnz.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage on the rope" class="if uuid-2736557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43344/2736557.jpg"></div><p>  There are also a large number of collage design options.  Among them: </p><ol><li>  Symmetric arrangement of elements (around a vertical or horizontal axis).  We place large pictures closer to the center, and small ones to the edges. </li><li>  Highlighting the central element.  In the center we hang the most important (or large) picture, and the rest we arrange according to the principle of symmetry. </li><li>  A picture cut into several parts and assembled on the wall in a single composition. </li><li>  The location of products on shelves mounted on the wall.  Cute glasses, vases, decorative plates will help to complete the collection. </li></ol><p>  A beautiful collage of photos on the wall will turn out if you use not only the pictures in the frame, but also drawings, mirrors, watches, wooden or plastic labels. </p><h2>  Seat selection </h2><p>  Before you post a composition, you need to choose a suitable place for it.  First we select the wall: it should be empty (without paintings, sconces, posters) and located in the distance.  It is also important that it is easy to approach, so that guests can appreciate your work.  Designers advise against placing photographs in hallways or on closed stairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homedesign2018.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage in the bedroom" class="if uuid-2736558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43344/2736558.jpg"></div><p>  Family photos should not be hung over a sofa or bed, as they cannot be seen closer.  Any other large shots or paintings are suitable here.  In which rooms will the collages look perfect?  They are perfect for living rooms, bedrooms, children's rooms, kitchens, cabinets, open stairs, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Photo </h2><p>  Before you make a collage of photos on the wall, you need to decide on the subject and size of the pictures.  The latter can be done as follows: cut out each element from plain paper and try to make a general composition.  After that, you can start printing pictures. </p><p>  An important part of photographs is frames.  To get a strict interior, it is best to make them the same.  For courageous people, another way is suitable - the choice of frames with different textures.  At the same time, they should fit into the overall interior (for example, dark frames are combined with wenge-colored doors and baseboards). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uniqueideas.site" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage of photos in the form of a heart" class="if uuid-2736551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43344/2736551.jpg"></div><p>  Several design options for the composition: </p><ul><li>  placing photos in a symmetrical or chaotic order around any object (paintings, doors, mirrors, lamps); </li><li>  the location on an empty space of frames of the same size into which the identical at first glance pictures are inserted;  such a composition will create an interesting visual effect; </li><li>  placing elements of the same size on parallel lines; </li><li>  vertical arrangement of frames - this will visually raise the ceilings. </li></ul><h2>  Paintings </h2><p>  A collage on the wall can be made not only from photographs, but also from paintings.  At the same time, they are bought ready-made or made independently.  Pictures can be painted with watercolors or oil, created from them panels (of wool, thread, leather) or make a prefabricated poster. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pinkzpassion.blogspot.com" data-author=": Pinkz Passion, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage of paintings" class="if uuid-2736550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43344/2736550.jpg"></div><p>  Let's try to figure out what is suitable for composing the composition: </p><ol><li>  Paintings painted by paints.  Even a novice artist will cope with this work - you just have to try.  A collage of children's drawings looks very unusual, and the child will really like this idea. </li><li>  The pictures embroidered with beads.  Perfect for a bedroom or kitchen. </li><li>  Products from improvised materials.  In this option, you can use and combine various objects: fabrics, buttons, dried flowers, small stones, shells, etc. </li><li>  Homemade posters.  You can insert handwritten recipes, texts, inscriptions, or quotes into frames. </li><li>  Pictures from the wallpaper.  They can be cut from photo wallpaper, glued on a solid base and put into frames.  Looks great composition of wallpaper, which fits a solid base (it turns panel).  Modular paintings that are made up of several segments fit well into the interior.  The absence of frames allows you to achieve smooth transitions of the picture. </li></ol><h2>  Create compositions from frames </h2><p>  An unusual option for decorating any room is a collage of frames on the wall.  Inside each element, you can place any "stuffing" or leave them empty and give the look a rest.  Such a composition looks unobtrusive and fits perfectly into any style.  Empty frames can be hung in any order.  Particular attention should be paid to the color of the products: if they are of the same color, they can have different shapes and sizes.  If there is a desire to hang multi-colored frames, then it is necessary to take this into account when drawing up the composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="merchrocks.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage of frames" class="if uuid-2736552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43344/2736552.jpg"></div><p>  Products on the wall can repeat the texture of furniture or other interior details.  Antique, exotic frames look very beautiful and unusual, and you can insert mirrors in some of them.  This decoration is suitable for the bedroom, and for the living room, and even for the bathroom. </p><p>  It is also possible to install one frame in another (smaller to larger).  At the same time, the smallest of them can be filled with paintings, embroideries, appliqu√©s, etc. Floral arrangements will help revive the interior. </p><h2>  Design Tips for Decorating Different Rooms </h2><p>  To make a collage on the wall, it is necessary to take into account the purpose and design of the room.  Elements of the composition should be in good harmony with the color palette of the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.warehousemold.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collage in a children's room" class="if uuid-2736554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43344/2736554.jpg"></div><p>  Designers advise decorating the walls as follows: </p><ol><li>  Family shots that can be hung on any wall are suitable for the living room.  But here you should not overdo it with quantity.  A great option is to compose a composition in the form of a family tree.  Branches with leaves hanging between the frames will be an additional decoration. </li><li>  In the bedroom it is better to hang a collage on the theme of love (meeting, wedding) - it will charge the spouses with a romantic mood and will refresh their feelings.  Lighting will help to make the composition attractive. </li><li>  In the children's room, photographs and paintings are inserted into frames in the form of bright puzzles arranged in a chaotic manner.  Design example: in the center is a smiling baby close-up, and around it there are moments of growing up, casting of arms and legs. </li><li>  For the kitchen, images of dishes, recipes and any culinary theme are suitable.  You can complement the interior with kitchen utensils. </li></ol><p>  Collage on the wall is a great way to add comfort to any room.  Most importantly, you don‚Äôt have to spend big money, because you can make it from improvised means. </p>
