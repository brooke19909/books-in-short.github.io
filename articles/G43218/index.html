    <p>  2014 for the South Korean company was marked by a sharp drop in sales of smartphones located in the middle price segment.  There were very definite reasons for that.  For example, one of them was the averaged characteristics that simply did not haunt potential buyers.  It turned out like this: there are two devices at a similar price, but Samsung offers less performance compared to another device of even a lesser-known brand.  What do you think, in whose favor did the buyer give his decision anyway? </p><p>  Then they found where to go for a walk, Chinese companies like Lenovo and ZTE.  Although talking about the low fame of the first, even in comparison with the South Korean manufacturer, it would be rather stupid, if you recall with what ambitions the Chinese made their way to the smartphone market.  Due to the fact that Samsung began to raise prices for its devices solely because of the popularity of the company around the world, a considerable percentage of the audience turned away from the Koreans, having made a U-turn to China.  Let's just clarify one simple thing: the chipsets of the corresponding devices were almost the same, as well as the materials for making the cases.  This should clearly explain why the audience did not want to overpay the money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Error correction </h2>

    <p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> A3 was developed by the company as a means of return and increase sales.  It became one of the manifestations of the company's foreign policy in the smartphone market, which was developed for 2015.  But what happened, more specifically?  We can notice that the South Korean manufacturer redesigned the strategy from beginning to end, deciding to abandon the development and delivery of a huge number of different models to the international arena.  Instead, it was decided to release in each individual segment a kind of ‚Äúhero‚Äù, which, in fact, was supposed to attract attention. </p><p>  And ahead of the company was a real triumph.  The device, released on the international arena of mobile devices, has become truly massively acquired in the world, quite popular and very popular.  But this, when viewed from the point of view of the segment exclusively.  This is not to say that the smartphone could compete with devices from other niches, this would be illogical.  We note one very interesting thing: leaving reviews about the Samsung A3, phone buyers often note an allegedly stylish and original design.  In fact, there is nothing really original in it, everywhere, from whatever sides and at whatever angles we look at the device, we will see quite characteristic features inherent in smartphones of the South Korean manufacturer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The difference between the lineup models </h2>

    <p>  A-series gives us an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe product line, consisting of three different devices: A3, A5, and also A7.  The difference between these three devices is, for the most part, exclusively in the hardware.  But in addition to it, of course, there is a screen diagonal.  Well, and more specifically, the <span>Samsung Galaxy A3</span> smartphone is equipped with a screen with a diagonal of 4.5 inches, A5 has 5, and A7 - 5.5 inches.  Otherwise, we will not notice any differences.  The design applied to all three devices is absolutely identical, and the same can be said about the appearance.  Actually, due to such features, these smartphones have created a single series, which is positioned on the market as a true product line. </p><h2>  Overall </h2>

    <p>  What else can be said about the introduction of the Samsung Galaxy A3 SM in the international arena?  Probably, it‚Äôs worthwhile to deal simply with the series.  Product line ‚ÄúA‚Äù, which includes the Samsung Galaxy A3 smartphone, is presented as a line whose devices are equipped with the latest version of the operating system at the time of release.  The case is made of high quality, solid materials.  However, in terms of technical characteristics, these are not the best smartphones.  By the way, we‚Äôll talk about this in more detail in relation to the subject of our review today. </p><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  <span>Samsung A3, reviews</span> of which we give at the end of this article, works in the GSM and UMTS bands.  In addition, the device has an integrated LTE module, which is necessary for using fourth-generation cellular networks.  To work with the international network, 3G and 4G standards are provided, as well as EDGE and GPRS.  The built-in modem can be used to create a Wi-Fi access point.  Other smartphones, tablets and laptops will be able to connect to it.  Due to the ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù function version 4.0, you can exchange multimedia data with the corresponding devices. </p><p>  The Wi-Fi module works in the b, g, and n bands.  The Samsung Galaxy A3 software, reviews of which you can read in the review, has an E-mail client.  Just an indispensable thing for people who are actively using the capabilities of email.  To synchronize with a personal computer, the owner of the phone will have to use a port and a cable of the MicroUSB standard - USB 2.0. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen <span>size of the Samsung A300F Galaxy A3</span> is 4.5 inches, as mentioned earlier.  Recall that with each subsequent model, the diagonal increases by 0.5.  With the appropriate option, the screen resolution is only 960 by 540 pixels.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using Super AMOLED technology, which demonstrates good (although they simply cannot be called the best) viewing angles.  Color rendering allows the screen to display up to sixteen million colors.  The touch screen is a capacitive type.  Due to the presence of a function called ‚Äúmultitouch‚Äù, scaling an image in some applications is quite convenient. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2>

    <p>  The resolution of the main module is eight megapixels.  Thus, the camera gives us good shots.  However, it will be difficult, of course, to call them ideal.  Images are obtained in the size of 3248 by 2448 pixels.  There is a function of automatic focusing on the subject.  Not far from the module, an LED type flash is integrated.  It allows both photographing and video shooting in conditions of either complete absence of lighting, or with a critical lack thereof.  In this case, the pictures are very good.  Video resolution - 1920 by 1080 pixels (the so-called Full HD quality).  The smartphone is equipped with a front camera (5 MP).  A good option, of course, for fans of selfies. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  As a hardware filling, we have introduced the Qualcomm chipset family.  More specifically, this is the <span>Snapdragon 410</span> model. The device has four cores that develop a frequency of up to 1.2 gigahertz.  Well, the graphics core is nothing but Adreno 306. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  To store personal information, by default, a little less than 16 gigabytes are provided.  This place can be filled with photos, pictures, films, music, video clips, e-books.  In general, everything that the owner of the smartphone only wishes.  The device has a RAM capacity of 1024 megabytes.  A greedy operating system selects part of it for itself, but in general there is enough memory even for using a smartphone in multitasking mode.  The user shell, like the OS as a whole, works quite smoothly and smartly, almost no complaints.  At times (very rarely), lags and friezes may appear.  However, the problem is solved for a long time by means of an ordinary reboot of the device.  To expand the initial volume of long-term memory, a microSD slot is provided for the corresponding external drives.  The maximum supported size is 64 gigabytes. </p><h2>  Conclusion  Samsung Galaxy A3: customer reviews </h2><p>  What can the owners of the device tell us who purchased it in time and managed to test it?  Well, let's listen to the first (and not only) impressions of the smartphone. </p><p>  At a high level, a voice call was clear in quality and loud in sound strength.  This, in principle, is a distinguishing feature of many, almost all devices of the South Korean manufacturer, there is nothing to be particularly surprised about.  The interlocutor‚Äôs speech is clearly audible, and the owner of the telephone is equally well transmitted to the other end of the missing wire.  The location of the phones is excellent.  Even the noisy surroundings will not interfere with a successful and understandable telephone conversation.  Was it worth talking about a good stock volume of the spoken speaker?  Probably not. </p><p>  In the Russian Federation, the model at the start of official sales received a cost of 17 thousand rubles.  It is unlikely to rise above the mark.  Of the shortcomings, not the most productive hardware stuffing should be noted.  And the functionality is a bit limp, to be honest.  For the same money, you can find devices much more productive than the subject of our review today.  Another thing is that the cases will not be made so premium, and will not have such reliability.  But here it is necessary to definitely choose one of the two chairs, which a potential buyer subsequently sits on. </p>
