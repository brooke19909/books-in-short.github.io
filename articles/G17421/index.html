It is the first museum that was opened by decree of Emperor Peter I. </p><p>  For a Russian, the word ‚ÄúKunstkamera‚Äù sounds rather unusual.  It is borrowed from German and literally means ‚Äúart room‚Äù.  In ancient times, so-called collections were rather unusual, but associated with the natural sciences and art.  In the XVI-XVII centuries, such things were familiar to royal families and princes, but ordinary people were sometimes surprised and even scared. </p><p>  There is an opinion that various monsters, freaks, demonstrating natural anomalies are collected in the Kunstkamera.  However, visitors can see completely normal things, but they are rare, because they are usually hidden from the human eye.  Mysteries of nature hidden on the seabed, in the bowels of the earth or in the starry sky are demonstrated here. </p><p>  Of course, exhibits of people with physical disabilities are also present.  This is due to the hobbies of Peter I, who was keenly interested in the anatomy and preservation of human health. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saint-petersburg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg: Kunstkamera" class="if uuid-3213159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3213159.jpg"></div><h2>  Peter-Pavel's Fortress </h2><p>  The main attractions of St. Petersburg can be very different.

Tourists sometimes believe that the monument is made of copper, but local residents know that this is not so.  It is made of bronze.  The name has taken root from the time when bronze was called copper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bronze Horseman" class="if uuid-3214265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/3214265.jpg"></div><h2>  Kazan Cathedral </h2><p>  His address: Kazan Square, 2. </p><p>  It is not without reason that Kazan Cathedral is among the main attractions of St. Petersburg.
