After the revolution of 1917 and World War II, few of them were fortunate enough to survive.

    <p>  The first mention of the area on which the estate of the princes Golitsyn subsequently was located dates back to the 17th century.  It belonged to the St. Nicholas Ugreshsky Monastery with the mill.  Later, in 1702, it was transferred into the possession of George Stroganov, the son of an industrialist, a native of a noble family.  Initially, he received a mill with a pond, and then the wastelands surrounding them. </p><p>  In 1716, the construction of the church began, which was consecrated in honor of the Vlaherna Icon of the Mother of God.  After the construction was completed, the Kuzminki estate was renamed Vlakhernskoye.  The name was given so long ago that no one remembers for what reason the mill was so named: either the previous owner was Kuzma, or the monastery bore the names of Kuzma and Danila.  One way or another, in 1740 Georgy Stroganov received Kuzminki for sole use and began to slowly develop it.  It was then that a pond was created, which has been preserved to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The estate has a new owner </h2>

In their family there were four branches, the descendants of three live now.  After marrying Anna Stroganova, Golitsyn received a dowry for her in the form of 518 acres of land and the Vlakhernsky estate itself.  It remained in the possession of the princely family until the revolution.

    <p>  After the wedding of <span>Stroganov‚Äôs</span> daughter, <span>the</span> Golitsyn <span>estate</span> in Kuzminki began to transform.  The old house was rebuilt, a lot of attention was paid to landscape design.  Particularly noteworthy is a cascade of four ponds that you can admire at the present time.  <span>The English park</span> served as a role model for the neighboring landowners and nobles.  Almost all the buildings were rebuilt: settlements, horse and stockyards, church, marina. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the death of Prince Mikhail, his son Sergey Mikhailovich (according to some statements, his grand-nephew) took over.  Under him, the Golitsyn estate ‚ÄúKuzminki‚Äù became so famous for its architecture that it was compared with the cities of Pavlovsk and Peterhof near St. Petersburg. </p><p>  CM.  Golitsyn was a large industrialist and owned a cast iron foundry.  All the masterpieces of park architecture, such as gates, benches and sculptures were cast on them.  To create monuments, lanterns, girandoles and other <span>small architectural forms, the</span> prince invited such masters as Rossi, Kompioni, <span>A.G.</span>  <span>Grigoriev,</span> A Voronikhin, M. Bykovsky and others.  Having turned into a masterpiece of construction and landscape design, the Golitsyn estate in Kuzminki was called the Russian Versailles among art lovers. </p><h2>  The further fate of the estate </h2>

After his death, the estate of Princes Golitsyns ‚ÄúVlakhernskoye-Kuzminki‚Äù passed to his nephew Mikhail Alexandrovich, who served as ambassador to Spain.  He practically did not appear on the estate.

    <p>  Later, the Golitsyn estate in Kuzminki went to his son, Sergei Mikhailovich.  Desolation begins on the estate ... The prince moves to Dubrovitsy, reduces the staff of servants, rents out premises for summer cottages.  There were even completed several buildings for vacationers. </p><p>  When the estate of Golitsyn went to his son, Sergey Sergeyevich, the First World War was on.  Some of the buildings of the estate were given to the hospital for officers.  Because of their negligence, a fire occurred, the Lord‚Äôs house and the West wing burned down - these buildings remained wooden. </p><p>  In 1918, the Golitsyn estate became owned by the Institute of Experimental Veterinary Medicine.  Products containing precious metals were seized in favor of the new state, the masterpieces of cast-iron pouring were sent for re-melting.  They made a rest house out of an old church.  In 1941, despite the constant bombing of the German army, the estate of Golitsyn practically did not suffer. </p><p>  In 1960, the estate, which fell into disrepair, received the status of a monument.  <span>Kuzminki Park has</span> become a popular holiday destination and a center for various cultural events. </p><h2>  Front yard </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The estate of the princes Golitsyn Vlakhernskoe Kuzminki" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/450819.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Kuzminki (museum-estate) begins with the exposition "Front Courtyard".  It includes many elements that deserve separate consideration: the Lord‚Äôs House, the West and East wings, the Entrance Bridge, the gates of the Main Courtyard, the Fencing of the courtyard and the Egyptian Pavilion (kitchen). </p><p>  The front yard was designed by the architect I. Egorov.  In order to separate it from the rest of the territory, it was surrounded by a fence and surrounded by a moat, which under the Golitsyn was filled with water.  It was possible to get to the Lord's house through the Entrance bridge with lanterns.  As planned, all the buildings should have been clearly visible, so the yard was decorated with flower beds and undersized shrubs.  The Egyptian pavilion was used as a kitchen. </p><h2>  The ensemble "Kuzminsky park" </h2><p>  Today Kuzminsky Park is a whole complex of natural and architectural monuments.  It contains English and French parks, a cascade of Kuzminsky ponds, a house on the dam, Grottoes, Lion's Wharf.  Parks today are almost completely open to visitors; various events are held in them.  Open to visitors and magnificent ponds.  The only exception is the site belonging to the institute. </p>

On the first is Lion's Marina.  It was with her that boat trips began earlier.  Between the Upper and Lower Ponds, on the dam, on the site of the former mill, a house was rebuilt.  It accommodated guests who stayed overnight.

    <p>  The Music Pavilion was located on one shore, where pop shows are being held, and on the opposite - two grottoes - One-Arched and Three-Arched.  In the first, under the Golitsyn forces, theatrical performances were staged by the hosts and guests.  On the bank of the Lower Pond, the Birdhouse was located, which was later rebuilt into a forge. </p><h2>  Manor Temple </h2><p>  The estate of Golitsyn got its second name precisely because of this temple.  <span>Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich</span> granted the former owner of the estate, Stroganov, a list with the Vlaherna icon.  A wooden temple was built in 1716-1720 to store it. </p><p>  Golitsyn rebuilt the church - now its walls were made of stone.  Napoleon‚Äôs troops ravaged it, but after the war, the owners of the estate restored the temple, installed marble iconostases, a clock on the bell tower, and re-consecrated. </p><p>  After 1929, the 3rd floor was completed, the church was first turned into a hostel, and then into the office of the institute.  After 1990, the church was transferred to the diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church and restored. </p><h2>  How to get to Kuzminka </h2>

    <p>  In fact, the museum, which today is the Golitsyn estate in Kuzminki, is not only the attractions described by us.  This is a gazebo, sculptures, horse and animal farm and much more.  One day to explore all the exhibits is simply not enough, so it is better to come here several times. </p><p>  Getting to the estate museum is not at all difficult.  It is enough to get to the Kuzminki metro station and walk for 15-20 minutes.  So you can get to the main entrance to the museum.  To get to certain expositions in the estate faster, you can use a fixed-route taxi, but since they rarely go, it will be faster to take the metro or take a walk. </p>
