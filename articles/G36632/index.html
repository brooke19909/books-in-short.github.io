Tourists resting in the capital of Russia quite often come here.  Here you can stroll through the wonderful parks where famous writers and poets once walked.  Museum lovers can visit the house in which Anton Pavlovich Chekhov lived and learn more about his life and career. </p><p>  Another attraction of the city that deserves attention is the Lopasnya-Zachatievskoye estate.  Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin and his family loved to relax here.  Detailed information about the estate is presented in the article. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.1396908" data-lng="37.445678300000054" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/6/8/6/6686.png"></div><h2>  Some historical information </h2><p>  The construction of the estate began in 1770.  The project was developed by the first owner of the estate - Count Alexander Vasilchikov, one of the favorites of Empress Catherine the Second.  This is a wonderful example of early baroque.  During the life of the count, his good friend Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin often came here, who loved clean air and the amazing atmosphere of this place.  Here he rested, and with pleasure created his literary masterpieces.  The owner of the estate often arranged literary evenings and small dinner parties, at which all people who were not indifferent to creativity gathered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the death of Vasilchikov, several owners changed at the estate in Chekhov.  The last mistress was Natalya Ivanovna Goncharova, a relative of the wife of Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin.  After the revolution, the Soviet school was located in the walls of the building.  In 1996, it was decided to restore the estate and open a museum complex here.  Unfortunately, not all rooms were restored in their original form.  Everyone can visit the estate and enjoy the old interiors during the museum‚Äôs opening hours.  Read about it later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deskgram.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor in the city of Chekhov" class="if uuid-2685671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/2685671.jpg"></div><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  The museum is located at Chekhov, Pushkin Street, building 10.

The air here is amazingly clean and the atmosphere is calm and peaceful.  The building is a classic example of the baroque of the late 18th century.  A pleasant soft pink color blends perfectly with white columns and other elements of the external decor.  The empire front porch, created in 1827, has been preserved.  Inside the museum, they tried to recreate the ancient interiors in which the Vasilchikov family lived, the rooms of the Goncharovs sisters (thanks to them, the estate was also called the "Pushkin Nest").  Here you can see the personal belongings of the owners of the estate, the ceremonial interiors of their living rooms and other rooms, a collection of letters and business documents, as well as many other interesting things.  Manor Lopasnya-Zachatievskoye is a truly unique place that is worth a visit for everyone.  Here you can learn a lot of interesting facts and enjoy the beauty of the surrounding nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chekhovmuseum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="museum halls" class="if uuid-2685686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/2685686.jpg"></div><h2>  Expositions </h2><p>  Each hall of the museum is a separate room with beautiful furniture and small household items.  All of them are ready to tell visitors how their owners lived.  The personal account of Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin is especially popular.  Here he created his priceless works.  Also preserved is his personal correspondence with friends.  In addition, in 1917 the unfinished manuscript "The Secret of Peter" was found.  She can also be seen among the exhibits of the writer's office.  On the third floor there are thematic exhibitions dedicated to the work of Pushkin.  Sometimes evenings are held associated with significant dates in the life of a Russian writer.  We advise you to walk around the museum with a guide.  You can ask him all the questions that interest you, and also learn a lot of interesting information about the inhabitants of the estate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor lopasnya zachatchevskoe reviews" class="if uuid-2685706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/2685706.jpg"></div><h2>  Holy place </h2><p>  Museum visitors can also visit a small temple built in 1694.  The church was consecrated in honor of the conception of St. Anne (hence the second name of the estate - "Zachatinsky").  The descendants of Pushkin are buried here - his eldest son with his wife and grandchildren.  You can also see a special funeral plaque to N.I. Vasilchikov and the family grave of this noble family. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor lopasnya zachyatchevsky description" class="if uuid-2685700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/2685700.jpg"></div><h2>  Manor Lopasnya-Zachatievskoe: visitor reviews </h2><p>  Museum guests always leave enthusiastic comments about visiting this place.
