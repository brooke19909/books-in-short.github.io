Well, if the size of the housing allows you to put an acoustic instrument.  But if there are problems with free space, or housing is rented, people often think about buying electronic keyboards.  And here the <span>Casio</span> CTK 3000 <span>synthesizer</span> is a great choice. </p><h2>  Tool types </h2><p>  Among electronic pianos, there is a division into synthesizers and <span>digital pianos,</span> which in the "stuffing" practically do not differ.  But the difference is not in sound or software. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="casio ctk 3000" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45314/1776471.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  When developing digital pianos, engineers strive to imitate a real instrument, not only in sound but also in sensations.  They create the same "game mechanics" as on an acoustic piano.  Synthesizers are focused on a large number of functions, such as auto accompaniment, a variety of tones and a training mode.  One of the brightest representatives of this type is the Casio CTK 3000. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The instrument has a learning mode, you can connect a sustain pedal.  The keyboard is represented by full-sized keys in the amount of 61 pieces (88 in the acoustic piano), due to which the length is significantly reduced.  In terms of stiffness, the instrument is an unweighted type.  Keyboards are divided into weighted, half-weighted, and unweighted, depending on how hard it is to press the keys.  Unweighted keyboards are most often installed on synthesizers.  They have almost no resistance, and playing them is very easy.  Weighted ones are usually used on digital pianos, because they are as close as possible to the ‚Äúresponse‚Äù to this instrument.  The half-weighted type is a compromise; it is easier to play on such a keyboard than on a weighted one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Functions and Design </h2><p>  The compact case is made of high quality black plastic.  Fingerprints easily remain on it.  To get rid of them, just wipe the tool with a damp cloth or alcohol wipes.  The speaker system is represented by two built-in speakers with a total capacity of four watts.  All necessary information is displayed on the liquid crystal display.  Casio CTK 3000 has a size of 949 x 112 x 354 mm.  Its weight is about four kilograms, so it is easy to transport, fits in the back seat of any car.  In the case it is convenient to carry it along the street. </p>

    <p>  The synthesizer has 400 different tones.  This list includes imitation of classical and synthetic instruments and sounds.  The maximum polyphony is 48 voices, but for some tones it is 24. The instrument contains 150 kinds of auto accompaniment, among which there are melodies in various styles - from jazz to Caucasian folk music. </p><p>  One of the distinguishing features of this line of synthesizers is powered by a battery or batteries.  Six AA alkaline batteries will give the performer about three hours of battery life.  The auto-off function is also important: when powered by a battery or batteries, the synthesizer will turn off six minutes after the last keystroke, and when powered by a network, after half an hour. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Other features </h2><p>  Casio CTK 3000 has a transpose function of 12 semitones up or down and a metronome function.  Reverb can be set to a value from 1 to 10 or turned off altogether.  Unfortunately, there are no other digital effects in this model, as well as arpeggio functions. <strong> </strong>  Using sampling, you can record various sound tracks (vocals, instrumental solo) from external sources, and then use them in your performance.  Management is carried out by buttons. <strong></strong></p>

    <p>  Headphones can be connected to the synthesizer.  The connector is represented by a standard "jack", so you can connect a simple headset from a phone or computer only using a special adapter.  It can be purchased at any electronics, radio or musical instrument store.  There is a USB input, so the tool can be used as a midi keyboard, which greatly expands the capabilities of the Casio CTK 3000. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  For its price category (10-15 thousand rubles, depending on configuration), this synthesizer has great potential, but it also has drawbacks.  Owners note the insufficient volume of the built-in speakers.  Four watts is enough for playing at home, but playing in a team with other instruments, a concert on the street or in a spacious room requires the connection of additional external speakers.  It is inconvenient that the synthesizer does not remember user settings for tones: if the standard ones are not satisfied, then they will have to be changed every time again. </p>

    <p>  Many users who previously played only on an acoustic instrument note the softness of the keys, which makes playing on the Casio CTK 3000 uncomfortable.  However, this is due to the type of keyboard that is characteristic of almost all synthesizers.  If you want more rigidity, you should choose a tool with a half-weighted keyboard.  After several months of constant operation, the keys may begin to creak - some owners note this.  The creak is not strong, it only interferes when playing on a quiet sound.  To fix it, you need to disassemble the keyboard mechanism and lubricate it. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  To the advantages of the synthesizer, users include a clean and beautiful sound, really similar to the sound of an acoustic instrument, and, oddly enough, ease when playing: apparently the lack of hardness of the keys is not a drawback for everyone.  Numerous timbres and a sampling function allow you to diversify the performance, many mention ease of transportation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="casio ctk 3000 instruction" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45314/1776465.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Battery life, according to owners, is both a plus and a minus of this tool.  On the one hand, the ability to give street concerts is excellent, but on the other hand, the everyday purchase of batteries turns out to be quite expensive.  Someone solves this by independently converting the instrument to a battery, which deprives the product of a guarantee, and someone buys rechargeable batteries.  Casio CTK 3000 equipment may be different. Instructions, a music stand and a power supply are always included, but the presence of a stand, sustain pedal and headphones must be specified before purchase. </p>
