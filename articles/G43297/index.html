However, people who once visited it, dream of coming back here again. </p><p>  Despite the infrastructure that has recently begun to develop, there are already many hotels where the resort offers high-quality service.  One of those is Coconut Beach Resort 3 *.  We will consider it in the article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Koh Chang Island is a paradise in Thailand.  About 80% of its area is covered by jungle wilds, and some beaches are still considered wild and protected, being territories of nature reserves.  Only 20% of the island is built up with entertainment and health centers, as well as hotels. </p><p>  Coconut Beach Resort 3 * is located in the western part of the island, on Klong Prao Beach, which is the longest in these parts - at least half an hour is required to get from one end to the other. </p><p>  It is also worth knowing that the sea here is rather shallow the first 100 meters, and therefore this place is loved by travelers who are used to taking their children on vacation. </p><p>  It should also be noted that Sapparod Bay Ferry Terminal is a 20-minute drive from this hotel.  The nearest airport, located in the Thai city of Trat, is 25 kilometers from here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kohchangfitness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Klong Prao Beach" class="if uuid-2971418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2971418.jpg"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Coconut Beach Resort 3 * located on the island of Koh Chang has everything that a hotel of this level should have.

In February, December and January, here the temperature indicators of air are in the range + 29.8 ¬∞ C to + 31.0 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  In winter, it almost never rains, which is important, since local showers can spoil any excursion, and even more so a beach vacation.

However, even an expensive ticket in our time is realistic to buy, as it offers the opportunity to purchase in interest-free installments. </p><h2>  Centra Coconut Beach Resort 3 * </h2><p>  Finally, a few words to say about this hotel.  The name is very similar, but it is a completely different hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hikersbay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coconut beach resort 3 ko chang reviews" class="if uuid-2971426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2971426.jpg"></div><p>  It is located on the beach of Thong Tanot, near the islands of Koh Mutsum and Koh Tan.
