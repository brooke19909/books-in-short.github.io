Such a place is located 18 kilometers from Volgograd in the small town of Great October.  On one of its outskirts is a fairly popular holiday destination - Dubrovsky Park Club.  Volgograd with its international airport remains far away.  It offers a cozy private beach, a children's playground, an outdoor pool and a 24-hour reception. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.676953" data-lng="44.75762199999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/4/2/2/5422.png"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The park club is located in a shady oak grove on the Erica coast in the large Volgo-Akhtubinskaya floodplain natural park.  Remoteness from noisy tracks and bustling cities is the key to good rest with both soul and body.  On the camp site there are houses with terraces, numerous recreation areas, a bathhouse and an equestrian club. </p><p>  The bath, by the way, is built on the shore.  It is a log house from the Arkhangelsk pine.  All necessary bath accessories are leased.  After the steam room, you can plunge into the river, and then, wrapped in a warm blanket, conduct intimate conversations over a cup of herbal tea or beer.  The descent to the river is equipped with convenient steps.  In winter, for extreme people in the ice cut a window. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mirturbaz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel interior" class="if uuid-2601638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2601638.jpg"></div><p>  Near the pool a cozy relaxation area is organized.
