All owners of devices running this shell know that using Android is simple and convenient: you always have your favorite applications at hand, useful functions, and the interface is so flexible that you can almost completely change it at your discretion. </p><h2>  "Brick" - what is it? </h2><p>  "Android" began its journey back in 2009 and since then, developers have been engaged in the promotion and improvement of the shell, not knowing sleep and rest.  Systematic updates and new versions.  As a rule, a user buys a gadget with an operating system already installed on it and throughout this device‚Äôs ‚Äúlife‚Äù the firmware of this version (version of the operating system) remains.  But sometimes it needs to be reinstalled due to technical problems or at the user's own request.  Then you have to carry your favorite device to a service center, to an experienced master, and some are taken for a flashing on their own. </p><p>  Here, many novice users who are familiar with "Android" at a level no higher than installing applications from the Play Market, "grow wings."  Having read various instructions on the World Wide Web, they think that reinstalling the OS is a simple matter and that they can do it themselves.  In addition, they will save a certain amount, which they would take in a service center.  But soon such users realize that they have exaggerated their own strengths and it‚Äôs not going to complete the flashing properly. </p><p>  In this case, there are various scenarios.  The most unfortunate of them is when the phone turns into a brick.  You may have heard this wording before, but did not understand what it means.  "Bricking," or "bricking," of a device means that it partially or completely stops working.  That is, it does not turn on, does not respond to pressing buttons or connecting to a computer.  Is it possible to restore the brick "Android"?  Of course you can.  Hence the name - brick, because the functionality of the gadget is now no more than that of a stone, and now you can only crack nuts with it.  To bring the device to such a state is quite difficult, for this you need talent.  But we hasten to please you - the device is in any case subject to recovery, if you have not taken seriously the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnuts, and the device itself is safe and sound.  So, how to restore the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù brick? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Why can a device become a brick? </h2><p>  In order to understand how to restore the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù brick, you first need to understand the mechanism by which the device turns into it.  So to speak, go the opposite.  And once again, it would be nice to prove to users that without physical interference in the case and the internal device of a smartphone or tablet, you cannot completely ‚Äúkill‚Äù him and you can return to work in ways that we will discuss below.  We will interpret in simple language.  Your device has a <span>recovery console.</span>  It is located in the internal memory and does not have intersection points with the operating system, that is, these are two independent substances.  And even if during the flashing process crashes, malfunctions or errors occur, this same console will remain untouched and with it you can reinstall the firmware again.  In addition, you can back up the OS with all the necessary information to this console. </p>

    <h2>  No panic </h2><p>  The question is brewing: "And if something is wrong with the console itself and it disappears?"  Liquidation of the console is quite rare, but even if it happened, the operating system will remain in place, and you can restore the console from it using special utilities.  There are practically no cases when both the console and the operating system ‚Äúfly away‚Äù, you just need to have enchanting luck to destroy these two shells at the same time, but recovery is also possible in this version. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to restore a brick- "Android" at home </h2><p>  If you are good at technology, but for some reason you have turned the device into a brick, you can restore it at home.

    <h2>  Unable to log into the operating system </h2><p>  That is, the gadget itself gives signs of life, it can be turned on, but the firmware hangs endlessly, is reset, or just on the screen you see a boot or power on window, but in fact nothing happens.  Firstly, do not rush to conclusions.  For example, people who don‚Äôt understand how to restore the Chinese Android brick start to panic just a few minutes after the power-on screen appears, and after all, such a device needs even more time for ‚Äúreflection‚Äù than a high-quality device.  It is only possible to come to the realization that something went wrong only 10-15 minutes after switching on. </p><p>  Then your actions are as follows: completely turn off the device and again enter recovery mode (the system console, staying in which is an integral part of the flashing itself, so hardly need to talk about what it is and how to get there).  After that, you can try again to install the same firmware as the first time <span>(Install zip from sdcard -&gt; Chooze zip from sdcard)</span> or make a backup of the system <span>(Backup and restore -&gt; Restore)</span> .  Please note that if after the first attempt to reflash the device you could not enter the system, then perhaps the OS itself was of poor quality or not intended for your gadget, and you do not need to ‚Äúinstall‚Äù it again.  Choose a different version or restore the old one.  The same problems can occur if the battery was not enough to complete the process or memory to install a new system (the device model is outdated for the new firmware version). </p>

    <h2>  Unable to enter recovery mode after flashing </h2><p>  There is such an option that after flashing the OS itself works fine, but it does not exit the console.  Everything is fixable and much simpler than you think.  On the Play Market of the same name, you can find special programs designed to return recovery mode to you.  For example, applications such as <span>TWRP Manager or <span>Installer do an excellent job.</span></span>  <span><span>If your device specific and similar utilities did not help you, then there are other ways to restore the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù brick mode of the console.</span></span> <span><span><br></span></span> </p>
