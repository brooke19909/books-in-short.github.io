  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top themes for Android: review, features and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are already fed up with the look of the desktop - icons, animation and a standard menu, then you can diversify your mobile gadget with some new themes.  The latter are special software - launchers that allow you to unrecognizably change the visual component of your gadget. </p><p>  There are a lot of similar utilities on the network, and among all this diversity it is quite problematic to choose the really best themes for Android.  Some programs are poorly adapted to the platform, clumsy work, or even slow down your device.  So you need to be serious about choosing software. </p><p>  We will consider the best themes for Android, which are very popular and have a lot of positive feedback from users.  All the software described below can be found on Google Play, so there should be no problems with testing.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  CM Launcher 3D </h2><p>  This is one of the best themes for Android 7.0 and earlier.  Launcher offers a chic selection of tools to personalize your gadget from many categories: nature, cars, people, flowers, movies, sports, holidays and others. </p><p>  One of the best topics for Android is easy to manage and does not require any specific skills or knowledge.  At the first start, you will be greeted by the settings wizard and step by step will guide you through the entire functionality of the launcher.  The theme has its own curtain, at the opening of which you will be presented with basic management tools. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="CM Launcher 3D" class="if uuid-3038830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3038830.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, one of the best themes for "Android" has several more useful qualities.  So, she can optimize the battery and clean the registry with RAM.  The theme is correctly integrated into the platform and, judging by the feedback from users, they have not seen any serious bugs. </p><h2>  Next Launcher 3D Shell Lite </h2><p>  This is also one of the best themes for Android 6.0 and older.  Advanced utility has impressive functionality and capabilities.  A rich library allows you to choose topics from almost any direction.  In addition, the built-in editor will help to make your own design from an existing template, as well as change the animation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.likelylive.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.likelylive.com/android-top-paid-apps/"><img itemprop="image" alt="best themes for android" class="if uuid-3038831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3038831.jpg"></div><p>  One of the best themes for Android has its own store.  Moreover, most of the wallpapers, icons and other ‚Äúdecorations‚Äù can be downloaded for free.  In addition to topics in the store, you can find additional utilities in different directions: energy-saving, flashlights, alarms, games and more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Judging by the feedback from users, no problems with integration into the operating system were noticed.  Some experience difficulties with specific branded shells of ultra-budget gadgets, but for the most part the reason for this is the advertising code built into the platform ("Aliexpress", "Ebay", etc.), and not the topic itself. </p><h2>  TSF Launcher 3D Shell </h2><p>  This theme also deserves to be installed on your smartphone or tablet.  It has rich capabilities for personalizing the platform interface.  There are settings for curtains, animation, processing of the main menu, desktop grid and more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="appmirror.net" data-author=": " data-source="https://appmirror.net/android/tsf-launcher-3d-shell/"><img itemprop="image" alt="best themes for android 6 0" class="if uuid-3038832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3038832.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the competent optimization of the topic.  The developers have worked hard on the code, so the launcher does not slow down even on older gadgets and platforms of past generations.  The interface of the theme itself is simple and understandable even for beginners. </p><p>  You don‚Äôt have to wander along the branches of the menu, because all the main tools are presented on the main theme settings screen and, if necessary, are transferred to a convenient curtain.  Judging by the reviews, there were also no problems with integration to the platform. </p><h2>  Techno-theme "3D glass" </h2><p>  The theme attracts primarily with its elaborate 3D-design.  Here it is implemented as it should and is not buggy at every opportunity, as it is observed in other 3D launchers.  The theme supports colorful animations for the desktop and wallpapers, and also has amazing soundtrack. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lastbutton.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://lastbutton.ru/apps/themes/tekhno-tema-3d-steklo/"><img itemprop="image" alt="best themes for android 7 0" class="if uuid-3038833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3038833.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the interface involves several nice widgets, including weather ones.  Despite the 3D component, the theme works pretty fast even on budget gadgets.  And users in their reviews do not note the presence of any serious visualization problems. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the developer with the latest update worked on the code, and now the theme integrates perfectly even in the fastidious gadgets from Samsung, Asus and Sony.  About some critical crashes or glitches reviews do not mention. </p>
