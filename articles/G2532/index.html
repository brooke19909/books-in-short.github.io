The exotic beauty of the country amazes tourists.  One of the most secluded resorts is the Samana Peninsula in the Dominican Republic.  It is preferred by connoisseurs of an individual relaxing holiday.  It is here that you can fully enjoy your vacation in the bounty style. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Coconut groves, clean rivers, mysterious caves, picturesque waterfalls and deserted sandy beaches - all this you can see on the Samana Peninsula in the Dominican Republic.  Throughout the year, you can enjoy dolphins and manatees in the sea waters.  And in winter, the famous humpback whales appear in the sea, which are the largest in the world. </p><h2>  Famous peninsula </h2><p>  Samana is a peninsula of the famous Dominican Republic.  It is located in the north-eastern part of the country.  On its territory there are three large cities - Sanchez, Las Terenas and Santa Barbara de Samana, as well as a lot of small villages.  In general, the entire Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces, and so Samana is one of them with the administrative center in the city of Santa Barbara de Samana.  Very often, tourists get confused and believe that Samana is the Dominican Republic.  But actually it is not.  Although near the peninsula is the islet of Cayo Levantado, which is considered a real paradise for lovers of diving and snorkeling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samana Dominican Republic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2168941.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are three airports in the province, and only one of them has received international status.  In cities there are hotels offering all-inclusive holidays.  However, most of the establishments are small hotels for a modest budget vacation. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The greatest amount of precipitation in the territory of Samana (Dominican Republic) falls on the period from January to March.  It is worth noting that the province is surrounded by mountains, and therefore there are no hurricanes here.  For this reason, the resort is the most peaceful region in the country.  In the rainy period, showers can be quite long and last up to several days.  But after that, beautiful dry weather immediately begins, allowing you to relax on the beach. </p><p>  In fairness, it should be noted that throughout the year on the peninsula, the air temperature remains almost unchanged.  Its fluctuations can be only a few degrees.  The hottest month is August.  During this period, the average temperature is about 32 degrees.  And January and February are considered the coolest.  During these months, air temperature is kept within + 29 degrees. </p><h2>  Resort Transport </h2><p>  From the airport to one of the three cities of the resort can be reached by taxi.  But on Saman itself (Dominican Republic) it is easiest to get around on a rented car, bike or scooter.  As for public transport, it is also available in the resort and is represented by minibuses and buses.  In addition, a mode of transport such as a taxi is quite developed here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beaches in Samana </h2><p>  The beaches in Samana (Dominican Republic) can safely claim the title of the best in the country.  All of them are located along the coast of the peninsula.  Which one is the best for tourists is hard to say.  It all depends on where you prefer to swim: in the ocean waters or in the waters of the bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peninsula of adobe dominican republic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2168943.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Tourists should know that the east and north coast is washed by the Atlantic Ocean, but the south coast overlooks Samana Bay. </p><p>  One of the most famous beaches of the resort is Bonita, the length of which reaches 13 kilometers.  It is located near the town of Las Terrenas.  The beach is convenient for those resort guests who prefer Las Terrenas hotels and villas.  The coast in this area has a white sand coating.  The beach is separated from the coast by a wide strip of palm trees.  Conventionally, it can be divided into two parts: western and eastern.  The western section of Bonita is calm, there are never waves.  But on the east coast quite often quite high waves are observed.  For this reason, surfers like to relax here. </p><h2>  Cayo Levantado Island </h2><p>  On the island of Cayo Levantado is the beach of the same name.  It is of interest to those holidaymakers who prefer a relaxing stay and are accommodated in a local hotel.  But, in principle, everyone can come to the island.  To do this, you can use the services of the local population for transportation by boat.  Moreover, from the promenade in Santa Barbara de Samana can also be reached by boat.  The beach becomes incredibly in demand during the mating season of humpback whales, since it is very convenient to observe the behavior of animals from the coast of the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samana dominican republic reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2168946.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Colorado Beach is located in the east of Samana (Dominican Republic).  It belongs to the wild part of the coast of the peninsula.  Partially it is occupied by the private sector, but the rest is open to free access.  There is no developed infrastructure, but you can admire turtles, which are very many on the beach. </p><p>  But the Rincon beach is the real pride of not only the resort, but the entire Dominican Republic.  By the way, Rincon entered the top ten <span>best beaches in the world.</span>  It is located on the coast of a picturesque bay.  Nearby begins the territory of one of the resort's national parks.  The beach is surrounded by plantations of coconut trees and mountain slopes.  Its coast is covered with fine coral sand and washed by the waters of the Atlantic. </p><p>  Tourists will certainly be interested in the wild Fronton Beach.  Its feature is in its natural beauty.  On all sides it is surrounded by mountain slopes covered with lush tropical vegetation. </p><h2>  Interesting places Samana </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine, but in the territory of Saman (Dominican Republic) there are six national parks.  The most popular and largest of them is the Los Aitises Park.  Numerous tourists are attracted by its pristine beauty, unique animals and tropical vegetation.  In the park you can have a good time walking in the jungle or boating.  It is also worth visiting the caves, which still have drawings of the very first inhabitants of the island - the Taino Indians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Samana Island" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2168950.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about the best places in Samana (Dominican Republic), then it is worth recalling the beautiful El Limon waterfall, which is certainly worth a visit.  According to an ancient legend, those who bathe in the waters of a waterfall are threatened with countless riches.  True or not, it‚Äôs hard to say.  Probably worth checking the veracity of the legend yourself.  True, the road to the waterfall is not very simple, but incredibly picturesque.  It lies between the majestic mountains.  As a vehicle, tourists are offered only horses.  But after a magnificent waterfall, guides offer to go to the ranch, where you can see how cocoa and coffee are grown.  Judging by the reviews of Samana (Dominican Republic), such sightseeing trips are the most popular among tourists. </p><p>  In the mountains and in the parks for tourists they organize trips by jeeps and horses, which makes the excursion even more exotic. </p><h2>  Peninsula bay </h2><p>  The resort of Samana (Dominican Republic) is famous for its whales.  From January to March, large flocks of humpback whales sail from the Atlantic to the peninsula.  Animals overcome long distances, of the order of three to five thousand kilometers, and sometimes even up to seven thousand kilometers, if they swim from the coast of Norway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Samana Hotels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2168961.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Whales sail in the warm bay of Samana for breeding.  Young kittens frolic here, entertaining the public.  Whales are generally one of the main attractions of the peninsula.  Local residents even came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing boat trips around the bay in search of animals, which are determined by the produced fountains.  Lucky to see a whale at close range is a big question.  Still, wildlife is not a zoo, and animals do not submit to our whims.  Nevertheless, such trips are incredibly interesting for tourists, because they allow you to experience real extreme and excitement.  Especially nice if you can get closer to the animals. </p><h2>  Saman Hotels in Dominican Republic </h2><p>  The resort has suitable hotels for recreation.  In general, the peninsula is good for those guests who prefer a relaxing holiday at sea.  Going to Samana, of course, you should not count on finding fashionable establishments here.  But the resort is gradually developing on its territory new hotels are being built.  The best institutions on the peninsula are: ‚ÄúLuxuri Bahia The Principle of Cavo Levantado Don Pablo Collection‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlbahara Hotel‚Äù, ‚ÄúSublim Samana‚Äù and ‚ÄúHotel Alicei‚Äù.  Most likely, in the near future, guests will be able to offer a wider selection of hotels.  The best hotel complexes are located near the resort towns.  They are equipped with swimming pools, nice rooms and equipped grounds.  According to tourists, these establishments are great for a comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Museum of the Dead </h2><p>  Holidays in Samana (Dominican Republic) is not only an opportunity to lie idly on the coast, but an opportunity to see the most interesting places of the resort.  One of them can be considered a museum of sunken ships, which is located in Santa Barbara de Samana.  The facility will appeal even to children.  Its exhibits are the most interesting finds, raised from the bottom of the sea.  In the museum you can find many interesting facts about wrecks and how they are raised by the seabed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samana Dominican Republic rest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2168964.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you are planning to visit Santa Barbara de Samana, then you should know that a carnival is held in the city every year in February.  Look at the colorful show is very interesting. </p><h2>  Reviews for Samana (Dominican Republic) </h2><p>  According to tourists, Samana is the most wild and at the same time beautiful part of the Dominican Republic.  If you are an admirer of the natural beauty of an exotic country, then you should definitely visit the peninsula.  Its exotic vegetation is significantly different from what tourists are used to seeing in the famous resorts of the country.  Civilization has not yet reached and has not yet managed to spoil the whole beauty of the region.  Local beaches are very deserted and almost devoid of infrastructure, but this is their appeal.  Even the ocean here is a little different.  Although its waters are not as clear as in Punta Cana, but the underwater world is richer and more diverse.  The peninsula has not yet been mastered by tourists, of whom there are not as many as in other regions of the Dominican Republic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samana Dominican Republic beaches" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2168966.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Even the largest of the three cities - Santa Barbara de Samana - is more like a village than a city in our understanding.  If you are a supporter of noisy resorts and night walks, then Samana is definitely not for you.  It is good to relax with your family with children or couples in love.  The peninsula is also very popular among surfers, as well as lovers of diving and snorkeling. </p><h2>  Local Travel Reviews </h2><p>  Thanks to the pristine beauty of the nature of the region, there are many interesting places of a natural nature.  But it is worth knowing: if you are going on an excursion, then do not wait for a comfortable bus.  All travel to the natural attractions of the resort will have to be done on horseback or in jeeps.  Such trips here are incredibly popular.  The use of such vehicles is quite justified by the roads that run along the mountains and trails, so no cars are even discussed.  Tourists definitely recommend visiting the local waterfall.  Many are impressed not so much by himself as by the stunning landscapes on the way to him. </p><p>  The national parks of the resort are also noteworthy.  Well, in order for the trip to Samana to become a real holiday, you should go on a sea tour to see real whales.  Unfortunately, such entertainment is available only a few months a year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samana Dominican Republic best places" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2168969.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, Samana is the most beautiful and green place in the Dominican Republic.  The beaches of the resort deserve the most attention, because it is for their sake that tourists come.  The sparsely populated sandy coast with thickets of palm trees - what could be more beautiful?  Especially guests recommend going to the island of Levantado.  This is where you can truly enjoy the privacy and sea.  The magical Dominican Republic is a paradise for lovers of beach resorts. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In general, if you want something unusual, then you should go to Samana.  Of course, the choice of hotels in the region is not as wide as in other well-known resorts in the country, but there are still good hotels and more modest hotel complexes, so you can always find the right accommodation.  Tourists recommend the peninsula to those who love nature.  If tropical beauty is not indifferent to you, then it makes sense to choose a more civilized resort with a developed infrastructure. </p>
