  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mainz city in Germany: history and interesting places</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Mainz in Germany is one of the oldest territories in the country with a rich history and culture.  It was founded before the new era by the Romans.  Previously, the city was called Mogontiacium, in honor of the ancient god Mogon.  Soon after its formation, it became one of the three centers of the region.  Currently, the population of the city of Mainz in Germany is more than two hundred thousand people, and the area is about one hundred square kilometers. </p><h2>  Mainz Tourism </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the city was founded by the Romans, many attractions of the times of the empire have been preserved in Mainz. </p><p>  The village itself is small and quite cozy - it is an ideal place for family tourism or for those people who love peace and quiet. </p><p>  There are several ways to get to the city.  The first - the fastest, but expensive - is a plane to Frankfurt, and after that the bus is already to Mainz.  Fortunately, the cities are only 30 kilometers from each other.  The second way is a railroad crossing.  Of course, the city of Mainz in Germany can be reached by personal transport. </p><p>  The city has a fairly large number of hotels, so there will be no difficulties with accommodation.  Shopping lovers will also have something to do here - Mainz is full of various shops. </p><p>  Once in this wonderful city, every tourist should try two traditional Mainz products: Spundek√§se and Handk√§se cheeses. </p><h2>  Cathedral in Mainz, Germany </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Germany Mainz" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50521/2203129.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The most famous attraction of the city is the Mainz Cathedral.  It was built in the Romanesque style with elements of Baroque and Gothic, which is typical for <span>German architecture.</span>  Its construction began in the tenth century and lasted more than two centuries.  Its other name is the Cathedral of St. Martin and St. Stephen.  It presents many works of medieval sculpture and a collection of religious heritage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Church of christ </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="university of mainz germany" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50521/2203131.jpg"></div></h2><p>  This church was erected much later than the Mainz Cathedral and was built in opposition to it.  The Church of Christ is a Protestant church.  During World War II, it was badly damaged and its restoration began only in 1952.  Now the premises of the church are a place where various exhibitions, concerts, etc. are held. </p><h2>  Gutenberg Museum <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral in Mainz Germany" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50521/2203132.jpg"></div></h2><p>  It was in Mainz that the first printer <span>Johannes Gutenberg</span> was born <span>.</span>  All excursions around the city necessarily go through a museum named after him.  Here are Johann's personal items, as well as his printing house and hand press.  He began his book printing business in the 1940s.  In general, in Mainz, a street is named after Gutenberg and much more, this is not surprising, because he made a great contribution to the history of not only Germany, but the whole world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Museum of Antique Shipping </h2><p>  There are very few museums of ancient shipping like the one in Mainz in the world, which is why it attracts so much attention.  There are warships, ordinary boats and canoes of the Roman Empire.  It is noteworthy that some of these vessels were discovered during the construction of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life in mainz germany" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/50521/2203130.jpg"></div>
