    <p>  An extensive number of rooms allows you to comfortably accommodate and have a great time.  All apartments have outdoor terraces with great views.  The best rooms are those with a sea view from the window. </p><p>  The rooms are made in a modern style and equipped with good appliances, they even have coffee machines (the machines are equipped with capsules, the cost of each 40 baht).  Two bottles of drinking water are brought to the room daily.  As for the cleaning, it is carried out quite qualitatively and tourists have no complaints.  All wishes can be voiced by the maid, and they will try to help you.  When a language barrier arises, sign language always saves.  By the way, Russian is understood only at the reception, and part of the staff speaks English. </p><p>  According to guests, the hotel’s apartments are beautiful and functional, they have everything that makes the stay not only comfortable, but also pleasant.  Some rooms have traces of scuffs on furniture and interior items, but this does not overshadow the stay.  Some rooms have a smell of sewage in the morning.  If you are lucky enough to live in such apartments, then you can contact the reception with a request to replace the room.  The staff of the institution willingly makes contact and tries to solve the problem.  All Thais are incredibly smiling and welcoming, and the hotel staff is very cordial. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Description of Centara Grand Phratamnak <strong> </strong>  Pattaya 5 * would be incomplete, if not a few words about the quality of food.  As with any Thai hotel, guests can choose their own meal plan.  Breakfast for guests is served in the form of a buffet in the main restaurant, which is located in the lobby.  A wide range of restaurant dishes is praised by all its customers.  In addition, the hotel has <span>a la carte restaurants,</span> but the food in them is quite expensive, so tourists prefer to visit the nearest restaurants and cafes for a change, where you can taste a variety of national dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="centara grand phratamnak resort pattaya 5 pattaya" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1834248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Which institution to give preference to, it is up to you to have a more complete picture of Thai cuisine, vacationers recommend first visiting several restaurants.  Unfortunately, many cafes do not have a Russian-language menu, so often tourists order dishes at random.  Otherwise, there are no nutritional problems.  Near the hotel there is a small market where you can buy delicious fruits. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists note the high level of service and very friendly hotel staff.  Settlement takes place immediately upon arrival, without delay or delay.  At the reception, tourists take a deposit of 1,000 baht per night (1 baht is 1.7 rubles).  The money is sealed in an envelope and returned to you at the time of departure.  The presence of Russian-speaking staff makes registration quick. </p><p>  On the roof of the hotel there is a beautiful, but small pool with a wonderful terrace for relaxation and a unique seascape.  All guests are impressed by the beautiful hotel lobby with stunning chandeliers and a huge aquarium.  At the reception, vacationers can rent a bike, where you can travel around the resort.  The presence of such a simple vehicle will allow you to see a lot of interesting things.  Daily shuttles to the city center are not the only transport.  Near the hotel there are taxis and tuk-tuk, which for 200-300 baht will take you anywhere in the resort at any time. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The complex is quite suitable for beach holidays and business trips.  But lovers of active nightlife, perhaps you should choose a hotel for yourself, located closer to the center of the resort.  Most of the tourists are Chinese and Russian, Europeans can be seen here extremely rarely.  Since the complex is quite large, there is no feeling of overcrowding with tourists, which is very important for a calm measured rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="centara grand phratamnak pattaya 5 pattaya" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1834253.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the lobby, everyone can buy sightseeing tours to see the local beauty.  Thailand is a stunningly beautiful and interesting country with an unusual culture that is worthy of your attention. </p><p>  In general, the hotel makes the most pleasant experience, as evidenced by many admired reviews.  According to tourists, the modern institution really matches the five stars on the sign.  It is very pleasant that the complex still lives up to the expectations of its regular guests. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  If you go to Pattaya for a beach holiday, then the proximity of the sea is the main criterion for choosing a hotel.  In this regard, the Centara Grand Pratamnak is an excellent place, since the complex is located in close proximity to the coast.  The hotel's beach is not very large, but equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas.  Unfortunately, the cafe does not work on it, but many sellers with shrimps, mussels and other local delicacies constantly walk along the shore.  The sea in the hotel area, as in the whole of Pattaya, is a bit unclear, but always warm. </p>

During the day, nails and bags are washed ashore.  But such a picture is almost the norm for Thailand.
