After all, the more details you own, the less chance you will experience of disappointment when you arrive on a long-awaited overseas vacation.  In many respects it concerns the issue of choosing a hotel.  Therefore, today, travelers not only study the official description of hotels and are interested in the opinions of travel agents, but also try to independently get acquainted with as many reviews of real people who happen to be in the place they are interested in.  This allows you to make a more complete and reliable picture.  To save you time and effort, we offer you the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at the Golden Coast Resort &amp; Spa in Vietnam. </p>

    <p>  Just note that almost all tourists were satisfied with the choice made.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of travelers, they all liked the rooms offered at Golden Coast Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Phan Thiet).  So, according to our compatriots, the apartments here are very spacious, with high ceilings, stylish decoration, high-quality wooden furniture and good appliances.  True, some guests complained about the loudly working air conditioner, but, as they themselves stated, you quickly get used to it and then do not even pay attention to this detail.  Also, guests say that the rooms have everything that you might need during your stay - shower gels, shampoo, soap, slippers, bathrobes, toothpaste and a toothbrush and much more, including even a rain umbrella.  As for cleaning, they spend it every day.  Towels here, according to tourists, are updated every other day, and bed linen is changed a couple of times a week.  In general, the guests were satisfied with the quality of cleaning. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition, in the reviews they note very high-quality white towels (both for the bathroom and the beach), as well as bedding.  Tourists also pay attention to comfortable and large beds, sleeping on which is a pleasure.  As for check-in, regardless of the time of your arrival at the hotel, you will be offered to enter the room almost immediately.  In addition, upon check-in, you will find a present from your hotel in your apartment in the form of a large basket of exotic fruits. </p><h2>  Location, Territory </h2><p>  As many tourists note in their comments, the Golden Coast Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel is located quite far from the airport.  Therefore, after the flight, you still have to spend from 4 to 6 hours on the road (depending on what you will get to the hotel on).  According to travelers, the path is somewhat exhausting, but this hotel is worth it.  After all, once you get here, you will immediately forget about fatigue and a long journey.  As for the hotel surroundings, the infrastructure is only developing here.  So if you want to have fun, you can go to Phan Thiet or <span>Mui Ne.</span>  This can be done either by public transport or taxi, or by renting a scooter.  By the way, experienced travelers warn of very heavy traffic.  In addition, many drivers do not follow the rules of the road and move quite randomly.  Therefore, you must be very careful when driving. </p>

    <p>  As for the hotel territory, almost all tourists were satisfied with it.  So, according to them, it is, although small, but very well-groomed, green.  Here you will see a lot of coconut palms and other exotic plants, cute little ponds, etc. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in Golden Coast Resort &amp; Spa 4 * includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, in the morning the food here is very tasty and varied.  So, for breakfast in the restaurant a buffet is presented, represented by several types of side dishes, sausage and cheese (and sometimes fish) slices, a variety of fresh fruits, eggs, soup, pastries and desserts prepared in different ways.  Many guests praise the local coffee very much. </p>

    <p>  As for lunch and dinner, you can eat both in the hotel restaurant (for a fee), and in one of the cafes in the vicinity.  According to travelers, almost everywhere food is very tasty and inexpensive.  Many tourists are advised to visit different cafes to try various dishes of local cuisine. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As tourists note in their reviews, the big advantage of the hotel we are considering is that it is located on the beach.  So the beach can be reached in just a couple of minutes.  According to our compatriots, the beach here is simply excellent - wide, sandy, with a large length.  It has many sun loungers and parasols, so there is more than enough space for everyone. </p><p>  However, some travelers complain that quite often the wind blows from the sea.  As a result, waves form on the water, which makes comfortable swimming impossible.  Often the wind begins to blow after lunch.  Therefore, hotel guests try to relax on the beach in the morning. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Golden Coast Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Vietnam) does not offer special fun for its guests.  After all, it is more suitable for people planning to relax in a calm, measured environment, enjoying the wonderful nature and the rustle of the waves.  Therefore, fun discos and noisy animation you will not find here. </p><p>  But the hotel has a rather large swimming pool with a sun terrace and a bar with a wide selection of drinks.  According to tourists, it is very clean, and the water in it is always warm and pleasant.  The hotel also has a spa.  Many of our compatriots enjoyed massages here.  They report that the services in the salon are very high quality and at a very reasonable price. </p><p>  If you have a desire to visit a nightclub or disco, then you can go to Mui Ne.  As for excursions, in the vicinity of the hotel there is a mass of travel agencies that offer trips to the main local attractions. </p>
