    <p>  Human language is a muscular organ located in the <span>oral cavity.</span>  <span>The structure of the</span> language directly determines the properties and functions of this organ.  This organ is of great importance, as it provides the ability to perceive and distinguish taste, and it is also responsible for speech. </p><p>  <strong>The structure of human language</strong> </p><p>  So, as already mentioned, the tongue is a large muscular organ.  It consists of three parts: </p><ul><li>  The root of the tongue is the part that attaches to the hyoid bone and lower jaw. </li><li>  The body is a large part of the organ. </li><li>  The apex is the most mobile part of the tongue facing forward. </li></ul><p>  The root of the tongue is located between the <span>molars</span> and is covered with the mucous membrane of the so-called palatine-lingual arch.  Next is the largest part of the organ - its body.  It lies between the branches of the lower jaw.  The upper part of the tongue, which faces the sky and pharynx, is called the back - it is divided by a deep sagittal groove.  The lower part is only partially free, as it is attached to the muscles closer to the pharynx.  The lateral surfaces of the organ converge into a bridle, which can be seen by lifting the tongue to the sky. </p><p>  On top of the organ is covered with a mucous membrane, which contains the lingual papillae.  Interestingly, in the back of the tongue there is an accumulation of lymphoid formations that form the so-called lingual tonsil. </p><p>  In the mucous membrane of the tongue, as well as in the submucosal layer, contains a mass of small salivary glands, which synthesize mainly a mixed secret. </p><p>  The structure of the language also explains its functions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The tongue is involved in the mechanical processing of food - it mixes food with saliva and takes part in the formation of food breasts. </li><li>  The tongue provides the beginning of the act of swallowing - as soon as the food breast reaches the root, it is no longer possible to stop the swallowing reflex. </li><li>  Due to the presence of mechanical and taste buds, it is an <span>organ of touch</span> and taste. </li><li>  Language is involved in the formation of articulate, human speech. </li><li>  Since its <span>mucous membrane is</span> characterized by high permeability, this makes it possible to quickly absorb some useful substances, including drugs. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Tongue: structure of the sensitive papillae</strong> </p><p>  Sensitive papillae are located in groups along the entire surface.  It is customary to distinguish the following types: </p><ul><li>  Conical and filiform papillae are mechanical and tactile receptors. </li><li>  Mushroom-shaped and located at the edges of the tongue and near its apex.  It contains flavor bulbs. </li><li>  Trough papillae are the largest formations that have taste buds.  Their number can range from seven to twelve pieces.  They are located in the form of the Roman numeral V. </li><li>  Leaf papillae are located predominantly at the edges of the tongue and also act as <span>taste buds.</span> </li></ul><p>  Nerve endings depart from the taste buds, which are part of the <span>taste analyzer</span> and lead to the corresponding centers of the cerebral cortex. </p><p>  <strong>Language structure and taste perception</strong> </p><p>  Taste bulbs are not only on the surface of the tongue.  They can also be seen on the posterior surface of the epiglottis cartilage and the nasal surface of the sky.  Now you know the basic principles of the structure of the language, so it‚Äôs worth considering how taste is perceived. </p><p>  It is customary to distinguish four basic tastes: salty, bitter, sweet and sour.  Each of them differs in a certain group of taste buds. </p><p>  The standard carrier of salty taste is sodium chloride, to which papillae located on the edges of the tongue and in front of it react.  But the sour taste is perceived by the lateral edges of the back of the organ.  This taste depends on the pH of the substance. </p><p>  It is customary to associate a sweet taste with the presence of sugar in food, although a similar reaction develops for glycerin and for some proteins and amino acids.  Detectors are the so-called G-proteins.  Taste buds that respond to sweets are located on the tip of the tongue.  The bitter taste is perceived by the same G-proteins.  The collection of receptors is at the root of the tongue. </p>
