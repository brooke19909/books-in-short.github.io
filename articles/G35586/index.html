    <p>  There are tourists who were disappointed by Olesya (Loo), a hotel.  The reviews indicate that some members of the staff are unfair to their duties.  So, the authors share their dissatisfaction regarding room service: wet cleaning is not carried out regularly, linen is rarely changed (contrary to the indicated norm: every 5 days), towels, etc.  However, for the most part, the reviews are positive, and if you want to relax in this hotel, you will not regret your decision. </p>
