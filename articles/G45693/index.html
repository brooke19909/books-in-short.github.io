    <ul><li>  It is worth a look at the dolphinarium.  Several times a month they organize an unusual show with these animals.  There is a special program for the youngest visitors, it will give a good mood. </li><li>  On the streets you can see playgrounds, and in shopping centers there are good game rooms. </li></ul><p>  Right in the central part of the capital of Belarus there is a sandy beach.  On hot days, it will be an excellent substitute for a vacation at sea.  You can stay in any comfortable hotel.  In this place, you can distinguish more than ten good institutions for living. </p><h2>  Cultural program </h2><p>  If you wish, you can independently arrange for the whole family a cultural and entertainment program.  It will be interesting for school children.  In total, there are three places that deserve special attention: </p><ul><li>  The Chagall House Museum in Vitebsk was built at the beginning of the 20th century.  In it you can get acquainted with the history of this legendary man and his family. </li><li>  Museum of the History of the Military Military District in Minsk.

Feedback from them can only be seen with positive content.  First of all, they emphasize cleanliness and order in everything.  In a small country, it‚Äôs a shame to even throw a candy wrapper on the road.  Locals are very welcoming and friendly.  They will be happy to tell you the way and even lead you to the right place.  Unlike Russia, there are flat roads.  In particular, this country is loved by motorists.  Parents claim that they will definitely come with their children to this place again.  Excellent leisure, clean air, a huge number of water sources - all this makes the rest as useful and fun as possible. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are also negative reviews.  Where to relax in Belarus in the summer is understandable, but many have problems with currency exchange. </p><p>  We have to wait a few days for a bank transaction.  It is recommended to prepare funds in advance.  Almost all hotels are located far from the center, if there is no personal transport, then there may be inconvenience.  Many tourists feel sorry for the locals, because with a small salary they are forced to buy expensive food. </p><h2>  Some reasons to come to Belarus </h2><p>  Why is it worth spending your vacation in Belarus?  Unlike other countries, you do not have to make a visa here.  You can be in this place any amount of time.  Almost all people understand Russian, which is very convenient!  Among other things, there are a huge number of beautiful places that I want to admire forever! </p>
