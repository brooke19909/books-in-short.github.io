  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to Crochet Booties</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many ways to <span>knit</span> booties.  This booties and socks, made using 5 knitting needles, with sewn on soles and crocheted welt, and booties-marshmallows, knitted on two knitting needles.  But here we will look at ways to <span>crochet booties.</span> </p><p>  So, why do we often <span>crochet booties?</span>  Yes, just this method is the fastest and most time-consuming!  In just an hour or two (it depends on the skill of the needlewoman to handle this device), you will already have small soft slippers for the baby in your hands.  Although the same, but only larger, they are quite suitable for an adult: warm, easy and convenient! </p><p>  Since <span>knitting booties</span> follows from yarn, you first need to choose the one that is most suitable for knitting.  For example, for babies it is best to buy natural Angora wool or mohair yarn, as small children may not respond to artificial materials in the best way.  For adults, it is quite possible to make slippers from more rigid synthetics. </p><p>  <strong>The first way that tells how to crochet booties from a toe</strong> </p><p>  These slippers begin to weave from the toe or, in another way, from the nose.  Therefore, they collect 5 air loops and fix it in the ring.  Then they begin to perform circular rows with single crochet, increasing their number so that to get a toe - hat.  When the ‚Äúcap‚Äù will cover all the toes of the foot, the application can be stopped and continue knitting with regular round columns. </p><p>  Thus, even without adding columns, you should tie the entire toe to the rise.  Then we go into knitting with a turn, since we need to leave an opening for the entry of the legs into the booties.  The knitting is the same - single crochet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When the booties are ready in size, in the middle of the row you should begin to reduce the columns, knitting together at once in three.  So we get a rounding on the heel, which will soon come to naught.  When trying on a foot, slippers should fit tightly on the sole. </p><p>  Now you should go directly to the design of the appearance of the booties.  If you want to make soft knitted slippers bright, then you can use contrasting yarn for decoration.  She needs to tie the welt up, highlighting the sole, and make a bow-tie on the toe, just as the top of the ‚Äúmoccasins‚Äù is formed.  Having tied the neck of booties, this can be done. </p><p>  But some needlewomen decorate <span>crocheted booties with a crochet</span> ‚Äúneck‚Äù with lace or a stand-up collar ‚Äî anyone likes it as much as possible.  You can make the ties by stretching along the neck the lace from the air chain with tassels or pompons.  You can sew a flower or a bow in front.  By the way, these decorations are also quite acceptable to do with a hook. </p><p>  <strong>The second way, telling how to knit booties from the sole</strong> </p><p>  You should tie a chain of 7 loops.  The sole is knitted with crochet with a turn of the product after each row.  The first three rows are knitted without addition, then one column is added at the end of each row.  It is necessary to increase the value of the working row by 6 columns in total. </p><p>  Having knit so many rows without changing the number of columns so that the sole corresponds to the length of the foot from the heel to the tip of the little finger, it is necessary to begin the reduction of the columns, one in each.  Bringing the number of columns to the initial (7), you should knit three more rows and go to the clearance. </p><p>  At this stage, knitting is translated into circular.  The first row of the rise must be knitted, introducing a hook into the middle of each extreme loop of the sole and capturing the inner wall of the loop.  Thus, a welt is formed that separates the sole and the rise of booties. </p><p>  For lifting, you should knit without adding three or four rows, you can replace the single crochet with double crochet, so the work will go faster.  You can not break the thread - after sewing on the upper part of the lift, you will need to perform the processing of the ‚Äúneck‚Äù of the bootie, tie the lace or just a ‚Äúcollar‚Äù with ties.  This can be done according to the example of the first option described here. </p><p>  Now we will postpone this detail and begin to knit the upper part of the rise.  It runs like a sole, but not completely, but a little more than half.  Then the connected part should be sewn on top, tying the seam with a runk.  The thread can be cut off, and the one that remains from the sole can be made with a collar or lace. </p><p>  Do not forget to wash them after use to make baby items! </p>
