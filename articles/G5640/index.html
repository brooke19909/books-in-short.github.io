    <h2>  Winemaking - plus or minus? </h2><p>  The main thing is not to start an active holiday with a visit to the wineries, because they are too good: they will not be allowed to go to the mountains or to travel on ATVs, even the sea with its diving and windsurfing will go by the wayside.  This is Anapa.  The Beton Brut Hotel allows you to see how many grapes grow in the vicinity - thousands of hectares from the first minutes!  And it‚Äôs easy to find, after conducting the very first tasting, that here the drinks are the best in the country.  The reason for this is clear: such a life-giving soil, such a favorable climate that can well be compared with the Mediterranean.  Therefore, it is better to leave a visit to the wineries at least in the middle of vacation, and even better - on the very last day.  True, then there is a danger of missing your flight, but Anapa will also help here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hotel "Concrete Brut" has in its arsenal funds that will facilitate timely departure: they will wake up, they will call a taxi, they will take the luggage, they wave it with a pen.  However, it is interesting to know at least briefly the ancient secrets of winemakers, the differences between the various varieties of this noble drink, and how exciting it is to participate in the preparation of wine!  Here, traditions are closely intertwined with the latest technologies, to touch all of this is great happiness.  Here, not only Bacchus fans find it, even absolute teetotalers begin to distinguish taste and even discover their own favorite variety.  The choice of wine is not such a simple matter, but experienced sommeliers advise visitors here, and the tasting will tell you, teach you how to "lay out" a bouquet of each drink.  In addition, the knowledge that every intelligent person should possess will appear: combinations of wines and dishes, without which neither wine nor food will sparkle with all shades of their taste. </p>

    <h2>  Four star hotel </h2><p>  Beton Brut, a 4-star hotel, has so much to offer.  It seemed that everything that exists in the field of active recreation on the water was already listed.  But there is also diving and parasailing!  To watch the underwater life of the richest flora and fauna of the Black Sea - what could be more interesting?  But the ships that sunk during it, lying here and there on the seabed - isn't that exciting?  But there is also air!  Isn‚Äôt it nice to parachute over the sand of the beaches, where there are so many beautiful girls and each is already mentally close?  Almost everybody dreams of a chic Beton Brut room, a 4-star hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In a word, the vacation in Anapa is in no way inferior to the most famous resorts of foreign countries in terms of emotions, here it is quite European in quality and no less high level of service.

From the windows of one - a panoramic view of the sea, from the other two - a side view - on the right and left, the windows of the fourth facade look at the hotel grounds, which, in principle, is not inferior in color to the other three options.

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Holidays on the coast of the sea involves a complete switch from established everyday habits.  But it‚Äôs almost impossible to get rid of some even for a while.  The one whom relatives call a screen addict will be able to relax and amuse their habit after a day full of impressions, having delighted it with a wonderful movie, where your favorite actors famously spin the plot.  To do this, "Concrete Brut" invites all guests to its own modern cinema with excellent sound and a good screen. </p><p>  An evening in the cinema hall will be especially wonderful if the weather outside or there is a need to switch and relax, anticipating another adventure in the depths of the sea or in the saddle of an ATV.  The selection of films contains all genres and directions.  You can watch new films that did not have time at home, and the most favorite of the old ones. </p><h2>  "Bears rode a bicycle ..." </h2><p>  Almost every floor has its own (and often not one) playroom for children.  They especially like for some reason a constantly functioning room with a dry pool - they jump there for hours.  The teacher is not there, and therefore - poor parents, they somehow want to jump in the balls!  The teacher can leave the children from 9 am to 18. There they play with the teacher, they constantly master something, develop their abilities with the help of games, draw, read fairy tales.  Pupils love rooms with game consoles.  Still: these stimulants create new worlds that are surprisingly realistic.  This is a rather useful way to spend time if you do not take into account excursions and outdoor activities.  "Concrete Brut" has a whole range of games for such a plan. </p><p>  If the weather is good, then no one will be bored.  After all, the hotel has a bike rental service - this is the most correct way to get to know the magnificent nature of Anapa.  A ride along the coast at dawn or at sunset, when the beaches are deserted, and the human anthill sleeps for the most part - it's so romantic!  Many families prefer just such a plan for an active holiday full of sea wind, warm sun and good mood.  And how much time is saved!  Along the way, you can not only view landscapes, but also visit shops, buy souvenirs, and at the same time, your health improves - you need to turn your bike, pedals. </p>

    <h2>  Yet </h2><p>  Extra beds are organized easily: in the Deluxe, Superior, Standart rooms there is a folding Euro bed with a mattress.  Higher-class rooms are provided with a folding sofa.  The hotel has bicycles for children and adults, strollers and scooters for hire.  Each room has a safe - it does not depend on the class, the safe lock is digital.  In addition, there is a pantry for valuable luggage, and you can also leave all luggage there if the check-in is early or the check-out is late.  No need to worry about its safety.  Estimated time is 12.00, and arrival no earlier than 14.00.  These terms can only be violated if the director of the Beton Brut hotel allows.  Anapa is a beautiful city, and therefore it is better not to bother the directors, but simply to hand things over to the pantry under supervision and take a walk - even in the morning, at least in the evening, the surroundings are beautiful! </p><p>  The pool bar can be used until 23:00, the lobby bar is open 24 hours a day, the restaurant is open in the summer until 1 a.m., and in winter it ends at 23 p.m.  The disco in the street pavilion ends at 22 o‚Äôclock, but if a festive event is held, it can extend the fun to 23. The beach has sun loungers, mattresses, umbrellas, a bar tent with a TV.  Soft drinks, water and ice cream - for free.  There are also locker rooms, showers and toilets.  There is a volleyball court, there are simulators. </p>
