Some seek to make their mobile life as comfortable as possible, while others try to save as much as possible and are always in search of the cheapest rate.  Tele2 has few tariff plans, but each subscriber can find something suitable for himself. </p><h2>  "Classical" </h2><p>  When considering <span>tariff plans,</span> in the first place it is worth paying attention to the "Classic" option.  It can be safely called the cheapest tariff on Tele2 without the Internet.  It does not provide any daily and monthly charges.  The subscriber pays only for what he spends. </p><p>  Call charges vary by region.  For example, in Moscow and the Moscow Region there is a single cost for outgoing calls to all numbers in Russia.  She is 1.95 rubles.  in 1 minute of communication.  The same price is set for SMS messages to absolutely all numbers.  But in the Altai Territory, the conditions are slightly different: </p><ul><li>  1 minute of communication with a subscriber of any operator in the home region costs 0.60 rubles .; </li><li>  1 minute of conversation with a Tele2 Russia subscriber - 2 rubles; </li><li>  1 minute of conversation with a subscriber of another operator and another region - 9 rubles; </li><li>  SMS sending - or 1.50 rubles.  (in the home region), or 2.50 rubles.  (to another region of our country). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="karelinform.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Classic&quot; tariff without a monthly fee" class="if uuid-2632483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2632483.jpg"></div><h2>  “Unlimited on Tele2” service for the “Classic” tariff </h2><p>  The “classic” tariff plan, which is considered the cheapest Tele2 tariff without a monthly fee, is ideal for those subscribers who do not often make calls and do not talk for a long time with their interlocutors.  But people who actively use communication services are not satisfied with per-minute billing.  With long conversations, a rather large amount is debited from the balance sheet.  What tariff in this case may be the most profitable?  To answer this question, it is recommended to look at which subscribers of which operators you have to communicate most often. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If calls are mainly made to the numbers of the native operator of the home region, then you should not refuse the “Classic” option.  With one option, it can be turned into the cheapest Tele2 tariff.  Its name is "Unlimited on Tele2".  The name speaks for itself.  Subscribers can communicate absolutely limitlessly and for free.  A daily subscription fee is charged for the service.  Its size is only a few rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tokkoro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap tariffs &quot;Tele2&quot; for calls" class="if uuid-2632490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2632490.jpg"></div><h2>  "My Tele2" </h2><p>  Today, only a small number of subscribers make phone calls exclusively.  The Internet has long entered our lives.  Many subscribers go to the worldwide network for different purposes - someone communicates, someone watches a video, someone listens to music, and someone just reads the news. </p><p>  For those who use the Internet and make frequent calls to Tele2 numbers, the cheapest tariff will be My Tele2.  This tariff plan provides unlimited calls to Tele2 Russia and an Internet traffic package that includes several gigabytes.  There is a small daily monthly fee.  In Moscow and the Moscow region, it is 7 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Super Talk, My Online and My Online + </h2><p>  On such tariff plans as “Super Talk”, “My Online” and “My Online +”, a monthly subscription fee is set.  Its sizes in Moscow and the Moscow region are 200, 400 and 700 rubles.  At first glance, for subscribers looking for the cheapest Tele2 tariff, such options do not seem to be very suitable.  However, the listed tariff plans are very beneficial.  They are suitable for those people who not only make calls, but also use the Internet. </p><p>  All these tariffs are united by one single condition - unlimited calls to Tele2 numbers in Russia.  In addition, each tariff includes a package with free minutes for communication with subscribers of other operators of the home region or the whole of Russia (it is recommended to specify this for each tariff plan and each region, region, republic). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arizonalatinos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Favorable tariffs &quot;Tele2&quot; with a monthly fee" class="if uuid-2632505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2632505.jpg"></div><h2>  Small calculation </h2><p>  To understand the benefits of tariffs with a monthly fee, we will make a small calculation.  Take, for example, the “My Online +” tariff (with a subscription fee of 700 rubles), valid in Moscow and the Moscow Region.  Its options include: </p><ul><li>  30 GB of Internet; </li><li>  unlimited traffic on social networks and some applications; </li><li>  unlimited calls to Tele2 numbers in the home region and the whole country; </li><li>  800 free minutes to all other numbers in Russia. </li></ul><p>  We will not take into account the package with Internet traffic, as well as unlimited conditions.  We calculate the cost of 1 minute of conversation, taking into account the size of the monthly fee.  We get a value of approximately 87 kopecks.  For subscribers who often make calls to Russian numbers, such a tariff seems ideal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2dsl.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Choosing the best tariff &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-2632471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2632471.jpg"></div><h2>  Internet tariff </h2><p>  What is the cheapest tariff for Tele2 for the Internet used on a tablet or computer?  Unfortunately, the answer to this question cannot be called many options.  For the Internet, the mobile operator has one tariff - “Internet for devices”.  However, each subscriber can find a benefit for himself, since this tariff plan, as a rule, is used in conjunction with special options. </p><p>  Options for internet tariff include traffic packages.  In Moscow and the Moscow region, the size of these packages and the cost are as follows: </p><ul><li>  7 GB for 299 rubles.  per month; </li><li>  15 GB for 499 rubles.  per month; </li><li>  20 GB for 699 rubles.  per month; </li><li>  50 GB for 999 rubles.  per month. </li></ul><p>  To choose the most profitable option for yourself, you first need to determine the consumption of Internet traffic.  For those who rarely hang out on the World Wide Web, do not listen to music often, do not watch videos, the smallest package will be most suitable.  It is much more profitable for subscribers who are fond of movies to immediately connect a large package with Internet traffic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techsmith.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tariff and Internet options from &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-2632511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2632511.jpg"></div><p>  One cannot call the specific tariff from Tele2 the cheapest for calls or the Internet.  Each subscriber uses communication services in different ways.  People who rarely make calls should take a closer look at the simple “Classic” tariff.  Active subscribers are recommended to analyze tariff plans with a monthly fee. </p>
