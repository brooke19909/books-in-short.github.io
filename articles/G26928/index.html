These images are made by representatives of the bank and can be transferred to plastic.  This function is convenient for those people who do not want to place their own photos on the front side of the card or cannot choose something suitable from their options.  When contacting a consultant at a branch, you can ask to see the available individual designs of Sberbank cards in the form of a catalog.  Usually they are presented as small copies of real cards: they can be viewed and touched.  It happens that cards with an individual design are printed in a special album, which is available for study to all visitors. </p>

    <h2>  What can be shown on the map? </h2><p>  You can draw up a Sberbank card with an <span>individual design</span> in a variety of directions.  It all depends on personal imagination and creativity.  It is possible to make a card of any color, with any pattern, except prohibited, and the bank will realize these desires.  The embodiment of creativity - a card with an individual design (Sberbank).  Reviews from its owners suggest that most cardholders are delighted with pictures of their pets, photos from vacations, family archives or today's popular selfies.  You can print photos of the fruits of your creativity, a hobby: it can be a baked and decorated cake, a <span>beautiful landscape</span> from the window or a blossoming rose bud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can choose a classic or youth card by contacting <span>Sberbank.</span>  <span>An</span> individually designed <span>youth card</span> will be available for people over 25 years old.  Such a card has the same functions as the standard one, only externally it has a distinctive feature in the form of the selected picture. </p><h2>  How long does it take to wait for a card? </h2><p>  A relatively short card is produced with an individual design (Sberbank).  The terms of its development vary from three days to two weeks.  The minimum production time is occupied by cards with the design offered by the bank.  Such work does not require much effort from employees, and therefore the timing of its release pleases every potential owner.  If the client wants to order a Sberbank card with an individual design, which he invented independently, then it can come to his disposal only after two weeks.  It all depends on the complexity of the image, color palette and small details.  About two weeks is the standard time for the manufacture of plastic, but each case is individual and requires a certain time frame.  Banking specialist during filling out the application will announce the approximate waiting time for the card. </p>

    <p>  As soon as the card arrives at the selected department, a message with the necessary information will be sent to the number indicated during registration of the application.  Do not delay with going to the bank, as the card cannot be on the balance sheet of a banking organization for too long. </p><p>  Usually the cost of a card is debited from the account to which it is attached.  Moreover, on the day of filing the application for the issue, the required amount should already be in this account.  Otherwise, the card cannot be issued, as the bank does not issue cards with an individual design at its own expense. </p><h2>  Features of cards with an individual pattern </h2><p>  All individually designed cards have the following features: </p><ul><li>  valid for three years; </li><li>  participate in the "Thank you" program; </li><li>  issued with the payment system "Visa" or "Mastercard"; </li><li>  currency used: rubles, euros and dollars; </li><li>  they are only debit (it is impossible to get a loan on them); </li><li>  are not salary. </li></ul><p>  Such a card can be used for absolutely any purpose, like other standard cards of Sberbank.  You can withdraw money from it, make transfers, pay for purchases and much more.  It accepts any ATM and payment devices in stores.  Thanks to the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù bonuses, you can save a decent amount by returning up to 20% of the purchase price.  This program allows you to use the accumulated points to pay for goods in the future recalculation: 1 bonus = 1 ruble. </p>

You can print any picture you like not only on a landscape sheet, but also on a plastic card.  The choice in favor of individual design will emphasize personal merits and vivid character traits.  When you get such a card, you can be sure that no one else has it.  Individual designs of Sberbank cards attract the attention of not only their owner, but also those around them.  Admiring, for example, a photograph of your favorite pet on the map, you can smile and cheer yourself up. </p>
