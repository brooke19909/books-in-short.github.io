In order to save your time and energy, we offer you the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their stay at the four-star Egyptian hotel Ibis Styles Dahab Lagoon.  Reviews of tourists, it should be noted, the vast majority are positive.

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The apartments at the ibis Styles Dahab Lagoon hotel are mostly satisfied with the travelers.  According to them, the rooms here are large, bright, decorated in a modern style and comfortable.  True, our compatriots advise, if possible, to settle in the buildings where the apartments are located, the numbers of which begin with the numbers 1 and 2. The rest of the apartments are in buildings that are far enough away from the main infrastructure and the beach.  Especially satisfied were the guests who settled in rooms with sea views.  As for the Internet, according to the guests, Wi-Fi here catches only in the apartments located next to the reception. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of our compatriots, they had no complaints about the work of the maids of the Ibis Styles Dahab Lagoon hotel.  On the contrary, they were satisfied with the daily high-quality cleaning and the regular change of bed linen and towels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibis styles dahab lagoon hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1043483.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  As travelers note in their reviews, regardless of the time of arrival of new guests at the hotel, they try to move them into the reserved rooms as quickly as possible.  So if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, then you most likely will not have to wait for the check-out time to get into the apartment.  Guests staying late in the evening will be expected to have dinner upon check-in, so that they will not remain hungry. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, the apartments will need to be vacated before noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel only in the evening, then things can be left in the locker room and use the entire infrastructure of the hotel, with the exception of meals, if you are not on an all-inclusive basis. </p><h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  The location of the Ibis Styles Dahab Lagoon hotel, the majority of Russians who were here, were satisfied.  So, they note that from the hotel you can walk to the center of Dahab with lots of restaurants, shops, bars and other tourist facilities.  Also very close to the hotel there is a kite base.  After all, this hotel has long been chosen by kite and windsurfers. </p><p>  Our compatriots found the territory of the hotel quite spacious and very well-groomed.  Here you can always take a pleasant walk and find a lot of beautiful places in order to make great photos as a keepsake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dahab ibis styles dahab lagoon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1043482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Concept </h2><p>  Many travelers in their reviews try to draw the attention of tourists planning to come to Ibis Styles Dahab Lagoon to the fact that this hotel is a great place for fans of wind and kitesurfing, as well as for those who prefer a relaxing and measured vacation.  Other categories of people here may not really like it. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As tourists note, the Ibis Styles Dahab Lagoon 4 * hotel offers its guests to choose the type of food suitable for them.  So, when booking a stay, you can stay at one of the following options: only breakfast, half board, full board or all inclusive.  Please note that all types of food, except ol inclusive, require paid drinks for lunch and dinner.  Since the center of Dahab with a large number of cafes and restaurants for every taste is very close, many guests were satisfied with the options ‚Äúonly breakfast‚Äù or ‚Äúhalf board‚Äù.  After all, according to them, during the day you can rather economically eat outside the hotel.  However, those tourists who ate according to the ol inclusive scheme did not complain.  They note that the chefs at the hotel work just fine, and the choice of dishes in the restaurant is always quite diverse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibis styles dahab lagoon 4 hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1043481.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As our compatriots note in their reviews, the Ibis Styles Dahab Lagoon hotel offers its guests a magnificent beach holiday.  So, you can reach the sea in just a couple of minutes.  This place is a natural lagoon.  The beach here is very large, sandy, clean.  According to tourists, there are always plenty of free sunbeds.  Entry into the water is gentle, with a sandy bottom.  Therefore, here you can easily do without rubber shoes, even for children.  Directly next to Ibis Styles Dahab Lagoon 4 * there is no coral reef.  However, as noted by travelers, small pretty fish often swim to the shore.  Therefore, even here you can sometimes swim with a mask.  If you want to watch the inhabitants of a large coral reef, you can go on a tour or order a transfer and go to the beach, a ten-minute drive from the hotel. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, you can have a good time at the hotel.  So, there are several pools, including with water slides.  True, they are not equipped with heating, so in winter the water in them can be quite cool.  Since the hotel is designed for a calm and measured rest, there is no special animation.  So, those who wish can do water aerobics, play volleyball or darts, and in the evening dance at a disco. </p><p>  But, since more than half of the hotel guests are engaged in wind or kitesurfing, they have no problems with organizing leisure activities.  In addition, experienced travelers are advised to spend at least a couple of days on trips to the sights of Egypt.  You can book an excursion to the place you are interested in either at the hotel guide (according to our compatriots, the price in this case will be unreasonably high) or at the travel agent in Dahab. </p>
