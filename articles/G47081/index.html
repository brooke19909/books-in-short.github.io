Knitting patterns: schemes, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many seasons in a row, the jacquard pattern on knitted clothes remains fashionable.  Why is the colorful ornament called jacquard?  How to knit such a pattern?  Why are some of them called "lazy"?  We will try to answer these questions in this article. </p><h2>  How did you get the name pattern? </h2><p>  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, a special <span>loom</span> appeared <span>,</span> which made it possible to create patterned fabrics through complex weaving of threads.  His inventor was Joseph Maria Jacquard.  On his behalf received the name and pattern. </p><p>  At home, you can knit such patterns with knitting needles.  Schemes, as a rule, are simple, and even a novice craftswoman will understand them. </p><p>  <span>Jacquard patterns</span> are quite intricate, with a lot of interweaving of threads and colors, but there are also those that are quite simple to execute. </p><h2>  The difficulty of knitting patterns of several threads </h2><p>  Knitting a multi-colored ornament from several balls at once is quite a difficult task and only an experienced knitter can do it.  It takes a lot of patience and attention - over the course of a number of threads you need to change the threads several times to knit a pattern.  Difficulties are presented by the fact that the balls are tangled and rolled, and even those threads that do not participate in knitting, pull the fabric together, passing through the wrong side. </p><p>  If the vertical gap between two colors is more than two rows, then you have to additionally cross the threads.  This is necessary in order for the new thread to press the previous one, which we have already finished knitting.  If this is not done, vertical gaps form in the web. </p><p>  All these subtleties slow down the product creation process and affect the quality of work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why are some jacquards ‚Äúlazy‚Äù? </h2><p>  Simple patterns by lovers of knitting are called "lazy jacquard."  The patterns are arranged in such a way that two rows of knitting, one after another, are knitted from one ball, and the other colors appear from the loops of the previous ones, which are removed or stretched in a special way.  This is very convenient when working, as the craftswoman doesn‚Äôt get a few tangles under her arms, the canvas itself is not pulled inside out due to broaches of the thread. </p><p>  Sometimes in the literature on knitting there are such names as <strong> </strong>  a false jacquard, a lazy ornament or just a lazy pattern.  Perhaps such names are given to these knitwear because they do not require a high level of skill and great experience in knitting, and besides, they knit much faster than classic jacquards. </p><p>  It is no coincidence that many knitters use lazy jacquard in their products.  Patterns are designed in such a way that in the process of knitting a row you do not need to change the thread, every two rows are created from one ball.  This makes work easier and faster. </p>

    <h2>  Creation Features </h2><p>  Let's figure out how the lazy jacquard fits.  His schemes, like all others, consist of front and back rows.  Features of the pattern are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Firstly, both rows - front and back - are knitted with one thread from one ball.  It changes only on the side, on the right edge of the canvas. </li><li>  Secondly, when the front rows are knitted (in the diagrams they are usually odd), the knitted thread in the loops removed is left at work.  And vice versa, when the wrong (or even) rows are knitted, the thread is led in front of the canvas.  As a result of this rule, broaches, just like in classic jacquards, remain on the wrong side. </li><li>  Thirdly, when creating the back rows, the loops are knitted according to the pattern, just like they lie on the knitting needle (usually purl).  If a removed loop is found, then it is removed again without being tied, following the rule indicated above. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Where is the colorful pattern applied? </h2><p>  Knitwear is always fashionable and popular.  Ornaments in folk style remain relevant at all times.  In children's blouses, trousers, overalls, bright and multi-color patterns are used, patterned mittens are also popular.  Lazy jacquard knit many products.  Women's pullovers, cardigans and other outfits are usually decorated with knitted ornaments of two or three colors.  And for men's <span>knitted vests</span> and sweaters, as a rule, strict and restrained two-tone motifs are used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you decide to create such patterns with knitting needles, patterns can be found in books and magazines on needlework.  And some craftswomen come up with them on their own. </p><p>  The ideal pattern for knitting hats, sweaters or mittens is the lazy jacquard.  Schemes are quite common.  The creative approach used by some knitters to create products makes them come up with new ‚Äúlazy‚Äù patterns.  This is not as simple as it seems, because it is necessary to take into account those patterns that we noted above. </p><p>  Let‚Äôs tell you in more detail how to knit one of the <span>two-color patterns</span> called ‚Äúlazy jacquard‚Äù.  Schemes with a description of knitting are also given below. </p>

    <h2>  Loop set </h2><p>  It is necessary to draw on the knitting needles with a thread of one of the two selected colors the number of loops, which will be divided into four, then add three more loops to maintain the symmetry of the pattern and two for the edge loops.  For example, we knit a small sample and collect 20 loops (5 fragments of 4 loops), 3 for symmetry and 2 for edges.  Only 25 loops. </p><h2>  1st row </h2><p>  We use a thread of the same color that the loops were gathered.  The sequence for creating the series will be as follows: </p><ul><li>  leave the edge loop (just remove, leaving the thread before work); </li><li>  we knit three facial ones, remove one loop without knitting - we repeat this several times (four in our sample); </li><li>  at the end of the row - three facial; </li><li>  edge loop, which we knit front. </li></ul><h2>  2nd row </h2><p>  We continue to work with a thread of the same color.  First, remove the edge loop without knitting.  Then we knit 3 front, after which 1 loop is simply removed, skipping the thread in front of the fabric.  Repeat this procedure several times.  We knit the last edge loop again. </p><h2>  3rd row </h2><p>  Enter the thread of the second color.  Edge loop (just remove).  We knit 1 front loop, after which we will repeat this sequence several times: one loop - remove, skipping the thread behind it, three - knit facial.  After we repeat this pattern to the end of the row, two loops should remain.  We knit one for the front for symmetry of the pattern, the second for the edge, we also knit it for the front. </p><h2>  4th row </h2><p>  We use the same thread as in the third row.  At the beginning of the row, as usual, an edge loop, which, as throughout the work, simply needs to be removed.  Next, you need to knit 1 front loop, for symmetry, repeating it several times: one - remove, at the same time, lead the thread in front of the loop, and three - knit the front ones.  At the end of the row, one front and one edge loops are knitted again. </p><p>  So we got to the end of the scheme.  <span>The lazy jacquard with knitting needles is</span> knitted further, while the work from the first to the fourth row is repeated in sequence. </p>

    <h2>  Pattern "diagonal relief" </h2><p>  We bring to your attention another lazy jacquard with knitting needles.  A master class with a description of <span>knitting a fabric</span> from threads of two colors, a photo and a diagram are given below.  When knitting this pattern, all the rules of the lazy jacquard that we described above apply.  The result is a spectacular knit in which diagonal stripes of two colors alternate.  Such an ornament is suitable for sweaters, vests, mittens, cuffs, socks and other products. </p>

    <h2>  Description of knitting pattern </h2><p>  <em>Step 1</em>  We collect loops and knit a row with a thread of one of the selected colors.  The number of loops should be a multiple of six plus two edge loops.  We will have 20 loops.  We will not consider this row in the pattern, it is needed for the base. </p><p>  <em>Step 2</em>  Getting to the pattern.  In the first row we take yarn of a different color. </p><ol><li>  First, we form an edge loop, just removing it on the knitting needle, and we knit the next one with a new thread.  In this series, we begin the creation of the pattern itself, for which we knit and remove the loops one by one, according to the diagram and description.  We knit two front loops (for the symmetry of the pattern), and then repeat this combination: one - remove, five - we knit facial.  Our sample will have two such repeats, after which the shot loop and three facial loops are executed again.  The row ends with an edge loop. </li><li>  The second row is knitted with the same thread on the back side, while the removed loops are removed, and the rest are knitted as wrong.  That is how all even rows will be executed in our work, therefore they are not indicated on the diagram. </li><li>  The third row starts with an edge loop, then one front and one shot loop.  Further, a combination for repetition: three facial, shot, facial, shot.  We knit it several times.  At the end of the row are three facial and shot.  We end with an edge loop. </li><li>  The fourth row fits like all wrong. </li><li>  In the fifth row, after the edge loop, 4 face knits, and after that, as in the first row, the alternation of one shot and five face is repeated.  At the end of our sample, one shot and one face are knitted, and after them - edge. </li><li>  Sixth row - wrong side. </li><li>  After the initial edge, the facial, removed, facial, removed, and then repeat the combination (as in the third row) of the three facial, removed, facial, removed are knitted.  At the end of the row, two face and the final edging are knitted. </li><li>  We knit the eighth row purl and removed according to the pattern. </li><li>  The ninth row after the edge loop immediately starts repeating the combination of one shot and five faces.  Finish the edge. </li><li>  In the tenth row we knit, as in all wrong ones. </li><li>  The eleventh row begins with an edge loop and immediately afterwards - a repeating combination (as in the third row) of three facial, removed, front and removed loops.  The row ends with an edge loop. </li><li>  The twelfth row is the wrong side. </li></ol><p>  <em>Step 3</em>  Repeat the pattern as many times as needed, knitting sequentially from the first to the 12th row. </p><p>  If, even after the detailed descriptions given, questions remain about how to tie this lazy jacquard, the schemes should bring final clarity.  Below we indicate a pattern where cells of two colors denote knitting rows.  An empty cell denotes a normal facial loop, and a cell with a J sign indicates that the loop needs to be removed.  The wrong rows are not indicated on the diagram, because, as we said above, they are knitted with the same thread on the wrong side, according to the pattern: the removed loops are removed, and the rest are sewn on the wrong side. </p>

    <h2>  Lazy jacquards - beautiful, simple and practical </h2><p>  When knitting such patterns, the remains of yarn are usually used, you can also knit from threads that were previously knitted fabric, which was dismissed.
