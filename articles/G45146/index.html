Firstly, we immediately note that the process of installing a protective glass for a smartphone has some subtleties, but in general it does not seem to be something very complicated.  Even if you have never done this before, you can achieve the same result as you get in service centers or in mobile phone shops, with the only difference being that the installation of protective glass in the above-mentioned companies is a paid service.  All that is required from the user is a set of tools and a little attention. </p><h2>  Protective glass on the phone: how to glue </h2>

    <p>  Many users who are faced with the need for such an operation do not even suspect that not only the correct sequence of actions, but also a well-trained workplace plays an important role here.  If there will be a mess on the table, and the materials and tools will be scattered, it will be more difficult to achieve a good result.  The more quickly you can use this or that element, the better the gluing will turn out.  Therefore, make sure in advance that all unnecessary components are removed from the workplace or at least moved outside the scope of the operation.  So, here is a <span>protective glass</span> on the phone.  How to stick, we will tell a little lower, but for now we‚Äôll talk about what it is and how it differs from the film. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The differences between glass and film </h2>

    <p>  Usually, users clearly understand which of these materials is in question.  Nevertheless, some people do not understand the elementary differences between the film and the protective glass.  Let's talk about this in more detail.  The second material is better able to withstand mechanical stress.  If you drop a <span>phone protected by</span> such material, only the glass will suffer.  It can then be replaced.  But if an ordinary film was glued to the device, then everything is much more serious.  This may require a complete screen replacement.  And it will cost an order of magnitude more expensive.  For the sake of justice, we note that sharp objects are not afraid of glass.  You can drive it with keys, a knife, scissors - anything.  But at the same time it will not receive damage.  This, unfortunately, cannot be said about the film.  I would like to note in the end that glass is much easier to glue.  Well, now let's move on to the question of how to install a protective glass on the phone, in more detail. </p><h2>  Cooking screen </h2>

    <p>  Before installing the protective glass on the phone, carefully prepare the display surface for this operation.  The process will consist of several basic steps.  If you previously had a <span>protective film</span> applied to the screen <span>,</span> you need to remove it by pulling the edge.  In the future, we do not need more film, and it can be thrown into the trash can.  We open the kit with a protective glass.  It should have a cloth made of microfiber.  We will need it in the future.  If the equipment does not include an alcoholized rag, then you can wet a wet disc with it, and then wipe the screen.  You can wait until the display dries, and then use the microfiber cloth for its intended purpose.  Before starting such work, it is recommended to wash your hands with soap to avoid greasy stains on the screen.  When the screen is cleared, you can go to the next step.  So, we continue to answer the question of users about how to use a protective <span>glass on the phone, how to glue</span> it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Installation </h2>

    <p>  When you pick up the protective glass for the phone, you will see that it is covered on one side with a special layer of film.  This is the sticky side by which the element will need to be applied directly to the screen of the device.  Now we remove the film, preparing the glass for the gluing process.  At the same time, it should be held not by the surface, but by the edges in order to avoid loss of properties.  When you align the glass, we press it to the screen itself.  The coating of the first is made in such a way that nothing else needs to be done, it glues itself. </p><h2>  Finish the operation and remove the air </h2><p>  After you install the protective glass on the phone, you will notice that there are small bubbles under it.  This is the air remaining inside.  You can remove it quite simply.  To do this, smooth the glass from the center in the direction of the bubbles.  Thus, they can be ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù abroad.  At the end, you will get an element that has perfectly sat on the screen surface.  Some users ask how much a protective glass on a phone costs.  Note that the price for it falls in the range from 300 to a thousand rubles, depending on the brand and quality, as well as on the phone model.  Now, after reading this article, you know the answer to the question of how to use a protective glass on the phone, how to glue it correctly. </p><h2>  Which protective glass to choose </h2><p>  Currently, a considerable number of companies are engaged in the production of such accessories.  Nevertheless, by right, the best of them are considered to be protective glasses from Ainy.  Why?  What is the best protective glass on the phone?  The products of this company have proven themselves in the course of numerous tests.  Especially closely experts monitored the behavior of the glasses installed on the devices of the American company Apple.  It was found that with a relatively small thickness, accessories provide excellent protection for the screen from external mechanical influences.  It should be noted that the glass of this company is made of five layers, the final of which is oleophobic. </p><p>  Func, for example, is also producing such products.  Its products are in about the same price category.  It was noted that many accessories are hardened, but in terms of quality and level of protection, elements from Ainy do not reach, which, in principle, was confirmed by endurance tests. </p>
