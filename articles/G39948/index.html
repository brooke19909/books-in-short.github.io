As a rule, in such laptops, specialists save quite a lot on components, which, in turn, reduces the cost of the device.  However, the main thing in this business is to know the balance.  Sometimes manufacturers go too far, as a result of which very cheap, but limited in terms of functionality gadgets come out.  Could Dell developers maintain a delicate balance between price and quality?  You will find the answer to this question in this article. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the appearance of the device.  The guys from Dell removed additional design elements and reduced the variability of colors to the classic black and silver.  However, despite its budget, the laptop looks pretty good.  Of course, you will not find any revelations in it.  Dell Inspiron 3542 simply skillfully copies the appearance of its wealthier predecessors. </p><p>  The cover is made of fairly high-quality matte plastic, which is characterized by a very nice relief pattern.  The bottom and working panel are made of cheaper material - ordinary black plastic.  These components are not afraid of scratches and light damage, which is a huge plus.  However, there was a fly in the ointment.  Housing loves to collect fingerprints.  Of course, this can hardly be called a global stumbling block, and this problem is solved with an ordinary rag. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Input Devices </h2>

    <p>  Keyboard in the new Dell Inspiron 3542 island type.  That is, the keys are located at a small distance from each other, which allows to reduce the likelihood of mislisk to almost zero.  This is a very useful feature.  In addition, the key mechanism pleases.  Buttons push well after pressing.  This, in turn, has a positive effect on speed during printing.  The keyboard is fixed pretty high quality.  Even with strong pressure on the center keys, the base does not bend.  When you press the buttons do not make noise and feel good, which is an undoubted advantage of this device.  Perhaps the only reproach is that the keys are too soft.  Although, as they say, "taste and color." </p><p>  The large <span>touch panel</span> has a now popular buttonless design.  That is, the touchpad contains only one mechanical button.  In principle, the touchpad is pretty good.  The moment of pressing is well felt, and the touchpad reacts very smartly. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Dell Inspiron 3542 is a budget <span>device, the laptop</span> boasts a rather powerful stuffing.  On board the laptop is a very successful processor from Intel called Core i5-4210U.  This component is often found in expensive modern laptops.  Therefore, to meet her in a cheap laptop was a pleasant surprise.  From its predecessors, the 4210U is distinguished by a clock speed increased by as much as 100 MHz, which provides decent computing power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As for the video card, things are a little worse here.  The chip has an integrated Intel HD 4400, the operating frequencies of which range from 200 to 1000 MHz.  In addition, there is a <span>discrete graphics card</span> NVIDIA GeForce 820M.  This is a rather weak video chip, so you should not expect miracles from it.  It is also worth noting that only specially designed drivers for the Dell Inspiron 3542 will ensure correct operation.  You can download them on the official website of the manufacturer. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the video card and processor work perfectly in tandem.  These two components provide high and, most importantly, stable computing power.  Thanks to this, the laptop easily copes with such ordinary tasks as Internet surfing, listening to music, watching movies in high HD quality, etc.  Not only that, the laptop is even capable of launching recently released games.  For example, at minimum settings, you can enjoy the new ‚ÄúTomb Ryder‚Äù.  Indeed, at low graphics settings, the laptop stably produces as many as 60 FPS, which for many devices of this class is simply an unattainable result. </p><h2>  Laptop Dell Inspiron 3542 reviews </h2><p>  No one so accurately evaluates the product as a buyer.  Users reacted well to the release of the new Dell Inspiron 3542. Reviews, for the most part, are positive.  Many praise PCs for their high performance, good build quality, and convenient input devices.  Of course, the design was a little disappointing, but these are trifles.  It is unlikely that someone buys a laptop in order to admire its appearance.  Also, the price of a laptop simply cannot but please.  To become the proud owner of the Dell Inspiron 3542, you will have to pay about 25 thousand rubles.  Regarding the products of competitors, this is a rather low price. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  In summary, we can say that the Dell Inspiron 3542 is a great laptop that has a lot of advantages.  Dell experts decided to save on such trifles as the design and materials of the case.  Thanks to this, the budget made it possible to shove rather powerful hardware into the laptop.  And this is a pretty good solution.  We can say with confidence that in terms of price and quality, the Dell Inspiron 3542 is one of the best devices on the market today. </p>
