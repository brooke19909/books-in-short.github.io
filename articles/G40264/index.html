    <p>  <span>The stone fortress</span> in Smolensk was built in the late XVI - early XVII century.  The height of the walls reached 18 meters.  The Z8 towers consisted mainly of three tiers and reached 22-33 m in height.  The wall of this fortress is considered the most powerful in the history of Russia.  Even Napoleon managed to blow up only 9 towers.  In peacetime, the Smolenskaya fortress wall served as a source of brick, which was used to rebuild buildings destroyed by the war.  Today we can see 18 towers and fragments of walls scattered throughout the city.  So big was the Smolensk fortress wall, the history of which is filled with many heroic battles. </p><h2>  Zaaltarnaya tower </h2><p>  It consists of 16 faces and is located at the end of Isakovsky Street.  It is in the possession of the Smolensk diocese, so its inner part is not accessible for inspection, as it is part of the monastery territory.  Today, the tower was restored and re-covered with a roof, which was lost during the Patriotic War. </p>

    <h2>  Pozdnyakova Tower </h2><p>  It consists of four faces and is located on Timiryazev Street.  It was named after the merchant Pozdnyakov.  The people called it "Rogovka."  She received this name because it is located in the place where the road forks.  The tower was also subjected to numerous enemy attacks during wars.  During World War II, it also lost its roof, but was partially restored in 2013. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Volkova Tower </h2><p>  Despite the fact that today we can see at least partially what the Smolensk fortress wall was like, the history of the towers of which is related to repelling numerous enemy attacks, in peacetime it begins to collapse from old age, and nothing can be done about it.  For example, Volkov‚Äôs tower is barely held by gigantic metal supports, although it continues to crumble.  It is located on Sobolev Street.  It is believed that the tower is named after one of its defenders.  Although, according to another version, its name came from the word "volgly", which means wet, since in ancient times a branch of the Dnieper flowed opposite it.  The tower is called ‚ÄúStrelka‚Äù in a different way, because it gives a direct and clear view of Rachevka. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 18th century, the tower had a powder magazine.  Even then, she was in a deplorable state.  Therefore, it, as well as the adjacent Smolenskaya fortress wall, were dismantled.  The tower was erected again in 1877 and contained the archive of the district court.  In Soviet times, they even lived in it, but now it‚Äôs dangerous to enter it.  She will come down and look.  The city authorities are trying hard to save the architectural monument. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The Veselukha Tower </h2><p>  When visiting this architectural structure, which, incidentally, is included in a sightseeing tour of Smolensk, the tourist, it would seem, has nothing to fear, because it has such a funny name.  But it turns out there is something to be afraid of.  At least the legend that says that in this tower the daughter of one of the city merchants was immured alive.  This was done in order to buy off evil spirits that prevented the tower from standing normally in its place and not cracking.  But the girl, apparently having lost her mind with grief, did not cry, but laughed in her confinement.  That's why the tower was called "Veselukha".  Based on this material, Oettinger wrote a novel called The Veselukha Tower.  Although, if you do not believe the ancient horror stories, it turns out that she got her name for the cheerful landscape that opens if you climb to the very top.  The Smolenskaya fortress wall includes several towers, but this is the most popular.  It has also been completely renovated. </p><h2>  Eagle Tower </h2><p>  Tourists often come here to admire the stunning panoramic view that opens from its site.  Smolensk fortress wall is scattered throughout the city.  The address of this tower is Timiryazev Street.  She is sometimes confused with Veselukha.  But these are two completely different towers with their own stories.  On this, it is believed, eagles lived, which flew away from here, as soon as the war began.  The tower is not rounded at all, but has 16 faces.  In another way, it was called Gorodetskaya due to the fact that at the foot of it there was an earthen fortification, which in ancient times was called the "town". </p><p>  An unpleasant story has happened to this tower.  Money was allocated for its reconstruction.  When work began, there was a fire.  Materials burned out.  The authorities walled up the tower.  In this form, it still exists.  You can inspect it only from the outside. </p>

    <h2>  Hoof Tower </h2><p>  This part of the Smolensk fortress wall is located on the territory of the Lopatinsky garden.  Previously, it was surrounded by a moat and an earthen rampart.  This tower has three tiers and an L-shaped passage.  Over the gates are preserved icons that have traditionally been installed on structures of this type.  It is easy to guess that the name of the tower is associated with the word "hoof".  Indeed, it was built on the road along which cattle were driven to pastures.  The tower has been restored, but the gate is not used at all. </p><h2>  Kassandalov Tower </h2><p>  The second name of this tower is Kozadolovsk.  It is also related to the fact that pastures were located near it.  This tower has not survived to this day.  If it had not been blown up by Napoleon‚Äôs troops, then you would have found it at the site of the Heroes' Memory Square.  Instead, the building of the city school was built here in 1912.  During World War II, it was destroyed, and then restored again.  Now it houses a museum. </p><p>  The volumes of this article do not allow us to talk about all the towers, which includes the Smolensk fortress wall.  Hours of towers should not be looked for.  But the museums located in them work, as a rule, from 10 to 17 hours.  The day off is Monday. </p>
