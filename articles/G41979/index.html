A word can have several meanings.  It is known that the word "synclite" was used in ancient Greece and in Byzantium.  To find out what it meant, you need to make an excursion into history. </p><h2>  Areopagus in Ancient Greece </h2><div class="photo" data-original="covertress.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Areopagus from the Acropolis" class="if uuid-2864376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2864376.jpg"></div><p>  In ancient Greece, the synclite was called the meeting of senior officials - the Areopagus.  It got its name from the place where meetings were traditionally held.  It was the hill of the god of war Ares near the Acropolis.  Now this area is a popular attraction among tourists.  For Christians, Ares Hill is famous for the fact that the apostle Paul delivered his sermon from him. </p><p>  In the heyday of the state, the Areopagus had a high status, imposing it with great powers.  Initially, it arose as a council of elders, endowed with political, judicial and religious authority.  It included former archons (rulers) who faithfully served their homeland and gained a good reputation. </p><p>  The Areopagus Court dealt with serious crimes such as murder, blasphemy, and blasphemy.  Over time, his power was increasingly limited.  According to historians, a similar trend was associated with the strengthening of the power of the ruler and the development of slave democracy in Athens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Senate in Byzantium </h2><p>  In Byzantium, the synclite is the Senate of Constantinople, which was the highest deliberative body under the emperor.  His education is associated with the name of Emperor Constantine I. In the initial period of its existence, this body was a kind of analogue of the Roman Senate.  He received his development in the reign of Constantine II.  At the legislative level, the conditions for joining the synclite were established and the number of its members was brought up to 2 thousand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phryne in front of the Areopagus" class="if uuid-2864780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2864780.jpg"></div><p>  The members of the body were representatives of the titled nobility, whom the high status of the synclitic gave the following privileges: a place corresponding to their position on the table of ranks and monetary and material allowance.  The Senate of Constantinople lost its political weight by the end of the 11th century during the era of the Comnenus dynasty. </p><h2>  The figurative meaning of the word "synclit" </h2><p>  In addition to its basic meaning, the word also has a figurative meaning and means a complete collection of dignitaries.  For example: a meeting of shareholders. </p><h2>  Mentioned in the composition "Rose of the World" </h2><p>  In the religious and philosophical work of Daniil Andreev "Rose of the World" this concept is also mentioned.  The author uses the word "synclite" in the following meaning: the posthumous cathedral of outstanding personalities of a particular culture. </p>
