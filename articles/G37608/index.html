  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A trip to Montenegro by car from Moscow: the best route, documents, tourist tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many years, Montenegro has been in great demand among Russians, because in addition to friendly relations, this country is much cheaper than other European countries.  People come here for natural beauties and a comfortable climate.  Some prefer to buy real estate in Montenegro in order to relax in full, regardless of the reservation at the hotel.  Recently, tourists have often come to Montenegrin resorts using a personal car. </p><p>  In this hospitable country, they speak Montenegrin, Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Albanian.  Of course, many know English.  Locals are sympathetic to Russian tourists.  There are several road routes from Russia to Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro.  In our article we will consider the most optimal. </p><h2>  Optimal route </h2><p>  According to the reviews of tourists who have already traveled the entire route to Montenegro by car from Moscow, the most optimal option is a bunch of Belarus-Poland-Slovenia-Montenegro.  In between, of course, you have to cross the borders of other European countries that are part of the European Union. </p><p>  Between Moscow and Podgorica, the distance is approximately 2700 kilometers.  For more comfortable movement, it is better to provide for an extra night, then the travel time will be not 3, but 4 days.  If you go without haste and consider the sights of places that come across on the way, you can stretch the pleasure for 5 days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Time difference between Moscow and Montenegro" class="if uuid-2964230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2964230.jpg"></div><p>  Seasoned tourists are advised to make their first stop overnight in Minsk.  According to other travelers, it is better to pass the Polish border first, and only then arrange a night, as this particular post will be the most difficult for the whole trip.  According to the calculations made, all expenses in one direction (gasoline and toll roads) will cost 320-350 euros (about 26 thousand rubles) + 140 euros (about 11 thousand rubles).  This is taking into account travel in a passenger car.  In order to calculate the route and arrange the necessary points for stops, including border posts, it is best to use the convenient Internet navigator service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cost of hotels on the road can start from just 15 euros (1000-1200 rubles).  It will increase depending on where tourists stop (highway, suburb or city center).  The cost of gasoline in Montenegro is slightly different from the rest of Europe.  For one liter, you can give only a half euros (about 115 rubles). </p><p>  It is better to calculate the route so that it turns out to go to Montenegro in the summer.  In the country you can find both sandy and pebble beaches.  Almost all of them are located in bays, which implies the absence of strong wind and waves.  Moving around Montenegro by car, you can carry your umbrella and other accessories for a beach holiday, and not rent them on the beach territory. </p><h2>  From Moscow to Poland </h2><p>  The first day, according to the calculated route, begins with a trip to Belarus.  To pass all the Moscow traffic jams, it is best to leave very early (at 4-5 in the morning) and move along the M1 highway.  In general, the condition of the roadway on it is tolerable, although in some places you can find repair teams. </p><p>  Since the route lies to Montenegro through Belarus, it is best to prepare a "green card" when approaching the border.  There is almost no control there due to the very warm relations between the two countries.  According to tourists' reviews, it is best to refuel in advance in Russia, as Belarusians will get more expensive gas at a cost. </p><p>  The next border will be with Poland, here it is much more serious.  Despite the fact that all automobile travel forums are reporting that the border has been crossed in Brest, experienced people advise you to go to Peschatka, as the process moves faster even with a large number of cars.  You can view all border posts between Belarus and Poland on the official website of the Belarusian border service.  It is there that you can find information about travel times and the number of cars standing in line for inspection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="belarusdigest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarusian border with the EU" class="if uuid-2964313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2964313.jpg"></div><p>  When traveling to Montenegro from Moscow by car while passing the Polish border, you must provide for at least two hours of waiting.  In general, this is the most difficult border on the way.  Another quick post for which you have to make a small detour is called Domachevo.  However, tourists report that the maneuver is worth it, because the time will still come faster than in Brest. </p><p>  Since the described route is the safest way, the Poles must be given their due, because they even check the cleanliness of the machine itself.  They also ask to turn on the dashboard to check the operation of all the necessary bulbs, they may ask about the availability of spare ones. </p><p>  In fact, traveling by car to Montenegro is a very exciting adventure.  For example, after entering Poland, especially in the evening, you can feel like a fairy tale hero thanks to the narrow ornate streets.  Here you need to be careful and comply with traffic rules.  In Europe, within settlements, the maximum permitted speed is 50 kilometers per hour, and the maximum allowable excess is three kilometers per hour.  Be careful on the road! </p><h2>  Attractions on the way to Poland </h2><p>  In addition to the beautiful landscapes that accompany the entire journey while traveling by car from Moscow to Montenegro, you can and should see the sights along the way.  For example, in Belarus, travelers recommend a glimpse into the Brest Fortress, and in Poland - a walk through the central part of Warsaw.  In this case, the car can be left in one of the city parking lots.  For walks in European cities, tourists are advised to use the convenient application on the phone - IZI.Travel, where you can use the audio guide for free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Considering that the article deals with the optimal route of a trip to Montenegro by car, the former Auschwitz concentration camp will also be along the way.  It is difficult to recommend it, as each responds in its own way to this tragedy of the 20th century, but you can definitely look at it from the car window.  If you move a little away from the route and turn towards Krakow, you can look at the completely calm life of this city, which has an interesting history.  Once it was the Polish capital, and all of Krakow's attractions are conveniently located along the Royal Road. </p><h2>  From Poland to Slovenia </h2><p>  The next day, traveling to Montenegro from Moscow by car, travels to Slovenia.  This is the longest stretch of a thousand two hundred kilometers.  A big plus is the chic road surface on which the car does not just drive, but literally glides silently.  The track is almost always two-lane and filled with wagons. </p><p>  In order not to trail behind a loaded heavy truck, you need to carefully look at the signs of interchanges, with which you can go around the busiest sections of roads.  Also, tourists are advised to refuel before entering the Czech Republic in order to save on fuel prices.  Talking about how to get to Montenegro, you need to mention the purchase of a vignette.  This is a special sticker that sticks to the windshield in the car and allows you to drive on toll roads of the European Union.  You need to buy it near the city of Mikulov at the cash desk of any gas station.  The best solution would be to purchase several stickers at once: one for the Czech Republic, and the rest for Austria with Slovenia.  The cost of the vignette ranges from 8 to 12 euros per piece (800-1000 rubles), and its validity is about a week, but the sticker that lasts for a month will cost the least. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calculate route" class="if uuid-2964250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2964250.jpg"></div><p>  On some forums you can read that you can reach the Montenegrin border without this sticker.  But if a policeman stops such a driver along the way, then he won‚Äôt get away with a simple apology, and fines in Europe are high.  This also needs to be taken into account by amateurs to save money. </p><p>  Further, the path continues to Vienna, follows through Graz to Maribor.  Austrian roads do not have a single flaw.  Riding them is a pleasure.  Given the long road, entry into Slovenia may already be closer to midnight, so it is important to purchase a vignette for this country in advance so as not to look for it at night. </p><p>  Given that Slovenia became a member of the EU not so long ago, when crossing the border, you can stumble upon inactive and abandoned security checkpoints.  You can spend the night in Maribor, and in the morning move towards Zagreb, after a stroll through the picturesque surrounding territories.  There are a lot of hotels in Maribor, only you need to book a room in advance, since not all reception open 24 hours a day. </p><h2>  From Slovenia to Montenegro </h2><p>  We analyze further how to get to Montenegro from Slovenia.  Our path lies through Croatia.  Given the fact that it is not a member of the European Union, border control will have to take place here.  To get to the border, you should go to Split, after which choose the highway to Dubrovnik.  After crossing the border there is an exit on the autobahn at number A1.  He is paid.  Money is paid on departure.  The fare along the entire length of the route is 35 euros (2200-3000 rubles).  Light sadness from such expenses will be brightened up by gorgeous mountain landscapes that open on both sides of the road. </p><p>  In general, the distance and route Moscow-Montenegro by car for an experienced motorist are not difficult.  An exception may be the last hundred kilometers.  They will need to pass along the Yadran highway, which has a large number of serpentines, and its lanes are quite narrow.  Therefore, those who are cradled under such conditions of movement, it is better to take care of special pills in advance. </p><p>  In the same section, Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to cross with a small section of the Balkan coast ten kilometers long.  The line for crossing borders here rarely lasts longer than twenty minutes.  The Bosnian border is a formality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The border between Montenegro and Bosnia" class="if uuid-2964254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2964254.jpg"></div><p>  Herceg Novi will be the first city to appear to travelers after crossing the Montenegrin border.  The distances between towns in Montenegro are small, like the country itself, but it is advisable to take into account the time difference between Moscow and Montenegro.  She is 2 hours.  This country is switching to summer time. </p><h2>  Attractions on the way to Slovenia and Montenegro </h2><p>  In the Czech Republic, the road will be the town of Brno, which is in second place after Prague in number.  In it you can find a lot of interesting architectural objects with a unique history.  Tourists advise you to call in the Dietrichstein castle in Mikulov, and in Olomouc try the local cheese, which has earned fame throughout Europe.  Of course, you should not miss the opportunity to see Prague, in particular, to climb Kutna Gora and visit the most popular ossuary with skulls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Montenegro" class="if uuid-2964237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2964237.jpg"></div><p>  Passing through Austria, it is worth staying in Vienna and Graz, which is a UNESCO heritage.  Well, Croatia is Plitvice Lakes and Dubrovnik (in addition to Zagreb with Split). </p><h2>  Visa for Russians to Montenegro and other documents </h2><p>  What visa to Montenegro for Russians need to apply for?  There is an agreement between the two countries, according to which citizens of the Russian Federation can stay in Montenegro for up to thirty days without a visa.  Since the article is about traveling by car, the route of which runs through the countries of the European Union, you will additionally need to submit documents for a Schengen visa.  Since Poland is the first in the list, it is best to apply for a visa at the Polish Embassy. </p><p>  In addition, some countries will need to submit additional documents.  To <span>travel to Montenegro, you</span> need to take medical insurance, a green card for your car, a printed hotel reservation in the nearest Schengen country through which the route runs, as well as an international driver‚Äôs license, which you must take care of in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gezimanya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Podgorica from above" class="if uuid-2964297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2964297.jpg"></div><p>  Arriving in Montenegro on vacation, a Russian who does not use the services of hotels must register with the local police department for the first 24 hours, and remove himself from the register before leaving.  If you are staying at a hotel, this procedure is done by its administration.  Do not forget to change the clock, because the time difference between Moscow and Montenegro is two hours. </p><h2>  The necessary equipment on the road </h2><p>  What else will the traveler planning to cross the borders of different European countries need on the road?  Firstly, a first aid kit with all medicines that require EU standards.  Secondly, a fire extinguisher with a warning sign.  In addition, reflective vests are widely used in Europe if you need an unforeseen stop on the track in the middle of the night.  The vest must be in the cabin, not in the trunk. </p><p>  If a person has a radar detector in the car, then it must be removed before traveling, as this can lead to serious problems if the car is checked by the police.  If the trip is scheduled from November to the end of March, the car should have winter tires in case the road is covered with ice or solid snow.  Rubber with studs is prohibited in Europe, and chains can only be used if there is solid ice on the road surface. </p><p>  According to the rules of the European Union, a windshield must transmit at least 75 percent of the light and be equipped with two rear-view mirrors. </p><h2>  Parking rules and SDA Montenegro </h2><p>  The biggest plus of Montenegro for motorists is the free parking on the streets.  That is, you can simply park the car on the sidelines at no cost.  Of course, first you need to make sure that there is no sign prohibiting parking.  The country has paid parking.  They are indicated by a warning sign. </p><p>  Mostly money for parking can be taken in the central areas of the city, where most of the attractions are located, so there are more tourists with cars.  But you can cheat, leaving the car, for example, a 20-minute walk in one of the yards, and walk to the center on foot.  The cost of parking starts from one euro and can go up to 5 euros per hour (about 300 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="auto-travel.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Documents for a trip to Montenegro" class="if uuid-2964269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2964269.jpg"></div><p>  The Montenegrin rules of the road do not differ from the Russian ones, so there will be no difficulties on the roads.  However, it is worth knowing some nuances.  So, the maximum permitted speed within settlements should not exceed 50 kilometers per hour.  Outside the settlements, you can accelerate to 90 kilometers per hour.  On highways and highways, speed limits are 100 kilometers per hour, and on highways and highways it is allowed to drive up to 130 kilometers per hour. </p><p>  There are strict rules regarding alcohol.  This should be especially taken into account by lovers of evening drinks at the bar.  Citizens under the age of twenty-four are not allowed to drive at all, having blood alcohol above 0 ppm.  For other ages, 0.3 ppm is allowed. </p><p>  The low beam rules are the same as in Russia.  It must be turned on both day and night, otherwise they can be fined. </p><p>  An important point is seat belts.  They should be in the back seat.  Children under 12 years old are not allowed to be in a moving car in the front seat.  And children under five years old must ride in special chairs installed in the back seat. </p><p>  It is strictly forbidden to use a mobile phone while driving.  If a person needs to talk while driving, you must use a hands-free device.  If a policeman stops a driver who is talking on the phone while driving, the fine will be from 60 euros to 150 (more than 11 thousand rubles).  All fines issued by the patrol must be paid in the near future.  This procedure is carried out in any bank. </p><h2>  Road situation in Montenegro </h2><p>  Highways are free in the country (unlike other EU countries), but the Sozin tunnel must be paid.  True, the price tag is small - two and a half euros (about 250 rubles).  On the roads of Montenegro, an atmosphere of friendliness and courtesy reigns, here everyone is trying to comply with traffic rules, so as not to interfere with other participants in the movement. </p><p>  In some places, picturesque landscapes can be admired from special panoramic platforms. </p><p>  In case of emergency, you need to call the police - 122, the fire department - 123 or the ambulance - 124. </p>
