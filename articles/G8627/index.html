    <h2>  From the history of the region </h2><p>  The regional center - Kursk - is located on the banks of the Tuskan River (where it connects with Kura).  Other lands had a significant influence on the history and modern appearance of the city.  At one time, Kursk was part of the Chernihiv, Pereyaslavsky and other ancient Russian principalities. </p><p>  In 1597, a large fortress was built in the city.  The military, artisans, merchants and peasants from all over the country began to move here.  Since then, Kursk has become an important administrative and commercial center. </p><p>  The most tragic pages in the history of the region are connected with the Second World War.  For more than a year the city was occupied by German troops.  But even after liberation, this land became an arena of hostilities.  For more than a month, the famous battle on the Kursk Bulge lasted - one of the key battles that ended the <span>radical turning point</span> in the war. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Znamensky Cathedral </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous temples in the Kursk region.  According to legend, at the beginning of the 17th century the city was ruined and almost completely destroyed by the Polish-Lithuanian army.  We managed to survive only a small fortress, in which there were defenders of Kursk.  After that, local residents in her place decided to build a monastery.  Its construction began in 1816.  This cathedral belongs to the group of cross-domed.  Its interior decoration impresses with its beauty.  It is decorated with magnificent stucco moldings, paintings with religious subjects.  The dome of the Znamensky Cathedral is strewn with fresco paintings. </p>
