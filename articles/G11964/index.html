Many tourists also do not like that when buying a ticket for the whole day you can not leave the territory of the complex.  But still, if you are staying for a while in the village of Nebug, the Dolphin water park should definitely be visited.  This complex is especially liked by children, kids are ready to frolic in water at least all day.  A variety of slides will also delight adults.
