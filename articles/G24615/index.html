First of all, this paradise in the Caribbean attracts lovers of exotic, classic beach holidays at the highest level and total relaxation in the "Bounty" style.  Let's see what tour operators in the Dominican Republic in Moscow are able to organize a magical vacation in this country. </p><h2>  Why do tourists choose Dominican Republic? </h2><p>  The benefits of a holiday in the eastern part of the fabulous <span>island of Haiti,</span> where the Dominican Republic is located, can be enumerated endlessly.  This is an elite world-class resort.  The richest natural tourist resources, magnificent climate, snow-white beaches, warm and tear-free sea with various coral reefs, picturesque nature, interesting flora and fauna.  In addition, in recent years, the tourism sector of the Dominican Republic has become a fundamental budget-forming sphere of the economy.  This growth was facilitated by the development of infrastructure, the construction of a wide network of hotels of various categories, and the improvement of service. </p>

    <p>  Despite the tourist boom, Dominican Republic remained a country with amazing Caribbean flavor.  <span>Dominican rum</span> in narrow circles is valued even more than rum from Jamaica.  High-quality tobacco is grown in the country, cigar factories operate in many cities and towns, where cigars are rolled no worse than in Cuba.  Coffee and spices from the island of Haiti also often take pride of place among the souvenirs that tourists bring home after a vacation in this wonderful place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Among other things, the Dominican Republic is one of the burial places of Columbus.  In fact, it is not known where the remains of the discoverer of the New World are now located, but in the capital of the Dominican Republic there are a couple of places where his body can be hidden.  <span>This is the lighthouse of</span> Columbus or the cathedral in Santo Domingo.  Many Moscow Dominican tour operators organize excursions to these interesting places for those travelers who lack only a beach holiday in the spirit of all-consuming laziness. </p><p>  The country also has rich gastronomic traditions, the marvelous spirit of the era of ‚Äúgreat geographical discoveries‚Äù, and unsurpassed pirate flavor.  And also an exceptional mild tropical climate, this is a country of eternal summer, but without unbearable heat and heat. </p>

    <p>  The tourist public in the Dominican Republic is motley, consists mainly of Americans and Europeans, they are partially supplemented by Japanese, local residents, there are a very modest number of Russians.  Fans of not meeting ‚Äúnative faces‚Äù on vacation should definitely pay attention to the Dominican Republic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why do tourists not choose Dominican Republic? </h2><p>  Resorts of the Caribbean coast is a very expensive pleasure for a Russian tourist.  This is due to the enormous geographical remoteness from the native continent.  The most budget option for a flight to Punta Cana from Moscow empties a tourist‚Äôs pocket by 30 thousand rubles one way.  The flight itself takes more than 13 hours (if without transfers).  And those who do not want to test their spine for endurance for 13 hours pay an additional $ 300 for a business class.  The time difference with Moscow is 7 hours.  So, no matter how beautiful the Dominican Republic may be, many Russian tourists cannot afford it. </p><h2>  Visa </h2><p>  For Russian tourists who have their eyes on the resorts of the Caribbean coast, Dominican Republic is the most attractive.  That's because for a trip of less than 30 days for citizens of the Russian Federation does not require a preliminary visa.  At the same time, for our holidays in Mexico, Cuba, or on the east coast of the United States, our compatriots need to undergo a not-so-pleasant procedure full of paperwork. </p><h2>  Tour operators in the Dominican Republic in Moscow.  What is the market situation? </h2><p>  Naturally, evaluating the service of operators of nearby tourist destinations, the same Egypt and Turkey, the average client or manager makes the main emphasis on the price-quality ratio.  And, taking into account the very "tasty" prices for holidays in these countries, you can sometimes turn a blind eye to the lame service in some travel companies. </p><p>  But the quality of services in such areas of recreation as the <span>Dominican Republic (Dominican Republic),</span> tour operators are simply obliged to polish in full.  The fact is that the Caribbean resorts are mainly chosen by travelers, for whom there is practically no compromise in terms of service level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The whole point is that there are no single-industry companies that work exclusively with the resorts of such a small island state in another part of the world, like the Dominican Republic.  An operator who specializes in organizing tours exclusively in this direction would be known as the best tour operator in the Dominican Republic in Moscow.  But this is an expensive and therefore not very popular trip, and it is almost impossible to ensure a solid tourist flow, working only in one unique direction. </p>

    <h2>  Natalie tours </h2><p>  This is a tour operator in the Dominican Republic in Moscow, which provides its services in other cities through a retail network of agencies.  This is one of the few operators who can organize corporate travel and MICE events at the level.  Has a positive reputation, has been working since 1992.  And in 2014 he received the award "Best Tour Operator" according to Disney Stars Live Experience. </p><h2>  Tourbook </h2><p>  This is a tour operator in the Dominican Republic, whose rating is off the scale in Moscow.  The central office of the company is located in the capital.  It provides services like a regular tour operator.  For all other regions of the country, the company has created the Tourbook Internet platform.  On the site, every tourist has the opportunity to get advice on choosing a tour, help in booking it.  Also in online mode, the company accepts payment, writes out all the necessary documents (voucher, airline tickets, insurance policy, service agreement).  This approach to customer service eliminates the need to create a whole network of travel agencies in the regions and "unfasten" them immodest 10-15% of the cost of the tour. </p>

    <h2>  ICS Travel Group </h2><p>  An authoritative company, a member of the association of tour operators, a diversified company with a huge list of services.  He is engaged not only in the sale of package tours to the Dominican Republic, but also in the design of wedding ceremonies, the organization of extreme tours.  Like all other operators, trips to the ICS Travel Group are based on regular flights. </p><h2>  Batch or independent vacation? </h2><p>  The tradition of organizing your holiday on your own is becoming increasingly popular.  Discussions between fans of package and "home-made" tourism do not stop.  Still, the situation is very ambiguous.  The advice is not to use the services of a travel agency, and organizing a trip yourself can be both ingenious and rather stupid.  It all depends on the country and the specific vacation spot. </p><p>  If we are talking about resorts completely occupied by Russian tourists such as Turkey, Egypt, Thailand, where all the service is focused on our brother, then it is better to fly to rest through a travel agency.  Why?  Because in such areas, operators most often organize charter flights, the most experienced guides work in these countries, companies make group discounts, share transfers, and create last-minute offers.  Independently book a ticket for a regular flight and hotel room, take a taxi from the airport will be more expensive. </p>

    <p>  But for long-distance visa-free destinations, operators rarely lay charter flights, and it‚Äôs unprofitable for them to maintain a huge staff of guides in unpopular resorts.  In such cases, self-organized recreation usually implies good savings.  In order to carry out such a plan, you really need a minimum of body movements: book a hotel room or apartment on special sites, order an electronic ticket and apply for an insurance policy. </p><p>  And if you need to organize excursions at the vacation spot, local tour operators of the Dominican Republic will help the tourist.  Their ratings and reviews are pretty good.  How to find a representative on site, you can find out at the reception at the hotel or ask tourists.  If you have average knowledge of English, and especially Spanish, you can go on trips around the Dominican Republic yourself. </p>
