    <h2></h2><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  This scarf appeared many years ago in Norway.  It has long been knitted in completely different ways - both manually and with a typewriter.  Bactus was widely distributed thanks to active bloggers who disseminated information about an unusual accessory.  A scarf is named after a knitter nicknamed Carius, which the Norwegians associate with Bactus.  In general, Carius and Bactus are the heroes of the tale of the famous Norwegian writer.  In it, they are dental trolls, which are caries and bacteria.  This theory is little known and more like a fairy tale.  In fact, bactus is part of the oldest Norwegian folk costume.  For many centuries, triangular <span>men's scarves</span> and women's shawls have been an important component of Bunad costumes. </p><p>  More recently, a popular scarf in Norway has conquered the whole world.  Now almost every fashionista in the wardrobe has an unusual accessory with original decor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit bactus with knitting needles" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/340727.jpg?1392999987984" width="460"></div>

Due to a variety of yarn, such an unusual accessory can be used not only in winter but also in summer.  In addition, various color options make it possible <span>to knit scarves</span> that fit any outfit.  For example, knitted <span>Japanese</span> bactuses with knitting needles from black or white cotton threads perfectly diversify the image in a classic style.  For younger people, a scarf made from section yarn will be a great accessory.  Do not think that such products are suitable only for women, if you make them from rustic yarn or from threads of gray or brown color, the accessory is ideal for men.  In general, to summarize, we can conclude that bactus (knitting needles for it or a hook - it doesn‚Äôt matter) gives a lot of room for the realization of one‚Äôs fantasies and talents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork bactus knitting" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/340723.jpg?1393000085824" width="400"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Benefits of this accessory. </h2><p>  The main advantage of this triangular scarf is that it is multifunctional.  For example, bactus can be used as a regular scarf or as a shawl to keep warm in cool weather.  Also, this accessory can be used as a head scarf, it all depends on the style and the chosen image.  In addition, the advantages of this accessory include the fact that, due to the variety of colors, it will become a favorite wardrobe of even the most strict fashionistas.  Another main plus: knitting bactus with knitting needles is a very simple task that any woman who does not have much experience in this field can handle.  If you can‚Äôt knit, then this scarf can also be made with a hook.  Products will differ in execution scheme. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  You can choose the yarn according to your wishes.  The only recommendation - do not take thick and textured yarn, since the final product will turn out to be quite massive, and wrapping it around the neck will not be so simple.  As for the knitting needles, it is best to choose circular, although a pair of long knitting needles will be able to cope with the task. </p><p>  Bactus can not be attributed to one specific style of clothing, since it can easily complement any image.  This scarf is best suited for sports or <span>casual style.</span>  Such an accessory is best combined with skinny jeans, blouses or warm dresses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting bactus with knitting needles" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/340722.jpg?1393000140615" width="360"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  How to knit bactus with knitting needles? </h2><p>  The knitting process begins with a set of 4 loops on the knitting needles.  Openwork bactus with knitting needles is knitted with a garter stitch <span>,</span> that is, all rows will be knitted either only in the front or only on the wrong side.  It all depends on who is comfortable and familiar.  For knitting many products, the first loop does not need to be knitted, in this case the process changes dramatically. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Knitting bactus knitting pattern </h2><p>  You need to knit both the first and last stitches, as well as the entire row, with any chosen knitting option.  You also need to knit 3 next rows, while you do not need to add or reduce loops.  Now now, only with 4 rows is it necessary to make a yarn, which in the 5th row must be tied with a loop at the back wall to get rid of the hole.  If you did everything correctly, then there should not be a gap in this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese bactus knitting needles" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/340724.jpg?1393000195328" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The next time the yarn according to the principle of the 4th row must be done in the 8th.  It is very important to understand: in order for the bactus to be perfectly even in a triangular shape, the increase must be done only from one selected side.  According to this principle, that is, every 4 rows, the crochet must be knitted to the middle of the product. </p><p>  The width can be different, since it all depends on the selected model.  On average, such a scarf is about 40 cm, if you increase it, the final product will more resemble a shawl.  Bactus for children has a width of about 20 cm, choosing a lower value is not recommended, as in the end you will get something awkward.  Most often, women choose options from 130 to 160 cm long. To quickly determine the size of a scarf before knitting, you can wrap any scarf around your neck.  Basically, the length depends on how exactly you are going to wear your bactus.  For example, the length of the scarf that you wear under the coat will be different from the one that will be worn over the outer clothing. </p><p>  After you get to the middle, you need to make a decrease according to the same principle as you did the increase, that is, in every 4th row.  Decrease occurs in this way: in each 4th row you need to knit 2 loops together with facial viscous.  Thus, you need to knit until you have only 4 loops left on the spoke. </p><p>  A product will be considered finished and correctly connected if it turns out to be symmetrical and when folded in half, all its parts will join. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern of bactus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/340726.jpg?1393000280495" width="600"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Decoration and decor </h2><p>  How to knit bactus with knitting needles, figured out, it remains to decorate the scarf to get the perfect product.  You can decorate, for example, only the ends or the entire product around the perimeter.  As decorations, you can choose pompons, tassels, or fringe.  In addition, it is recommended to <span>crochet the</span> protruding edges of the bactus <span>,</span> as a result you will get an unusual openwork edge.  Jewelry will make a scarf for a woman even more original.  For children's bactus, embroidery can be used as a decor, for example, you can embroider a child‚Äôs name, flowers, animals, etc. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  If you knit according to the principle considered, but only with the <span>front surface,</span> then in the end you will get a scarf called carious.  Its difference from bactus is that you will definitely need to tie the edges so that they do not twist and do not spoil the general appearance of the product.  In addition, you can knit this accessory not only with front and outer loops, but, for example, with an unusual pattern, for which you need to constantly add and remove loops. </p><p>  Another tip on how to diversify the appearance of bactus is to make the first double crochet not in the 4th row, but in the 6th.  In this case, the ends of the scarf will be more elongated and elastic.  Thanks to this, tying an accessory will be much easier.  If you want to tie a bactus from the remnants of yarn, then you need to start knitting a scarf from the middle of the product and move in different directions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles with a lace edge" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/340733.jpg?1393076859216" width="400"></div>
