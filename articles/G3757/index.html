    <h2>  The most expensive option </h2><p>  Naturally, the Fairmont Ajman 5 * hotel (emirate of Ajman) would not be considered 5-star if there were no penthouses in it.  But they are.  And penthouse suites are the most expensive hotel option. </p><p>  You can start from the square.  She in this case is 520 square meters.  m!  And inside there is absolutely everything that may be required.  Even the most sophisticated in terms of conditions and amenities, the guest will like such a suite. </p><p>  Inside, everything is designed in a luxurious style.  Expensive leather furniture, high ceilings, <span>marble floors,</span> exquisite decor elements, elegant chandeliers with a golden surface - all this and much more adds special chic to the interior.  There is a bedroom, a living room and a kitchen equipped with everything for cooking.  There are also two bathrooms and a separate sauna.  By the way, this apartment can accommodate a maximum of 8 people.  Sleeping places are enough for everyone.  After all, the suite has three huge 2 double beds and even sofas. </p><p>  In this case, it is better to quote the price as an example per day.  For two people, this number will cost 440,000 rubles.  Only 1800 will be more expensive for three.  In general, to make it easier, we can say that each guest is another plus 1.8-2 thousand rubles to the main cost (which is 440 thousand rubles).

She will not be superfluous with such prices. </p><p>  Check-in here starts at 14:00, and check-out lasts until noon.  We must take this into account when buying tickets for a particular flight. </p><p>  The hotel is allowed to stay with children, but extra beds are not available for them.  Will have to be placed on those that are in the apartments. </p><p>  By the way, 10% of the service charge and another 11% as a city tax (tourist tax) will be added to all payments. </p><p>  But for children under 6 years of age, meals are provided free of charge.  And for those who are not 12, a discount of 50% is offered.  Guests over 13 years old are considered adults, so they are charged the full price.  And this also applies to accommodation, too.  All who are 13 years of age or older are adult guests. </p><h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  People who have already visited the Fairmont Ajman 5 * hotel, leave positive reviews.  Which, in principle, is not surprising. </p><p>  So, for example, many assure: even if they didn‚Äôt succeed in arriving on time (too late or early flight), there will be no problems with checking in.  In any case, they will try to make the design as fast and comfortable as possible.  And yet, even if guests arrive deep after midnight, they will still be provided with dinner. </p><p>  Many are happy to share their impressions regarding the beach.  Guests say that at the entrance to its territory, guests are given fresh towels and a bottle of cold purified water.  The beach is always perfectly clean - it's nice to be.  The entrance to the water is also very convenient, like the bottom of the sea. </p><p>  Guests pay special attention to food.  She's gorgeous here.  Even breakfasts, which, it would seem, are the same everywhere.  But no, there is a choice: scrambled eggs, omelettes, hot oatmeal, fried sausages, potatoes, a huge variety of tea and coffee and dozens of other dishes.  And yet, if the guests are planning some kind of holiday (birthday, anniversary, anniversary), then you should ask to organize a celebration in the Spectrum restaurant.  The guests, who did just that, assure: they will do everything at the highest level, having fulfilled all the wishes. </p>
