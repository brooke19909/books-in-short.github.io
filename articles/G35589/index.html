It is convenient and practical, and most importantly, you do not need to look for anything and bend down or go down the stairs each time.  Probably, it happens to everyone that they put a thing on a shelf, and then you can‚Äôt find it in this place.  That is why we suggest you familiarize yourself with how you can do such a thing at home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ready tool belt" class="if uuid-3144622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3144622.jpg"></div><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  A tool bag (it‚Äôs easy to make it with your own hands) involves sewing an organizer with cells of different sizes.  They can accommodate various devices that are often needed for minor repairs.  Such a device will save time searching for the necessary screwdriver or hammer.  The maximum number of pockets - 10, is no longer recommended.  A lot of stress on the back can affect your health, in particular, lead to back problems.  Of course, a bag or belt for tools can be found in the store, but the price will not always please, not to mention the quality.  In addition, in terms of functionality, they may not meet your needs.  Therefore, let's save, especially since there are few costs, but many benefits.  Located at the waist - convenient and practical, no need to break away from work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apron for tools" class="if uuid-3144626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3144626.jpg"></div><p>  Such devices can have several varieties: </p><ul><li>  belt; </li><li>  vest; </li><li>  a bag; </li><li>  apron. </li></ul><h2>  Where to find a pattern? </h2><p>  For sewing a tool belt with your own hands, you must have a pattern.  Print ready or make a photo yourself.  The main task is functionality.  If you decide to do it yourself, then you should determine the main points: </p><ul><li>  total size of a belt or bag; </li><li>  number of pockets; </li><li>  the size and purpose of the compartments - for a particular tool it is important to make the correct calculation so that it does not fall out. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="podelkidoma.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tool belt pattern" class="if uuid-3147287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3147287.jpg"></div><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  An equally important issue when sewing a tool belt with your own hands remains the selection of material.  After all, it must be strong and reliable, otherwise it may break at the most inopportune moment.  It is best to use dense fabric - denim, nylon, leather, they have optimal properties for such a product.  It is also worth paying attention to such a parameter as water resistance, so that everything that is there, in any weather, remains dry.  In addition, this is not the only thing that is needed for further work.  You will need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  scissors; </li><li>  pattern; </li><li>  ruler or centimeter; </li><li>  sewing marker, soap or chalk; </li><li>  sewing machine; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  accessories - carbines, latches, Velcro, rivets; </li><li>  Decoration Materials. </li></ul><p>  After preparing all the necessary materials and devices, you can proceed to the next stage. </p><h2>  Sewing </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself tool belt must be cut in accordance with the pattern.  All details must be laid out on the wrong side of the selected material and circle them with chalk, soap or a sewing marker.  Do not forget to add allowances for the seam - in this case, the product will be the right size, if this is not done, the pockets and all parts of the belt will be smaller.  On the finished pattern, allowances may already be added - pay attention to this.  Such a nuance can affect its functionality and practicality. </p><p>  We start from the very belt where the compartments will be located.  The width of the product, the greater the better, it is also worth taking care of stiffness, the length is selected depending on the volume of the waist.  For adjustment, you need to use special accessories - latches or carbines.  Velcro will also look nice, if necessary, it is easy to replace it with a new one.  All options can be found in stores with sewing accessories and consult with the seller, he will definitely tell you a good option from all available. </p><p>  Now we proceed to design the pockets properly: </p><ul><li>  hem of one free edge with a finishing stitch; </li><li>  processing finishing materials. </li></ul><p>  This treatment option will prevent the edges on the fabric from climbing in different directions.  And this can lead to the loss of a tool, which will be extremely unpleasant.  Rivets should be used to reinforce pockets. </p><p>  When all the compartments are finished with the workpiece, you need to place them on the belt in the way the final result will look.  To try on, pin all the details with pins, if everything suits you, then you can start sewing on a typewriter. </p><h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  Before you start sewing a tool belt with your own hands, several points should be considered.  They can be very important for you, so we suggest that you familiarize yourself with them in more detail: </p><ol><li>  Make pockets on the side of the belt where you have a working hand - in this option it will be much more convenient to take a tool.  For clarity, make a sketch, you can even have one. </li><li>  If at work you often use not only small tools, but also something larger, then you should take care of the mounts for them. </li><li>  Carefully consider in which pocket this or that will lie, but do not forget about the even distribution of weight. </li><li>  Unloading belts will help you reduce the load on the back of the weight of the tools. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="shop.magnolia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unloading belt" class="if uuid-3147283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3147283.jpg"></div><p>  Following simple guidelines will help you work comfortably anywhere.  If you buy a ready-made belt, bag or vest for accessories, then pay attention to how securely all the compartments are and the quality of the latches so that everything remains in place. </p><h2>  Second life for old things </h2><p>  It is easy and simple to make a tool belt from old jeans.  To do this, use pants that have been idle for a long time.  The main part will be the upper part of the trousers, since there are already ready pockets there.  If this is not enough for you, then in this case you can increase their number, just do not forget about the restriction - 10 pcs.  It is also worth taking care of the fastener - it must be reliable, but at the same time give in to unfastening, so as not to exert much effort, check if it will open itself.  The greater the weight of the vest or bag, the more reliable the latch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trekkiemom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tool belt from old jeans" class="if uuid-3144638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3144638.jpg"></div><h2>  Original ideas </h2><p>  You can sew a belt for tools on the pattern or without it.  Ideas for this should be taken from the Internet or come up with something new on your own.  For example, take an old belt, fasten a dense fabric on it and sew pockets from a briefcase or pants that have long been idle.  This option is interesting and does not require a lot of time and money.  Everyone in the closet will find things that are unfit for wearing.  So you can give them a second life and get rid of unnecessary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing belt" class="if uuid-3144649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124045/3144649.jpg"></div><p>  A good option for a tool belt (everyone can do it with their own hands) of a small size is an old and small men's bag.  The handle must be cut in the middle and fastened with carabiners or latches.  This option will practically require no effort from you, because all the departments are ready and you don‚Äôt need to sew anything to look for a pattern. </p><p>  As you can see, there are many options, the main thing is to choose the most optimal one for yourself. </p>
