    <h2>  What are Sberbank mutual funds? </h2><p>  <span>Mutual investment funds</span> is a complex that is based on the trust management of the resources (property) of funds by management companies.  Their main functions are increasing the value of shares.  Unit investment trusts are formed on the basis of funds of investors - private individuals.  The main purpose of investment funds is to profit from assets that are <span>securities: bonds,</span> stocks, etc. </p><p>  An investor in a mutual investment fund can be any private person who acquires shares - securities, confirming the right of the owner to a part of the property of the fund.  Moreover, regardless of their number, each investor has the same amount of rights.

But, it would seem, a simple way out of investing poses the following tasks, namely: choosing a company or bank that is taken to operate with other people's money.  As a rule, the largest players in the financial sector come to mind first.  And Sberbank in this line, of course, occupies a leading position. </p>

    <p>  Until 2012, the management company of this bank was named Troika Dialog.  Today, Sberbank calls its brainchild the most substantively - “Sberbank Asset Management”.  The essence of the functions does not change from this.  Clients are offered a fairly large list of funds for investment.  Sberbank mutual funds are represented in all sectors of the Russian economy.  At the same time, the value of the share is initially 15 thousand rubles.  Further contributions are much lower - from 1.5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Even considering that the experience with a large number of mutual funds of highly professional managers is more than 10 years, it is necessary to know both the negative and positive aspects of investing in mutual funds and have at least minimal ideas about how to choose a fund. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Investment portfolio </h2><p>  By 2014, Sberbank Asset Management offers potential shareholders a choice of 23 mutual investment funds.  Each of them has both attractive sides and alarming ones.  So, for example, Sberbank Mutual Investment Fund Ilya Muromets offers potential shareholders a fairly high share price, a balanced distribution of funds for investment in several sectors of the economy and low risks. </p>

    <p>  For lovers of "hotter" there is always a proposal.  One of the most profitable funds is the “Risk Bonds Fund”.  At the time of its foundation, the unit value was 1.7 thousand rubles.  By May 2014, it had grown to 2.5 thousand rubles.  But the profitability in comparison with other funds is simply amazing: 29.4% for 36 months, over the past period from January to May 2014 - almost 3%.  And this despite the fact that most mutual funds for 5 months not only did not increase the value of shares, but reduced them to a minus.  What is the secret to the success of this fund? </p><h2>  Portfolio components </h2><p>  The management company distributes funds in <span>securities of</span> various issuers.  In order for the reader not to become completely confused in terms, we will deal with this using the example of one of the funds - the Dobrynya Nikitich mutual fund.  Sberbank Asset Management founded this complex in June 1997.  Issuers of Dobrynya Nikitich are Russian companies with a high liquidity ratio and growth potential, namely, those working in such areas as: </p><p>  - oil and gas; </p><p>  - telecommunications; </p><p>  - finance; </p><p>  - consumer sector; </p><p>  - media and IT; </p><p>  - chemical industry; </p><p>  - the property; </p><p>  - transport. </p>

    <p>  All shares of issuers can be called part of the investment portfolio.  But this will not be an exact definition.  When buying a share of a low-risk fund, a novice investor should remember that its profitability is quite low.  That is why more experienced shareholders advise "do not put all the eggs in one basket."  The best option would be to invest in at least two different funds: mutual funds with high risks and returns and mutual funds with low risks and stable returns.  This option of capital distribution, as a rule, has the greatest efficiency. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  The choice of company is carried out by evaluating the effectiveness of management.  It is in comparison with the profitability achieved and potential.  But the future client will probably not find information about it.  Officially, the management company cannot advertise the potential profitability of Sberbank mutual funds.  Only her past achievements can serve as an indicator of effectiveness. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and valuation of funds </h2><p>  If, for starters, the investor still chose Sberbank mutual funds, feedback from experienced shareholders on the Internet about their profitability will be the first step to a clear picture of the work of the management company.  Communication on the forums, as a rule, does not reveal any figures and percentages, does not carry a complete analysis, but is useful from the point of view of the practicality of choosing an investment portfolio. </p><p>  Evaluation of funds at the stage of determining which one is worth investing in, still have to do it yourself.  This task is not too difficult.  On the official website of Sberbank, a report on the work of the management company is presented in tabular form.  They contain complete information: the names of the funds, the unit value in each of them, the yield for 36, 24, 12 months of work, as well as for the past period of the current year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pif Dobrynya Nikitich Sberbank" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/421754.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Mutual Fund of Sberbank of Russia - pluses of choice </h2><ol><li>  The biggest plus is that almost everyone can join the fund without special knowledge.  A mutual fund does not require an investor to understand all the intricacies of the process, constant attention and monitor the growth of capital.  The management company is fully engaged in this. </li><li>  The second plus is a consequence of the first: saving personal time of the client.  Bank reliability is worth a lot.  There is no need to spend time on constant control over the course of market falls and ups, directly participate in the process, and so on.  As soon as a client of Sberbank buys a share in a mutual fund, professional managers begin to deal with his papers. </li><li>  Available down payment amount.  15 thousand rubles - a small starting capital to start investing. </li><li>  The simplicity of design.  To join Sberbank mutual funds, it is enough to have only the necessary amount of money and a passport with you.  The client of the management company must write an application for the acquisition of the unit.  And that’s all.  To sell a share is as easy as to acquire, that is, it is also enough to write a statement in the office of the management company. </li><li>  Liquidity of shares.  Mutual funds of Sberbank of Russia are quite diverse in their characteristics.  There are funds with high returns and high risks and, on the contrary, with minimal risks, stable income, but high liquidity.  Such mutual funds require the sale of a share quickly, with the least expenditure of time and with virtually no loss in value. </li><li>  Taxes.  They are taxed only on the yield of mutual funds of Sberbank.  More specifically, net profit.  It is taxed automatically, at a rate of 13%.  Naturally, there is no need for self-submission of a declaration to the tax office. </li><li>  Diversification of investments.  To reduce possible risks, the funds of the shareholder are distributed for the purchase of bonds and shares of various sectors of the economy of the Russian Federation.  This allows the investment portfolio to become more resilient to market falls. </li><li>  Investment security under state control.  The risk of irretrievable financial losses is minimized, since the invested money of the shareholders is not stored in the accounts of the management company.  Funds are transferred to a special depository.  Control over it is carried out by state bodies. </li></ol><h2>  Cons of investing in mutual funds <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mutual funds of Sberbank of Russia" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11866/418486.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><ol><li>  Lack of warranties.  More than one investment fund does not give confidence that a shareholder will receive a profit in any given period of time.  It all depends on market behavior and how experienced and qualified stock traders are.  Risks are always present. </li><li>  Overpricing of unit value.  This is done to attract new investors.  The mechanism of overstatement is quite simple.  Before the reporting period, the management company buys the shares of those enterprises that are already in the portfolio, thereby increasing its value.  Naturally, the price rises and share.  After the reporting period, unnecessary shares are discarded.  The value of the share falls. </li></ol><h2>  The overall result </h2><p>  It is most practical to start investing activities by investing in Sberbank mutual funds.  Profitability, reviews, maximum open information, accessible reporting confirm this. </p>
