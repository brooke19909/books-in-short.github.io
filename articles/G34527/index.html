    <h2>  Create a new area </h2><p>  The history of Tikhoretsk is inextricably linked with the construction of the Vladikavkaz railway line.  In 1860, Tsar Alexander II signed an important document for the city.  It gave instructions on the creation of a new administrative-territorial unit of Russia - the Kuban region.  This decision was made with the aim of economic development of the southern lands, as well as to solve the problems of political consolidation of the country in these territories. </p><p>  In May 1860, a decree was issued to begin construction of the Vladikavkaz railway line.  In the future, this path has had a significant impact on the economic development of the Kuban region. </p><p>  In the process of construction, villages began to appear along the new canvas.  They were intended for railroad workers, among whom there were many peasants who left their villages in search of work. </p><p>  In 1862, the world saw a new Decree, which spoke about the settlement of the Kuban.  Its inhabitants were immigrants from the Voronezh, Chernihiv, Kursk, <span>Oryol provinces</span> and some other regions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The foundation of the Tikhoretsky farm </h2><p>  The history of Tikhoretsk began in 1874. This is the year of the founding of the eponymous Russian railway station.  On May 17, 1874, a train passed here for the first time.  It was a freight train heading south. </p>

Thus began the story of Tikhoretsk.  In 1882, the first wooden station building was built at the station.  At this time, the population of Tikhoretsk consisted of less than fifty inhabitants.  A little later, new railway lines were put into operation with a direction to Novorossiysk, Ekaterinodar and Tsaritsyn.  After that, the station became a hub.

    <p>  1895 was the starting point in the creation of the Tikhoretsky farm.  He appeared on the site of the already attached settlement village.  In this settlement, which is subordinate to the Tikhoretskaya station, more than 2,000 residents already lived.  By 1917, the population of the farm at the expense of the visiting people increased to 14 thousand people. </p><h2>  Farm Development </h2><p>  In a relatively short period of time, Tikhoretsk turned from a small station village into a transport and industrial center of the northern Kuban.  The wooden station building in 1883 was replaced with a brick one.  In the 1890s, steam locomotive workshops began to function here.  At the beginning of the 20th century, a <span>locomotive depot</span> and grain barns were built at the station.  At the same time, numerous private industrial and commercial enterprises began to work in Tikhoretsk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An important role in the development of the farm was played by engineer <span>Boris Akimov.</span>  At the beginning of the last century, he served as the head of the Tikhorets distance.  With the active participation of Akimov in 1902, the construction of the club of railway workers named after  Menshikov. </p><p>  It was one of the first cultural institutions along the entire Vladikavkaz path.  A little later, in 1907, Akimov initiated the construction of a two-year school for women, which later became a gymnasium.  In 1910, on his initiative, another educational institution began to work.  It was a two-year male college.  Through the efforts of Akimov, gifted immigrants from poor families in these educational institutions were paid a scholarship.  After the engineer retired, cash payments were named in his honor. </p><h2>  The advent of Soviet power </h2><p>  The revolutionary wave that swept all over Russia could not but affect the city of Tikhoretsk.  Already in 1900, the first spontaneous performances of employees of locomotive workshops took place at the station.  Since 1902, strikes and rallies have become widespread and frequent.  Major uprisings swept all of Russia.  Tikhoretsk raised a major wave of indignation as early as 1905 </p><p>  The official proclamation of Soviet power took place in 1918 at the club of railway workers.  M. Menshikov was elected Chairman of the Council of Soldiers and Workers Deputies.  Until July 1918, Tikhoretsk was the military center of the Kuban-Black Sea Red Army.  Further, this settlement was occupied by the Volunteer Army, which established ataman rule in the town.  The return of Soviet power to the station occurred only in 1920. </p><h2>  Status change </h2><p>  In 1923, a significant event took place.  Farm Tikhoretsk received the status of a city.  In those years, it belonged to the Kuban-Black Sea region and was located on the territory of the Caucasus department.  In 1924, Tikhoretsk became a district center, and two years later it was included in the list of settlements in the North Caucasus region.  The city grew and developed rapidly.  In 1926, its population exceeded 19 thousand people, and by the end of the thirties it reached 30 thousand. The socio-economic sphere was developing at an enviable rate.  Since the mid-1920s, much attention has been paid to new construction in the city.  So, a poultry and meat processing plant, a hospital building and a second railway club, winter and summer cinemas, a library and a radio center appeared.  By the end of the thirties, the construction of the Palace of Culture was begun. </p><h2>  War with fascist Germany </h2><p>  The history of Tikhoretsk radically changed during the years of World War II.  From August 1942 until the end of January 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans.  This is a tragic period for Tikhoretsk, when 3.5 thousand people were tortured by the Nazis.  The nodal station was considered an important strategic point for both our and the German army. </p>

    <p>  That is why fierce battles followed, as a result of which the city was almost completely destroyed.  In Tikhoretsk, it was difficult to find a surviving building.  In order to restore the ruined city, the USSR government allocated more than 80 million rubles. </p><h2>  The development of Tikhoretsk in peaceful years </h2><p>  After the Victory over Nazi Germany, the city began to recover.  In gratitude to those who defended the freedom of Tikhoretsk, a monument was erected on its Victory Square in 1959. Much later, in the 90s, memorial plates appeared on its foot, on which the names of the dead Tikhorets were carved. </p>

Together with new production facilities (sleeper impregnation, brick, mechanical plant, as well as an enterprise for processing corn seeds of hybrid varieties), the city continued its economic development.  But the peaceful victories of the Pacific people did not end there either.  In the mid-fifties, the Vorovsky factory launched the production of track machines.  In the sixties, wine and canning industries were opened.  In 1964, the factory "Red Hammer" began production of equipment for the chemical industry.

    <p>  Tikhoretsk developed rapidly.  The Krasnodar Territory accepted it into the list of cities of its subordination in 1961. By the seventies of the last century, more than sixty thousand inhabitants already lived in Tikhoretsk. </p><p>  A new twist in the history of the city was the ongoing perestroika in the country.
