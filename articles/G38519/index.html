    <p>  After the revolution of 1917, the estate was nationalized.  In her main house, a museum of landlord life was arranged, and then a colony for street children.  For many years, the former manor house of the estate was used for household needs, and since 1977, the Museum of Local History has been operating here.  Now it is one of the main attractions of the city of Lytkarino.  The museum‚Äôs collection includes ancient household items belonging to the owners of the estate Zotov-Chernyshev, photographs, paintings, archival documents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Near the main building you can see a two-story house.  This is the first stone building in the city of Lytkarino.  At the beginning of the 19th century there was a human room (a house for servants), then the Chernyshevs opened a school for peasant children in this house.  Currently, the building houses the exhibition hall of the museum. </p><p>  Attraction Lytkarino is a manor park around the museum.  It looks well-groomed and beautiful: alleys are laid, lighting is organized, benches and urns stand.  Here are excursions, holiday performances, game programs for children, concerts.  In the park there is a monument to one of the owners of the estate Alexander Ivanovich Chernyshev - the hero of the Patriotic War of 1812.  Restored unique sundial on the original pedestal. </p><p>  There are always many visitors interested in the history and sights of Lytkarino.  Now in the main building of the estate restoration work is underway.  The museum is located at the address: 7th quarter, house 6. </p><h2>  Manor Petrovskoe </h2><p>  Unlike the Chernyshevs estate?  <span>this attraction of</span> Lytkarino has been desolate for many decades.  In 2006-2008, restoration work was carried out here, and now the house has a very well-groomed appearance. </p><p>  The Petrovskoye estate at different times belonged to different noble families: Miloslavsky, Naryshkin, Demidov, Chernyshev.  Its last owners were the Baryatinsky, with them at the end of the XIX century the main house of the estate was built.  It was a building with a colonnade and a round roof structure (belvedere).  The interior of the house was decorated with painted shades, stucco molding and figured stoves.  Around the main building of the estate was a park, which in the 19th century was considered a masterpiece of garden art. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1930, a fire broke out in the house.  The second floor was completely burned out, the luxurious interiors of the halls and the belvedere were lost.  In 1959, restoration work was carried out here, but the superstructures were made in a completely different style, which was alien to the appearance of the manor house.  The building was occupied by various institutions.  And only the latest restoration work returned the house to its original form.  Tourists from Moscow and other cities began to come here to get acquainted with this half-forgotten attraction of Lytkarino.  Photos of the estate can be seen below. </p>
