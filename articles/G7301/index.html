On its territory there are a large number of mineral springs.  For example, in the south-east of the country there is a lake, the waters of which contain almost all the elements of the famous periodic table.  It is called Alakol.  <span>Recreation centers, boarding houses</span> and motels are constantly open for people who come here to regain strength and improve their health.  The healing properties of the lake have been known since Genghis Khan.  He and his army came to the pond to heal the wounds received in battle.  Currently, it is treated for disorders of the nervous system, disorders of the musculoskeletal system, skin diseases.  It is even known that <span>Lake Alakol</span> can also cleanse radiation <span>.</span>  Recreation centers and sanatoriums received famous astronauts who, after a long stay in space, regained their strength and health. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the infrastructure in this region is not well developed.  This is primarily due to the remoteness of the object.  For example, from Alma-Ata it will take about 10 hours to get to the lake by car.  Outside the recreation areas, finding entertainment is almost impossible.  There are also not very many natural attractions in the district.  However, even such inconveniences at first sight cannot be compared with the healing properties of Lake Alakol.  The recreation centers operating in this area belong to different price categories and provide various living and leisure conditions, which can be found by reading this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alakol Holiday Village" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1460415.jpg" width="600"></div>
