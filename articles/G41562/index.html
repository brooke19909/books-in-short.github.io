Cushions, napkins, panels or even vases became quite familiar.  However, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating Christmas decorations in the form of bells is relatively new.  It is actively used in European countries, decorating their homes, Christmas trees, windows and doors.  In addition, it will allow you to get a pretty cute little present - an openwork bell - a hook.  The scheme of such products is not at all simple, but accessible to most craftswomen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas bell crochet pattern" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1251912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Yarn for bells </h2><p>  Very thin <span>cotton yarn</span> is suitable for crocheting small items <span>.</span>  In this case, it is advisable to choose not crochet, but mercerized cotton.  This thread is processed with alkali, so it does not fluff, has smoothness and torsion. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bell hook diagram" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1251913.jpg" width="409"></div>  The decor associated with such material is very expressive.  Otherwise, it will help to get a rather rough and too voluminous bell hook.  The scheme, as a rule, is designed for the use of yarn with a thickness of about 550-600 m / 100 grams.  In extreme cases, a material with a thread length of 450-500 m / 100 grams can be used.

The half-columns are performed in the same way as the double crochet (CCH), but the loop and crochet are knitted together, and not sequentially. </li><li>  1 lifting VP, 1 PS, 1 PS, 2 PS in one base loop (that is, every third PS is doubled). </li><li>  4 VP lifting, 1 VP, column with three crochets.  Repeat the sequence (except lifting loops). </li><li>  1 VP lift, 32 single crochet (RLS).  The row is repeated two more times. </li><li>  1 lift VP, 4 SBN, 20 VP, 1 SBN in the 5th VP, 5VP, 4 SBN.  Repeat 7 times. </li><li>  1 VP lift, 2 sc, 6 sc in a smaller arch, 8 sc in a large arch, 2 sc, 8 sc in a large arch, 6 sc in a smaller arch.  Sequence: 2 sc, 6 sc in a smaller arch, 4 sc in a large arch, attach a petal to the middle of the nearest petal with a connecting column, 4 sc in a large arch, 2 VP, 8 sc in a large arch, 6 sc in a smaller arch. </li></ul><p>  This method will help to execute several identical or one small bell-hooks, the scheme is not difficult, however, skills in working with circular canvases are required.  The process can be simplified by tying the petals without attaching them during knitting.  They can be sewn after the product is ready. </p><h2>  Mount for decor </h2><p>  To make the bell convenient to attach to the spruce branch or to another holder, a loop must be attached from above.  As the material, the same thread that the bell was connected to, as well as a ribbon of satin or organza, is suitable.  In the photo, a crocheted plastic circle was sewn to the bell.  It is very comfortable and beautiful.  You can tie a bow from a ribbon to a little ring or just put it on a branch. </p><h2>  Bell handling </h2><p>  In order for the finished product to keep its shape and fulfill its main function, it must be processed.  Here, with your own hands, I created a crocheted bell hook, the pattern and pattern do not matter, you need to put on a cone made of thick cardboard prepared in advance.  So that the paper does not soften, it must be wrapped in polyethylene and only then put on the bell. </p><p>  If the product has a shape different from the cone, then the basis should be given the appropriate form.  As an alternative, they use light bulbs, cups, figured vases and other shaped objects. </p><p>  After putting the bell on the mold, it is generously moistened with a solution of starch, PVA glue or gelatin.  After complete drying, a durable and voluminous Christmas bell is crocheted.  The pattern of patterns with large holes can lead to the fact that the canvas will be very soft.  In this case, you can soak the product with a solution several times. </p>
