    <h2>  History </h2><p>  For a long time, the beautiful Kirov Park, once loved by many generations of residents, was neglected.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a zoo in it arose from the president of the Udmurt Republic, Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov.  The task was not an easy one, but, to the delight of the locals, it was brought to life.  And on September 10, 2008, the zoo in Izhevsk officially opened.  This event was a gift to residents on the anniversary of the city.  Now it is a pride and an important socio-cultural part of the state infrastructure of the Udmurt Republic. </p><h2>  Zoo in Izhevsk: opening hours, contacts and schedule </h2><p>  Address of the zoological park: UR, Izhevsk, st.

On this day, a couple of polar bears - Nord and Dumka - was born a baby.  According to the director of the zoological institution Svetlana Malysheva, such an event occurred here for the first time.  A bear couple has been living in the zoo since 2008, from the day it was opened.  The good news about Dumka‚Äôs pregnancy was kept secret because of superstitions until the birth of the teddy bear.  Zoologists did not excommunicate the cub from the dipper.  He grew up with his parents in a den.  Employees watched its development and upbringing using video surveillance.  To the delight of the director and staff of the zoo, the mother recognized her baby.  Everyone was very worried about this, because maternal instincts do not always remain in animals growing in captivity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="little bear in Izhevsk zoo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20295/452158.jpg" width="600"></div>  Choosing a name for the newborn has become an event in the city.  Competition for nickname options for the baby was announced in April 2014. Prerequisite: the name must have the first letter "H", like the nickname of Father Nord.  Many options were sent.  On City Day, 06/12/2014, it was announced that the teddy bear in the Izhevsk zoo was nicknamed Nissan.  Today, a healthy and active baby delights zoologists and visitors to the park.
