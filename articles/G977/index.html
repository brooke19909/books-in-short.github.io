Here's what they talk about most often: </p><ul><li>  The hotel is very pleasant and comfortable, it is really 5 minutes to go to the sea at a slow pace. </li><li>  The location is advantageous.  On foot you can walk to the street, where cafes, restaurants, shops and entertainment venues are concentrated. </li><li>  The apartments in life are the same as in the photographs.  Equipped with everything necessary for comfort. </li><li>  Guests are very quickly accommodated.  Even if they arrived ahead of time, subject to availability of rooms, ready to move in, they will be given keys. </li><li>  Maids are cleaned every day, and in good conscience.  Constantly replenish hygiene supplies, bring water - one 0.5-liter bottle per guest. </li><li>  They pay special attention to television - there are many good Russian-language channels through which films are shown around the clock. </li><li>  Room service level.  The ordered food is brought quickly, and it is as tasty as in the restaurant itself. </li><li>  On-site chic pools, you can swim until the evening. </li><li>  Guests are treated with care and respect.  All requests are executed immediately. </li></ul><p>  All in all, Coconut Village is a true paradise oasis in the midst of bustling Patong.  The main thing to clarify when booking that I would like to stay in apartments with increased sound insulation.  Because some rooms are closer to the road, and there it is noisy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.a-hotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coconut Village 3 *" class="if uuid-2968921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2968921.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The average price for a trip for two to Thailand with accommodation in Coconut Village is 85-90 thousand rubles (excluding fuel surcharge).  This price includes: </p><ul><li>  Round-trip flights departing from Moscow. </li><li>  Accommodation for 8 days (7 nights) in a standard 2-bed room. </li><li>  Group transfer from the airport to the hotel and back. </li><li>  Breakfast </li><li>  Medical insurance. </li></ul><p>  The price is, of course, approximate; there are other offers.  You can often find trips and cheaper.  The final cost depends on many nuances, which include the tour operator, airline, room category, the presence or absence of discounts, etc. </p><h2>  5 star hotel </h2><p>  It is important to make a reservation that in Phuket there is another hotel complex with the same name.  We are talking about The Village Coconut Island - a 5-star hotel located on a private beach, from whose open spaces you can enjoy amazing views of Phang Nga Bay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phuketastic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the village coconut island thailand" class="if uuid-2968911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2968911.jpg"></div><p>  This, of course, is a hotel complex of a completely different level.  Travelers who decide to stay at The Village Coconut Island 5 * (Thailand) will be provided with accommodation in chic private villas, each of which has access to its own pool. </p><p>  On the territory there is everything: SPA-salon, fitness center, mini-water park, several swimming pools, sun terraces, restaurants, bars, coffee shop, water sports center ... In general, there is everything that can make the vacation of travelers as interesting and intense as possible . </p><p>  But, of course, the cost of such a vacation will be different.  The average price for a Thailand trip to The Village Coconut Island is 140,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Opinion of vacationers </h2><p>  Located in Thailand, The Village Coconut Island is a real secluded paradise for people who dream of a measured vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novaturas.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coconut village resort 4" class="if uuid-2968913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2968913.jpg"></div><p>  Everything here is conducive to relaxation.  Even the staff is unobtrusive: they clean the apartments, after discussing the time convenient for the guests (when they are on the beach, for example). </p><p>  And the villas are an ideal place for lovers of silence.  Own pool, private kindergarten, and if you go down a little, you can find yourself on the beach, where nothing interferes with unity with nature. </p><p>  But the amateurs of entertainment The Village Coconut Island is not suitable.  After all, he is "cut off" from the mainland.  For the same reason, for people tired of crowds and noise, it‚Äôs better not to find a place. </p><h2>  When is it better to come? </h2><p>  The holiday season in Phuket reigns year round.  But the best time to spend a vacation here is winter. </p><p>  In December, January and February, the air temperature varies from +30.6 ¬∞ C to +31.4 ¬∞ C.  And also at this time there is very little rain, unlike summer.  The sea, of course, is warm.  In winter, its temperature indicators are in the range of 27-29 degrees. </p><p>  And in December, January and February you can get on any excursion.  In summer, during the rainy season, many routes are closed.  In winter, this problem is irrelevant.  And excursions here must be ordered, as there are a lot of picturesque places in Phuket. </p>
