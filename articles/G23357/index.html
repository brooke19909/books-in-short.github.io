  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The functions of political science and its methods.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main functions of political science, like any science, is the solution of the problems that arise in front of it.  Studying the methods and functions of political science, you can understand the importance of this science in modern public life. </p><p>  The most important of the functions of political science can be called cognitive (it is also called epistemological).  It provides both <span>basic</span> scientific <span>research</span> and those conducted by the empirical method and provide a concrete bag of facts, the study of which leads to the correct conclusions about the real situation.  From this function, one can also distinguish a descriptive one, which is designed to give political scientists an answer to the question of what political reality is. </p><p>  The next function of political science, which follows from the previous one, is the explanatory, or, as it is also called, the <em>function of rationalizing social life.</em>  In fact, it makes the conditions and laws of political processes more clear and accessible to the understanding of ordinary citizens. </p><p>  The heuristic function helps to find the truth among the tangled tangle of facts and conjectures that have developed around a specific political situation.  Political science does not welcome naked scientific knowledge of facts; it is more engaged in the search for truth and rational grain in all the processes it studies. </p><p>  When considering the functions of political science, it should be noted that, in addition to the above descriptive ones, it also has a number of other functions related to the analysis and explanation of processes in political life.  So, some functions of political science provide an assessment of political events, figures, institutions.  One of them is normative.  Political science, revealing the laws of political development, provides clear information that is needed in order to effectively manage social processes and not break away from real life.  The managerial function flows smoothly from here.  It is expressed in the fact that applied political science is engaged in the development of practical advices and recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of political process and event management. </p><p>  One should also especially dwell on such a function of political science as prognostic.  Based on the knowledge of patterns <strong> </strong>  political science all the time puts forward hypotheses, theories, and then tests in practice their veracity.  This function is necessary so that political scientists can clearly answer the question of how the political situation will develop and what specific results will be achieved in the current political conditions.  These forecasts are carried out taking into account the actual data, by the method of analysis of historical experience and the current real situation.  Instrumental (applied, organizational) is inextricably linked with this function.  Thanks to her, political scientists can answer the question, "what needs to be done to get the desired political science result."  This is the development of technologies, instructions that political actors need to implement their planned strategy. </p><p>  One should not underestimate the educational function of political science (it is also called the worldview).  Performing this function, political science forms the necessary social political ideals, customs, culture. </p><p>  Modern politics is not only a science with clear norms and rules.  This, in its way, is a very subtle art, which requires serious knowledge in applied psychology, <span>sociology, history</span> and other sciences and just corresponding abilities and skills.  The functions of political science help to better understand the subject being studied and make fewer mistakes in politics. </p>
