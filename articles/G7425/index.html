    <h2>  What is a personal account, why is it needed? </h2><p>  A personal account means a certain sequence of digits that is unique for each subscriber and is his personal ID for the operator.  By naming a personal account number, you can get information of interest from technical support specialists or in the Rostelecom salon, deposit money to pay for services, etc. A personal account number is assigned at the time of concluding a contract for communication services.  Usually, when connecting, the specialist performing the work draws the attention of the user to this identifier, by which he will subsequently pay for the services.  It is indicated in the documentation that is issued to the client in the company envelope.  How to find out the number of Rostelecom's personal account if the subscriber forgot it or does not know where to look?  There are several ways, we give them all below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Method 1 - look at the documents </h2><p>  When you connect the services to the client‚Äôs hands, an agreement is issued, in which exactly the same is fixed, according to which personal account the services will be provided.  The easiest way is to find it and browse.  However, if a long time has passed after the conclusion of the contract or if the user does not have the habit of storing documents, then most likely it is not possible to use this option. </p><p>  Also, often clients of Rostelecom try to find out a personal account by the contract number as follows: they simply look at the contract number and think that this is a personal account.  However, it is not.  The personal account consists of 14 digits and rarely matches the contract number.  Therefore, these terms should not be confused. </p>

    <h2>  Method 2 - study the receipt for payment </h2><p>  You can also view the receipt, which is received monthly by customers to pay for services.  We remind you that the receipt can be received either by e-mail or by regular mail, in paper form.  The variant of receipt of the invoice is determined by the client. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Both in the paper version of the invoice and in the electronic one there is information about the number of the personal account.  The document may indicate: ‚Äúl / s‚Äù or ‚ÄúPersonal account‚Äù.  It is these numbers that the client needs. </p><h2>  Method 3 - go to your personal account </h2><p>  Another fairly simple way to view the personal account number is to visit your personal account on the company's website.  Of course, if the client is already registered on it.  Just enter your username and password - and the necessary data will be displayed on the start page.  At the same time, it will also be possible to view data on services that are activated on a particular personal account, disable them, activate additional packages and options, as well as familiarize yourself with the balance sheet, clarify whether there is a debt, and even pay it.  If the user has not yet managed to start a personal account, then you can register it, because for this you do not need to know the personal account number. </p>

    <p>  If television from Rostelecom is used, information about the personal account number is also reflected in the user menu of the set-top box.  You can read more about how to use this menu in the instructions that come with the set-top box.  By the way, in the set-top box menu, you can also view data on connected services and TV packages, view notifications from the company (displayed as incoming messages), etc. </p><h2>  Method 4 - call tech support </h2><p>  How to find out your personal Rostelecom account in another way?  Call the technical support of the company and explain the situation to the specialist of the subscription department.  The contact center employee will be able to identify the client by address, phone number (when connecting telephony), and contract number.  In some cases, a service code may be required (password, without which the employee will not be able to consult), set by the client himself.  If at the time of the appeal the client forgot it, then the only way to clarify the information is to contact the sales and service salon. </p><p>  Is it possible to call Rostelecom and get a personal account by phone?  Yes, there is such an opportunity.  Of course, this applies only to those users who previously connected the telephony service.  In all other cases, this method will not work, you should choose another option to restore personal account information. </p>

    <h2>  Method 5 - contact the office </h2><p>  How to find out your personal account of Rostelecom if the previous tips did not help?  Another sure way to get data by number is to contact the salon.  In this case, you need to bring your passport with you.  Only the person with whom the contract was originally concluded can receive data on his personal account.  Otherwise, information will be refused.  You can also entrust this procedure to your relative or friend, but in this case you will have to pre-issue a power of attorney for it (general or to perform a specific action in the company‚Äôs cabin).  In the salon, the specialist will check the records in the database and report on personal accounts assigned to a particular person.  Moreover, it is possible to do this even for long-closed l / s, because the operator has a history for each client of the company.  This is especially true when the client wants to check if he has any debts to the company. </p><p>  In this article, we talked about how to find out your personal account of Rostelecom, and provided a description of several methods.  One of them will certainly help the client of the company to clarify the data he needs.  The most checked is the appeal to the office of the company.  After all, here you can get information about the status of personal accounts that were closed several years ago.  This may be relevant when there is a suspicion of debt. </p>
