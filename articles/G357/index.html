In North America, it is better known as Black Jack and is a required member of all the largest online casinos.  The standard set of cards in this case is 52 or 54. In the Soviet period, such decks could be rarely found on the market, more often the option with 36 pieces was used. </p><h2>  Main aspects </h2><p>  The second name of the American version - "Three Seven Ace".  It was this variation of the combination that gave one of the opponents a victory.  The ace value of each variety is 11 points, while Jack, Queen and King are calculated differently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="21 points" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/859150.jpg" width="225"></div>  In <span>Blackjack</span> they had ten full-weighted points, and playing in 21, a point or another version with 36 cards, you had to add 2, 3 or 4, respectively.  Such an adjustment in the rules compensated for the absence of fives, fours, etc. In addition, the game balance was changing, because ten-point cards were much smaller.

    <p>  If you answer the question of how to play 21 in the Soviet version, then the beginning is a classic development of events: the first banker is selected by lot, which changes in turn in the direction of clockwise movement.  <span>The face value of</span> each card in Twenty One contains the following indicators: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Six to ten, each with its own number of points; </li><li>  J-2, Q-3, K-4; </li><li>  A-11. </li></ul><p>  In a situation with Black Jack it is necessary to be guided by such figures: </p><ul><li>  Two to ten are considered at par; </li><li>  Jack, Queen and King add ten points each; </li><li>  Ace always has an eleven-point value. </li></ul><p>  In the case of the 54-card deck, both jokers give 11 points. </p><h2>  Game example of distribution </h2><p>  Understand the general principles and answer the question of how to play in 21, will help a visual description of the actions of all participants in the entertainment process.  After thoroughly mixing the deck, the banker offers to move it.  This should be done by the person sitting to the left of the distributor.  Next, each player receives one card in a closed form (the banker puts an open card for himself). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to play 21" class="if" height="493" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/859120.jpg" width="418"></div>  Having finished the change, the ‚Äúleader‚Äù takes out a copy from below and turns it over for general viewing, placing the deck on top.  The shifting participant has the right of the first move.  He replenishes the bank and begins to ask for an additional card until he reaches the mark of 21 points.  You can stop earlier.  The strategic possibilities of the game are limited, but have several interesting directions, including the classic bluff.  A three, seven, ace or other sequence giving in the sum the right amount of points is considered to be victorious.  After the first participant says ‚Äúenough‚Äù, you can proceed to the distribution to the next player. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to play the point" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/859136.jpg" width="480"></div>  Busting is called any combination summed above twenty one points.  In this case, you will have to discard the cards, but if this option is found in the hands of a person who is dishonest, or simply does not know how to count correctly, you will have to pay the fine agreed to by the participants before the debut distribution begins.  The banker always makes the decision last and open.  If no one scored 21, the winner is the one who has the most points at the time of the showdown.  Dealing, the banker stacks the cards he has won back and discarded, face down on top of the deck.  After the end of the round, the "leader" becomes the participant located on the left.  The transfer takes place in strict order, immediately upon completion of the drawing of the next bank

The most famous modifications include the following amendments: </p><ul><li>  The game is dark.  When collecting a face value of 17 points, you can take the next card without looking and expect a showdown by the banker.  This will make it possible not to pay a fine to the general piggy bank during the search and will exert psychological pressure on the opponent. </li><li>  Knock.  It means obligatory showing of cards by the participants to each other upon reaching two or three times the value of the initially played amount.  The specific ceiling is discussed before the start of the game. </li></ul><h2>  Online casino.  black Jack </h2><p>  Game clubs open on the Internet present users with a version of the game that uses two 52-card decks and a strictly agreed cash betting scheme.  Otherwise, everything develops according to the traditional rules described above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Three Seven Ace" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/859244.jpg" width="600"></div>  Typically, institutions take a five percent fee, and the rate in one hand does not exceed two hundred cu  Here you can find details on how to play 21. Typically, the main nuances are described in the Rules or Instructions section.  The main disadvantage of the online option is the exclusion of additional features and the automatism of the system.  In addition, the number generator is not subject to psychological pressure, as when playing with a real opponent.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, it can be noted that the advantages of entertainment include the ease of mathematical operations, the simplicity of the rules and accessibility, limited by the presence of a deck of cards.  At the same time, learning how to play the point does not mean being an expert.  And the search and application of new strategies always takes place. </p>
