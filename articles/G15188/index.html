    <h2>  DIY wish tree </h2><p>  The easiest way is to make such a tree using a simple drawing technique.  To do this, prepare the following materials: paper, colored pens, felt-tip pens or pencils.  Then draw a beautiful plant with large fruits or leaves that need to be left clean - do not shade.  On them (leaves or fruits) you need to write all your most cherished dreams and wait for them to come true.  But some lucky people are still advised to take feasible steps to implement what was conceived, then desires are fulfilled faster.  You can use ready-made projects - a wish tree, the template of which is presented below, is perfect for such purposes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Today, a wonderful tree is becoming an integral attribute of any celebration.  It is created for a birthday, making a frame of the simplest materials, such as paper or wire, and the leaves are replaced with rhinestones, beads or sparkling jewelry.  In the New Year, such a tree is replaced with a traditional Christmas tree, also tying ribbons on it with a description of your dream.  A wedding wish tree can be drawn by replacing it with a traditional guest wish book.  The simplest technique for performing such a masterpiece is presented below. </p>

    <h2>  Stages of creating a wedding tree </h2><ol><li>  It is necessary to prepare a paper or canvas, its size will depend on the number of those present at the celebration.  If there are too many invited, then you can make several blanks, for example: for relatives, for friends, for colleagues, etc. </li><li>  Apply a bright sketch of the plant to the base, filling the rest of the space with images of the sun, flowers, birds, rainbows, etc. The picture should be very positive and kind.  You can entrust such a responsible matter to professional artists, because the created exclusive masterpiece will be stored in the family archive for a long time. </li><li>  Prepare containers with paint (better than a smaller volume, but more units) or <span>stamp pads,</span> as well as wet wipes or towels.  It is better to choose safe paints in order to avoid allergic reactions in guests. </li><li>  Ask all participants in the wedding to leave a print of their palm or finger on the sketch - in the places of the alleged leaves or fruits (depending on the theme of the picture).  If guests leave a fingerprint, it is better to choose light shades of any color so that the inscription can be distinguished. </li><li>  On the palm print, all present write wishes, and next to the outline of the finger they leave only their names. </li><li>  After completing this ceremony, which should take place with the appropriate music and be accompanied by the comments of the host, the sketch is framed and given to the young. </li></ol>

The stages of work on such a masterpiece are presented below: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to make blanks (twigs) - string the beads on the wire, placing it in the middle of the cut piece.  The number of beads on each blank depends on the size of the future tree. </li><li>  Twist the ends of the wire so that a loop of beads with a long twisted ‚Äútail‚Äù is obtained. </li><li>  Connect all the loops on the base (trunk), which is made of twisted wires of a larger diameter.  Spread loops (twigs).  The splendor of the ‚Äúcrown‚Äù will depend on the number of blanks used. </li><li>  In a container that will serve as an imitation of a flower pot, pour beads and pour glue.  ‚ÄúPlant‚Äù a tree and allow the structure to dry. </li><li>  Spread all the leaflets and decorate the container with beads or rhinestones. </li></ol><p>  Such a wish tree can be presented as an exclusive souvenir to friends and acquaintances. </p><h2>  Real instances </h2><p>  In many countries, there are <span>living trees</span> that help people - fulfill their desires.  Usually these are powerful and beautiful plants located in a park or resort area.  Shreds with <span>cherished desires are</span> tied on their branches <span>,</span> and money is thrown to the roots so that the plan is fulfilled faster.  Many make pilgrimages to such sacred places, believing that this is a more effective way to bring the fulfillment of their desires closer.  The most famous of them are described below. </p><ul><li>  Money oak in Scotland, on the island of Marie.  In his bark, people put small coins and ask the tree to fulfill its plan more quickly. </li><li>  Perhaps the oldest wish tree is in India.  Its dimensions are so large that a dozen adult men cannot grasp it.  Multi-colored ribbons are tied on the branches of this giant, and not only coins, but also small figurines can be seen in its bark! </li><li>  A tree grows in the <span>Maldives</span> , to which those who wish to have a child come.  It is so ancient that it is impossible to distinguish roots from branches on which colored shreds are tied. </li></ul><p>  You can create a wonderful tree in your garden or apartment, choosing the most healthy and strong plant for this.  Ribbons with wishes are tied to it on dates that are significant for the family, and a symbolic ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù is brought to the roots.  It is believed that such a tree helps and serves as a talisman for all family members. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bead wish tree" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14550/366929.jpg?1396669241891" width="423"></div></h2><h2>  Useful advice </h2><p>  The desire tree should always have roots, as they symbolize the strength of the plant and its connection with the energy of the earth.  If this rule is neglected, then the fulfillment of desire may be delayed for a long time or never fulfilled.  After all, if there are no roots, then where to get the power to implement the plan? </p>
