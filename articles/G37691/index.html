After all, people have neither fangs, nor claws to defend themselves - the blade has become their replacement.  Initially, it was stone, but humanity went forward, and the knives were also improved.  Steel appeared, and then they learned how to make its various brands, so it became possible to give products different properties.  A knife for man is indispensable now.  Here we will study in detail the question of how to make a knife with our own hands, so that it meets all the requirements of the owner. </p><p>  A good blade is especially necessary for people involved in extreme sports away from civilization, as well as foresters, huntsmen, fishermen - that is, all those whose activities or hobbies are associated with wildlife.  If something unexpected happens in such conditions, then a durable and convenient knife, when used skillfully, can save a life.  The most important thing is that it is convenient for the blade to perform various tasks.  For example, to cut fish, cut a tree, and also to defend themselves when attacked by a beast.  Now there are many different variations of knives on sale, but in most cases their quality is very poor.  It remains only to make a knife with your own hands at home.  Only then will it be possible to know that the blade will not fail and will be able to fulfill all the obligations assigned to it. </p><h2>  What is the easiest way to make a knife? </h2><p>  Depending on the material and manufacturing technology, the blade is different.  The simplest way is to make a knife by cold forging.  Various garden tools can become the material: shovels, choppers, saws - a bunch of options.  This material is quite malleable, and a knife made of such steel has not been dull for quite some time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Manufacturing process </h2><p>  Reflecting on the question of how to make a knife with your own hands at home, you first need to get tools.  We will need: </p><ul><li>  Hacksaw for metal. </li><li>  Files: one large and the rest smaller. </li><li>  It is not necessary to have a vise, but with them the process will be more convenient and faster. </li><li>  Sandpaper. </li><li>  Drill. </li><li>  Hammer. </li><li>  Anvil or piece of rails. </li></ul><p>  Take a broken or unnecessary garden tool and draw a sketch of a future knife on it.  After we begin to create this form.  To do this, you can use a drill: drill a lot of holes in the shape of the workpiece, then break off the excess and level the surface.  If the shape of the knife is simple, then immediately proceed to sawing with a hacksaw.  To do this, it is easier and more convenient to clamp the material in a vice - so it will hold tightly, without popping up.  When the form is sawn, it needs to be finalized with a file.  Where you need to remove a lot of metal, use a large file, and then process it with smaller ones.  So, the knife is ready, move on to understanding how to make a knife with your own hands. </p>

    <h2>  Secondary processing </h2><p>  In order for the cutting edge of the blade to hold sharpening well, it must be riveted.  This is called the cold forging method, because, without heating the metal, it is simply riveted.  Garden tools have carbon steel, but can be riveted.  On a rail or anvil we rivet the workpiece in the place where its cutting edge will be.  In this process, the shape of the blade may bend a little, because the metal is deformed, on the one hand it contracts, and on the other it expands.  However, such deformation is negligible and almost does not change the <span>appearance of the knife.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Final processing of the knife </h2>

    <p>  After the cutting edge is riveted, the knife is ground - this is required in order to remove the tubercles from impacts.  Some people like to see such marks on their knife, and they leave them.  But here everyone has their own preferences regarding how to make a knife with their own hands and what kind of knife it will be.  However, from a practical point of view, it is better to make the blade smooth, so that all dirt is easily wiped from its surface.  Indeed, moisture can be trapped between dents, which will lead to corrosion, and this is undesirable.  Also, when cutting hard wood, it is better for the blade to pass through the fibers well rather than cling to them. </p><h2>  Hot forging method </h2><p>  To make a serious knife, the blade of which could cut nails, you need a more complex processing process.  First, select the appropriate material.  Need high carbon steel.  From what you can find at home - these are files, drills, springs from cars, as well as spring steel.  With this material you can make a <span>hunting knife</span> with your own hands, which will be much better than those offered in stores. </p>

    <h2>  Hot forging process </h2><p>  To do this, you need a furnace in which you can greatly heat the metal.  It can be built of red brick, coated with clay and heated with coal, providing a strong air flow so that the temperature is higher.  After the iron has heated up, you can start forging.  And then - to form a blank until the blade takes the necessary shape. </p><h2>  Knife hardening process </h2>

    <p>  For a long time, blacksmiths learn to determine the color of a hot metal when it is tempered by immersing it in water or oil.  However, for the layman there is one universal way.  When the steel is hot, you need to bring a magnet to it: if it is attracted to the blade, then you should warm it further, and if not already, then you need to immerse it in water or oil - for hardening.  Knowing the basics of how to make a knife with your own hands, you can improvise to create various models of knives. </p><p>  An excellent knife can be made from a drill.  He is heated and, clutching in a vice, untwist.  Once an even rectangle is obtained, the blade is given the desired appearance.  From such material you can make a <span>Finnish knife</span> with your own hands of excellent quality.  After the blank has acquired the shape of a blade, it is hardened, as described above. </p>

    <h2>  How to make <span>throwing knives</span> with your own hands? </h2><p>  To make such a weapon, it is not necessary to have good steel.  After all, if you take material with a high percentage of carbon, then with an unsuccessful throw, the knife can break.  Therefore, milder steel, however, from a thickness of 5 mm, is quite suitable.  This is necessary so that, firstly, the blade has sufficient weight, and secondly, does not bend.  It is easy to make it by cold forging, after which you just need to grind it so that the surface becomes smooth. </p>

    <p>  However, it must be remembered that the center of gravity of the <span>throwing knife</span> must be strictly centered or offset more toward the blade.  The manufacturing process of such a knife is quite easy, on the one hand, however, on the other, it is quite painstaking due to the need to center the knife.  The handle can be made easier by drilling it. </p><h2>  Flip knives </h2><p>  They are convenient enough for the city, because they take up little space and are very convenient, however, with prolonged use, their mechanism may clog and work poorly.  It is not very convenient to use such a knife while working, however, if there is no alternative, then for a short period of use it can become an excellent assistant.  To make a folding knife with your own hands, you need to choose a reliable mechanism in which the blade will not loosen.  It is better to give preference to a model in which the blade pops up from the side.  After all, as practice shows, if the blade is well tightened and equipped with bearings, it will not loosen for a long time.  But in knives with frontal ejection of the blade, backlash of the blade is inevitable and only intensifies in operation.  This is more a stylish toy than an instrument. </p><p>  This article examined all the ways to make a knife with your own hands.  Of course, this is a rather time-consuming process, requiring considerable effort, and in some cases, technical devices.  However, the result is worth it, and the thing will last for many years. </p>
