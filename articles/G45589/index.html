    <h2>  Impressions </h2><p>  Liman Park Hotel 3, reviews about which tourists leave good, is attractive primarily for its low prices.  The best offer from tour operators today is the cost of 15,000 rubles per person for seven nights with the concept of "half board" and departure from Moscow.  True, it is constantly changing, depending on the availability of a charter flight and season. </p><p>  In their reviews, residents separately note the convenient location of the hotel and the nearest beach, on which there is always a lot of free space and clean. </p><p>  As for the numbers, the Russians have no particular complaints: they are always tidied, in addition, they have everything to make it comfortable to relax. </p><p>  Our compatriots are somewhat dissatisfied with the paucity of the proposed menu, but it all depends on preferences.

Moreover, many tourists choosing this particular hotel knew that they were not going to a five-star hotel with an all-inclusive concept, but to a modest three-ruble note, the price of which fully corresponds to the offered service. </p>
