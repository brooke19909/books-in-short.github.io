    <h2>  What is the essence of the source data for design? </h2><p>  The initial data for the design is the information reflected in the documents that are executed with the participation of legal entities arising in the framework of the implementation of a project.  As a rule, construction. </p><p>  So, the main source in the interaction of partners who implement the project, within the framework of which the construction or repair of a building or structure is carried out, may be a contract signed by them.  It can be supplemented by documents in which key initial data for design are recorded, for example, by a technical task.  It usually fixes the wishes of the customer, the conditions for the <span>implementation of the project,</span> various technical requirements. </p><p>  The list of initial data for design can be clarified taking into account the specifics of a particular project, as well as the conditions for its implementation.  The collection of necessary information within the framework of design can be carried out both directly by the customer and the design organization, if this is provided for by agreement between them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Source data generation </h2><p>  What algorithm can collect the necessary initial data for design? </p><p>  First of all, the specialist responsible for the formation of the information under consideration should familiarize himself with the specifics of the designed facility.  To do this, he may need active communication specifically with the customer.  In the process of communication of these entities, all types of necessary information must be exchanged, which are necessary for the formation of project documentation. </p>

    <p>  Initial data for the design of construction are also collected in the course of interaction between the customer and the design organization on the acquisition by the obligated party of the technical conditions for the facility.  This condition is the most important from the point of view of developing high-quality design documentation. </p><p>  Another key step in collecting baseline data is obtaining the necessary permissions from regulatory authorities, if this, of course, is required based on the specifics of the implementation of a particular project.  The developer of the <span>project documentation</span> should also familiarize himself with the information about what minerals are located on the territory of the work: the possession of this information may affect the formation of plans related to obtaining certain <span>permits.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The designing organization may need to familiarize itself in detail with the information that is recorded in state registers - such as, for example, the State Committee for Civil Protection and the Unified State Register.  In many cases, familiarization with them precedes the stage in which the designer determines what initial data for the design should be collected when the organization fulfills its obligations under a specific contract. </p><p>  The next important task of the designer is to coordinate with the partner the territory of the construction work, the places on which the objects to be built should be located. </p><p>  Another major stage of the organization‚Äôs work is the preparation of a land allocation scheme based on the information that is reflected in the cadastral map. </p><p>  It is worth noting that a specific list of source data is collected based on the characteristics of a single enterprise, and the process of its formation can be characterized by a large number of nuances. </p><p>  Consider what a typical list of the source data used in construction projects can be. </p><h2>  Typical list of initial data in construction: details of documents </h2><p>  The initial data for design in the construction industry can be represented, first of all, by the details of the documents, which serve as the basis for the development of documentation.  For instance: </p><p>  - federal, regional, municipal or departmental programs; </p><p>  - normative legal act of the executive authority at the federal or regional level, municipality; </p><p>  - A decision issued by the management of the developer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In turn, it is also planned to prepare the initial data, which must be obtained in order to prepare directly the project documentation. </p><h2>  Initial data for the preparation of project documentation </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about the formation of the following sources: </p><p>  - assignments for the implementation of design, if the documentation is prepared on the basis of an agreement; </p><p>  - reporting documents on the basis of engineering work; </p><p>  - title documents pertaining to the facility under the capital construction project, if we are talking about it; </p><p>  - urban development plan of the site, which is presented for the <span>construction of an object of capital construction</span> - approved, as well as registered in the prescribed manner; </p><p>  - documents related to the use of sites to which the jurisdiction of urban planning regulations cannot be extended; </p><p>  - technical conditions determined in accordance with the Town Planning Code of the Russian Federation and other normative acts; </p><p>  - documents certifying the coordination of deviations from the norms fixed in the technical conditions; </p><p>  - documents on deviations from the established limit values ‚Äã‚Äãof the permitted construction of facilities, if necessary based on the specifics of a particular project; </p><p>  - acts issued by the owner of the facility on its decommissioning, if required by the project implementation plan; </p><p>  - decisions of the municipal authority in the event that an appropriate sanction is expected; </p><p>  - information on the specifics of the functional purpose of the facility, on the structure of production, the features of the products or services - as part of the project at the industrial enterprise; </p><p>  - data on the needs of the facility for certain types of fuel, gas, water, electricity; </p><p>  - information on the design capacity that characterizes the facility, if it has an industrial purpose; </p><p>  - data on the sites that are supposed to be used in the implementation of the construction project; </p><p>  - information about which <span>categories of land</span> will be used during construction; </p><p>  - data on the amount of cash that must be sent to the owners of land in order to reimburse them for possible losses; </p><p>  - data on the use of various inventions, research results when implementing the project; </p><p>  - substantiation of the available opportunities for the implementation of the project within the framework of individual stages; </p><p>  - information on planned costs associated with the modernization of infrastructure located in the construction area; </p><p>  - location schemes of certain designed objects, the definition of the boundaries of easements, if necessary during the implementation of the project. </p><p>  This list of information is very impressive, but it can not be considered exhaustive. </p><p>  The initial data for the design can also be supplemented by those contained in the materials in which they are approved: </p><p>  - a conclusion on the structure of the chemical composition of groundwater, soil, the concentration of pollutants in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãconstruction work; </p><p>  - information about the available, as well as the projected sources of water supply for the project, water protection zones, pressure in the water supply network, water quality, sewage systems; </p><p>  - substantiation of methods for laying heat supply infrastructure; </p><p>  - data on pipelines, justification for the method of connecting various elements of the infrastructure within the framework of the project, elevator control systems, alarm systems, communication networks, television; </p><p>  - data on the issuance of various permits by type, as well as fuel limits; </p><p>  - justification for the formation of pipeline routes, as well as the boundaries of the protected area. </p>

    <h2>  Initial data on technological solutions </h2><p>  There is other significant information regarding what is needed to implement the project.  So, the initial data for the design can be supplemented with information related to technological solutions in the framework of the project.  Namely: </p><p>  - reflecting facts about the production program, characteristics of production technologies, requirements for ensuring the functioning of business operations, information about the main resources that are used for the needs of the enterprise; </p><p>  - including the characteristics of the sources of supply of raw materials to the company, if the construction of industrial facilities is carried out within the framework of the project; </p><p>  - containing a description of the various requirements for the parameters of products, again, when it comes to production facilities; </p><p>  - including substantiation of indicators, as well as characteristics of the processes carried out at the enterprise; </p><p>  - reflecting the description of the types of auxiliary types of equipment, vehicles, as well as various mechanisms. </p><p>  What other parameters will need to be specified in the documentation?

    <h2>  Industry specifics for determining source data </h2><p>  There is also industry-specific input data generation.  What could it be? </p><p>  First of all, the need to follow the norms of various industry regulations.  So, for example, there is a Regulation on the initial data for design, approved by the Deputy Minister of Industry of the Russian Federation on January 30, 2002.  This source of law governs how the source data should be formed in order to design the output of products that are produced by enterprises in the chemical industry. </p><p>  Moreover, the jurisdiction of this normative act extends to all enterprises, regardless of the specific legal form of business.  The regulation on the initial data for design, approved for chemical industry enterprises, establishes how the composition, procedure for development, design, approval process, and approval of relevant information should be determined. </p><h2>  Baseline generation and regulation </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that the industry normative act - the Regulation on the initial data - includes the norms according to which the competent specialist should also be guided by the provisions of federal normative acts when developing documentation.  For example, such as Federal Law No. 116- adopted on July 21, 1997, which regulates industrial safety issues. </p>

    <p>  The development of initial data, the design of documents, which will reflect the information necessary for the implementation of certain projects, should therefore be based on the provisions of regulatory acts that can be adopted at different levels.  Of course, not only regulatory sources at the level of federal laws or departmental legal acts can be taken into account, but also local norms reflected in internal corporate administrative documents. </p>
