The miniature medieval town of the Renaissance is a reconstruction of a <span>Spanish village of the</span> 15th century.  Despite the fact that this is the so-called remake, it is incredibly popular among tourists. </p><h2>  The story of a small oasis </h2><p>  In the picturesque resort of Casa de Campo is the city of artists in the Dominican Republic, located on a high hill.  Overlooking the Chavon River, a man-made monument appeared, thanks to the desire of the American millionaire to present his daughter with an unusual gift.  Charles Blachdorn, the owner of a successful company that has been involved in producing paintings and developing sugarcane plantations in a country where summer lasts all year round.  The tycoon, who first visited the republic, was fascinated by her amazing beauty.  He decided to move here for permanent residence, buying a luxurious mansion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic sightseeing artists" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2046557.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The rich man wanted to give his daughter an unusual surprise and invited a famous Hollywood decorator to develop a project that began in 1976.  The American dreamed of reconstructing the Spanish medieval complex with narrow ornate streets paved with cobblestones, cozy houses with arches and balconies, and artists and architects brought romantic notes to the small oasis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Unusual gift </h2><p>  The creation of the future city of artists in the Dominican Republic was attended by masters familiar with the crafts of a distant era, because the customer wanted to achieve historical authenticity. </p><p>  After 16 years, in 1992, Blachdorne gave his daughter a unique gift, to which the famous Frank Sinatra, who financed the construction of a giant Greek-style amphitheater, also had a hand in it.  Later, concerts of famous pop stars took place in it: Sting, Shakira, <span>Julio Iglesias.</span>  In addition, film producers have chosen this place as the filming of Hollywood blockbusters. </p><h2>  City as a decoration for Hollywood films </h2><p>  Tourists who are going on vacation and wanting to get acquainted with an amazing monument will be interested to know the name of the city of artists in the Dominican Republic.  The complex, which can be bypassed in 20 minutes, is called Altos de Chavon (Altos de Chavon).  In the village, talented architects brought to life the best traditions of European medieval architecture.  Of course, one cannot help but see the influence of Hollywood that affected the layout of the unusual complex: each street looks like the perfect decoration for the films. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Artists in Dominican Republic Description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2046556.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cultural Center </h2><p>  The cultural center, which has turned into a popular tourist attraction, is led by Dominic, the daughter of an American rich man, for whom the gift was intended. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In a half-empty village in the afternoon, surprised visitors roam on tour buses, and only after seven in the evening, when cozy restaurants open, an active life begins here.  The amphitheater at night turns into a fashion club where only guests of the resort of Casa de Campo have fun. </p><h2>  City of artists in the Dominican Republic: description </h2><p>  The architectural ensemble is made of coral limestone, which acquires, in the light of the setting rays of the sun, an iridescent golden-pink hue. </p><p>  All streets paved with artificially aged stone converge in the central square of the town.  The journey from one part of the attraction to another takes no more than 15-20 minutes, and during this time visitors enjoy the wonderful panorama of the Chavon River and the nearby valley covered with dense forest. </p><h2>  Church of St. Stanislav </h2><p>  In the center of the square stands the temple, which the decorator entered into the project.  The church of St. Stanislav, named after the patron saint of Poland, has become no less famous attraction than the city of artists in the Dominican Republic.  In the 70s of the last century, the pope visited her, so the name of the temple is a tribute to a man revered by Catholics, a Pole by birth. </p><p>  This is a functioning church where mass is held on weekends.  It married Lisa Maria Presley and King of Pop Michael Jackson and other famous couples.  And now lovers from different parts of the world come here to hold a memorable solemn ceremony. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Artists in the Dominican Republic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2046561.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The religious site is located on a picturesque square, one side of which ends with a steep cliff, from which wonderful views of the small river open.

Pieces are staged here, music festivals and concerts with the participation of world stars are held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the name of the city of artists in the Dominican Republic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2046535.jpg"></div>

    <p>  F. Sinatra laid the tradition of performing in a building that transfers to Ancient Greece after he sang at a celebration that was dedicated to the opening of the amphitheater. </p><h2>  A fascinating adventure in the village </h2><p>  Excursions to the city of artists (Dominican Republic) are held regularly.  The cost of a visit is $ 25, but do not forget to pay a guide who will tell you in detail about all the objects of interest.  True, as tourists advise, it is best to come here not as part of an organized group, but on your own, to completely plunge into the magical world of art, enjoy architecture, imbued with the spirit of freedom, and participate in colorful performances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic city of artists photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2046558.jpg"></div>
