  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting traces with knitting needles: two simplest ways to make using two knitting needles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Knitting slippers</span> and <span>slippers</span> with <span>knitting needles is</span> not only useful, since it is very nice to put cute original half-noses on the legs at home, but even to some extent curative.  Indeed, as proven by neuropathologists, manual labor is extremely calming for the nervous system.  Moreover, achieving the goal develops determination and perseverance, perseverance and willpower.  And the moment when the thing is completed gives the needlewoman inexplicable pleasure. </p><p>  For the attention of those who wish to do this, the craftswomen offer a variety of different ways.  The simplest of them are the options for performing models on two knitting needles.  So here we are, proceeding from this, we proceed to describe the manufacture of the model: ‚ÄúKnitting traces with knitting needles of the‚Äú winding ‚Äùtype with a seam.‚Äù </p><p>  For her, the needlewoman needs only one skill - making a rectangular knitted fabric.  Drawing can be absolutely any.  If desired, even a craftswoman can apply knitting a jacquard pattern with threads of different colors. </p><p>  You should knit a cloth measuring 35 centimeters by 10 centimeters.  One of the long sides of the rectangle can be decorated with <span>crochet.</span>  It can be a simple strapping or corners, lace or even a ruffle like a ruffle. </p><p>  We can assume that <span>knitting the tracks with the</span> needles of this model is completed.  Now we proceed directly to the final phase - wrapping the track and stitching the model on the sole.  We apply the narrow side to the inner ankle, closing it with a small spacing of 7-8 centimeters.  We wrap the foot around the heel and obliquely, with a ‚Äúschalke,‚Äù overlapping the first narrow side of the rectangle.  The second narrow side should hide under the foot. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It remains only to stitch together the entire trace.  The model can be decorated at the junction of the ‚Äúshawl‚Äù with pompons, a button, a bow or a flower - as you like.  But even without decoration, these soft shoes look simply amazing! </p><p>  The pattern of <span>knitting traceless</span> needles without a seam on two needles is also quite simple.  But the completed model has an advantage over the first one in the fact that its manufacture does not use seams on the sole, which in some cases create certain inconvenience when walking. </p><p>  To make it easier to understand, we‚Äôll use the following conventions: we will designate the facial letters with the letter Y, the wrong ones with the letter Z, the crochet with N, and the two loops knitted together with X. We put 41 stitches on the knitting needle if we decided to make tracks for an adult and, accordingly, less for children.  Their number must be odd. </p><p>  We knit the first five rows with the pattern that will connect the entire track.  We will consider a model connected by ordinary facial loops.  Therefore, the 6th row is knitted like this: 20 Y, N, Y, N, 20 Y. The 7th row - 43 Z. The 8th row: 21 Y, N, Y, N, 21 Y. The 8th row: 45 Z. This algorithm executes the entire upper part of the foot.  Now you need to switch to knitting the soles. </p><p>  If knitting the tracks with knitting needles is done by a completely inexperienced craftswoman, then it is quite acceptable to simply knit the middle 9 loops so that you can then attach the sole to the sides with a needle.  For convenience, it will be necessary to remove non-working loops either on spare knitting needles or on a thread.  Just do not forget that the sole in this version smoothly passes into the back of the model.  Therefore, in the manufacture of it is necessary to try on the track on the foot in order to determine the length of this strip. </p><p>  But more often the option is used when the sole is made similar to <span>how the heel of a</span> regular sock is <span>knitted</span> - that is, without a seam.  We need 9 loops on the sole - we will rely on them.  So, 1 row of the sole should be done exactly in the middle of knitting.  Why do you need to find the middle loop and after it knit 4 Y, X. Then we turn the knitting, regardless of the fact that the row is not finished.  Further, all the even rows are knitted according to the pattern: * do not knit the first, 9 Z, X *, turn the product.  And all the even ones according to the scheme: * do not knit the first, 9 Y, X *.  And finally, only 9 stitches left on the spoke. </p><p>  Now you should start knitting the backdrop.  We do it this way: we knit 8 Y, and along with the ninth we grab the side loop - X. The front rows all need to be knitted in a similar way.  And the wrong ones are carried out according to the principle of 8 Z, X the ninth together with the loop seized from the side of the product. </p><p>  Knitting of the tracks with needles ends in this way when all the side loops are involved.  At this stage, all remaining loops should be closed, and the neck of the track should be crocheted.  The item can also be decorated with pompons or crocheted flower. </p>
