Here, dazzling white sand and clear white water caress the deserted coast, lush exotic greenery captivates with its unusualness, rainbow birds cheerfully wake up in the mornings with their singing, and hotels - the embodiment of a dream of perfect relaxation and peace.  Medhufushi Island Resort is one of the most beautiful places to enjoy a paradise vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="keywordsuggest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water Villas" class="if uuid-2532166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2532166.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of rest in the Maldives </h2><p>  Maldives is a small archipelago consisting of many small islands in the Indian Ocean.  Their area is so small that the airport is located on a separate stretch of land, and the capital of Male - on the other.  All hotels are scattered in the sea, like robinsons, each on its own island.  Wealthy tourists use seaplanes to get from the airport to their hotel, and those who choose a budget vacation use speed boats.  Between the main cities of the country ferries run. </p><p>  A rich vacation away from noisy cities begins already in a taxi plane.  The service in them is top notch.  Tourists are offered refreshments, wet towels and light snacks.  The windows of the windows open breathtaking views of the ocean and the small rows of bungalows surrounded by bright coral reefs.  In many hotels, small individual houses are located directly in the water, and they are connected to the land by small wooden houses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.holistictour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pool Bungalow" class="if uuid-2532164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2532164.jpg"></div><h2>  When is it best to go to the Maldives </h2><p>  The islands are located near the equator, and all year round the air temperature here does not drop below 28-30 ¬∞ .  In the climate there is no pronounced seasonality, as we have here: winter, spring, summer and autumn.  But there are months with rains and months without rains.  The season in the Maldives begins when it gets colder and autumn begins, that is, somewhere from October-November, and ends in April.  All the summer months of the island are influenced by the southwest monsoon, which raises waves and brings frequent rains. </p><p>  If you are flying to the Indian Ocean to merge with nature: diving, cycling around the islands, admiring crystal clear transparent water, then choose the peak of the hottest period.  The season in the Maldives without rains, wind and an abundance of shallow plankton off the coast is January-February and a little March.  It is during these months that the lulls of the island become an example of peace and tranquility.  Only here you can completely isolate yourself from worldly problems and be alone with yourself and nature. </p><h2>  Prices of tickets to the Maldives </h2><p>  As you know, holidays on the distant islands are very expensive.  The flight is about 8 hours with a change in Dubai.  The price of a ticket to the Maldives per person for ten days (8 nights) starts at 70,000 rubles.  The price includes: flight, transfer to the hotel, accommodation, breakfast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another feature of holidays on the paradise islands is that almost all hotels include only breakfast in the price.  This is a type of BB food.  This is slightly different from the usual All Inclusive service in Turkish and Egyptian resorts.  Type of food BB means literally bed and breakfest, which means "bed and breakfast."  Hotels have their own restaurants and it is assumed that you need to order food there yourself.  And to get a boost of energy for the whole day, a light breakfast is enough. </p><p>  The price of rest at the Medhufushi Island Resort hotel per person per 10 days is 165,000 rubles.  The hotel has a category of 5 stars and boasts excellent service and beautiful rooms. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Medhufushi Island Resort is located on Miimu Atoll.

A variety of dishes, there is fish, meat, many seafood.  An abundance of fruits, many grow right on the island.  Alcohol can be purchased separately.  Tourists do not recommend choosing the All Inclusive system, because, apart from breakfast and free cocktails, nothing else is included. </p><p>  The hotel has a lot of staff ready to fulfill any request.  Sometimes it seems that there are even more of them than vacationers themselves.  There are special people who make a bed and put swans from towels.

All tourists are advised to buy a local SIM card at the airport and use the Internet services through it.  Maldives is a multinational resort, but most of all the Chinese like to relax there.  According to tourists, there are many at any time of the year. </p><p>  But the big plus of the hotel is that all the houses are separate from each other and the chance to meet their neighbors is small. </p><p>  Tourists also note that, in general, the resorts of the Maldives are quite boring.  In fact, you are attached to your island, where you have everything to relax.  You can go to the capital or any other city in the country, but for this you need to rent a boat or a seaplane separately. </p><p>  Overall, the hotel rating is very good.  Small cons they are everywhere, but there are still more pluses.  Beautiful vacation on a paradise island!  Come to the Maldives at any time of the year and enjoy impeccable service. </p>
