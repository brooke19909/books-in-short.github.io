In the line there are many models of the most diverse equipment.  The smartphones of this well-known company are especially popular.  In this article we will look at one of the most common models today - Samsung Galaxy S4, the technical characteristics of which are still of interest to many, despite the fact that the phone is not a novelty of the season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 feature" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31321/814612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design of the device is an extremely controversial topic.  After the model entered the world markets, a lot of complaints to the Korean manufacturer appeared regarding the <span>appearance of the</span> device.  The thing is that visually the novelty was practically no different from its predecessor.  In fact, this is one of the main problems of the entire series of Samsung smartphones.  There is no design at all, all products are made in one style, as if the manufacturer deliberately seeks to anonymize their models.  The characteristics of the <span>Samsung</span> Galaxy S4 <span>phone</span> , in terms of external performance, are largely similar to all the device design descriptions from the company.  The flagship has simple, streamlined on all sides, uncomplicated shapes.  The device is as smooth as <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãpebbles.</span>  Its plastic case and gloss, so unloved by users due to constant scratches, does not deter its acquisition.  It's amazing that even despite such a faceless design, Samsung Galaxy S4 (whose technical characteristics cover all the flaws of the case) is in the top of the best-selling models in the world.  Sly Korean manufacturers understand as well as you and me that appearance is by no means the most important factor when choosing a phone.  The company frankly declares that in the near future it is not going to change its strategy.  However, perhaps this should be done, especially with such production capacities.  Compared to its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S4, whose characteristics are largely identical, has slightly less rounded corners, a slightly wider rim and a different flash location.  The dimensions and weight of the device remained unchanged.  The innovations include materials: ordinary polycarbonate has replaced ordinary plastic.  This is good news, because there is a chance that the new case will be more scratch resistant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Usability </h2><p>  The keys and connectors of the model remained in place.  The side rim framing the display has slightly decreased, which made it possible to fit the characteristics of a larger screen into the same dimensions of the Samsung Galaxy S4.  This, of course, is commendable, because the large screen will appeal to everyone, but the sheer size confuses many.  It is also encouraging that the back cover remained removable, that is, the user has the opportunity to replace the battery on his own, insert a SIM card without additional devices, etc.  Initially, the phone came in two colors (black and white), a little later appeared colored cases, which allows everyone to choose a gadget in their favorite color scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 specifications" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31321/814196.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Once embarked on a path, Koreans invariably follow it.  The new Samsung Galaxy S4 (screen characteristic 1920 √ó 1080 pixels) is equipped with a Super AMOLED display.  The diagonal is 126 mm., Full <span>HD resolution</span> and more than 441 pixels - pixel density, really pleased buyers.  In general, the screen is quite good, brightness is quite enough, wide viewing angles are certainly a plus, the smallest elements on the display are clearly visible.  The screen is sensitive to touch.  Samsung Galaxy S4, the characteristic of which is discussed in this article, is distinguished by another interesting feature - the ability to control the sensor with gloves on.  This is very convenient, especially considering the harsh Russian winters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 mini specifications" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31321/814200.jpg" width="600"></div>

The new smartphone received a good camera.  Of course, this applies directly to the photo processing algorithm itself, because Exmor R (camera module) at Samsung was developed by Sony.  A matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused that has BSI backlight and has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  There is also a <span>front camera,</span> aimed, as a rule, at creating self-portraits and video calls (its resolution is 2 megapixels).  The manufacturer promises users the possibility of one-time shooting from both cameras.  An interesting addition will be software that is able to compose and process the resulting materials, creating entire stories, accompanied by an audio track.  There is no dedicated button for a photo on the case, but this is not required, because you can release the shutter using the volume key.  In general, a sufficiently high-quality camera is equipped with the Samsung Galaxy S4.  The characteristic in numbers for many does not carry any practical information, so you can view photos taken by the flagship on the street and indoors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 specifications" class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31321/814611.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The hardware platform of the smartphone is based on the powerful SoC Exynos 5410 Octa.  It consists of 2 quad-core processors (ARM Cortex - A15 with a frequency of 1.9 GHz and ARM Cortex - A7 with reduced frequencies of 1.2 GHz.).  The application proposed by the company is obvious: with a serious load, the first one is used, and energy-efficient ones are replacing the top cores to fulfill those tasks that do not require significant processing power.  As for image processing, here Samsung Galaxy S4 (decent graphics performance, as already mentioned) is supported by the specialized graphics core PowerVR SGX 544MP3. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="feature phone samsung galaxy s4" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31321/814610.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The flagship is equipped with a removable battery, which can be extremely necessary, for example, in situations with a swollen battery (which sometimes happens) or in cases of long trips, when it does not hurt to get a second battery.  The smartphone also supports the <span>wireless charging</span> feature indispensable for all advanced users <span>.</span>  In more detail, they will talk about the capabilities of the Samsung Galaxy S4 battery. Features: </p><ul><li>  The Internet.  When Wi-Fi is on and the browser page is updated every minute, the gadget withstands about 8.5 hours of operation.  All this at 70% brightness and off means of saving. </li><li>  Reading.  In the conditions of disconnected wireless networks, the phone remains charged for 10.5 hours with automatic page turning. </li><li>  Video.  It is possible to play continuously for 10.5 hours, unlike the Samsung <span>Galaxy S4 Mini, the</span> characteristics of which are slightly lower (6 hours of battery life in the specified mode). </li></ul><p>  In general, it can be noted that the flagship‚Äôs battery life is satisfactory.  However, you have to constantly monitor and disable unnecessary services.  In this regard, the phone is similar to powerful smartphones of other well-known manufacturers.  If you constantly keep all applications and services turned on, charging will hardly last until the evening. </p>

    <h2>  Samsung Galaxy S4 Duos (specifications) </h2><p>  In fact, this is a small copy of Galaxy S4.  Here, everything is a little smaller: the screen, the case, the camera resolution, and performance.  The main advantages of the model are compactness, a more affordable price and, of course, the ability to install two SIM-cards at the same time.  This point is often decisive when choosing a particular smartphone.  In modern conditions, when you need to be constantly in touch, it is very convenient to have one device and several SIM cards in it.  This allows you to save on calls between different operators and not carry several devices with you. </p><h2>  Remarks </h2><p>  With continuous use, the Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone (the characteristics have been examined in detail) gives problems in the camera, which were subsequently fixed in the new firmware. </p><p>  Like most powerful phones, heating of the top of the lid is observed, but this is only with severe loads. </p><p>  There are also some complaints about the Super AMOLED display and the difficulty of using it on a sunny day. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Galaxy S4, as well as Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini, whose characteristics are slightly lower, are certainly high-end smartphones.  The company does not disappoint its fans and continues to produce quality products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone samsung galaxy s4 specifications" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31321/814202.jpg" width="600"></div>  As for prices, everything is standard here: the starting price at the beginning of sales is 30,000 rubles, but it is rapidly falling with the release of new models.  If for you the main thing is not the appearance of the device, but its practicality and ‚Äúfilling,‚Äù you can safely get the ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù.  For many years, the phones of this company have been in the top of the best and are the main competitors of the iPhone, Sony, HTC and others.
