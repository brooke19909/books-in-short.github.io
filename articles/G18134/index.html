    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of happiness" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/1545116.jpg"></div>  Spouses Irina Nekrasova and Yuri Dremin - musicians from Novosibirsk, quite famous in their city.  These creative people have always considered themselves happy enough and were able to enjoy the little things.  Even more, a married couple likes to share their own happiness and positive emotions with people around them.  Today, Irina and Yuri admit that their museum of happiness appeared literally "by itself."  The first exhibits were souvenirs given to the couple during their trips and purchased by them personally.  When the collection became large enough and interesting, the idea arose to show it to the public.  The official foundation date of the museum is 2009.  The first years the exposition did not have a permanent residence permit and was mobile.  The creators gently dubbed their collection the “Museum of Happiness in a Suitcase”.  The happy collection has been exhibited many times in various cities of Russia.  Since 2013, the exposition has gained permanent residence; today it is housed in a historic building recognized as an architectural monument of the early twentieth century in Novosibirsk.

    <p>  To date, the museum's collection consists of more than 500 exhibits.  What is curious - the exposition is constantly updated.  Everyone can bring something of their own to the Museum of Happiness in Novosibirsk.  Owners of the collection rarely refuse gifts, provided that they are positive and bear joy.  One of the most interesting exhibits is a stylized flag / map of the world, drawn by American artist Carroll Hiltner.  Instead of the usual contours of the continents, this painting depicts the happy faces of children.  In 2012-2013, the flag traveled around the world, during which representatives of 40 countries of the world signed autographs, including politicians and well-known public figures. </p><p>  The Museum of Happiness in Novosibirsk boasts a large collection of figurines and images of guardian angels.  There was a place in the collection for 300 <span>lucky</span> public transport <span>tickets</span> .  During the tour, museum guests can see the charms and symbols of happiness of various peoples of the world.  These are magical signs and items such as horseshoes and <span>folk dolls.</span>  Many exhibits are handcrafted and unique in their kind.  Museum owners also collect a collection of aphorisms, folk sayings and jokes about happiness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Happiness is for everyone!
