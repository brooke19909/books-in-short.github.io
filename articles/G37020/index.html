    <h2>  Different types of cards </h2><p>  Before contacting a credit institution for the opening of plastic, you should decide in advance what type it will be.  Today there are debit and credit cards.  In the first case, the client simply opens an account with a financial institution, and after receiving funds in it, he can withdraw them at any ATM.  If a person orders a credit card, then in this case he receives a certain amount of financial resources directly from the bank itself, which he can use and gradually repay the debt.  If we talk about platinum plastic, then it happens in both categories.  However, most often, bank customers draw up a debit card of Sberbank Visa Platinum.  She will be very useful in many situations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cost of services </h2><p>  According to reviews, the platinum debit card from Sberbank is not issued to everyone.  However, even if the client became its lucky owner, it is worth considering tariff rates. </p><p>  First of all, you will need to pay 4900 rubles for card service.  This cost includes not only 1 year of service, but also all subsequent use of plastic.  If the card is reissued, there is no need to pay extra. </p><p>  Also, many will be pleased that when withdrawing currency from ruble accounts, no additional expenses are expected.  The only exception are situations when money is transferred by a third party through another territorial bank. </p>

    <p>  If you receive money through the cash desk of Sberbank itself (provided that the daily limit has not been exceeded), then the commission will not be calculated.  In situations where a client of a financial institution wants to withdraw a larger amount, a commission of 0.5% of the amount that exceeded the limit is withheld.  If funds must be withdrawn through another financial institution, then the conditions will be the same. </p><p>  Also, in reviews of the VISA Platinum debit card of Sberbank, many draw attention to the fact that when using a bank machine of another financial institution, you need to be prepared for 1% of the total amount of money being deducted.  When using cards on trading floors, no commission is provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Limits </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Visa Platinum card from Sberbank is issued with certain restrictions.  In this case, you can withdraw no more than 500 thousand rubles per day and not more than 5 million per month.  There are no limits on the payment of certain goods or services. </p><p>  If a citizen of the Russian Federation wants to withdraw cash without using a card at the cash desk of another bank, then in this case there is a limit of 50 thousand rubles.  Among the paid services, it is worth highlighting the receipt of statements for the last 10 operations performed on accounts.  In this case, it will be enough to pay 15 p. </p>

    <p>  The same cost awaits those who want to receive data on the current spending limit.  However, in this case, you will have to pay this commission only in the situation if an ATM of another bank was used.  Subject to an unacceptable overdraft, the commission is 40% per annum. </p><h2>  Sberbank Platinum Premier Card: reviews on payment methods </h2><p>  Many note that in order to transfer funds to your balance, you can use one of five methods.  For wire transfers, mobile applications or special online services from the bank are used.  They can be used by all debit card holders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, you can deposit funds using ATMs and payment terminals.  Also, replenishment of the balance can be performed at a third-party bank in which there is a similar service of transferring money from one account to another.  In this case, the transfer shall indicate the person‚Äôs personal data, his card number and account.  As a rule, after this the money arrives at the specified details within 3 days. </p><p>  In addition, you can use the special services of <span>Master Card</span> Money Send.

    <p>  Of course, money can be deposited directly to the account at the box office of Sberbank itself.  To do this, it is enough to visit the nearest branch of a financial organization and present a passport (in case the money transfer is more than 15 thousand rubles). </p><p>  It is also worth considering the pros and cons of the Sberbank platinum card.  Many users do not pay attention to them. </p><h2>  Platinum Card Benefits </h2><p>  If we talk about the advantages of this proposal, then it is worth paying attention to several important nuances.  First of all, all cards are equipped with a built-in microchip, which allows you to protect your account from possible hacking.  When cashing money outside the border, no additional fees will have to be paid.  You can use any additional cards. </p><p>  <span>Visa and Master Card</span> payment systems also offer special privileges to cardholders.  In addition, it is worth highlighting the numerous options for replenishing the card.  Among other things, Sberbank provides a variety of bonus programs for holders of such accounts. </p><h2>  Additional privileges </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Platinum card from Sberbank has great advantages than other plastic. </p>

    <p>  For example, in this case, the transfer request is considered much faster.  This means that in situations where you need to wait up to 3 days with simple cards, a few hours are enough for holders of platinum cards.  At the same time, owners can use absolutely any currency that is approved by Sberbank. </p><p>  Among the additional privileges, one can distinguish the presence of a personal manager, who can be contacted at any time of the day or night by contacting the call center.  Due to this, it is not necessary to visit a bank branch on the issue that has arisen.  If such a visit cannot be avoided, then the card holder is usually served in a separate VIP zone. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to one very interesting privilege, which concerns the payment for goods using cards.  If platinum plastic is used in this case, then the warranty period for any purchase is increased by 2 years.  However, there is a small reservation - the cost of goods should be more than 3000 rubles. </p><p>  Also, customers who have purchased such a card may receive free legal or medical assistance provided by International SOS.  Moreover, these privileges can also be used by family members of the account holder. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  If we talk about the cons, then many customers expressed some dissatisfaction, which is due to the fact that the maintenance of this plastic is too expensive.  Also, account holders drew attention to the fact that when using such an expensive card there is no way to contactlessly pay for purchases.  Private business owners noted that due to the established limits, it is quite difficult to withdraw large amounts of money. </p>

    <h2>  Card "Platinum" from Sberbank: reviews </h2><p>  If we talk about the opinions of users, then on the Web there are more frequent words of praise for this product.  However, it all depends on the specific purposes for which a person acquires this card.  Of course, if you just need to transfer salaries or use plastic for small purchases, then there is no point in overpaying extra money for maintenance. </p><p>  On the other hand, the presence of such plastic greatly enhances the status of a person in the eyes of his environment.  Even considering that the cost of service is quite high, many people noticed that the service and individual approach to the client in this case are much better.  In addition, 4900 rubles must be paid only once.  Given that some debit cards require an annual renewal, this amount is not so great.  And also many spoke out that it makes sense to purchase such plastic exclusively from Sberbank, since the ATMs of this financial organization are located at almost every step. </p><h2>  Who benefits from purchasing </h2><p>  If we talk about customer reviews, it is worth paying attention that many distinguish 2 categories of people for whom this card will be simply irreplaceable.  First of all, these are businessmen who must increase their status and look worthy in the eyes of their partners. </p><p>  Also, this card is beneficial for business trips abroad, since in this case you do not have to think about taking cash with you in the currency of another country.  The same goes for travelers who spend a lot of time abroad.  If in this case you use a regular card, each time you withdraw cash from an ATM you will have to pay a rather impressive conversion fee.  Therefore, in this case, it is much more profitable to purchase a platinum card and pay for its service. </p><h2>  Terms of receipt </h2><p>  As a rule, no concessions are provided for in this plan at Sberbank.  Upon receipt of a Visa Platinum card, the conditions will be standard. </p>

    <p>  This means that there is an age limit that ranges from 21 years to 65 years.  In this case, a person must confirm the fact that he has been working for at least 6 months.  It is also necessary to prepare a document from the Pension Fund in the form of 2-NDFL, in which the solvency of the applicant will be displayed.  In addition, platinum cards are issued exclusively to citizens of the Russian Federation registered and registered in this country. </p><p>  However, not everyone can get this plastic.  A person who decided to apply for him should have at least 5 million rubles.  on accounts with Sberbank.  Over the past six months, at least half a million rubles should be transferred to them from debit salary cards, and operations for 75 thousand rubles should be carried out on international accounts over the past month.  and more. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Sberbank Visa Platinum Premier card is really very profitable.  However, before opening it, you need to think several times for what purposes it is suitable.  For travel, business trips and safety of funds, it is the best option.  It is especially worth paying attention to the absence of commissions for most operations, for which, as a rule, on the contrary, one has to pay quite impressive amounts of money. </p>
