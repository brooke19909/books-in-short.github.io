    <h2>  Who is Peter Gronsky </h2><p>  It is believed that the rocks were named after a revolutionary worker who, together with his comrades, hid weapons there, trained revolutionaries in shooting and prepared for the struggle for a brighter future.  Studies conducted in recent years have failed to confirm this information.  The only thing that was found out was that such a person really lived at the beginning of the 20th century at Iset station, but he did not prove himself during the revolutionary events of 1917, since he was still a teenager. </p><h2>  Petrogrom </h2><p>  This second name of the rocks was proposed by archaeologist E.M. Bers.  It is associated with the fact that they attract lightning like a magnet.  At the same time, locals claim that it is from this rocky group that thunderstorms usually come to Iset. </p>

    <h2>  Origin </h2><p>  The rocks of Peter Gronsky, from a geological point of view, belong to the Verkh-Isetsky massif, covering a significant territory.  Although the peaks of most of the surrounding mountains are crowned with stone "sculptures" of bizarre shapes, the most magnificent of all the stone remains is Petrogrom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to geologists, the stones making rocks are about 300 million years old.  During this period, they underwent severe destruction, leading to the formation of horizontal and vertical cracks.  These faults appeared during the cooling of magma, and the destructive effect of erosion expanded and deepened them.  As a result, vertical columns formed of rounded plates formed between which there are many deep niches and intricate through slots. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The rocks of Peter Gronsky stretch from east to west.  Their greatest height reaches 15 m. At first glance, they resemble the ruins of a huge fortress wall with towers, which was destroyed due to an attack by the enemy. </p><p>  The rocks of Peter Gronsky, photos of which adorn many albums dedicated to the natural wonders of the Urals, along with the mountain 23 meters higher than the famous Devil's Hillfort. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The rocks of Peter Gronsky (how to get there by car - see below) are recognized as a valuable archaeological site.  During the excavations there were found ceramic and metal objects of two cultures: Itkul (5-3 century BC) and the so-called Petrogrom (second half of the 1st millennium AD).  A variety of ceramic material testifies to the continuity in the production of various household items and tools on the mountain of Peter Gronsky from the 5th century BC.  e.  up to 12-13 centuries  n  e.  and about the "family" ties of local residents with the tribes of the forest and forest-steppe zone of the Trans-Urals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Iron and Steel Works" </h2><p>  According to archaeologists, ancient people smelted copper near the cliffs.  Some researchers even believe that on Mount Petrogrom there was something like a <span>mining and metallurgical complex.</span>  Most likely, the ore was imported.  A special composition was prepared from it, which included charcoal and animal bones.  Then it was laid out in a smelting furnace, and then it was poured into special molds to obtain the desired products.  From the copper produced, spearheads and arrowheads were made, as well as various ornaments, etc. Archaeologists believe that already in those days, the local population had established active trade relations with neighboring peoples, and metal products smelted on the Petrogrom mountains spread far beyond the limits of the Ural region.  In addition, some finds made in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rocks suggest that the metallurgists of antiquity had sufficient knowledge to separate non-ferrous metals (for example, silver from copper) from each other during smelting. </p><p>  EM Bers discovered 18 metallurgical horns in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Peter Gronsky rock (how to get, it will be described later).  These ancient stoves were arranged in crevices of rocks, which contributed to the flow of oxygen.  At the same time, manual air was used.  Metallurgical furnaces were built of stone slabs that reached a height of 1.5 m, and one of their walls was made of collapsible smaller blocks, so that it was easy to remove the finished metal ingots. </p>
