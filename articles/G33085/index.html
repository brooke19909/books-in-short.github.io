The mystery of the death of the ferry "Estonia"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There were many sea disasters.  Apparently, mankind will have to experience other <span>wrecks of ships,</span> planes, trains, and various other equipment, which is becoming faster and more difficult.  But every time a terrible event occurs, accompanied by numerous casualties, it is involuntarily compared with disasters that have already happened.  The wreck of the Estonia ferry caused an association with the death of the Titanic.  Indeed, these two catastrophes have something in common.  In both cases, the ships were large and luxurious, many people drowned, and no one could foresee this.  But all this is only at first glance.  Circumstances revealed by investigations by independent experts turned out to be scandalous and eloquently indicated that this crash could have been avoided.  However, there are several versions of events. </p>

    <h2>  What was the steam </h2><p>  The ferry “Estonia” was a luxury ship, offering its passengers not just a utilitarian transfer from one port to another, but a journey full of pleasure.  To do this, on board there was everything necessary and many excesses designed to create an unforgettable experience.  Several cafes and restaurants, a club with a disco, a swimming pool, an entertainment room for children, a sauna, a modern cinema provided a pleasant pastime throughout the flight.  The photo of the Estonia ferry was printed on postcards sold in souvenir shops here, along with other goods needed on the way and bought simply as a keepsake.  But the main purpose of the craft should be remembered.  An unprecedented opportunity for very recently former Soviet citizens to get abroad with their own car was felt as a luxury of joining European life.  460 places for cars were enough for everyone who had money to pay for any of them.  The ferry “Estonia” looked luxurious, it was large (length over 155 meters, width - 24 m, displacement 15.5 thousand tons).  It was built in Germany, in 1980, at the Meyer shipyard for the Norwegian shipping company, although Viking Line was immediately resold.  Then the ferry was called "Sylvia Star", but the letters on board, denoting the company, the shipowner, had to repeatedly paint over and write new ones.  In 1991, the ship was acquired by Vasa Line, and it was renamed Vasa King.  Then there was a merger of companies, and it received a new one, this time the last name - the ferry “Estonia”.  His death in the cold waters of the Baltic Sea shocked in 1994 the whole world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Dry facts </h2><p>  The ferry left Tallinn according to the schedule, at a quarter to eight in the evening of September 27.  The weather was good, but its deterioration was predicted.  Passengers had fun, but by one in the morning, most of them had already <span>gone to bed.</span>  When the Estonian ferry crossed the Turku traverse line, people who had not yet had time to sleep felt a jolt, quite strong, and heard a rattle.  The ship began to roll, by half past one in the morning the slope of the decks reached 30 degrees and continued to grow.  The panic began, but efforts to save the majority of passengers were in vain, it was already impossible to exit the corridors.  Water arrived, and only the inhabitants of the upper deck had a chance of life.  The distress signal was broadcast, but the steam almost at the same moment disappeared from the radar screens - it was ten minutes to two.  The ferry Estonia sank at a depth of approximately 80 meters at a point with coordinates 59 ° 22 ′ north latitude and 21 ° 40 ′ east longitude.  In the morning, mournful news spread around the planet. </p>

    <h2>  The rescue </h2><p>  The first ferry to arrive at the crash site was Marella, whose crew set about rescuing those in distress.  Only hundreds of two people who managed to leave the ship and retire from it had chances.  In total, there were 989 crew members and passengers on board.  A storm broke out, a strong wind blew, fog made the situation difficult.  Lifeboats and rafts turned out to be useless, they were found empty, most people were in the water dressed who in what.  They were cold and dying.  At about three o’clock in the morning, helicopters entered the business, but they were also powerless, the cables in the wind could not withstand the load.  Even those who managed to raise, were dying of the cold.  The heroic efforts of the sailors led to the rescue of 137 people from all who were taken on board the ferry "Estonia" in Tallinn.  95 crew members and passengers were killed, 757 were considered missing for some time, but by seven in the morning it became clear that they could be included in the mournful list. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Official version </h2><p>  No one dared to explain the quick death of a modern ship in a rather safe area of ​​the sea.  It soon became clear, however, that the ferry "Estonia" sank because it hit the visors with shock waves (these are the elements of the ramp, when opening which the cars are able to enter the loading deck).  The German shipyard “Meyer” was hastily declared guilty, to which the representatives of the shipbuilding enterprise objected that the operating life at the time of the disaster exceeded 14 years.  In addition, the watercraft was not designed for ocean or sea waves at all and was supposed to make coastal coastal flights only, for example, to cross bays.  In any case, the cause of the disaster was named.  But she did not explain all the circumstances.  There were additional versions. </p><h2>  Drugs </h2><p>  The hinges were torn off, the wings flew off, they were later found at a considerable (about a mile) distance from the place of occurrence at the bottom of the hull.  But a study of the raised structural elements showed that the mounts were powerful and could theoretically withstand heavy loads when closed.  Then there was a version that the breakdown of the hinges occurred due to the opening of the wings at full speed.  Immediately with someone’s light hand, a suggestion was made about throwing a batch of drugs overboard.  It seems that someone was able to warn smugglers about the ambush awaiting them, and they urgently got rid of the <span>dangerous cargo.</span>  The version, to put it mildly, was <span>far-fetched.</span>  Even if the ferry “Estonia” transported illegal drugs, they could not occupy a large volume, they could be thrown overboard without suicidal risk. </p>

    <h2>  Explosion? </h2><p>  Well, if the shutters were closed, then we can still assume that their fastenings were subjected to additional loads, for example, explosive ones.  To verify this assumption, in 2000, lifting from the bottom of the fallen off parts was carried out, which were examined.  These measures did not give a clear answer, but they did not refute the assumptions.  Who needed this diversion and why?  On this occasion, two mutually exclusive hypotheses arose immediately. </p><h2>  Dual spy version </h2><p>  After the <span>collapse of the USSR,</span> control over the amount of weapons stored on its territory, including the latest, was partially lost.  At least, some modern analysts think so.  Having become independent countries, the former Soviet republics became owners of impressive arsenals, which included the latest models, including those related to special and nuclear ones.  This is where the ground for speculation about who was interested in the destruction of the secret cargo appeared.  The first option - the ferry "Estonia" was sunk by CIA officers, fearing the exposure of their espionage actions, and drowned evidence at the bottom.  The second hypothesis is completely opposite, but the meaning is the same.  Russian intelligence agents, the heirs of KG, thwarted an attempt to export Soviet secret weapons. </p>

    <h2>  What mystery is more mysterious </h2><p>  There are a number of circumstances that have become public and still have not found an explanation.  Divers and rescuers did not find the computer, whose hard drive recorded the parameters of the vessel in fact in the “black box” mode, although they searched diligently.  Two heavy vehicles on board, according to witnesses, did not go through customs inspection.  The mystery of the death of the Estonia ferry becomes even more vague, given that Captain Pikht, who was missing according to the official version, was seen in one of the medical vehicles that took the rescued, and he was even filmed.  After that, no one else saw him.  In the same way, several other passengers disappeared after they were removed from the cold waters.  However, all this can be explained by the extreme confusion, always reigning after a great disaster. </p>

    <p>  But why it was decided to brick the hull with concrete, it is difficult to understand.  The depth at which it sank is not so great as to exclude the possibility of lifting, if not the ship itself, then at least the bodies of the victims of the wreck.  Nevertheless, a decision was made to permanently hide “Estonia” steam from concrete eyes under a layer of concrete.  The dead remained in their steel grave forever.  How can one not believe in the "nuclear" version? </p><h2>  Most likely clue </h2><p>  Just a half day before the fateful flight, the ferry “Estonia” underwent a technical inspection.  The impartial look of specialists on his condition revealed a number of malfunctions, about which the management of the ship company was notified.  Despite this, the ship went to sea.  Among the malfunctions, the engineers pointed to violations of the design of the locking devices of the ramp.  Apparently, Estonian businessmen, not having sufficient financial resources to repair equipment, decided to postpone the repair, but for now earn more.  This is very reminiscent of the hope of chance, attributed for some reason only to the Russians.  In this, one can discern the reason for concealing many facts, which also led to the appearance of unlikely versions.  The interests of the state and its prestige may have turned out to be higher than the truth.  The sea of ​​negligence does not forgive. </p>
