    <h2>  Work networks </h2><p>  To begin with, one important fact remains to be understood - mobile device owners can work with different types of Internet.  Depending on it, the algorithm of actions when setting up access to the network will change.  Despite this, all the proposed connection options are quite easy to learn. </p><p>  I wonder how to set up the Internet on the "iPhone 5S"?  Then you have to decide which particular network to use.  Today, iPhone can work with the following types of Internet access: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Wi-Fi: </li><li>  LTE </li><li>  2G; </li><li>  3G </li><li>  4G. </li></ul><p>  Increasingly, users are trying to use Wi-Fi and 4G-network.  In fact, the difference between configuring these connections is not critical.  What should every owner of an "apple" phone know before using the Internet and setting it up? </p><h2>  Mobile Internet </h2><p>  Let's start with the most common option - connecting a <span>mobile network.</span>  How to set up the Internet on the iPhone 5S?  Tele2 or any other mobile operator - it doesn‚Äôt matter which company it is.  The main thing is that the smartphone owner will have to configure the device for normal operation with mobile Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set up internet on a chinese iphone 5s" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1688295.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What is required for this?  Necessary: </p><ol><li>  Insert SIM card into iPhone.  After this, it is advisable to select the most profitable tariff plan for working with the Internet and connect it. </li><li>  Go to the "Settings" section on the phone. </li><li>  Open the "Cellular" menu. </li><li>  Set the switch opposite the inscription "Cellular data" to the "On" mode.  In this case, the green indicator lights up nearby. </li><li>  Click on "Cellular Data Network". </li><li>  How to set up the Internet on the iPhone 5S?  Beeline, Megafon, MTS or Tele2 - it doesn‚Äôt matter.  In the window that opens, you will have to type data to access the Internet.  This is a username, password for login and APN. </li><li>  Click on the "Save" button. </li><li>  Set the pointer next to "Enable LTE" in active mode. </li></ol><p>  Nothing more is needed.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to set up the Internet on the iPhone 5S.  Problems can arise only with the search for network access data. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to set up the Internet on iPhone 5s Tele2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1688293.jpg"></div>

In general, the information that you need to enter in the menu "Cellular Data Network" is recommended to check with your mobile operator.  Only in this way will you be able to 100% connect to the mobile network. </p><p>  You can use the generally accepted rules for each telecom operator.  How to set up the Internet on the iPhone 5S?  MTS offers the following login details: </p><ol><li>  APN is a special combination that indicates which network is connecting.  In our case, it is necessary to write internet.mts.ru in this field. </li><li>  Username - The name of the company in Latin.  More precisely, mts is written in this line. </li><li>  Password - it is similar to the username. </li></ol><p>  Accordingly, after entering the proposed data and saving it, you can go online with the MTS SIM card.  What other options are possible? </p><h2>  For Beeline </h2><p>  How to set up the Internet on the iPhone 5S?  Beeline offers to act in exactly the same way as MTS.  The only difference is that the data used will be fundamentally different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set up internet on an iPhone 5s beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1688296.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If the owner of the "apple" phone has a Beeline SIM card inserted, he needs to enter the following data to connect to the World Wide Web: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  APN - almost completely reproduces the previously proposed inscription.  But in this case, it will look like internet.beeline.ru. </li><li>  Password is the name of the operator.  It must be written in Latin.  More precisely, the password for the connection is beeline.  Everything is written in small letters. </li><li>  Username - you need to copy the password. </li></ol><p>  You may notice that in general the algorithm of actions remains the same.  Setting up mobile Internet at Beeline is as simple as setting up MTS. </p><h2>  For Megafon subscribers </h2><p>  But what if the user decided to insert the Megaphone SIM card into the mobile device?  There is no reason to panic.  Using the example of the first two operators, it was possible to verify that setting up a mobile network is an extremely simple task, independent of the service company.  What to do in this case? </p><p>  How to set up the Internet on the iPhone 5S?  Megafon presents the following data for setting up a mobile network: </p><ol><li>  The name is gdata. </li><li>  Password - repeat the network name. </li><li>  APN - in this case, the information looks primitive.  It is enough to write just internet in the corresponding line. </li></ol><p>  Important: to successfully configure the network when working with Megaphone, you can leave the Password and Name fields blank.  This scenario is perceived without errors and failures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set up mobile internet on iphone 5s" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1688294.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Work with 4G </h2><p>  Now you can talk a bit about how to work properly with a 4G network.  This connection for users raises a lot of questions.  Therefore, it is necessary to deal with a similar network and its configuration. </p><p>  The first thing that the owner of the "apple" product should remember is that before connecting to 4G you need to buy a SIM card that supports this type of data transfer.  It is recommended to clarify this feature when buying a SIM card. </p><p>  The second nuance is the operating system.  Before thinking about how to set up the Internet on the iPhone 5S by connecting to 4G, you need to have a new version of the operating system (iOS 7.0.4 and newer). </p><p>  Are you done?  Then the following algorithms are offered to the attention of the user: </p><ol><li>  Connect to the mobile Internet using the previously proposed methods. </li><li>  Open "Settings" - "Software Update". </li><li>  Click on "Update". </li><li>  Agree to the update and wait. </li><li>  Enable the LTE option in the "Networks" settings. </li></ol><p>  If everything was done correctly, then LTE will appear in the upper left corner of the screen.  This means that there was a connection to 4G. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set up internet on iphone 5s pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1688290.jpg"></div>

    <p>  You can resort to another option.  He will be interested in those who have a computer at hand.  The user needs: </p><ol><li>  Connect iPhone to PC using wire. </li><li>  Launch iTunes.  In the "General" menu, select "Update Software ...".  Accept the process. </li><li>  Disconnect iPhone 5S from the computer.  Go to "Settings" - "Networks".  Enable the LTE option. </li></ol><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to set up mobile Internet on the iPhone 5S.  There was another very interesting trick. </p><h2>  Work with Wi-Fi </h2><p>  It's about connecting wirelessly.  Wi-Fi on a smartphone as a network access is in great demand.  You can connect to the Internet using this option almost anywhere. </p><p>  How to set up the Internet on the Chinese iPhone 5S using Wi-Fi?  Required: </p><ol><li>  Turn on iPhone.  Go to the "Settings" section. </li><li>  Select Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Set the switch indicating Wi-Fi is on. </li><li>  Wait.  A list of available connections appears.  Select the desired line. </li><li>  If necessary, enter the login information.  More specifically, you will need a password from the wireless network. </li></ol><p>  You can close the settings.  If everything was done correctly, the user will be able to enter the Internet without much difficulty.  It is suggested to check the connection using the browser.  Or you can look at the upper left corner - an indicator with the Wi-Fi signal level will be displayed there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to set up internet on iphone 5s megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1688297.jpg"></div>
