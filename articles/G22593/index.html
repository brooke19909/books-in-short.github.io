The historian Klyuchevsky S. O. called this time a shock that shook the foundations of Russian statehood.  There was a great devastation, which foreign historians call the Moscow tragedy.  Its scale is difficult to determine, since most of Russia was in a terrible situation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history troubled times" class="if uuid-2496630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2496630.jpg"></div><h2>  Military intervention </h2><p>  The consequences of the Time of Troubles include the result of the intervention in Russia.  Thousands of people left their homes, leaving for Siberia and the south.  Veliky Novgorod was completely destroyed by the Swedes, who were invited by Vasily Shuisky to defend against False Dmitry II.  The mercenaries were not paid a salary, so they seized the city and the surrounding land.  The population, fleeing robberies and violence, fled from the captured city, leaving villages empty, villages and uncultivated land. </p><p>  In 1617, the Pillar Peace was concluded with the Swedes in the village of Stolbovo, according to which the Novgorod region was indulged in Russia.  Sweden left the entire Baltic coast, plus she owed monetary compensation. </p><p>  After a nine-year war, Russia concluded the <span>Deulinsk truce</span> with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1618. It was an unprofitable treaty for Russia, according to which nine Russian cities (including Smolensk) with lands and the population went to Poland.  Polish <span>prince Vladislav</span> becomes a contender for the throne.  Despite this significance, the truce is great, since the signing of the treaty is considered the end of the Time of Troubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The consequences of the Time of Troubles include the loss of Russian territories.  If the lands captured by the Poles returned to Russia in the near future, Peter I had to cut through the ‚Äúwindow to Europe‚Äù, that is, to win the Swedish access to the Baltic Sea for the whole 20 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": http://derzava.com/yurij-bulychev-smuta-1598-1613-"><img itemprop="image" alt="the consequences of troubled times include 3" class="if uuid-2496406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2496406.jpg"></div><h2>  Cossacks </h2><p>  The Cossacks, who, according to historian Solovyov S., were people who lived in turmoil and did not want its end, still posed a great danger.  The huge mobile mass of freedom-loving warriors, who was robbery, was ready to support any government, any monarch, no matter who it would be ‚Äî the Swedes, Poles, or Russians. </p><p>  The problem of the Cossacks was acute.  Units that did not recognize the new king moved around the country.  They represented a real danger.  The problem was that it was an independent armed population, fed by the state.  I. Zarutsky, who fled from Moscow, was with one of the detachments, along with him was Marina Mnishek and her son, known as Vorenok.  After the election of Mikhail Romanov to the throne, I. Zarutsky was executed with Vorenko, and Mnishek was tonsured a nun. </p><p>  But the Cossacks are nothing compared to a people tired of hunger, turmoil, rumors and natural disasters.  People were ready to serve any monarchs, even impostors, who would promise them a good life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="results and consequences of troubled times" class="if uuid-2495511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2495511.jpg"></div><h2>  Economic and financial situation </h2><p>  The economic consequences of the Time of Troubles were overcome only by the end of the XVII century.  A severe economic shock, disaster, it can be said, led to a rollback in the development of cities and villages many years ago.  Life in villages and cities froze for many years, which led to the impoverishment of the country - the treasury was empty. </p><p>  The country's financial situation at the end of the Time of Troubles was critical.  The maximum possible funds were withdrawn from the tax-paying people, often taxes were paid in kind.  What they generally paid was a miracle.  The government saw a solution in restoring agriculture, increasing the number of people in the fields, in securing the peasants for the landlords, and in extending the term for the search for fugitive workers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--e1adcaacuhnujm.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="economic consequences of troubled times" class="if uuid-2495523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2495523.jpg"></div><h2>  Restoration of power </h2><p>  The beginning of the end of the Time of Troubles, historians called the election of Mikhail Romanov to the throne in 1613 at the Zemsky Cathedral.  The children of foreign monarchs, the protege of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the royal prince Vladislav, from Sweden Karl-Philipp, the son of the king, were represented as candidates.  The son of Maria Mnishek and False Dmitry, who was nicknamed Vorenok.  From Russia, children of some large boyar clans were nominated.  Having discussed all the candidates, the cathedral chose Mikhail Romanov, who was related to the first wife of Ivan the Terrible. </p><p>  The newly elected king was <span>16 years old,</span> so his <span>patriarch Filaret</span> became his mentor <span>.</span>  The new king faced the daunting task of rebuilding the country.  In Russian history, the end of the Time of Troubles was the beginning of the reign of the Romanov dynasty. </p><p>  The consequences of the Time of Troubles include the never-before-seen surge in the activity of representative bodies.  Zemsky cathedrals regularly met, their composition expanded.  The elections were real, the participants actively expressed their proposals and dissatisfaction.  Urban and regional representative bodies from different classes were created. </p><p>  Once the boyars played an important role in the history of Russia, but gradually the position of the boyars in the life of Russia began to lose its significance.  Their power was broken back in the time of the oprichnina.  The consequences of the Time of Troubles include the gradual rise of the nobility, which has increasingly played an important role in the life of the state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flashcardcloud.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="economic consequences of troubled times" class="if uuid-2495539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2495539.jpg"></div><h2>  Foreign policy implications </h2><p>  Foreign relations with many European countries have virtually ceased.  The country was at war with Sweden and the Commonwealth.  Trade ceased: foreign merchants were afraid to go to Russia, since the Cossacks who lived by robbery and robber gangs hunted on the roads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the consequences of troubled times include" class="if uuid-2495394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2495394.jpg"></div><h2>  Results of the Time of Troubles </h2><p>  The outcome and consequences of the Time of Troubles was the choice of the path of development of the Russian state: </p><ul><li>  The political system is a monarchy, representing a form of political government.  At the first stages, it was limited to representative bodies: the Boyar Duma and the Zemsky Cathedral.  Later, during the reign of Peter I, the monarchy will take an absolute form - autocracy. </li><li>  The basis of the country's economic development is serfdom, which was the only possible way for the financial revival of the country at that time. </li><li>  The ideological policy of the state is Orthodoxy. </li></ul><p>  The new king was faced with the hard work of rebuilding the country.  Most importantly, the Russian state was preserved. </p>
