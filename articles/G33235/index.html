    <p>  Many people, completely desperate, begin to look for any ways to earn money.  Such personalities are deceived by scammers who tell in bright colors about quick earnings and that a million a year is nothing, and even a month everyone can earn such an amount.  But promising mountains of gold is easy, but you need to understand where reality is and where there are fairy tales.  But people "bite" on the bait, buy discs with courses and video lessons, only wasting, not earning.  You just need to think about it - after all, if everything was so simple and universal, then every third would already be rich.  No, millionaires are people with a completely unique mindset who have a special character, abilities and entrepreneurial spirit.  And even if one person acts on the advice of a wealthy businessman, then he may not succeed, because everything depends on the person. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Financial tricks </h2>

    <p>  But there is no need to be upset, because there are answers to the question of how to become a millionaire from scratch, albeit ambiguous.  For example, one of the most popular ways to earn money is to create passive income and then arrange a loan for it.  What does it mean?  So, you need to create a small passive income (20 thousand rubles or more), register as an individual entrepreneur, which is not so difficult, and apply for a loan at the bank.  Under this amount, a million will be given in the bank, and with installments for several years.  To create passive income, you can rent out real estate - this is the easiest method.  You can do network marketing by becoming a distributor.  Good specialists earn on this a few hundred thousand dollars in just one month!  A few months later, the question of how to earn the first million will no longer be of interest to the person receiving such money. </p><h2>  Assets </h2><p>  This method is suitable for enterprising people.  If a person has his own asset (a website that makes a profit, or an account with a network marketing company), then you can sell it.  It will be very <span>fast money.</span>  In fact, anything can be an asset.  How to calculate the amount that can be obtained for the sale?  It is calculated according to this scheme: monthly passive income is multiplied by 24 (this is the number of months for which the asset will pay off).  As an example, it looks like this: if a person receives 50 thousand rubles a month from his business, then the amount for which you can sell it is 1 200 000 rubles.  It turns out even more than a million. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The deal is a step towards a million </h2>

    <p>  We can not touch on this topic, discussing how to become a millionaire from scratch.  After all, you can earn a large amount both overnight and in several parts.  Sometimes this requires appropriate circumstances.  The method under consideration will be ideal for those people who understand the intricacies regarding the functioning of the business, are sociable and are able to win over to themselves.  You can conclude a deal for a large amount (preferably several million), from which the person who influenced its fulfillment will receive a percentage.  With some agreements, profits may even exceed one million.  To do this, you need to find a large investor who could invest in some project, find a buyer for real estate or a business. </p><h2>  By accumulation </h2>

    <p>  But what if the above methods are not a suitable option?  How to make a million in a year in this case?  The main thing is not to despair.  There are several methods that can help you achieve your desired goal.  Financial experts recommend always putting aside a small part for any income.  So it will turn out to gradually develop capital intended for investment.  It is also advisable to increase this amount every time.  By the way, such savings will also become the so-called <span>pillow of financial security.</span>  This is necessary because no one is safe from the risk of losing a job or suddenly losing something of value.  By the way, this is why financial experts recommend having several sources of income - this will also be financial insurance.  And yet it will turn out to earn more money.  It is not necessary to get two jobs.  You can rent a room in your apartment, for example, if there is such an opportunity.  It is also recommended to keep a report - to record how much money was spent and for what.  Big purchases should not be made.  In a word - you need to save.  But then the amount that could be accumulated will work for the welfare of its owner.  After all, it can be invested in a bank at interest, in gold, in real estate.  And all this is an excellent <span>source of passive income.</span> </p><h2>  FK-Ramps - a role model </h2>

    <p>  The stories of millionaires who made their fortunes from scratch are always inspiring, and the creators of FK-Ramps are a clear example of this.  They are young entrepreneurs Fedor Tikhomirov and Alexander Koksharov.  They started their activities at the age of 16 - then they built their own zone, designed to improve the skills of skateboarders and skaters.  Then the guys did not think about how to make money on it.  They just loved extreme sports, like many other young men, but there were no necessary venues in St. Petersburg.  And the guys ‚Äôsite quickly became popular and attracted the attention of skaters and skateboarders.  A huge number of applications for the manufacture of such training bases began to be addressed to the young men, and here is the result - today the company, organized by two young people, carries out thousands of orders throughout Russia.  And most importantly - the youths consider the millions that fell upon them only as a pleasant addition to their favorite pastime. </p><h2>  Fashion is where you can make money </h2><p>  The stories of <span>young millionaires are</span> diverse and unique, but they are all similar to each other in one small but very important nuance - they created something new, unique and necessary.  So, for example, Simon Kibalo, who is now only 24 years old, got the idea to start producing clothes with university symbols.  It turned out that a large number of students are proud of their alma mater and are ready to purchase a sweatshirt or T-shirt with its name to emphasize their identity.  Semyon says that he didn‚Äôt invest anything in his business.  And he completed the first order, showing the customer a sketch printed on paper.  And now two years have passed.  Kibalo has 24 representative offices in different regions and a huge number of universities, sports and public organizations in its partner base. </p>
