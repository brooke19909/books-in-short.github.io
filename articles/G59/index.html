Sometimes rescue vehicles standing on the street.  And a little earlier, we had to contact the girl who was heard on the other end of the wire, when we picked up the phone.  Her main business was to connect with the desired subscriber.  Not very practical, agree.  But in the XXI century, we have absolutely no communication problems.  With the advent of mobile phones, wherever we are, we are always available to people who know our number.  And it seems that if a person does not have a mobile phone, then he is divorced from life and from progress. </p><h2>  Lots of features in a small gadget </h2><p>  Today, such an apparatus does not surprise anyone at all.  After all, the usual mobile devices have been replaced by smartphones - smart phones.  With the help of such a device, you can not only call or write SMS messages.  These gadgets provide tons of amazing features.  You can listen to music, watch videos and even entire movies, go online, visit social networks, use the navigator, alarm clock, calculator, flashlight and many other useful and interesting things.  In the world of modern technology, almost every person has a smartphone.  Most often, device capabilities depend on the model or manufacturer.  But the operating system plays a much bigger role for the user.  <span>Operating systems</span> for smartphones allow us to reveal the full potential of the gadget.  The quality of its use depends on them.  In the article, we will talk about what <span>is the best operating system</span> for a smartphone and we will understand their main versions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Types of Operating Systems </h2><p>  The operating system has another name - ‚Äúfirmware‚Äù.  When they talk about installing the operating system, they use the term ‚Äúreflash‚Äù.  But these words are used more when they talk about versions of operating systems, and not their types. </p><p>  There are three of the most popular, well-known and used operating systems for smartphones, namely: Android, IOS and Windows.  There are others, but they are quite rare and mainly on Chinese models of dubious origin.  An experienced user, even at the first glance at the operating system, can determine the quality of the product. </p><p>  The operating systems that we named now and then compete with each other.  Owners of smartphones note that the developers copy the elements of the OS from each other. </p><p>  In addition to the three main competitors in the market for developing operating systems, there are also those that are created for a particular company or gadget model.  For example, Blackberry OS for Blackberry phones or <span>Symbian OS</span> for Nokia. </p><p>  Now let's talk more about the three giants.  So, the main operating systems for smartphones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  OS Windows Phone </h2><p>  This "OS" is simply recommended for people who strive to try something new.  We must say right away that there are far fewer smartphones based on this platform than on Android or Ayios, but it can also please its owner.  For example, in comparison with the same ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù, the system works much faster and more productively, but if you compare it with IOS, then the products are much cheaper.  Yes, and the familiar interface of the last two systems is already a little fed up with users. </p><h2>  The advantages of Windows </h2><p>  The second advantage of WP is in-store applications.  The fact is that Android has under its auspices the Google Play application store, IOS - the App Store, but the brainchild of Windows is the Windows Phone Store.  The number of applications in the latter is relatively small, but because of this, it is much easier to understand them.  Owners of smartphones running Android have access to thousands of paid and free applications, and sometimes when you need to find important software, they just drown in the abyss of the proposed applications.  But with Windows Phone is much easier.  Yes, and much more high-quality free applications, but their counterparts in the stores of competitors are quite expensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Moreover, almost all software is working and devoid of system errors.  In this case, we see a vivid example of when quantity does not mean quality at all.  There are a lot of ‚Äúnative‚Äù applications in this operating system, and therefore sometimes you do not need to download any add-ons at all.  Windows is a closed, self-contained and self-sufficient platform that will appeal to many users.  They will like the speed of the device based on this OS. </p><p>  All business in intellectual work with random access memory.  The system is programmed to download unused applications and the active work of those that you use often.  Therefore, everything loads very quickly and almost does not slow down.  Another advantage of this OS is the tiled interface.  The interface of the two other operating systems has a similar structure, but the tile has a radically different approach to the rational use of the screen. </p><p>  So, Windows 8, designed for computers, is rightly considered a failed operating system, and for the most part this is due to an impractical interface.  Not all users are accustomed to clicking on tiles on the screen, and few, in general, understood such an idea.  But for phones such a system fits perfectly.  But which operating system is better for a smartphone?  Let's figure it out next. </p>

    <h2>  Smartphones with the Android operating system </h2><p>  The most famous OS for gadgets in the world.  This operating system was initially doomed to popularity.  The fact is that all the rights to Android are owned by Google and it is developing it.  Perhaps everyone who has smartphones is familiar with this operating system.  <span>The Android operating system</span> is the undisputed leader in its category.  Other operating systems for smartphones cannot even come close to the performance of Android.  So, according to recent studies, about 75% of smartphones released over the past year have this ‚Äúfirmware‚Äù and even such a popular brand as IOS is satisfied with its 15 percent. </p>

    <h2>  The disadvantages of the "Robot" </h2><p>  Of the shortcomings of the operating system, it can only be noted that it has become boring to everyone for a long time, and even though updates and new versions of the system regularly appear, its interface and the "green men" on the screen are annoying.  Plus, users too often complain about lags and system errors.  It is not at all perfect, although the developers made sure that the updates came out quite often, respectively, errors and errors were fixed in them. </p><p>  This system is also very susceptible to attack by a variety of viruses.  To avoid this, you have to download additional anti-virus programs.  The cause of this problem is most often the applications ordered from unverified sources, and even the brainchild of Google, Google Play, does not always thoroughly check its products.  Now it remains to discuss only the advantages of the system. </p>

    <h2>  Best smartphone operating system </h2><p>  We can safely say that Android has eclipsed almost all mobile operating systems.  A smartphone on this OS perfectly reveals its capabilities.  The first thing to do if you decide to install Android is to create your Google account.  This is not difficult to do: just have Gmail, provide a password and billing information.  Another advantage of your own account is that it is the same for all Google services, and if you want, for example, synchronizing your smartphone with other devices, it will not be difficult at all. </p>

    <p>  Google Play is a great app store where you can find everything you like.  He breaks records in the number of high-quality and free applications than Android and has won the hearts of many users. </p><p>  Versions of operating systems for smartphones based on Android proudly bear the name of sweets, and experienced users know where to find the "Easter eggs" hidden in each of these systems. </p><h2>  IOS </h2><p>  This name is familiar to all owners of Apple products and, despite all the shortcomings, are devoted to this operating system.  The fact is that it is of excellent quality, hence the price of gadgets.  The system is not familiar with such a concept as lags and does not know what to ‚Äúbrake‚Äù.  Yes, exceptions sometimes happen, but they are so rare that no one pays attention to them.  The OS is very fast and understandable, which won the owners of iPhones.  But now about the bad.  If, for example, there are more than enough variations of models and manufacturers of phones for Android, then Agios is strictly limited to apple products, that is, no one has the rights to use this OS for other equipment. </p><h2>  Yablochka users </h2><p>  It is obvious that the system has not gained momentum due to the high cost of Apple products.  This "OS" is not tormented by viruses due to its unique Linux-based program code.  All Apple devices are perfectly synchronized with each other, however, working with other operating systems on iOS is difficult.  It is also very difficult to install the operating system yourself.  You can even ‚Äúreflash‚Äù a smartphone on Android at home, but using Apple is almost impossible. </p><p>  All operating systems for smartphones have their advantages and disadvantages, but the choice is always yours. </p>
