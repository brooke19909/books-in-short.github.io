    <h2>  Million in denominations </h2><p>  So, let's calculate the weight of one million "American presidents" in banknotes of various denominations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The heaviest ‚Äúlemon bucks‚Äù are obtained in $ 1 bills.  He will weigh a whole ton: </p><p>  1 million grams = 1,000 kg = 1 t. </p><p>  In two-dollar pieces of paper, the weight will be half a ton, or 500 kg.  If you weigh "lemon" with banknotes of $ 5 - you get 200 kg, and $ 10 - a centner.  In general, a lot. </p><p>  With twenty-dollar bills, a million people will ‚Äúpull‚Äù half a cent, and ‚Äúfifty dollars‚Äù - 20 kg. </p><p>  And the most interesting thing: how much does a million dollars weigh in 100-dollar bills?  If you weigh such an attractive amount in franklin, you get only 10 kg.  Not so much, especially when you consider that all this wealth fits in a regular medium-sized sports bag. </p><p>  But it turns out you can get a much lighter million.  Not everyone knows that in the period 1928-1945, the US Federal Reserve issued even larger bills.  You can pay with them today. </p><p>  So, if you have banknotes of $ 500, a million "pull" only 2 kg, and thousandths and 1 kg.  With $ 5,000 bills, the ‚Äúlemon bucks‚Äù will weigh only 200 grams, and if you take this amount with pieces of paper for $ 10,000, only 100 grams will come out. </p><p>  However, there is a small reservation.  It will be possible to spend 1,000,000 in such denominations only in the country.  The export of such banknotes from the United States is strictly prohibited. </p><p>  Now get ready to be surprised even more.  In America, there is a banknote of $ 100,000!  And this is absolutely true.  True, there are few such bills.  A total of 42 thousand copies were printed, and they can be paid exclusively within the walls of the Federal Reserve Bank, and only there.  In this case, the notorious "lemon bucks" will consist of only 10 pieces of paper and weigh, respectively, as much as 10 grams. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Million Coins </h2><p>  Well, we sorted out the banknotes.  Now let's determine how much a million dollars weigh in metal coins. </p><p>  The weight of the metal dollar is 8.1 grams.  Accordingly, a million will weigh 8,100 kg or 8.1 tons. </p><p>  Interestingly, the ‚Äúlemons‚Äù in coins of 50, 25 and 10 cents will weigh the same, 22 tons of 680 kg.  Although the weight of each of these coins is different: </p><ul><li>  11.34 g; </li><li>  5.67 g; </li><li>  2.268 grams respectively. </li></ul><p>  In five-cent coins, a million "pull" as much as 100 tons, because each weighs only 5 grams.  And if you weigh such an amount in 1  coins, you get as much as 250 tons, since each of them weighs 2.5 grams. </p><p>  However, the hardest ‚Äúlemon bucks‚Äù will turn out if you weigh it with one-centrifuges of the period 1909-1982.  The fact is that these coins were very heavy and weighed 3.11 g each.  Accordingly, the amount we needed would weigh a record 311 tons. </p>

    <h2>  And if in rubles? </h2><p>  If you prefer to keep your savings in national currency, let's calculate how much a million rubles weigh.  Russian millions, as it turned out, are not too heavy.  If you collect this amount in five thousandths, it will weigh only 204 grams, thousandths - 1 kg and 40 grams.  Five hundred bills will also come out a little - 1.9 kg, and "weaving" - 9.3 kg.  Banknotes of 50 p.  a million will weigh 19.4 kg, and ten-ruble pieces of paper - 94 kilograms. </p><p>  We won‚Äôt count in coins.  It is unlikely that someone will have a piggy bank of this size. </p><p>  Now let's count how much a million dollars weigh in rubles.  Given all of the above, it is easy to calculate that at the current rate, the weight of a million bucks, expressed in rubles in <span>five-thousand-dollar bills,</span> will be a little more than 12 kg. </p><p>  That's all.  Now you can independently calculate how much it weighs 100 million dollars, or even a whole billion.  However, rather than counting the weight of a ghostly million, it‚Äôs probably better to go earn it. </p>
