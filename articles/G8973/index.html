    <p>  Since the <span>beginning of World War II,</span> Nazi Germany has taken a political course towards the mass extermination of civilians, especially of Jewish nationality.  So "death squads" were eliminated about a million people.  Somewhat later, mass killings began, and <span>concentration camps</span> appeared in which people were deprived of medicine and food.  The concentration camps of World War II were built to systematically kill a large number of people.  They built gas chambers, crematoria, laboratories for conducting medical experiments. </p><p>  The first of them were built in 1933, and a year later the SS troops took command over them. </p><p>  So, large concentration camps were created in Germany: Buchenwald, Majdanek, Salaspils, Ravensbr√ºck, Dachau and Auschwitz. </p><p>  1. Buchenwald (men's camp) - was intended to isolate anti-fascists.  Outside the gates of the camp, one could see the area for construction, a punishment cell for interrogations, an office, barracks (52 main ones) for prisoners, as well as a quarantine zone and a crematorium where people were killed.  Here, the prisoners worked at a weapons factory.  Poles, Soviet citizens, Dutch, Czechs, Hungarians and Jews were brought to this place. </p><p>  The concentration camps of the Second World War had a group of laboratory doctors who performed experiments on prisoners.  So, it was in Buchenwald that the development of a vaccine against typhoid was carried out. </p><p>  In 1945, the prisoners of the camp carried out an uprising, captured the Nazis and took control.  We can say that they saved themselves, since an order had already been given to destroy all the prisoners. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Majdanek - was intended for Soviet prisoners of war.  The camp had five sections (one of them was female).  In the disinfection chamber, people were eliminated by gas, after which the corpses were taken to the crematorium, which was located in the third compartment. </p><p>  In this camp, prisoners worked in a factory that produced uniforms and in a factory that produced weapons. </p><p>  In 1944, due to the onset of Soviet troops, <span>the Majdanek concentration camp</span> ceased to exist. </p><p>  3. The concentration camps of World War II included the Salaspils Children's Camp.  Here the children were kept in isolation, they were deprived of care.  Experiments were conducted on them, the fascists organized the so-called children's blood factory. </p><p>  Today, this place is a memorial. </p><p>  4. Ravensbr√ºck - originally intended to contain German women, the so-called criminals, but later they contained people of different nationalities. </p><p>  In the camp, medical experiments were conducted to study sulfonamide drugs.  A little later, bone tissue transplantation began here, the possibility of restoration of muscles, nerves and bones was studied. </p><p>  In 1945, the <span>Soviet Army</span> began the evacuation of the camp. </p><p>  5. The concentration camps of World War II included Dachau.  This camp was intended to contain people who, according to <span>racial theory,</span> polluted the Aryan nation.  Here the prisoners worked at the IG Farbenindustriya enterprise. </p><p>  This camp is considered the most sinister of all known, it set up experiments on people whose purpose was to study the ability to control human behavior, also investigated the effect of malaria on the body. </p><p>  In 1945, an underground camp organization organized an uprising and foiled a plan to eliminate all prisoners. </p><p>  6. Auschwitz (Auschwitz) - was intended to contain political prisoners.  The camp had a heel yard, thirteen blocks, each of which had its purpose, a gas chamber and a crematorium. </p><p>  In 1943, a resistance group formed here that helped the prisoners escape. </p><p>  Thus, the German concentration camps of World War II are striking in their brutality.  Over the entire period of existence, a huge number of people died in them, including children. </p>
