    <p>  Grand Duke George Mikhailovich (grandson of Nicholas I) inherited from his father about 100 hectares of land in the Crimea.  This plot was ideally suited for the construction of the estate, but for a long time was desolate due to the lack of fresh water.  Georgy Mikhailovich was able to solve this problem by acquiring a drinking spring.  After which he hired N.P.  Krasnova - the chief architect of Yalta for the design and construction of the estate.  It is worth noting that the territory was heavily neglected and work on its improvement was initially carried out.  Haraks Palace and the complex of manor buildings were finally completed only in 1908.  In addition to the main residential building, the estate was built: a church, consecrated in the name of St. Nina, a house for servants, farm buildings.  All the buildings of the estate were made in the original unified style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Haraks Palace: photos and description </h2>

    <p>  The main manor house is designed in the style of late Art Nouveau.  The author himself - N.P.  Krasnov - called his creation Scottish.  The walls of the palace are made of limestone using the mosaic technique.  All the facades of the building are made in the same style, but when viewed from each side, the impression of the building changes.  The building is not pompous, but it looks impressive and regal.  It is worth noting that the apartment building is really relatively small.  The building received the status of the palace only thanks to its large windows.  And yet, despite modesty, the estate was considered refined and original, which means it was quite suitable for the life of a member of the royal family.  In total, the three-story building has 46 premises for various purposes.  Haraks Palace has a spacious terrace on the second floor, which could be relaxed in any weather. </p><h2>  The history of the palace and park complex </h2>

After the revolution of 1917, the estate was nationalized, and soon enough a sanatorium opened here, retaining the name of the palace.  The southern estate was significantly damaged during the Great Patriotic War.  After a lengthy restoration, the health resort reopened only in 1955 with the new name Dnipro.  The sanatorium worked until 2014, and after the change of power, it again changed its name and became known as ‚ÄúYuzhny‚Äù.  Today, a restaurant is open in the ancient palace, which anyone can visit. </p><h2>  Manor Park at Haraks Palace </h2>

    <p>  When the architect N.P. Krasnov first saw the area where he was to build the Haraks Palace, he was horrified.  Huge work cost the talented master to turn dry stony soil into a real oasis.  The park has planted more than 200 species of trees and shrubs, including a whole collection of conifers.  One of the pride of the estate - juniper grove, preserved to this day.  When landscaping the park, a large number of small buildings and decorative elements were erected.  A unique building is an antique gazebo, symbolizing the ancient history of these places.  There were other <span>canopies from the sun</span> and rain, as well as fountains, fences, decorative sculptures, benches in the park.  An impressive stone staircase has been preserved to this day, starting from the main entrance to the residential building.  The steps of this structure lead to the sea. </p><h2>  Decryption of the mysterious name </h2><p>  The name of the Charaks manor seems to many inhabitants obscure and strange.  The palace and the park were named after an ancient, supposedly Roman fortress, once located in this area.  The word "Character" in translation from ancient Roman means - "fortress".  It is believed that Georgy Mikhailovich began excavations even before the construction of the palace began.  And the result of archaeological research were valuable findings.  In 1909, a museum was even opened at the estate, where a collected collection of ancient objects was put on public display.  Today at the sanatorium‚Äôs library there is a museum room where you can find out the history of the area.  Archaeological excavations near the Charax Palace are carried out today.  According to experts, the land here may conceal many more interesting artifacts and antiquities. </p><h2>  Where is the palace of Georgy Mikhailovich? </h2>

    <p>  The Haraks Palace in Gaspra today has the following address: Alupkinskoye Shosse, 13. A historical landmark is located on the territory of the Yuzhny sanatorium.  You can get to this place from Yalta by minibus: No. 32, No. 102 and No. 115. Organized excursions to this estate are not carried out, but believe me, this walk will not leave regrets about the lost time.  During the walk, you can enjoy not only the appearance of the legendary palace, but also appreciate the beauty and convenience of the park layout.  You can find out more interesting facts by visiting the mini-museum.  Kharaks Palace (Crimea) is a unique attraction that deserves special attention.  The restored building and the well-groomed park all around make a pleasant, pacifying impression.  You will not find the second such palace on the entire Crimean coast! </p>
