    <h2>  How to make a fabulous costume? </h2><p>  To make a Kolobok costume for a boy with your own hands, you need to remember the tale itself and how the main character looks.  Naturally, a yellow ball pops up in my memory right away, which smiles and merrily rolls along the road, running away from my grandmother, grandfather and forest inhabitants.  And here you can already highlight the features and main details of the costume: it should be yellow, like a real Kolobok, and have a rounded shape. </p><p>  To date, in stores are presented ready-made bulk costumes Kolobok.  They are based on a rounded frame.  Yes, such an outfit is similar to the original picture of a fairy-tale hero.  But the problem is that such a suit is not very convenient and can create discomfort for the child, hamper his movements.  And the price of the purchased product is not too happy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, an excellent way will be a costume made by yourself.  Let it not be so much like the original, but it will be cheaper, and it will be much more convenient for the child in it. </p><p>  If you decide to make <span>a Kolobok costume</span> for a boy with your own hands, you don‚Äôt know how to sew, then the easiest way to implement the idea will be a suit of yellow pants, a hat (beret) and a drape.  But if you want something more original, then you can try to sew a round vest with your own hands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself kolobok suit for a boy how to sew" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1706084.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Do-it-yourself Kolobok costume for a boy: making a vest </h2><p>  To get a beautiful voluminous vest, the first thing you need to do is build a pattern.  First you need to draw a rectangle, where a is the waist, b is the length from the neck to the hips, multiplied by 2. Next, postpone three vertical and one horizontal line in the middle, and then designate the tucks. </p><p>  Then from the synthetic winterizer (lining - stitch) you need to sew a vest.  Using the resulting pattern, two parts are made.  As indicated in the drawing, openings for the hands should be left in the side seams.  In order for the vest to be more voluminous and keep its shape, at the level of the chest, waist and slightly lower than the waist, you can sew a tape from polyethylene.  The synthetic winterizer part will be internal, it should be adjusted according to the figure and then the second same part should be made of yellow fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself kolobok suit for a boy" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1706086.jpg" width="400"></div>

Tucks need to grind and cut out applications in the form of a mouth, nose and eye.  Next, you need to sweep the bottom and top parts from stitches and yellow fabric.  After that, they grind and insert the gum at the top and bottom. </p><p>  Now you know how to sew a Kolobok costume for a boy with your own hands.  The patterns presented in the article will be excellent helpers.  And to make the baby more comfortable, and the outfit had an aesthetic appearance, it is best to wear a yellow turtleneck under the vest. </p><h2>  Beanie </h2><p>  If we talk about headgear, then there are many options.  To create an image, a baseball cap, beret, or even a yellow bandana is suitable. </p><p>  If desired, the cap can be sewn from linen or cotton fabric.  A headdress in the form of a skullcap is perfect.  The hat is decorated with homemade spikelets.  They are knitted from thick yarn or yellow decorative rope.  Also beautiful spikelets will be obtained from strips of fabric woven into a pigtail.  A long braid can be sewn on the bottom of the headgear, and short spikelets are attached in the center and on the sides. </p><p>  There are also options in which you can do without a hat.  Suppose a yellow paper strip with a spikelet on it will be enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a kolobok costume master class sketch" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1706083.jpg" width="375"></div>

It's just a ball of dough that rolls fun along the track.

It can be purchased, but can be made independently.  Moreover, now you know how to make a Kolobok costume.  The master class, the sketch presented in this article will help to make this bright outfit without any problems. </p>
