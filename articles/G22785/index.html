The whole territory of Greece is popular with tourists.  But its islands - especially.  Rhodes, Kos, Crete - each of them has its own characteristics.  Greece never bothers, because when you travel around the islands, you get the impression that you are visiting different countries.  For those who want to relax in Corfu, the issue of finding a hotel is relevant.  The island itself is not that small, but not very large. </p><p>  If you are a fan of a calm and measured rest in the bosom of the most beautiful nature, welcome to the town of Liapades.  Corfu offers many housing options, literally the entire coast is occupied by hotels and apartments.  But finding a decent price-quality ratio is not so simple.  In this article we will consider a hotel in Liapades called Blue Princess Beach Hotel Suites 4 *.  The description of the hotel is based in part on information provided by the administration.  But we paid even more attention to the reviews of travelers who recently visited the hotel.  Previously, it was called Elly Beach.  And reviews about her were often positive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Princess Beach Hotel Suites 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2065235.jpg"></div>

But local residents, according to legend, leading their ancestry from a tribe of the Feaks close to the Olympic gods, did not care much.  They absorbed the most valuable of the cultures of the conquering peoples, while remaining faithful to the traditions of their ancestors.  The inhabitants of Corfu have conveyed this atmosphere of openness to the world and identity to our days.  Here, guests are welcome, they love to eat, make excellent home-made wine.  Corfu's cuisine, like the dialect of the locals, is a bizarre combination of Italian, Balkan, Greek and Turkish influences.  The village of Liapades, in which the Blue Princess Beach Hotel Suites 4 * is located, is typical of Corfu. </p><p>  It seems that the first vacationers locals have taken since the era of Jason and Odysseus.  And it‚Äôs for sure that they have become proficient in the tourism business during the time of Ancient Rome.  Christianity only added to the island's appeal, giving it many Romanesque churches and ancient monasteries.  By the way, Corfu is under the auspices of St. Spyridon, whose relics are still stored on the island.  Therefore, Kerkyra attracts not only tourists, but also pilgrims. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Princess Beach Hotel Suites 4 Corfu" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2065234.jpg"></div>

But the climate of Corfu is not entirely conducive to winter holidays.  The lion's share of the annual rainfall falls from November to January.  But already in February spring comes to Corfu.  During this period, the island literally blooms and smells.  The heat begins at the end of April.  But the deep Ionian Sea warms up slowly, and few decide to swim.  The tourist season opens in mid-May in the part of the island that faces the mainland, since the strait is shallow.  At the end of May, it becomes comfortable to swim on the rest of the Corfu coast.  High tourist season lasts until the beginning of October.  Storms that are becoming more frequent reduce the number of holidaymakers on the island, and with it prices.  The most convenient period for excursions around the island is April and October.  The weather is warm, sunny and without precipitation.  If you are exclusively interested in beach vacations, then the summer months will suit you.  However, with children it is best to go to <span>Corfu in September.</span>  In early autumn, the sun is not so baking, and the sea warmed up best. </p><h2>  Where is the Blue Princess Beach Hotel Suites 4 * located? </h2><p>  Description of hotels usually begins with their location.  We will not depart from this rule.  There is a hotel "Blue Princess Beach Hotel Suites" 4 * in the village, or, if you want, the town of Liapades.  Four kilometers away is the famous Paleokastritsa, while the capital of the island, the city of Corfu, where the airport is located, is 18 km away.  That is, you will not have to go to the resting place for long.  As the name implies (Beach translates as "coast"), the hotel is located on the first line from the sea, actually on the beach.  It is surrounded by restaurants, taverns and shops.  Vacationers really liked the location of the hotel.  To a beautiful sandy beach to go from anywhere in the hotel for about a minute.  The only minus the location of the hotel relative to the infrastructure is its remoteness from the bus stop.  If you went on an independent tour, then you have to go to public transport for about a kilometer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Princess Beach Hotel Suites 4 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2065229.jpg"></div>
