    <h2>  Hotel Complex Overview </h2><p>  The Porto Plaza Hotel has many reviews.  From them you can take a lot of useful information and even make your own opinion about this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Porto Plaza Hotel belongs to private city hotels, which are located almost in the center of the resort.  It consists of several three-story buildings, in which one elevator is equipped for guests. </p><p>  The hotel complex is considered quite old.  However, there are few new hotels on the island that would be commissioned in the last ten years.  Porto Plaza Hotel received its first guests in the late eighties of the last century, over time it lost its popularity due to poor condition of the number of rooms.  Therefore, five years ago, a hotel was renovated, which turned it into one of the most beautiful and modern complexes in Crete. </p><p>  For those who are just planning to buy a tour at Porto Plaza Hotel, reviews from vacationers will help you navigate the features of this hotel complex.  For example, you should know that the hotel does not have a large territory.  However, its entire area is characterized by an abundance of green spaces, which looks very nice against the background of stone walls and rocks.  Many guests of the hotel admitted that the photos of Porto Plaza Hotel are colorful and unusual. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  For active tourists, you can’t think of a better location than Porto Plaza Hotel.  After all, he is in the most party place of Crete - in the city of Hersonissos.  There is absolutely everything for a fun and reckless holiday: night clubs, bars, restaurants, discos and numerous shopping centers.  In their reviews, our compatriots write that the hotel is practically on the main street, so several hundred meters are separated from the main attractions of the resort and the infrastructure of the Porto Plaza Hotel guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The nearest airport is Heraklion.  From it to the hotel you need to overcome only twenty-six kilometers.  This distance can be covered by transport in thirty to forty minutes. </p><p>  From the reviews and descriptions of Porto Plaza Hotel, we can conclude that the hotel is located on the first coastline.  However, in tourist booklets it is written that the hotel is separated from the sea by about one thousand meters, which corresponds to the second and third lines.  What should travelers be guided by?  Of course, on the reviews of tourists.  In almost every review they write that they go to the sea no more than five minutes.  And some buildings are even located two minutes on foot from the coast. </p>

    <h2>  Beach description </h2><p>  Porto Plaza Hotel (Crete) has a pretty good beach.  More precisely, the hotel does not have its own private territory, but the municipal beach is very good.  Keep in mind that sun loungers and umbrellas on it are paid.  For one deck chair you need to pay five euros.  For this money you will use it all day.  Even if a tourist leaves the beach to have lunch, the place will be assigned to him. </p><p>  If you are lucky and your room is in the building by the sea, then you can go swimming and not rent sunbeds.  After all, after water procedures, many immediately go to the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Do not forget that the resort does not have wide beaches - you will have to be content with a small coastal strip surrounded by stones.  Although the sea in this part of Hersonissos is very calm and clean, therefore, tourists spend most of the day on the beach. </p>

    <h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  Porto Plaza Hotel (Crete), like many other Greek hotels, does not have a large number of infrastructure facilities.  Moreover, it refers to budget hotel complexes.  Therefore, most tourists are advised to lower their expectations before going to the hotel, and then he will be able to surprise you more than once. </p><p>  The complex has one swimming pool.  In the reviews about it is mentioned infrequently, because here vacationers spend very little time.  Around the pool there is a relaxation area (sunbeds, umbrellas and towels are completely free for all guests). </p><p>  Hotel guests eat in the main restaurant.  It has an indoor lounge and terrace, and guests can also have a meal at the bar, which is located near the pool. </p><p>  There is no business center as such in the hotel, however, if you need to make copies of documents or send a fax, the employees will give you the opportunity to carry out the necessary manipulations for a small fee. </p><p>  The front desk is open twenty-four hours a day.  However, keep in mind that the staff of Porto Plaza Hotel (Greece) do not speak Russian.  All questions you have to solve in English.  If you know his basics, you can establish communication with the staff. </p><p>  Luggage storage and a small tour desk are available at the reception.  As former hotel guests say, very friendly and helpful people work there. </p><h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  Usually in Greek hotel complexes access to the Internet is paid, even five-star hotels make money on this.  And at the Porto Plaza Hotel you have to pay for it, on average, two weeks will cost you ten euros.  Guests write that Wi-Fi has excellent speed, many even calmly watched movies.  If you are hoping for free Wi-Fi, which is described in advertising booklets, then keep in mind that it catches only in the lobby.  Moreover, its speed leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  Guests have the right to use laundry and dry cleaning services.  The cost of washing is low, so this service is very popular among hotel guests.  In addition, it is worth considering that about eighty percent of the guests are Europeans who are used to handing their things to the laundry. </p><p>  If you need, the hotel will arrange a transfer for you anywhere in the island.  This service is paid, but it is often used by our compatriots. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that many services are provided to vacationers upon request at the reception.  Guests can request for an iron, hairdryer, electric kettle and tea making facilities.  All this will be absolutely free. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Most tourists recommend taking breakfast only at the hotel.  In this case, you will not be attached to one place and you will be able to fully appreciate the Greek cuisine, whose dishes are served in numerous cafes on the coast. </p><p>  Of course, food in a hotel cannot compete with the all-inclusive system, but still no one ever leaves the restaurant hungry.  Usually, guests have the opportunity to choose the right dishes from the abundance on the tables.  Breakfast includes scrambled eggs, fried eggs, sliced ​​ham and several types of cheese, yoghurts and pastries.  If you pay for dinner, you will be served meat and fish dishes, a couple of soups, potatoes and pasta as a side dish, and mandatory baking.  Guests can also enjoy several types of fruit.  Own-made ice cream is sold at the hotel, vacationers write that it is simply magnificent.  Therefore, to try this dessert is for both adults and children.  Please note that during dinner all drinks except water are paid.  They cost about two euros. </p><p>  If you get to the hotel at the beginning of the season, when there are two or three rooms, do not count on a buffet.  In this case, you will be served specific dishes chosen by the cook.  However, in such a situation, the food will be delicious literally at home, guests will not remain hungry. </p>

    <h2>  Room characteristics </h2><p>  The apartments in the hotel complex are of the same type.  Basically, they are a standard room, designed for the settlement of two or three people.  Its area does not exceed twenty-five square meters. </p><p>  Each room is equipped with individual air conditioning, refrigerator, satellite TV and safe.  You need to pay extra for it if you plan to use it. </p><p>  The floors in the apartments are tiled, which creates additional coolness.  Cleaning takes place once every two days, regarding its quality, the guests did not agree in their reviews.  Some believe that the maids were very attentive and did their job superbly, but other guests were dissatisfied with the fact that they did not wipe the dust in the rooms and changed towels only after repeated requests. </p><p>  Russian tourists associate several unpleasant moments with checking in to the room.  For some reason, initially, hotel guests fall into one of the oldest blocks, where apartments without balconies are located, with old furniture and a view of the wall.  After a request to change the number of dissatisfied guests, they are immediately relocated to another building.  There are spacious new rooms with everything you need for a good stay. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Before going to a particular hotel, an experienced traveler will definitely study all the reviews left about him and identify the pros and cons of this place.  We did the same and found that our compatriots include the following points to the minuses: </p><ul><li>  simplicity in the interiors; </li><li>  worn out number of rooms; </li><li>  poor nutrition. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, all of these shortcomings can be attributed to the subjective perception by a person of certain conditions provided.  Indeed, for example, many other guests speak with great enthusiasm about nutrition. </p><p>  Of the advantages, guests distinguish: </p><ul><li>  convenient location; </li><li>  a large selection of dishes in the restaurant; </li><li>  good beach; </li><li>  Friendly staff. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  Going to the Porto Plaza Hotel, you should not forget that it belongs to budget hotels.  Therefore, do not expect a five-star service from him.  However, tourists often write that Greece has very good service and it is difficult to notice a difference in attitude towards guests depending on the stardom of the complex.  The hotel is recommended to all categories of travelers, because everyone will be welcomed here very welcome. </p>
