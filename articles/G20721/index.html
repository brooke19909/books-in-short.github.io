But what to expect from the hotels there?  And here seasoned tourists come to the rescue of chain hotels.  The level of service and maintenance in the Iberostar chain does not depend on where its representative office is located - in Europe, Asia or Africa. </p><p>  Consider the conditions of rest in the hotel Iberostar Hotel Safira Palms 4 * (Tunisia, Zarzis).  Reviews, photos of tourists who rested there recently (in 2016) became for us the basis for writing this article.  There is one more clarification.  It should be said that from September 2013 the hotel is simply called "I wanted Safira Palmz 4 *", but the management remains the same.  This is the representative office of Iberostar in Zarzis, on the Tunisian island of Djerba.  And the level of service here is unchanged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Hotel Safira Palms 4" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1542265.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located and how to get there </h2><p>  Hotel Iberostar Safira Palms 4 * is located on the southernmost island of Tunisia, Djerba.  The capital is the city and port of Houmt Souk.  At the northern tip of the island is its international airport - Zarzis.  But so is the resort area, which is located fifty kilometers from the air harbor.  Thus, it takes about an hour to travel from the airport to the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Iberostar representative office in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãZarzis is specially built so as to provide its guests with a quiet and relaxing holiday.  The hotel stands on the shores of the beautiful beach of Ra Marmur on the whole of Djerba.  And around there is a desert, in the middle of which the Safira Palm Hotel looks like an oasis from the fairy tale ‚ÄúA Thousand and One Nights‚Äù.  But if you want to plunge into the world of authentic Tunisia, you can take a walk along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the village with shops and mosques.  And to the center of the town of Zarzis - twelve kilometers. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Despite the distance from the settlements, the tourist in Iberostar Safira Palms 4 * will not be bored.  After all, this is not even a hotel, but a whole hotel complex, similar to a small town.  Its territory is simply huge, and there was a place for pools, a thalassotherapy center, sports grounds, restaurants and cafes.  The hotel was built at the very beginning of this century, but was constantly being refined and improved according to new standards of relaxation.  The last repair took place recently, in 2014. </p><p>  The hotel has three buildings.  According to the concept that a person feels comfortable in low buildings, they all have three floors.  This hotel may well call itself a spa hotel, because, in addition to the thalassotherapy center (this is truly a Tunisian feature), it has a bath complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Hotel Safira Palms 4 djerba tunisia reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1542291.jpg" width="600"></div>

They do not have a classification and all belong to the deluxe category.  Three buildings are set in such a way that most of the rooms open up, if not frontal, at least side views of the Mediterranean Sea.

It looks like in the Caribbean.  True, beach towels are issued against a deposit of ten euros. </p><p>  The beach strip is very wide, there was a place for a volleyball court.  Lezhakov - a lot, do not occupy them at six in the morning.  On the shore there is an outdoor terrace with soft pillows, where you can also sunbathe.

    <h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Hotel Safira Palms 4 * <span>(Djerba, Tunisia)</span> reviews are described as a family hotel.  For young guests there is a shallow pool.  It is next to an adult, which allows parents to always have their child under supervision.  But if you want to forget about the children for a while, you can send them to the mini-club.  There they will be engaged in creative counselors who will conduct active games, competitions, master classes with them. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel complex there is also a playground for very young children with a slide and swings.
