DIY mask and make-up</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Comics have long been firmly connected with the daily life of many children and adults.  Those who like to do cosplay often create masks of famous heroes from DC Comics.  Those who do not like to face difficulties, as a rule, create good grimaces of positive superhumans who constantly perform actions with a capital letter.  But isn‚Äôt it more interesting to make a mask of a negative character yourself? </p><p>  Speaking of the scary grimaces from the comics from DC Comics, of course, the Joker comes to mind first and only.  The mask of this character is creepy and scary.  As far as we know, this evil hero has two original faces.  In films and cartoons, it can take both a classic and a completely unusual look.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to describe how to cosplay the Joker from all cinematic films, therefore this article will describe the process of preparing the original make-up and creating a mask directly based on the appearance of the character in the comics.  But first, let's talk a little about the personality of the Joker. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="joker mask" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1371387.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Character Features </h2><p>  <span>How to make a</span> Joker <span>mask</span> will be described below, but now we‚Äôll talk about the features of an evil character. </p><p>  The hero is distinguished by a sufficiently high level of intelligence.  It is worth noting that the Joker is an excellent chemist.  In one of the comics, you can find out that the character has developed his own poison in several ways.  The Joker is not only smart, he is also an excellent strategist.  He hides his weapon, disguising himself as a clown props.  According to the characteristics of the "parents" of the character, we can safely say that the Joker is practically the best detective on the planet.  Even Batman fails to predict his course in some situations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself joker mask" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1371394.jpg" width="344"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mask or makeup? </h2><p>  For cosplay, a popular character is often used - the Joker, whose mask is not suitable for every thematic holiday.  If there is not the slightest desire to specifically buy a grimace that a person will wear only a few hours, then it is quite possible to make a make-up.  Its advantages lie in the fact that to create it quite inexpensively and really in a few hours.  A person should not have special creative skills. </p><p>  The Joker mask costs around 1 thousand rubles.  If you do not want to spend money on it, then you can make it from improvised items.  Do-it-yourself Joker mask and make-up are quick and easy, so no problems should arise. </p><h2>  DIY makeup </h2><p>  What is needed?  Everyone who is interested in this question clearly knows <span>what the Joker looks like.</span>  The mask or make-up will be completely identical (slight differences are allowed), therefore, for the most correct creation of a grimace, you will need false seams, scars and cuts, red and black lipsticks, foundation foundation, white varnish used to color hair, a hat (you can take a wig ) and, of course, a bright suit that will complement the whole concept. </p><p>  Near the mouth you need to make a scar.  Its effect can be easily created using the appropriate fabric, which is rubbed.  Need to remember what color the face of a character like a Joker?  The mask and make-up should fully comply with this, so you need to use white makeup.  Before you apply the foundation, you should frown your forehead.  So wrinkles will appear, and they will be more expressive.  You do not need to use cotton swabs or sticks to make up perfectly.  On the contrary, bumps will be quite the topic.  If there is no makeup or the skin is allergic to it, you can use white varnish, which was already discussed in the article.  It will be quite easy for them to separate the eye area.  They, as well as ears, mouth and nose should be covered.  You can wear glasses.  Then it will be much easier to make a sharper outline.  The area around the eyes should be painted over in black.  The nose is ‚Äúdecorated‚Äù with red lipstick.  The line of the mouth is drawn with a pencil of the same color.  The scar is stained as desired.  The option will look quite spectacular when in some places it is white, in others it is red.  If there is a chance that the scar will disappear, then it can always be glued. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a joker mask" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1371395.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  DIY mask </h2><p>  In order to make a mask, a cling film will be needed.  Papier-m√¢ch√© must be placed on it.  After the procedure, it should be covered with a film on top.  As a basis, the most common plastic mask is used.  The mass layer should be very small, only about 3 mm.  To mitigate it, it is better to use petroleum jelly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="joker mask" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1371396.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <p>  The cake should be removed from the first layer of the film (the second does not move) and carefully put on the base.  After that, you need to cut out your mouth and eyes.  After that, the remaining film layer can be removed.  The mask does not dry for long, after a day it is already to be used. </p>
