By the way, this exclusive and independent complex is owned by Muskita Hotels Ltd. </p><p>  True, it is far from the airport.  From it to the hotel by car about 50 minutes.  But there is a definite plus.  Because taking off and landing planes will not interfere with silence and solitude.  But from the center of Limassol, the complex is only 8 kilometers away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should also be noted that in 2009 Four Seasons Limassol 5 * became the first hotel in all of Cyprus to be accredited by Investors in People. </p><h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  This hotel complex has several luxurious and exclusive establishments where you can enjoy excellent cuisine. </p><p>  The first is Vivaldi.

Every day, VIP guests will receive a fresh local magazine, newspaper and a basket of fresh fruit.  By the way, if they want to warm up their appetite before dinner, then just make a request and free cocktails with light snacks will be delivered to your room. </p><p>  And finally, the most important.  Namely the staff.  The people working at this hotel speak ten (!) Different languages.  It is worth listing them.
