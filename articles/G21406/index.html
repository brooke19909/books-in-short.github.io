The holiday season in 2017 was marked by the replenishment of the Turkish coast with a new portion of bored Russian travelers.  The largest concentration of Slavic guests in Turkish resorts is observed precisely on the Antalya coast.  But not everyone knows that there is another Turkey - interesting, sober, friendly and even relatively honest.  Those who want to relax inexpensively, not bothering with ‚Äúvisa issues‚Äù, avoiding uncultured tourists and Turkish pathos, should pay attention to the western resorts of Turkey. </p><h2>  Aegean coast - another Turkey </h2><p>  This resort area is radically different from the Mediterranean coast.  Holidaymakers in Bodrum, Marmaris or Fethiye may seem to be somewhere in Corfu, Crete or the south of Greece.  In the western resorts of Turkey you can perfectly relax in a European, cultural, friendship with sports, with a rich excursion program, while not neglecting all the advantages of this country as a budget and visa-free destination. </p><p>  The climate in the west is softer, drier and windier.  It is nice to relax here even in July, when <span>the</span> heat on the <span>Antalya coast</span> becomes unbearable.  However, in September-October, the Aegean Sea becomes cold, not too comfortable for swimming. </p><p>  Cognitive tourism in western Turkey is developing, perhaps, even more intensively than classic tourism.  Few novice travelers are aware that approximately 80% of all ancient monuments are not in Greece, but in the Turkish West.  But Europeans have long appreciated the local excursion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegean Park Hotel Marmaris" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1996111.jpg" width="600"></div>

Only a few of our compatriots prefer it to the Mediterranean resorts of the same Turkey.  But these guys know a lot about good rest.  Like the hundreds of thousands of British, Germans or Dutch who occupy Marmaris in the summer. </p><p>  Note to Russian tourists: Marmaris is not such a ‚Äúnative‚Äù resort for Slavic guests; not all hotels and public places know the Russian language there.  In order not to overshadow your vacation with language barriers and misunderstandings, you should still learn a few popular phrases in English. </p><p>  The city is popular for cycling, trips to the lakes, sightseeing trips, there is something to diversify the standard vacation program, consisting of "all inclusive", shopping and the sea. </p><h2>  Aegean Park Hotel 3 *: general information </h2><p>  This three-star budget club hotel was built back in 1990, but in 2013 it was the last renovation. </p><p>  The complex consists of two buildings (4 and 5 floors).  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory is 3400 square meters.  m. On the territory there are 2 pools, a bar, a restaurant and a children's playground. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegean park hotel" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1996101.jpg" width="600"></div>

Nearby (300 meters along the road towards the center) there is an ATM where you can withdraw cash without commission. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Aegean Park Hotel 3 * has just a wonderful location, ideal for those who want to combine a beach holiday with an excursion program.  It is literally 600 meters from the center of Marmaris and the port, next to the city beach (30 meters).  <span>Dalaman Airport</span> is 90 km away. </p><p>  Exact address: boulevard named after  Kemal Elgin, No. 23, the city of Marmaris. </p><p>  Free car parking is available near the hotel. </p><p>  Another interesting feature of the accommodation, especially for young and active people: you can walk to Bar Street (or Bar street) in 15 minutes with leisurely steps.  Some operators call this hotel the most drunk on the coast, and not without reason.  As a rule, usually the Dutch or Germans are drunk, they slightly balance the reputation of Russian tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegean Park Hotel Turkey" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1996109.jpg" width="600"></div>

The complex was built by order of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1522. </p><p>  16 km from Marmaris is the island of Sedir, or the island of Cleopatra, where, they say, the queen herself took baths.  In addition to the baths, the island is also notable for the preserved ruins of the ancient theater and city walls. </p><p>  From natural popular places, guidebooks advise visiting Gyokova Bay, Lake Kecheiz or the town of Datca.  All are within 30 km of Marmaris. </p><p>  Shopping in Marmaris can also be very interesting.  The city also has shopping centers with mass-market stores, but the prices for goods there are too high, and the choice is inferior to the assortment in our shopping centers.  But in the colorful oriental markets or in small workshops you can buy good, unique things: bags, wallets, leather jackets.  You just need to turn on the regime of mistrust and double-checking, because everyone knows about the inventiveness of Turkish traders in matters of deception, body kit or divorce. </p><h2>  Infrastructure on site </h2><p>  Entertainment in Aegean Park Hotel 3 * can be completely organized without going beyond the territory of the hotel complex.  Although this establishment is far from deluxe city hotels, this level is not at all, but the hotel provides a basic infrastructure and entertainment package for its guests.  And you can already replenish the collection of impressions by going to Marmaris itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegean Park Hotel 3 Service" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1996106.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis.  The three-star All inclusive program is different from the pink concept of Turkish unlimited. </p><p>  At Aegean Park Hotel in Turkey, this concept includes breakfast, lunch and dinner in the main buffet restaurant, soft drinks: water, packaged juices, carbonated drinks, tea, coffee.  There is also alcohol on the menu: beer, homemade wine.  Fresh juices, ice cream, champagne and other products can be ordered at an additional cost. </p><p>  The √† la carte restaurant is paid, but it offers a discount for hotel guests.  The cuisine in the restaurant is international. </p><p>  All-inclusive timeframes are from 07:30 to 22:00.  All drinks ordered after 22:00 are paid extra by guests. </p><p>  Breakfast starts at 07:30 and lasts until 10:00.  In the morning, the hotel serves eggs, cereal, yogurt, juices, fruits, cereals, vegetables, toasts, jams, etc. - the standard menu of an inexpensive buffet.  No late breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegean Park Hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1996108.jpg" width="600"></div>

Soups, several types of side dishes, salads, meat and fish dishes, desserts, pastries, fruits are served in the morning and evening. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The beach at Aegean Park Hotel 3 * is municipal, it is 30 meters from the hotel.  The shore is clean, sandy, the entrance to the sea is gentle.  The beach is perfect for the debut acquaintance of kids with the sea elements.  Of all the Turkish resorts, Marmaris is considered the most quiet, as it is located in the bay.  The absence of high waves and strong currents are well suited for swimming inexperienced swimmers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegean Park Hotel 3 Entertainment" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1996110.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sun beds, umbrellas on the beach are paid.  Even so, they are conditionally paid.  There is a trick: if you buy drinks in any of the bars on the beach, then the loungers near this bar automatically become free for a valuable customer of the institution. </p><p>  There are no beach towels at the hotel, neither paid, nor deposit, nor free.  You need to bring your own or buy in the city. </p><h2>  Hotel service: paid and free services </h2><p>  For entertainment, the hotel has a lounge for watching TV, table football.  There is no animation, but it, as a rule, is not much practiced in the resorts of western Turkey. </p><p>  There is also a hammam and bath, massage room.  Their visit is paid separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegean Park Hotel 3 Entertainment" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1996104.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Free Wi-Fi is available at the reception.  Safe at the reception is provided for a fee. </p><p>  The hotel also has a free shuttle service to Bar Street - this wonderful street is parallel to the promenade.  Many restaurants and night clubs are open here.  On foot from the hotel you can walk to it in 20 minutes. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Children's service in Aegean Park Hotel 3 * is not as elaborate as in Belek or Kemer hotels.  The very orientation of the hotel - budget, youth, noisy, in the center of the resort city, does not oblige to draw up an impeccable list of children's services.  But, since the budget cost of living in a hotel also attracts families with children, the hotel has created the minimum conditions for recreation for small tourists. </p><p>  The restaurant has children's positions in the general menu, there are highchairs for feeding.  The complex has a large children's pool and 2 water slides, a children's playground.  A cot is available on request. </p><p>  <span>Marmaris beach is</span> also ideal for children, it is sandy, flat, there is no pebble, as in Kemer or Alanya.  The entrance to the sea is shallow, the waves are calm.  The beach has a variety of infrastructure, including for children. </p><p>  However, the proximity of Barov Street, the concentration of nightclubs full of European youth, the atmosphere of noise and courage sometimes complicate vacations with young children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegean Park Hotel 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1996102.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rooms in the hotel received conflicting reviews: the air conditioners worked well, but the bathrooms were very cramped, old, beds were uncomfortable, the rooms were a bit ‚Äúdamaged by life‚Äù, etc. Room cleaning left much to be desired. </p><p>  If you believe the reviews, the best rooms in Aegean Park Hotel 3 * are rooms with sea views.  They are more spacious and lighter, have a balcony where it is convenient to dry a towel or clothes.  Of course, the view itself is simply luxurious. </p><p>  One of the great philosophers said: "Any offense is unjustified expectations."  This is so, you just need to use your sanity to choose a hotel that costs $ 350 for 5 days to stay.  Naturally, in such an institution there is nothing ideal, but if you set yourself up correctly, organize an educational program on the memorabilia of the most interesting ancient heritage, then you can claim a very wonderful vacation in Aegean Park Hotel 3 *. </p>
