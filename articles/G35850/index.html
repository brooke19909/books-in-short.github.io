Its interior is truly chic, especially the Great Hall of King Henry VIII.  This medieval palace interior is decorated with old elegant tapestries, commissioned by the monarch himself.  The Royal Chapel is also located here, where services are still held. </p><h2>  Historical basis </h2><p>  Hampton Court was finally built and decorated until 1733, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreation originated in 1514.  The Richmond upon Thames area on the left bank of the Thames, sixteen kilometers from <span>central London,</span> was chosen as the location <span>.</span>  In 1529, the palace was transferred as a gift to Henry VIII. </p><p>  In the 17th century, the architect Christopher Wren completed the Baroque palace and park ensemble, as William III wanted to make English Versailles out of the castle.  Until 1760, Hampton Court managed to serve as a royal residence.  Here are paintings by great painters such as Rafael Santi, Andrea Mantegna and Brueghel the Elder.  Currently, this palace and park ensemble is part of the historical royal palaces management fund. </p>

    <h2>  Ghost stories </h2><p>  There are many different, both old and new stories about ghosts that live in the halls of the palace.  Hampton Court even has a special book, which contains information about all sorts of strange incidents. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The British themselves are sure that ghosts live in every <span>English castle</span> , that is, the souls of the owners who passed away.  Just the most mysterious place you can confidently call Hampton Court Castle.  The residence of the royal family still keeps a memory of the sinister past. </p><p>  It all started back in 1525, when Henry VIII decided to divorce his wife <span>Catherine of Aragon.</span>  The reason was that the queen gave birth not to a son, as the king wanted, but to a daughter.  Henry asked the Pope for permission to divorce, but was refused.  A little later, the king became the head of the English church, divorced from Aragon and married Anna Boleyn. </p><p>  And the story repeated itself: a young girl gave birth to a king a daughter.  Henry very cruelly treated his wife: executed, accusing him of witchcraft and adultery.  The third wife was Jane Seymour, thanks to whom the king finally had a son.  The woman herself died due to complicated births.  Oddly enough, the fourth bride, Catherine Howard, was also executed after two years of marriage to Henry. </p><p>  It is easy to guess that the ghosts of Hampton Court Castle are the king and his wives.  On October 16, 1970, castle servants allegedly saw Jane Seymour.  She was described as a beautiful woman in white clothes with a candle in her hands and a soft smile on her face.  According to eyewitnesses, all ghosts suddenly appeared and disappeared just as suddenly.  <span>Catherine Howard</span> was seen running toward the chapel in terrifying despair. </p><p>  The ghost of Henry can be called the most terrible of all.  Rumor has it that he appears only at night and only during a thunderstorm.  Witnesses say that when lightning illuminated the hall, they saw the figure of a man shackled in armor and with a crown on his head.  His gaze was full of anger, and from the ghost itself it did not blow in the cold, but in the heat.  The royal castle boasts such mysterious stories. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
