    <p>  As for lunch and dinner, you can eat at one of the many restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel.  So, in their reviews, many tourists from Russia and other CIS countries especially highlight the institution called "Snow White".  According to them, traditional Vietnamese dishes are excellently prepared here, and the prices will pleasantly surprise you.  In addition, the owner of the restaurant speaks good Russian and is always ready not only to deliciously feed his guests, but also to help them organize sightseeing trips and any purchases. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Many tourists who come to rest in Vietnam expect to have a good time on the seashore.  As for the four-star hotel Muine D√© Centuri Beach Resort &amp; Spa, which we are considering, it is located on the first coastline and has its own beach.  It is quite narrow, but here everyone can comfortably sit on comfortable sunbeds.  A number of our compatriots noted the fact that a lot of garbage is constantly thrown onto the shore as a drawback.  Moreover, this is not only algae and the remains of marine inhabitants, but also household waste.  Hotel staff regularly clean up the coast, so most often an unpleasant picture appears before the eyes of vacationers only in the early morning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="muine de century beach resort spa 4 phan thiet" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/967536.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The four-star Muine De Century Beach Resort &amp; Spa, which we are reviewing, was considered by our compatriots to be a great place for a relaxing and leisurely pastime.  After all, here you will not meet a noisy team of animators, which from morning to evening attracts tourists to sports or entertainment events.  Hotel guests are happy to relax near the pools, sitting on a comfortable sun lounger and listening to the sound of waves and the <span>singing of cicadas.</span>  Those who wish to relax in body and soul can book a massage.  The procedure is carried out on the seashore.  The local spa offers a range of massages, as well as locally produced beauty and healing products. </p><p>  In addition, experienced travelers are sure to advise everyone who comes on vacation to Vietnam to go on excursions.  After all, this country is rich in amazing places that you should definitely visit.  And in their reviews, many of our compatriots advise you to buy tours not from the guide at the hotel, but at the tour agencies in the city.  This will save you a significant amount of money, and the quality you get is the same. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Our compatriots, vacationing at the Muyne De Centuri Beach Resort &amp; Spa, did not make any complaints against the hotel staff.  According to them, the hotel staff is very polite, friendly and helpful.  A big plus was the fact that many local workers speak Russian.  So, our compatriots did not have any communication problems with the hotel in question. </p>
