    <p>  <span>Only 100 meters from the beach mentioned above, and you are near the cottage of Alla Borisovna.</span>  <span>If you look at the Small Berezhki (Moscow region) from above, you can see that the cottage is very reminiscent of a noble estate from the works of Turgenev.</span>  <span>Over 50 hectares of land, a luxury house, a garden.</span>  <span>What else is needed for happiness?</span>  <span>When Alla Borisovna moved to the chic Maxim Galkin mansion, her cottage was empty for a long time.</span>  <span>But now it <span>is</span> the residence of the grandson of <span>Nikita Presnyakov.</span></span>  <span>It was here that he moved with his wife.</span>  <span>To visit Small Berezhki and not to walk along this mansion <span>is a</span> huge crime.</span>  <span>Of course, you are unlikely to be able to see something: the mansion is closed to the eyes of the press and onlookers by a tall fence, which in fact does not reduce interest in it.</span> </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  <span>Nature <span>is a</span> special value of the village.</span>  <span>To find something like this in the suburbs is almost impossible, because huge hectares of forest belt have long been cut down.</span>  <span>Small Berezhki are located on the Istra reservoir, the views are amazing.</span>  <span>That is why artists and photographers come here so often <span>-</span> away from city noise, you can really immerse yourself in creativity.</span> </p>
