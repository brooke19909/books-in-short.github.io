    <h2>  Travel to Montenegro </h2><p>  Fans of beach, extreme and ecotourism come to this Balkan country.  For lovers of superior comfort, it is better not to come here or to choose a hotel belonging to a particular international luxury hotel chain.  And Montenegro is chosen by unpretentious tourists, for whom true peace and complete relaxation away from the hustle and bustle come first.  Especially like here people who come with the whole family, with small children.  As a rule, they book rooms in apart-hotels, for example, in Hotel Aquarius 3 * (Montenegro / Budva), the photo of which you see in this article.  After all, his rooms are quite spacious, have large terraces where it is very convenient for children to play, there are also rooms with kitchen corners, where you can prepare special dishes for kids or warm milk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Budva </h2><p>  The <span>Budva Riviera is</span> especially attractive for tourists <span>.</span>  This is the main tourist center of Montenegro.  There are wonderful sandy beaches, amazingly beautiful architecture (the red roofs are just standing), inexpensive, but quite comfortable hotels.  The center of the riviera is the city of Budva - one of the venerable resorts on the Adriatic.  The city was founded two and a half millennia ago.  This is perhaps one of the oldest settlements on the Adriatic coast.  Here and there along the riviera the most ancient architectural monuments have been preserved, which attract fans not only of beach tourism, but also of excursion programs.  Having settled in <span>the Hotel</span> Aquarius 3 * <span>hotel</span> (Montenegro / Budva), you can buy various tours to historical and natural sights at the travel agency. </p><p>  In addition, Budva is considered the center of entertainment in the country, it was not for nothing that the film ‚ÄúCasino Royale‚Äù was shot here - another series about the legendary agent 007, James Bond.  For this, the resort is called ‚ÄúMontenegrin Miami‚Äù.  It offers tourists - discos, clubs and restaurants, cabarets, casinos, etc. Budva welcomes guests all year round, although the high season is 4 months - from June to the end of September. </p><p>  Lovers of the beach island - 35 beaches.  Of these, 8 were awarded the Blue Flag of the European Union.  Most of them are rocky, small-pebble and, in rare cases, sandy. </p><p>  The resort has one drawback, and this is due to the ancient layout of the city.  Small hotels have virtually no territories; they can overlook other buildings.  If you read on the tourist portals about Hotel Aquarius 3 * (Montenegro / Budva) reviews of tourists, then among the negative you will see dissatisfaction with this feature of the hotel.  But what can you do, Budva is a very ancient resort, and the locals really value their historical heritage and will never begin to ruin the ancient old buildings in order to free the land for the adjacent territories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel aquarius 3 montenegro budva services" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1570633.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel <span>Aquarius 3 * (Montenegro / Budva):</span> traveler reviews </h2><p>  Both positive and negative ratings at the hotel abound.  What is the reason for such a spread?  Most of the negative reviews are due precisely to the lack of territory, and therefore, entertainment at the hotel.  However, no one deceives tourists, and no one promises them an interesting pastime at the hotel before buying a tour.  To do this, there are large hotels that are located outside the city.  And here, like other ancient Mediterranean towns, everything is crowded.  But around - ancient architecture and there is something to admire.  Tourists also complain about the presence of insects in the rooms.  If this is not cockroaches or bugs, then the claim should not be to the hotel administration, but to nature.  Positive reviews relate to the quality of services, to a delicious and plentiful cuisine, as well as to a simple human friendly attitude. </p>
