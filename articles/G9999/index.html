    <p>  Many travel on tourist packages and relieve themselves of worries about their place of residence.  However, not everyone prefers hotels when it is possible to stay in a private house or cottage by the sea in a picturesque tourist town. </p><p>  However, concluding an agreement with a private person and securing a carefree vacation is much harder than, for example, with an official representative of a hotel.  There are difficulties with paying, booking rooms, finding reliable information about the place of the upcoming vacation.  It should be noted that air tickets for charter flights are much more budget-friendly than the prices for regular flights with Bulgaria.  Therefore, it is the country's hotels that have been in stable demand for many years. </p><h2>  Price of pleasure </h2><p>  All-inclusive Bulgaria hotels are most revered by European tourists due to the fact that in this country reasonable prices and good quality are above all.  However, it‚Äôs also not worth saving too much when choosing a place to stay - you can easily find yourself near a construction site or even worse - in an unfinished hotel, since there is currently an active construction in a country called Bulgaria.  All-inclusive hotels, with accommodation prices starting at 250 euros per day, of course, will be located in quiet areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you take into account specific figures, then a family vacation (two adults and a child) in a <span>4 star hotel</span> will cost around 1,000 Euros for 12 days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels in Bulgaria all inclusive" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463354.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels for every taste </h2><p>  There are hotels with one star and five in the country - the famous all-inclusive hotels in Bulgaria.  In contrast, for example, from France, where you can only stay at the 4 star deluxe hotel, since the 5 star category is completely absent. </p><p>  Basically, the level of service in hotels is fully consistent with the specified class, because state certification in the country is required.  The Ministry of Economy of Bulgaria closely monitors the strict implementation by hotels of the required standards, and it is this institution that assigns hotels from three to five stars.  Simpler establishments (one / two stars) are occupied by city authorities. </p><h2>  "Stars" of hotels </h2><p>  In many countries, it does not correspond to the true living conditions of tourists.  For example, a five-star hotel in Egypt is on a par with a four-star hotel in Bulgaria.  Therefore, do not wait for deception from Bulgarian hotels and you can choose in accordance with personal priorities and financial capabilities.  Someone is happy about a simple room in a not very expensive hotel, where, as they say, only ‚Äúthrow dice‚Äù, while someone, on the contrary, needs expensive apartments with the best amenities and comfort and chooses all-inclusive hotels in Bulgaria.  In order not to be mistaken, you should understand several important criteria in choosing a place to stay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Mandatory conditions for a hotel with one star should be parking, mail, safe and telephone in the room.  Two-star rooms plus the above should provide customers with a TV and minibar, there should also be a laundry and dry cleaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria hotels photo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463355.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Three-star hotels should offer a children's area and a conference room, as well as guide services and car rental.  Hotels in Bulgaria (some photos can be found in this article) offer mainly three stars.  As a rule, these are buildings of the last century, carefully renovated and put in order.  Just 20 years ago, tourism in Bulgaria was at a very low stage of development, but the financial contributions of foreign investors significantly raised the level of hotels in the country.  Since the Germans made the greatest contribution to the development of the industry, now in Bulgaria one can often hear German speech.  They speak both English and Russian, but much worse, which can be a small problem for Russian-speaking tourists. </p><p>  In 4-star hotels, in addition to the above, there must be WI-FI, fitness centers and pools, as well as hotel staff must be fluent in various foreign languages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The best five-star all-inclusive Bulgaria hotels offer vacationers a range of shops, a beauty salon, a spa, a restaurant with a bar and more.  Tourists also have the opportunity to order additional amenities in their room for an extra charge (air conditioning, refrigerator). </p><p>  It is not always worth chasing the prestige of a five-star hotel in Bulgaria, because the level of four-star hotels here is quite high.  Such a hotel will have all the conditions for a pleasant and carefree vacation.  Three-star hotels are compact and unconditionally clean, but if you are relaxing with a child, then you will have to look after him exclusively.  Prices for <span>3-star hotels are</span> much lower than four-star hotels, which is an important condition if you take a break from city noise and bustle as a priority. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria hotels all inclusive prices" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463987.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Children's holidays in Bulgaria </h2><p>  Recreational facilities for children at local hotels pay great attention.  For local hotels, the norm is the presence of a children's menu in a restaurant, a children's room, cots in rooms, children's pools, entertainment for the younger generation (clubs, workshops, games). </p><p>  Animators (who also speak Russian) are happy to decorate the lives of kids with bright colors.  And the greater the "stardom" of the hotel, the more varied and interesting the program for kids who find themselves on vacation in a country like Bulgaria.  Prices for holidays here are from 1000 euros for 12 days.  To achieve maximum comfort, we recommend choosing hotels with babysitters and areas for children.  As a rule, a nanny is a few young guys from the animation team who will spend time with your child cheerfully and actively, as well as take breaks for food and sleep.  Most often, groups of children of the same age gather, get to know each other, find a common language and relax sometimes more productively than their parents sunbathing on the beach. </p><h2>  Hotel Features </h2><p>  It should be noted that motels, <span>private hotels</span> and apartments a priori cannot have more than three stars.  At the <span>same time, bungalows</span> and campsites - no more than two. </p><p>  As you know, rest for each person is completely individual and depends on the different interests of each guest of the country.  The best quality and most expensive hotels are Royal Bay (4 stars), located in Burgas, the best Bulgaria all-inclusive hotels, Marina Royal Palace (5 stars) in the same resort, Grand Arena (5 stars) in Bansko , Pamporovo (5 stars) in the city of the same name, Riviera Beach (5 stars) and Berlin Green Park (4 stars) are located on Golden Sands in Varna.  Of the simpler hotels in the same Varna, one can mention ‚ÄúPreslav‚Äù (3 stars), and in Burgas - ‚ÄúTundia‚Äù (2 stars) and others.  We hope that this information will be useful for tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria holiday prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463357.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Three-star hotels, although unremarkable, meet the criteria of ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù.  The biggest advantage of this kind of hotels is that they belong to the so-called family type.  Their owners are local residents who care about them as their own apartments, try to provide comfort and warmth in every room and please every client.  Other three-star hotels are the most common place for a tourist who does not pretend to a high level of service. </p><p>  So, perhaps, in an economical country it‚Äôs worth paying somewhere more, but enjoy a first-class, high-grade vacation.  Many will be interested in the analysis of hotels in a country such as <span>Bulgaria (overview).</span>  The hotels most often chosen by the residents of our country are presented below. </p><h2>  Family Friendly Hotels </h2><p>  Dunes: Belleville 4 *, Marina Royal Palace 5 *, Marina Beach 4 *, Holiday Village 4 *, Pelican 4 *. </p>
