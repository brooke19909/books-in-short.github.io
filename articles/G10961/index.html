  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Percentage of the plan: calculation, examples</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The planning process is an integral part of any success.  The presence of goals specified in the indicators allows you to control the movement of a person or organization in a certain direction, and makes the activity understandable.  This allows you to immediately move to effective actions.  However, an equally important condition for achieving success is the ability to control the results of their activities.  A person should have a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat stage he is at and how much more he has to do.  This article will tell you how to calculate the percentage of plan completion. </p><h2>  Why you need to count </h2><p>  There are many areas of human activity, the results of which can be accurately quantified.  In order to carry out their activities effectively, to make the most of their actions, resort to planning.  The presence of specific goals allows you to adhere to precisely those indicators for which the activity makes sense. </p><p>  A striking example in this case is budget planning.  To ensure that the organization remains profitable and receives the necessary funds for development, the development of indicators of income and expenses.  The implementation of the plan is a guarantee of the successful development of the company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gmkcapital.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Why you need to calculate the percentage of completion of the plan" class="if uuid-2814612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104861/2814612.jpg"></div><p>  In order to properly build their activities and timely achieve these indicators, it is necessary to imagine at what stage the organization is in relation to this goal.  It is for a clear positioning of a person or organization on the path to achieving results that the calculation of the percentage of the plan is applied.  It allows you to properly build your activities so that all the necessary indicators are achieved on time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to calculate the implementation of the plan </h2><p>  When it comes to how to calculate the percentage of fulfillment of a plan, it means the ratio of its two components: those indicators that have been achieved and those that need to be achieved.  In sales, this is the aggregate of purchases made by customers to the total planned sales volume.  When planning a budget, this is the amount of money currently earned to the amount of finance that you need to earn over a certain period of time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pulse.ng" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to correctly calculate the plan" class="if uuid-2814616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104861/2814616.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, in order to determine the percentage of fulfillment of the plan, it is necessary to find the quotient of the results achieved at the moment and planned by a certain date, and then multiply the resulting number by 100. </p><p>  PVP = TR / ZR * 100 </p><ul><li>  PVP - percentage of the plan; </li><li>  TR - current results; </li><li>  SR - planned results. </li></ul><h2>  Putting the formula into practice </h2><p>  For example, a real estate agency plans to rent 28 apartments this month.  Currently rented 6. So, the percentage of completion of the organization‚Äôs plan at the current time is 21. It is this information that serves as the basis for activating the further activities of the company and finding new tenants. </p><p>  PVP = 6/28 * 100 = 21.428 </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbesmiddleeast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Putting the formula into practice" class="if uuid-2814617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104861/2814617.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In most areas of activity in which the results are clearly quantifiable, a person or organization resorts to planning values, the achievement of which is a prerequisite for ensuring successful development.  This operation is used in the field of sales, economic activities of large organizations, small projects, ordinary families, as well as in many other areas.  Achieving the planned indicators requires a clear positioning along the entire path of movement to them.  It is precisely for the purpose of exercising control over the approach to the plan that the percentage of plan fulfillment formula is used. </p>
