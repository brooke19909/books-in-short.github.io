    <h2>  Who is Kiselev? </h2><p>  Kiselev Rock is named after the great Russian landscape painter, professor of the <span>St. Petersburg Academy of Arts</span> Alexander Alexandrovich Kiselev.  This man was born in Sveaborg, which today is one of the administrative districts of Helsinki, in 1838.  Alexander was a pupil of the Arakcheevsky administrative building, and since 1858 he became a student at St. Petersburg University.  In the fall of 1861, student unrest began to occur, so the university was closed.  So the future artist became a free-coming student of the Imperial Academy of Arts.  Mr. Kiselev worked in the Russian capital, but very often traveled throughout the country.  He did this in order to find new landscapes for his paintings, which in the best way reflected the nature of different seasons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A little later, Alexander took up writing the Caucasian species, which gained incredible success.  Among the masterpieces of the author are the paintings ‚ÄúSummer landscape‚Äù, ‚ÄúUkrainian landscape‚Äù, ‚ÄúView of the surroundings of Kharkov‚Äù and other works.  At the beginning of the last century, Alexander Kiselev erected a house in Tuapse, which is now the house-museum of the artist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kisele Tuapse rock" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/479771.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Where is it and how to get there? </h2><p>  Kiseleva Rock is located four kilometers northwest of Tuapse itself, between the mouth of the Aga River and <span>Cape Kadosh.</span>  This is one of the most beautiful places on the Black Sea coast.  The height of the object reaches 46 meters. </p><p>  Kiseleva Rock (locals know how to get to it, as well as employees of travel agencies) - the place is gorgeous.  So, the first way to travel: by minibus or regular bus from Tuapse to the sign of the same name.  Further the path will have to be done on foot.  The second method is a little more difficult than the first, but more interesting.  It consists of walking from Agoy along the coastline.  The whole journey will take no more than an hour.  True, sometimes you will have to jump over rocks and wade bends if the water is high.  And the third way: on a motor boat, a steamboat or a pleasure boat from Agoy, Nebug or Tuapse.  The cost of such a trip includes diving, swimming and a boat trip. </p><h2>  Rock of tears </h2>

    <p>  Once upon a time, the Kiseleva (Tuapse) rock was called the rock of tears.  And all because of one ancient Adyghe legend.  Once upon a time in the surrounding areas lived a young and beautiful girl, Guash.  She fell in love with a dzhigita, a native of the aul, which was located next to her house.  He bore the name Dysheek.  The couple decided to bond their love with a marriage.  But according to tradition, the groom had to abduct his bride.  At the peak of the cliff near the sea, that same secret place was assigned.  The signal to start the ceremony was to be a fire lit by Guash.  On the night of the abduction, the girl decided to test her beloved one last time.  She put a flaming lamp on a log and lowered it into the water.  When the guy arrived and saw a floating light, he immediately understood the intentions of his future wife.  On a horse, he went down to the sea and swam for a log.  The dzhigit plunged deeper into the sea.  The horse was no longer visible, but Dysheek was a strong young man.  And if not for the heavy chain mail ... The guy swam to the fire, but he couldn‚Äôt find the strength to return back. </p><p>  The girl did not wait for her beloved.  Since that time, Guash, who had never become a wife, often stood for a long time on the edge of the cliff, peering out her fianc√©.  She wept bitterly and sang songs.  The woman realized that she could not live without her Dysheek and jumped off a cliff into the sea abyss.  Water has become a common grave for lovers.  And the rock acquired the name "rock of tears."  Rumor has it that from time to time at night from the top of the cliff you can hear crying and sad songs that the girl sings. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

The popularity brought her a picture of A. A. Kiselev with a picture of a natural diva.  The rock itself is a cliff with three faces that protrudes far into the sea.  This is a unique natural creation, on the Black Sea coast it is so one of a kind.  The rock is considered the hallmark of Tuapse.  The cliff is visible hundreds of meters from the <span>sea: it is</span> light, smooth, as if polished by winds and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaters.</span>  On the top of the Kiseleva cliff, small groves have grown.  They grow some species of vines and <span>Pitsunda pine.</span>  In addition to them you can meet another 26 different types of shrubs and trees.

    <h2>  Travel Recommendations </h2><p>  Rock Kiseleva, whose photo is in our article, attracts travelers from all over Russia.  And if you are already planning to go here, be sure to bring a pipe and a mask with you.  It‚Äôs simply not possible to dive here.  This must be done.  But be careful, because the local beach is dotted with stones, large boulders and high ridges running parallel to the shore.  If you intend to stay here a little longer, then bring some food with you, as the nearest store is located in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Tuapse photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/479763.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Something interesting </h2><p>  Kiseleva Rock holds many mysteries.  One of them is the remains of marine sediments that are in the forest at the very top of the cliff.  These residues are petrified fauna and pebbles.  In the local waters there is simply a huge variety of fish, plants and crabs.  Diving enthusiasts can spend several hours underwater watching the underwater marine life.  However, they will not freeze - the water is almost hot, but crystal clear and transparent. </p><h2>  Clue </h2><p>  Well, did you remember how you knew the Kiseleva rock?  Not?  As we promised, we answer: in 1968, it became the location of the famous film ‚ÄúThe Diamond Arm‚Äù.  This is where the scene takes place in which Andrei Mironov and Yuri Nikulin (Lelik and Gorbunkov, respectively) caught fish <span>(White Rock).</span> </p>
