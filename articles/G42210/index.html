  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Absolute monarchy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An absolute monarchy is a form of government.  In the context of this structure, judicial, executive, legislative, and, in some cases, spiritual power is actually and legally concentrated in the hands of one ruler. </p><p>  The absolute monarchy was established at different times in many states that existed before the 18th century.  According to historians, the countries of that era came to this form of government naturally. </p><p>  An absolute monarchy (in the broad sense) is characterized as unlimited power, inherited.  In a narrow sense, this form of government involves a certain framework.  For example, in different countries, the absolute monarchy was subordinate to representative bodies (Cortes in Spain, <span>general states</span> in France, Zemsky Councils in Russia). </p><p>  At the same time, possessing even unlimited power, the autocrat was forced to reckon with his subjects.  The opinion of the people could be expressed in completely different ways: from the recommendations of advisers to the uprisings and the overthrow of the king. </p><p>  The absolute monarchy in <span>the Enlightenment</span> was not just unlimited, but a power that had a divine origin.  This was largely facilitated by theologians of the time.  Louis 14 better than others defined the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãabsolutism in his phrase "The state is me." </p><p>  This form of government contributes to the development of a ramified bureaucratic apparatus; a permanent police and army are formed. </p><p>  Absolutism in the West European powers reached its peak in the 17-18 centuries.  During this period, the <span>state</span> is completely <span>centralized.</span>  The monarch, vested with legislative and executive power, independently makes decisions, sets taxes and, at his discretion, manages the state treasury. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The unlimited power of the autocrat relied on the nobility.  Forming under conditions of feudal fragmentation, absolutism in the early stages developed quite rapidly.  The period of formation of this power was characterized by rather progressive actions: the struggle against the remnants of feudal fragmentation, the subordination of the church, the introduction of uniform laws.  The development of industry, trade, and the national economy was aimed at strengthening the military potential for future conquests. </p><p>  According to historians, the <span>features of absolutism</span> were present to one degree or another in all European countries.  However, this form of government in France was more complete.  This country came to absolutism in the 16th century.  And its form of government reached its peak in the era of the Bourbon reign <span>(Louis 13</span> and 14). </p><p>  The absolute monarchy in England reached its peak during the reign of Elizabeth the First Tudor (1558-1603).  However, in the British Isles in its classical form, this power has not been established.  The parliament prevented this in many ways.  In addition, there was no army, no bureaucratic apparatus. </p><p>  In different countries, absolutism possessed some particular characteristics.  To a greater extent, they were determined by the influence of various sectors of society on domestic politics in the country.  So, for example, in England and France the bourgeoisie had great influence. </p><p>  In the second half of the 18th century, absolutism moved on to the next stage.  The form of government in this period was influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment.  Thus, <span>"Enlightened absolutism" was formed.</span> </p><p>  With the development and strengthening of the capitalist system in European countries, the existence of absolutism began to strongly contradict the new order in society. </p><p>  In some states (for example, France, Russia), the contradictions between the developing society and the power limiting it were resolved in a revolutionary way.  Some powers gradually came to a <span>limited, constitutional</span> form of government. </p>
