This is not surprising.  It is so convenient to carry with you not a pile of ever-wrinkling and rustling paper notes, but a thin piece of plastic.  One of the most famous institutions issuing such is Sberbank.  Its branches operate throughout Russia and the CIS countries.  But, despite its popularity, many customers still do not know whether it is possible to put dollars on a Sberbank card.  We fill this gap in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="znatokdeneg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rubles and currency" class="if uuid-3181986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3181986.jpg"></div><h2>  When do I need a foreign currency in my account? </h2><p>  The need for foreign currency on the card may arise if you plan to travel abroad.  Or you need to replenish your account and pay for any goods, services in foreign currency.  Complexity arises when there is no currency at all in your account.  Or your card is not suitable for this at all.  So is it possible to put dollars on a Sberbank card? </p><div class="photo" data-original="bankigid.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cash deposit, ATM" class="if uuid-3181995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3181995.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it real or not? </h2><p>  To answer such an exciting question, you need to find out a few key points.  For example, you should know which card you have.  In particular, in any branch of a credit institution it is realistic to open an account in foreign currency (US dollars), national currency and order a multi-currency card (operations with domestic and foreign currency are possible). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you have a ruble credit card, the question of whether it is possible to put dollars on a Sberbank card will disappear by itself.  This operation is not performed. </p><p>  On the ruble card, it is realistic to put only domestic currency.  But on the dollar and multicurrency it can be done.  Another thing is how exactly to do this ?! </p><div class="photo" data-original="bankigid.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM Crediting" class="if uuid-3181997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3181997.jpg"></div><h2>  Transferring money through a terminal or ATM: is it real ?! </h2><p>  So, is it possible to put dollars on a Sberbank card through a terminal, ATM or any other self-service device?  Most often, many cardholders replenish their account using self-service devices.  It is convenient and very fast. </p><p>  But since the ATMs and terminals of Sberbank work with the national currency, this operation for crediting dollars or euros to the account is impossible. </p><p>  As for whether it is possible to put dollars on a Sberbank card through an ATM, and withdraw rubles, here the answer is similar to the previous one.  It is impossible.  The ruble card was created in order to withdraw rubles from it.  Putting dollars on it using an ATM or terminal is not possible. </p><p>  Multicurrency and dollar cards allow you to work with foreign currency.  However, it is also impossible to replenish them with this same currency through terminals and ATMs.  But through ATMs you can replenish your account in rubles.  Conversion at the current exchange rate of the bank will occur instantly.  And the money will get into your account almost immediately.  But is it possible to put dollars on a Sberbank card in other ways? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="aviationtoday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branch of Sberbank" class="if uuid-3182009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3182009.jpg"></div><h2>  How to really replenish the card with currency? </h2><p>  One of the most reliable and proven options for replenishing a card with currency is to contact a bank branch.  For this you only need a passport. </p><p>  And remember that to complete the operation you must have a multicurrency or dollar account with a bank.  In the case of opening the first version of the account, it is realistic to put dollars on Sberbank cards with rubles.  Can this be done with a dollar card?  The answer is no.  Only dollars can be put on a dollar card.  Accordingly, they will be on it.  But if you later want to withdraw money from this card, you can do it in rubles at the exchange rate.  According to the legislation and policy of the bank, cashing of a currency card through ATMs and terminals is allowed only in Russian rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aviationtoday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of Sberbank Maestro" class="if uuid-3182001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3182001.jpg"></div><h2>  How is the replenishment of a currency or multi-currency card? </h2><p>  Thinking about whether it is possible to put dollars on a Sberbank Mastercard card, do not forget about the rules of a credit institution.  According to them, you can put money on the card. </p><p>  This is really done at the bank branch.  But at the same time, you will still receive a certain amount in rubles.  The transfer will be carried out at the current rate of the bank.  But you can use such a multi-currency card in the currency that is most relevant for your country of residence.  For example, only rubles will work in Russia.  In the USA - dollars, and in European countries - euros. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arzdigital.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer dollars online" class="if uuid-3182011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3182011.jpg"></div><h2>  Can I put dollars on a Sberbank Visa Gold card? </h2><p>  Premium card holders can replenish dollar and multicurrency cards in foreign currency.  It is noteworthy that on your multicurrency card account there will be not only dollars, but also rubles, and euros.  Moreover, both versions of Sberbank cards require payment of annual services. </p><p>  Despite the presence of foreign currency units, the main one will still be domestic.  In the absence of a certain amount for service or for conversion at the current exchange rate of the bank in rubles, funds are withdrawn from the dollar account.  If the required amount is not enough on it, then money is withdrawn from the account in euros. </p><p>  Replenishment of a dollar account is carried out through the bank's cash desk in the nearest branch. </p><h2>  Can I recharge a card via the Internet? </h2><p>  Replenishment of Sberbank plastic cards via the Internet is also possible.  The main condition is connection to virtual banking.  And the second important point - the transfer of funds from card to card is allowed.  But at the same time, both of them must be executed in different currencies.  For example, one in dollars, and the second in rubles. </p><h2>  How to exchange currencies over the Internet? </h2><p>  First you need to log in to the service website.  If you are not registered, go through a simple registration.  Then go to your personal account, carefully study the current exchange rate, follow the link "Currency Exchange".  And finally, you just have to indicate the card number of the recipient.  At the same time, the exchange of national currency for dollars will be carried out very quickly. </p><h2>  How to withdraw dollars or euros from the card? </h2><p>  Withdrawing foreign currency from a multicurrency or dollar card is possible only at Sberbank branches.  For this you will also need to present your current Russian passport. </p><h2>  How to recharge a card in euros? </h2><p>  If you have a multi-currency card, and you decide to replenish it, you can do this in rubles through terminals or ATMs.  Exchange will occur at the current rate.  Funds will arrive immediately. </p><p>  The second option to replenish the card is an appeal to a representative of a credit organization.  To do this, select any nearest branch.  Come to it with a passport and carry out this currency transaction through a card. </p><p>  In this case, you can put euros, dollars or rubles on the card, instantly exchanging them for a suitable currency for you.  After that, you will get dollars or euros into your account.  And the bank will receive a small percentage from this.  As a result, everyone will be satisfied. </p><p>  And finally, the third replenishment option is the use of virtual banking.  For example, replenishment can be performed from a ruble card to a multicurrency one. </p><h2>  Can I top up from another bank? </h2><p>  You can transfer dollars to your Sberbank account from a branch of another bank.  For example, if you are his payroll client.  It is also possible to carry out this operation by going to the branch of another bank with a passport.  Alternatively, it‚Äôs realistic to transfer funds from card to card.  This is true, for example, if you have a multicurrency card opened in Sberbank and a dollar card in another bank. </p><p>  In a word, if you need to replenish the card with dollars or euros, it is possible to do this, but subject to certain rules.  This cannot be done at the ATM.  Only if you decide to exchange rubles for foreign currency.  Remember this. </p>
