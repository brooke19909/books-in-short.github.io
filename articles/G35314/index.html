All precautions and troubles taken with sports facilities at the Olympics in Canada were repeated thirty years later in Greek Athens. </p><p>  The number of medals was not equal to the two countries from the socialist camp.  The USSR and the GDR were able to get around their main competitor - the United States.  And the mistress of the most spectacular sports games did not win a single <span>gold medal.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Stronger security </h2><p>  After the tragedy that happened at the Olympics in Munich, where terrorists captured and then killed Israeli athletes, it was decided at the next Olympic Games in Montreal to do everything to prevent this from happening again.  The organizers spent six times more than planned on ensuring the safety of athletes. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the Olympics in Canada was held <span>"without a hitch,"</span> there was not a single incident.  And could it have been otherwise if the organizing committee attracted more than 20,000 law enforcement officers to guard, Although in all the Olympics in Canada gathered 6189 athletes!  Many participants in those competitions recall that the police performed their duties too zealously and not always correctly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montreal Olympics" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12504/381128.jpg?1398430614496" width="480"></div>

For example, in the main arena of the <span>Olympic Games,</span> where athletics competitions were held, two huge screens were installed.  The most interesting competitive moments were broadcast on them, you could even watch slow-motion replays, which at that time was simply unthinkable. </p><h2>  Unique technologies accompanied sports records </h2><p>  The Olympics in Canada had another "chip."  She became the pool, where the competition was held swimmers.  A special device was made in it to repay waves, which equalized the chances of athletes.  The waves, hitting the sides, interfered with the swimmers who were on the extreme lanes, and after the innovation all were put in the same conditions.  It is possible that all these novelties have contributed to the establishment of more than eighty Olympic records. </p><p>  Well, the most memorable moment of all the competitions was the lighting of the Olympic flame, which broke out on completely new technologies.  These and many other Montreal Olympics 76 were remembered by the fans. </p>

    <h2>  But it could have been otherwise ... </h2><p>  Surprisingly, Moscow could become the mistress of the Olympics not in 1980, but four years earlier.  At one of the congresses of the World Olympic Committee, they chose a city that will host the main games of the four-year period in 1976.  There were three applicants: Montreal, Moscow and Los Angeles.  The capital of the USSR was considered the main favorite, the successes of Soviet athletes and the fact that the main country of the socialist bloc had not yet hosted such major competitions spoke in favor of Moscow. </p><p>  The first round of voting confirmed this.  Moscow scored 28 votes, Montreal had three less and only 17 votes were cast for the American city.  The two capitalist countries had to trick to get the Olympics. </p><p>  The American city starred in the second round, and all their votes went to Montreal instead of the United States.  Canada, in which the Olympics were scheduled for 1976, won.  Since countries from the socialist bloc dominated most sports, having proved their strength to the world, they rightfully received the honor to host the next Olympics.  But this is a completely different story ... </p>
