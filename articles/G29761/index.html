People say that there is simply great service.  It is impossible to even compare with the hotel service in Turkey.  The hotel certainly deserves its four stars.  The staff here are very polite, friendly and friendly.  You can leave a tip, but it is better to offer them personally, since the staff did not take the money ‚Äúin the tea‚Äù left in the room. </p><p>  But even without a tip, all hotel employees behave in a precautionary and inconspicuous manner.  The services of staff are always timely. </p><p>  The hotel stops a lot of British and Germans.  It is impossible to meet big noisy companies there, because the atmosphere of conservatism and peace is always maintained, and for many years. </p><p>  Very good food is noted by visitors to this tourist complex.  However, there are minor difficulties with the fact that the water pressure in the faucet in the room is not very strong.  In this case, this is a common problem throughout Cyprus.  Do not forget that this is still an island. </p>
