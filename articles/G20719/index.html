History of the Olympic motto</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For the first time, the Olympics gathered its spectators in 776 BC.  e.  Competitions athletes took place near Olympia on the island of Peloponnese.  An interesting fact is that during the games absolutely all the wars in the region stopped.  Ancient Greece for over a millennium watched this unique sporting spectacle.  The participants were warriors, men competing in running at a distance of about 192 meters (one stage) completely naked.  Because of this, women were not allowed into the stands, and they did not take part in competitions. </p><p>  The duration of the competition was only one day.  Gradually, the program of the Olympiad expanded.  First, two-stage running was added, then endurance running, pentathlon competitions, chariot running, pankration, fist fighting and others.  The decision to increase the duration of the games to five days was made in the fifth century BC.  e.  The 394 year was unlucky for the Olympians, the competitions were abolished due to incompatibility with Christianity.  After all, initially they were dedicated to Zeus and other gods from the sacred mountain.  It was possible to revive the games only in 1896 with the efforts and efforts of Pierre de Coubertin in a symbolic place - in Athens.  And since 1924, the Winter Olympics started. </p>

    <h2>  History of the motto ‚ÄúFaster, Higher, Stronger!‚Äù </h2><p>  The motto is the Latin expression ‚ÄúCitius, Altius, Fortius!‚Äù, Which literally means ‚ÄúFaster, Higher, Stronger!‚Äù  The authorship belongs to Henri Didon, director of the Theological College, a French priest.  During the start of sports in college, he tried to express as accurately and concisely as possible the desire for a fair fight, as well as the beneficial effects of sports on people.  Pierre de Coubertin really liked the Latin saying and when, in 1894, when the IOC (International Olympic Committee) was created, the question arose which <span>Olympic motto</span> would be officially approved, de Coubertin did not hesitate and suggested "Faster, Higher, Stronger."  The first IOC Bulletin of 1894 first used the slogan in its headline.  The official approval took place in 1913, and since 1920 it has become part of the Olympic emblem.  The motto was presented to the public during the VIII Summer Games in Paris only in 1924. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The unofficial principle of Olympic competitions </h2><p>  De Coubertin is also credited with creating the unofficial motto of the Olympics, which reads "The main thing is not victory, but participation."  In fact, these words were uttered by a bishop from Pennsylvania in 1908 during the London Olympics.  Participation was understood as empathy for an athlete who failed to win, but fought to the last with all his might.  Words were sent to Pietri Dorando, an Italian runner.  On the eve of Dorando, he was disqualified due to outside help at the finish line, which he did not ask for when he ran the marathon.  During the award ceremony, he still received a gold cup from a member of the <span>royal family</span> for his outstanding sporting achievement. </p><p>  Olympic motto ‚ÄúFaster, Higher, Stronger!‚Äù  extremely correctly and accurately reflects the aspirations of athletes around the world. </p>

    <h2>  The most memorable mottos </h2><p>  In addition to the generally accepted slogan, each country seeks to declare itself by the invented motto of its games.  One of the best so far is the motto of the Beijing Olympics (2008) - "One World, One Dream", translated - "One World, One Dream."  This is a reflection of the principle of unity.  It was made public in 2004 and over the next 4 years could not come up with anything better.  There were other interesting and catchy phrases.  In Vancouver (2010), for example, there were two mottos.  One of which is in English ("With Glowing Hearts"), and the second in French.  The literal translation is ‚ÄúWith Burning Hearts‚Äù.  The slogan of Sydney (2000) turned out to be memorable as well - ‚ÄúShare the spirit‚Äù and, of course, Salt Lake City (2002), which sounds like ‚ÄúLight the fire inside‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Two seasons of the Olympics, summer and winter mottos </h2><p>  <span>Winter Olympics are</span> much younger than summer ones.  They were first held in French Chamonix in 1924.  Until 1994, holding them coincided with the year of the Summer Olympics; after 1994, the interval was reduced to 2 years.  The motto of the Winter <span>Olympic Games</span> in Sochi (2014) consisted of a sequence of three words ‚ÄúHot.  Winter.  Yours. "  He talks about everyone's involvement in what is happening, about the intensity of the struggle and the time of the competition. </p>
