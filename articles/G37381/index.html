    <h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  The middle of the 20th century was remembered by many space race, the winner of which came the USSR.  In 1957, the first artificial satellite was created and launched, and a little later the first living creature visited space. </p><p>  Two years later, the artificial satellite of the Sun entered orbit, and a station called Luna-2 was able to appear on the surface of the Moon.  The legendary Squirrel and Strelka visited space only in 1960, and a year later a man also visited it. </p><p>  The year 1962 was remembered for the group flight of ships, and the year 1963 for the first time that a woman was in orbit.  Man managed to reach outer space two years later. </p>

    <p>  Scientific hypotheses do not deny the possible existence of universes like ours, but there is no evidence for this either.  In general, the cosmos is the universe, it is the world.  It is characterized by orderliness and materialization. </p><h2>  Learning process </h2><p>  The first in space were animals.  People were afraid, but wanted to explore unknown expanses, so they used dogs, pigs and monkeys as pioneers.  Some of them returned, some did not. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now people are actively exploring outer space.  It has been proven that weightlessness adversely affects human health.  It does not allow fluids to move in the right directions, which contributes to the loss of calcium in the body.  Also in space, people become somewhat plump, there are problems with the intestines and clogging of the nose. </p>

    <p>  In outer space, almost every person becomes ill with a "cosmic disease."  Its main symptoms are nausea, dizziness, headache.  A consequence of this disease is hearing problems. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Cosmos is that space in whose orbits one can observe the rising of the Sun about 16 times a day.  This, in turn, negatively affects biorhythms, and prevents normal sleep. </p><p>  Interestingly, the development of the toilet in space is a science.  Before this action begins to turn out perfectly, all cosmonauts train on the layout.  The technique is practiced over a certain period of time.  Scientists tried to organize a mini-toilet directly in the spacesuit itself, however, this did not work out.  Instead, ordinary diapers began to be used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Each astronaut after returning home for some time wonders why the objects fall down. </p>

    <p>  Not many people know why the first food in space was presented in tubes or briquettes.  In fact, swallowing food in outer space is a rather difficult task.  Therefore, food was pre-dehydrated to make this process more affordable. </p><p>  Interestingly, people who snore in space do not encounter this process.  An exact explanation of this fact is still difficult to give. </p><h2>  Death in space </h2><p>  Women who have enlarged their breasts by artificial means will never be able to discover outer space.  The explanation is simple - implants can explode.  Unfortunately, the lungs of any person can suffer the same fate if they find themselves in space without a spacesuit.  This will happen due to decompression.  The mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes simply boil. </p><h2>  Cosmos in ancient philosophy </h2><p>  Cosmos is a structural concept in philosophy, which is used to designate the world as a whole.  As a "peacebuilding" the definition was applied by Heraclitus more than 500 years ago BC.  This was supported by the pre-Socratics - Parmenides, Democritus, Anaxagoras and Empedocles. </p>

    <p>  Plato and Aristotle tried to show the cosmos as an extremely complete being, an innocent being, an aesthetic whole.  The perception of outer space was largely based on the mythology of the ancient Greeks. </p><p>  In his work ‚ÄúOn Heaven‚Äù Aristotle tries to compare these two concepts, to identify similarities and differences.  In the dialogue of Plato "Timaeus" a fine line is traced between the cosmos itself and its founder.  The philosopher argued that the cosmos arose successively from matter and ideas, and the creator put a soul into it, divided it into elements. </p><p>  The result was cosmos as a living creature with a mind.  He is one and beautiful, includes the soul and body of the world. </p><h2>  Space in the philosophy of the 19-20th centuries </h2><p>  The industrial revolution of modern times completely distorted previous versions of the perception of outer space.  A new ‚Äúmythology‚Äù was taken as the basis. </p><p>  At the turn of the century, a philosophical trend such as cubism arose.  In many ways, he embodied the laws, formulas, logical constructions, and idealizations of Greek Orthodox ideas, which, in turn, borrowed them from ancient philosophers.  Cubism is a good attempt to know a person as himself, the world, his place in the world, his vocation, to determine the basic values. </p><p>  <span>Russian cosmism</span> did not go far from ancient notions, but changed their root.  Now space is in philosophy something with design features that were based on the principles of Orthodox personalism.  Something historical and evolutionary.  Outer space can change for the better.  The basis was taken from biblical traditions. </p>

    <p>  Cosmos, in the view of philosophers of 19-20 years, combines art and religion, physics and metaphysics, knowledge of the world and human nature. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  We can make a logical conclusion that the cosmos is that space, which is a single whole.  Philosophical and scientific ideas about him are of the same nature, with the exception of only ancient times.  The theme of "space" has always been in demand and enjoyed healthy curiosity among people. </p><p>  Now the universe is still fraught with many mysteries and secrets that you and I have yet to solve.  Each person who finds himself in space discovers something new and unusual for himself and for all mankind, introduces everyone to his sensations. </p><p>  Outer space is a combination of various matters or objects.  Some of them are closely studied by scientists, and the nature of others is generally incomprehensible. </p>
