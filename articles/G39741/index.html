Town Hall Decorating the City</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The charming <span>capital of Belgium</span> with an interesting history is among the major cultural <span>centers of Europe.</span>  The ancient city is of great interest to tourists who will fully appreciate the wealth of architectural heritage.  Each passing era left its mark, and the central square is considered the heart of Brussels from the Middle Ages. </p><p>  Grand Place is not in vain called the most elegant in Europe.  Without exaggeration, the buildings surrounding it with a square are considered to be real masterpieces of world architecture.  The historical center that arose on the site of dried swamps, included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, is famous for the city hall Hotel de Ville, which occupies most of the square. </p><h2>  Popular tourist attraction </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a building that embodies the importance of a shopping center in medieval Europe came to the city authorities a long time ago, but only in the 15th century did the construction of a magnificent architectural ensemble begin, which has long adorned Brussels.  The Town Hall, considered the oldest building in the square, is a popular tourist attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brussels Town Hall Interesting Facts" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1352634.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  Asymmetrical building </h2><p>  Well-preserved after enemy attacks and numerous fires, the building is crowned with a high sentinel tower, located not in the middle.  However, this is not a mistake, but the result of the fact that several architects were engaged in construction at different times. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most <span>beautiful building of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãwas erected in several passes.  The left part with the bell tower was built in 1420, after 30 years the right side appeared, which initially turned out to be slightly shorter than the old one, and in 1455 a tower 96 meters high appeared.  The Brussels Town Hall is therefore interesting because its building turned out to be asymmetrical.  At the end of the 18th century, two baroque hind wings appeared. </p><h2>  Interesting decor </h2><p>  A five-meter-high figure of the archangel Michael, which protects Brussels from troubles, is crowned with gold openwork spire of the tower.  The town hall, recognized as a historical and architectural monument, acquired its current form in the 19th century, when it was restored, and then many sculptural objects were added: here you can see the images of saints, horseback riders, heroes of ancient legends, rulers of the Middle Ages, drunken monks.  But it is best to once admire the decor with your own eyes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brussels town hall" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1352646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Architectural pearl </h2><p>  The interior is amazing with special beauty.  Tourists die out at the sight of tapestries woven with golden threads, luxurious mirrors with wooden carvings, paintings by famous artists.  There is also a magnificent hall in which memorable weddings take place.  Therefore, many lovers who want to celebrate wedding ceremonies outside the box come to Brussels for positive emotions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Place" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1352630.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The town hall, which has historical value, is known for the fact that its architecture harmoniously combines two areas: Gothic and classical styles.  This is especially noticeable in the interior decoration of the building, in which to this day there are meetings of the city council.  For example, officials sit in rooms made in the spirit of the ‚Äúsun king‚Äù, and halls for weddings and official events are decorated in a neo-Gothic style. </p><p>  The aerial-looking building used as the residence of the mayor is available for excursions.  Tourists, having heard about the architectural pearl and dreaming of getting acquainted with a work of art, rush to hospitable Brussels every year. </p><h2>  Town Hall: interesting facts </h2><ul><li>  The fountains in the courtyard represent the two main rivers of Belgium. </li><li>  The most popular Gothic creatures of the town hall are gargoyles.  They are often confused with chimeras, since the differences between these monsters are very arbitrary.  This is not just an element of architectural design that performs artistic functions: frightening creatures with a monkey body and wings cover the drains of the structure or themselves remove moisture through an open mouth. </li><li>  Every even year, from mid-August, an observation deck opens, from which the city appears in full view.  A wonderful panorama cannot be missed if you want to enjoy the elegant beauty of ancient Brussels.  It was then that huge carpets of fresh flowers flourished in the square.  A delightful sight attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world. </li></ul>
