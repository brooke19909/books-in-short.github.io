Rest here has several advantages: the absence of a large number of vacationers, a clean sea and a beach, quite affordable prices.  In the village there are night clubs, a cafe, a restaurant.  Families with children will be pleased with the show programs in the dolphinarium and relaxation in the water park.  There are also sights here, the main of which are a mud lake and an active mud volcano, from time to time frightening vacationers who have arrived in the village for the first time. </p>
