In summer, there is the same influx of tourists as in the best resorts in Italy or Greece, so if someone else underestimates Abkhazia, then it's time to start respecting it.  Reviews about holidays in Abkhazia are divided into two categories: one half of tourists praises the country and tries to persuade domestic travelers not to spend money on obtaining a visa for holidays in practical similar conditions, the other half, on the contrary, scolds and enthusiastically lists all the disadvantages of vacation in this country. </p><p>  Well, do not guess and believe various rumors.  Let us independently familiarize ourselves with numerous reviews about holidays in Abkhazia, the main attractions and popular resorts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uenews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coast of Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2336706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2336706.jpg"></div><h2>  Regions and resorts of Abkhazia </h2><p>  Geographically, the country is divided into seven zones of almost equal area: Gagra, Gudautsky, Sukhumi, Gulrypshsky, Ochamchyrsky, Tkuarchalsky and Galsky districts.  If you are going to rest in this beautiful country, regardless of the choice of the region, you will be able to catch both a piece of the coast and enchanting mountain peaks. </p><p>  Abkhazia is rightfully a historical region of the Western Caucasus, it borders with the Russian Federation in the north and Georgia in the south.  The Abkhaz coast with a length of about 200 km is washed by the waters of the Black Sea, but this is not the main attraction of the country.  Here, no less developed type of recreation is skiing.  The country is spread out in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains sparkling with dazzling white snow. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate of Abkhazia </h2><p>  The climate in Abkhazia is truly beautiful.  The swimming season usually begins in mid-May and lasts through October.  The most favorable time for relaxing in this country is considered to be the middle of summer and the beginning of autumn, when the so-called velvet season begins. </p><p>  Snow always lies on the peaks of the Caucasus Mountains, therefore, in addition to beach vacations, the country has a well-developed ski resort, and excursions to climb mountain areas are popular. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the fact that it is in Abkhazia that the warmest place on the entire Black Sea coast is located - Gagra.  In winter, the air temperature on the coast does not drop below zero, which contributes to a comfortable pastime on land. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turgo.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The nature of Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2336747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2336747.jpg"></div><h2>  Do I need a visa? </h2><p>  Another reason why holidays in Abkhazia, according to domestic tourists, is very much appreciated is the lack of a visa.  For citizens of the Russian Federation, as well as several other countries, it is enough to simply present documents at the customs checkpoint, declare currency and other things. </p><h2>  How to get to Abkhazia? </h2><p>  It so happened that Abkhazia has a very good geographical location in relation to Russia.  You can get to the territory of the southern fairy tale in several ways at once: by plane, by train or by personal transport.  Unfortunately, the first two options provide for a mandatory transplant in Sochi, but the direct route exists only by car.  For this reason, quite large traffic jams can be observed when crossing the border. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you travel by train, then in most cases, travelers depart from Adler‚Äôs station, where it‚Äôs close to the border.  Customs control is carried out directly in train cars, and the fare varies in the region of 1000 rubles per person. </p><p>  Also in season, sea ferries are launched from Adler, the fare is 500 rubles.  The main disadvantage of this option is that it is seasonal and irregular, so you should know everything in advance before planning your route. </p><p>  Let us now go directly to the main resorts of this wonderful country, for which it is worth coming here. </p><h2>  Gagra </h2><p>  As we already managed to say, rest in Abkhazia on the sea is one of the main reasons for visiting this state.  Gagra is the first city that every tourist passes when crossing the international border.  This is a picturesque resort located just a few kilometers from Sochi Airport in a quiet and calm bay.  In the summer, sea water here warms up to 28 degrees, and the swimming season lasts until November.  Gagra is an ideal place for <span>families with children in Abkhazia,</span> because it has a well-developed infrastructure: water parks, entertainment, many family cafes and, of course, all this against the backdrop of beautiful nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="komanda-k.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gagra Coast" class="if uuid-2336729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2336729.jpg"></div><h2>  Pitsunda </h2><p>  No less popular among domestic tourists is Pitsunda.  Honestly, this settlement is difficult to call a city, rather, just a village, but what a!  It is located in a picturesque place on the edge, away from the main highway, extending inland.  It is believed that it is here that the cleanest sea on the entire Black Sea coast is confirmed by the presence of dolphins.  They can often be seen here in fine weather.  Pitsunda is surrounded around a pine grove, which is considered the official territory of the Pitsunda-M√ºsser Reserve. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pitsunda in Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2336733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2336733.jpg"></div><h2>  New Athos </h2><p>  Just think about this name.  Feel how magnificent it sounds?  This is the main pilgrimage center of Abkhazia.  Tourists should go here to see important sights, natural monuments and history.  It is here that the famous New Athos Monastery, the grotto and the temple of the Apostle Simon Kananit and other religious monuments are located.  Of particular interest is a vacation in Abkhazia in the summer, and more precisely in New Athos.  Therefore, if you have the opportunity to visit this wonderful country, do not miss your chance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.votpusk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery in New Athos" class="if uuid-2336736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2336736.jpg"></div><h2>  Gudauta </h2><p>  Another resort town located near Gagra.  Here the holiday season lasts all year long.  Why is Gudauta so popular?  Perhaps because the resort is located in a peaceful bay with a predominance of conifers and citrus plants.  There is a beautiful city park, and the sea bay is bordered by a gravel beach, which helps to maintain the purity of the underwater world. </p><h2>  Sukhum </h2><p>  So, in the end, we will talk about the capital of Abkhazia - the city of Sukhum.  Here, like nowhere else in the state, a beach vacation is superbly developed, there are many hotels with excellent infrastructure, a large private sector for budget holidays.  In addition, if we talk about holidays in Abkhazia in sanatoriums, then there are a huge number of them.  Sukhumi is famous for its nature, clean beaches and, of course, therapeutic rest with many wellness treatments. </p><p>  Here, every tourist will find entertainment.  The city is known for its beautiful botanical garden, a monkey nursery, and a state museum.  Also in Sukhum, you can take a look at the Glory Park, built in memory of the heroes of the 1992-1993 war.  Getting to the city will not be difficult, for example, a direct train "Moscow - Sukhumi" regularly runs from Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="titan-race.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital is the city of Sukhum" class="if uuid-2336726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2336726.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Park Hotel "King Bagrat Mountain" is a complete complex with unique architecture.  They offer a wide range of services, ranging from the European level of service to a high level of security.  It will be interesting for both adults and children. </p><p>  The hotel is located in Sukhum at the address: st.  Jelia, 14. </p><p>  Beautiful and cozy design decoration of the rooms boasts <span>the Abaata</span> 4 * <span>hotel</span> in Gagra.  It has everything you need - a huge territory, beautiful decor, inexpensive rooms. </p><p>  An excellent option for relaxing in the private sector can be Amra Guest House.  This guest house is located in Pitsunda at 16/2 Agrba Street.  The house has 15 rooms, its own spacious territory, parking spaces and much more. </p><h2>  Rest in Abkhazia.  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The entire modern network is replete with numerous reviews of people resting on the territory of this wonderful state.  Probably, in the world there is no place that would be answered exclusively in a positive way.  Abkhazia is a country of contrasts: picturesque nature, well-groomed beaches, but at times rude attitude, unfriendliness and lack of high quality service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="businessvisit.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Abkhazia" class="if uuid-2336748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2336748.jpg"></div><p>  Separate attention should be paid to living space.  Holidays in Abkhazia in hotels are very popular, but you can only talk about quality service regarding 4- or 5-star complexes.  Many travelers complain about the inconsistency of the pictures stated on the hotel website with reality. </p><p>  If you plan to spend a beautiful vacation at the hotel, then it is better to overpay for quality or choose an alternative option.  For example, rest in Abkhazia in the private sector.  Do not underestimate this type of pastime.  Vacationers always have their own kitchen, bathroom, and the appearance of some rooms can seriously compete with hotel rooms.  Plus, there is a kitchen, which significantly reduces the additional cost of food in cafes and restaurants.  Sometimes the private sector for recreation in Abkhazia becomes the best solution. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Abkhazia is a great place for a long-awaited vacation.  To visit this country you just need to purchase tickets and book a hotel room, no paperwork with registration of permission to enter the country is required.  It is also worth noting the fact that there is no need to make a money transfer, since the country accepts the Russian ruble, and this, in turn, again simplifies the situation. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.0015544" data-lng="41.02340700000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/0/6/1606.png"></div><p>  The tourism industry is well developed in the country: various excursions, water parks, jeeping, parachuting - all this will leave an indelible impression in your memory, and photos about holidays with children in Abkhazia will periodically remind you of a great time. </p><p>  We hope that our article has helped you form your own opinion about this country.  Listening to people's opinions is sometimes useful, but still the best way to make sure the information is true is to check for yourself.  Therefore, do not be shy: find out for yourself what a summer vacation in Abkhazia is like.  Have a nice trip and new discoveries! </p>
