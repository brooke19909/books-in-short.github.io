    <p>  Two-and three-story buildings began to be built in cities, more often stone houses were built.  A characteristic feature of the construction was a rich decorative finish. </p><h2>  Education and Enlightenment </h2><p>  Although education and culture in the 17th century in Russia developed at an unprecedented rate, most people remained illiterate, although there were more literate among the townspeople.  In Moscow, primers were in good demand.  There are many books translated into Russian.  Some people began to collect and store books. </p><p>  It was no longer enough just to learn literacy, arithmetic and writing.  State and economic activity became more complicated, there was a need for educated people who possess knowledge in various fields.  But education and culture in the 17th century met stubborn resistance from the noble nobility and the clergy, which were conservative.  Meanwhile, in Moscow there were more and more private schools.  And in 1687, the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy became the first higher educational institution in Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 1621, for the king and his entourage, the hand-written newspaper "Courants" was published, which described the latest events that took place in other countries.  Books in which secular knowledge was communicated were not accessible to everyone. </p>

    <p>  Knowledge in medicine was based on the experience of treatment.  Although spread "herbalists" (a description of the medicinal properties of plants) and translated textbooks. </p><p>  In 1678, the history of the Russian state was printed, the narration in the Synopsis begins from ancient times until the 70s of the 17th century. </p><h2>  Geographic expansion </h2><p>  Geographical knowledge, like education and culture in the 17th century, has been steadily developing.  <span>Russian explorers,</span> such as Semyon Dezhnev (made an expedition to the strait between North America and Asia in 1648), <span>E. Khabarov</span> (made a map of lands along the Amur River in 1649, later Russian settlements formed there), V. Atlasov (conducted a survey of the Kuril islands and Kamchatka), made a huge contribution to the expansion of geography.  Based on all this knowledge, maps of the Russian state, Ukraine and Siberia were developed. </p><h2>  Literature </h2><p>  Education and culture in the 17th century in Russia led to the emergence of new genres in literature.  They began to write not only about the rich, but also about ordinary people.  A satire appeared, the objects of which were the church and the gentlemen.  In this century, versification and dramaturgy arose.  Simeon Polotsky was their founder, as he was the author of plays at the court of Alexei Mikhailovich. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  At this time, for the first time recorded proverbs, folk songs, sayings.  Folklore has firmly penetrated all areas of culture.  The widespread distribution of Western literature translated into our language. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Monumental churches began to be replaced by small Posad churches, which were amazed by the play of volumes and colors, elegant, lively, covered with many patterns.  Under the influence of Belarus and Ukraine in the last decades of the 17th century, the style of Moscow Baroque spread in architecture.  His main idea was the proportionality of the whole composition and magnificent decorative finishes.  Much attention was paid to the creation of bell towers and tiers.  Concluding, we can say that the education and culture of the 17th century affected the appearance of cities, making them even more beautiful. </p><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  Education and culture in the 17th century contributed to the development of painting.  Artists began to show their attention to the human person.  Although icon painting has reached an unprecedented hitherto mastery, portraiture arose.  Its founder is <span>Simon Ushakov.</span> </p>

    <p>  The Armory has become a center of fine art; it was located in the Moscow Kremlin.  Both Russian and foreign artists worked in it.  In their work, they tried to achieve great similarity with nature.  In the 70s, the ‚ÄúTitular‚Äù was created - this is a collection of portraits of rulers, from Rurik to Peter Alekseevich, portraits of foreign patriarchs and kings were also contained there, as well as coats of arms of different countries. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Changes began in Russia, education and culture changed in the 17th century.  The 7th grade of the school is the time when this layer of our history is being studied, which has become a turning point for Russian culture.  Frequent <span>popular movements,</span> wars, events of the Time of Troubles made it clear to the people that he was able to participate in his fate.  World outlook has changed, broadened horizons.  There was a forward movement in all areas, a need for education and training of qualified personnel was revealed. </p>
