    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In the brochures about the base ‚ÄúFactory of rest‚Äù (Barnaul) it is written beautifully.  But for some reason, the rating of this wonderful place is only 1.5, much lower!  The holidaymakers here in 2015 have such complaints to the base: </p><p>  - inflated prices for accommodation and services; </p><p>  - dirty in the area; </p><p>  - only two working toilets on the street, also dirty; </p><p>  - in houses it is not cleaned, beds are not the first freshness; </p><p>  - the furniture in many houses is old, cabinets with torn doors, garbage on canopies; </p><p>  - the food is not very tasty; </p><p>  - the water in the pools is dirty, unsuitable for swimming; </p><p>  - too expensive payment for the use of barbecue (1 hour - 500 rubles); </p><p>  - uncomfortable access to the base; </p><p>  - unfriendly staff; </p><p>  - a guide that does not pay attention to complaints of vacationers. </p><p>  Among the noted advantages: </p><p>  - a beautiful spacious area; </p><p>  - the ability in some cases to terminate the lease and collect the money. </p><p>  Reviews are a subjective opinion.  And you decide in any case. </p>
