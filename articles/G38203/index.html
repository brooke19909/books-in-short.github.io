The developer is the company "Land of Muscovy."  The fate of the complex is still unknown.  Owners of apartments not yet built in the residential complex “Birch Grove” continue to assert their rights.  At the moment, they have set up a tent camp in which they live. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Tent city in LCD" class="if uuid-2853443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2853443.jpg"></div><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  The residential complex was built in the town of Ramenskoye, near Moscow.  The residential complex “Birch Grove” in Ramenskoye is located between Oktyabrskaya and Berezovaya clearing.  The monolithic-block building of the economy class was originally planned, it included 14 buildings.  The height of each house in the Ramenskoye residential complex “Birch Grove” is 3 floors.  Also, 27 plots in it were reserved for individual development. </p><p>  The prices were attractive and the selection was wide.  Were in the LCD "Birch Grove" in Ramenskoye studio apartments, apartments with 1-3 rooms.  Their area ranged from 18 to 87 square meters.  Many people liked the layout of the LCD "Birch Grove".  The change was planned without finishing.  Each dwelling provides for the installation of double-glazed windows, metal doors, heating radiators, waterproofing bathrooms.  The layout of the apartments in the residential complex "Birch Grove" in Ramenskoye also provided for the presence of glazed loggias. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD project" class="if uuid-2853441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2853441.jpg"></div><p>  A kindergarten, a sports stadium, shops, and many service organizations were planned on the territory of the complex.  In addition to apartments in the residential complex “Birch Grove”, an open parking lot for 1250 cars was also provided.  In addition, 95 places were provided by a garage cooperative.  The yard was supposed to be equipped with playgrounds, lighting, lowered sidewalks for people with disabilities.  The area around the houses of the residential complex “Birch Grove” in Ramenskoye was supposed to be landscaped - it was planned to plant trees and shrubs. </p><h2>  About Territory </h2><p>  The residential complex "Birch Grove" is located in the town of Ramenskoye, located 30 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  By car they reach him on Novoryazanskoye or Yegoryevskoye highway.  Shuttle taxis and electric trains run from the city to the capital of Russia.  Nearby is the metro station "Zhulebino". </p><p>  Only 400 meters from the residential complex “Birch Grove” in Ramenskoye there is a grove, the Dergaevka River flows 900 meters from it.  The construction was carried out in a favorable ecological environment, surrounded by picturesque places. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  According to official studies, the soil in the Moscow Region city is practically uncontaminated, the content of harmful substances in the air is at an average level.  However, Ramenskoye has a high level of pollution of water bodies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is important to consider that there are no harmful industries in Ramenskoye, however, its active development is taking place.  Therefore, there is a lot of construction waste in the air.  Also in the city there are many traffic jams, accidents, natural parking.  Roads do not cope with the flow of cars. </p><p>  The railway tracks passing through the city, as well as the nearby airfield, create a lot of noise.  Takeoff and landing of planes is heard constantly.  During construction, green spaces disappear, and the wind brings smoke and exhaust from the South-Eastern Administrative District to the city.  However, the residential complex is located closer to the outskirts of the city, and there is a forest nearby. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Residential complex “Birch Grove” in Ramenskoye is located far from the city center, but infrastructure is developed around it.  So, just 190 meters from the complex is a school, in the same vicinity there is a shop.  Only 400 meters from the building is a clinic.  There are cafes nearby and the distance to the center of Ramenskoye is 1.7 km.  It is also important that the territory of the residential complex “Birch Grove” in Ramenskoye, the developer decided to make protected. </p><p>  All these features attracted many young families who liked the new complex.  Interest holders quickly bought up the apartments of the residential complex "Birch Grove" from the developer. </p><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The developer of the residential complex “Birch Grove” in Ramenskoye - “Lands of Muscovy”.  It has been registered since 2010.  In legal form, this is an open joint-stock company with an initial authorized capital of about 511 million rubles. </p><p>  The main activity is the provision of financial services, excluding pensions and insurance.  Also among the directions stood out: operations related to land, real estate, construction of buildings, mediation in property valuation, legal services in real estate, real estate services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Until 2013, the developer did not participate in the construction.  However, then he began to build the residential complex "Birch Grove" in Ramenskoye.  Reviews of residents who have not settled in the purchased apartments prove the dishonesty of the developer. </p><p>  It is known that with the start of proceedings in this case, the developer was observed.  As a result, the director general of Land of Muscovy, S. Bubnov, was sentenced to 9 years in a maximum security colony on charges of embezzlement of 600,000,000 rubles.  The company "Land of Muscovy" was declared bankrupt. </p><h2>  History development </h2><p>  Back in 2016, according to reviews, LCD "Birch Grove" began to show the first signs of long-term construction.  Then control over the situation was assumed by the regional ministry of construction.  However, this had no effect on her.  And the developer lived up to the worst expectations of interest holders, which were expressed at the first presentations of the complex.  The company "Land of Muscovy" had no experience, and the acquisition of apartments from it was fraught with risk. </p><p>  Already in 2016, construction was stopped, and the deadline was postponed.  According to residents, in the residential complex “Birch Grove” some of the houses were supposed to be commissioned in 2015.  However, at first the deadline was postponed to 2016, and then no shifts occurred until 2018.  And it is obvious that the current dates are completely unknown.  No construction work is underway at the complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Unfinished house" class="if uuid-2853446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2853446.jpg"></div><p>  When the noise around this story rose, the developer back in 2014 renamed the project “Ramenskie Alley”.  "Muscovy Land" joined the new group of companies, but the construction did not resume.  At that moment, the news ceased to be published on the Birch Grove website, and the Ramensky Alleys website did not work at all.  Photos of the residential complex “Birch Grove” were not published, and the owners of the residential areas of the complex remained in the information vacuum.  The only way to get information about the construction for them was to visit the construction site. </p><p>  However, soon the interest holders of the residential complex "Birch Grove" established contacts with each other, creating a separate site.  In desperation, they turned to the city and regional authorities, everywhere they sent out their calls to sort out the situation. </p><p>  At that moment, the authorities expressed their readiness to meet them.  She expressed her vision of solving the problem: developing a new project for a complex with a large number of apartments.  And it was due to their sale that funds should have appeared for the completion of the entire complex.  4 buildings had already begun to build, now they were planned to be demolished.  The builders believed that in economic terms it would be more profitable to erect buildings anew than to continue working on walls that had stood idle for years.  Nevertheless, despite promises by the authorities to regulate the process, work has not begun.  There is still no certainty in the fate of equity holders and the complex.  The purchase of apartments here has remained a very risky undertaking.  There is still hope for a new project, but no one imagined it either. </p><p>  Meanwhile, Ramenskoye is actively building up, and there are many more successful alternatives to the problem complex in the city. </p><h2>  More about the story </h2><p>  Back in 2017, information appeared that the developer had ceased its activities in the lawsuit of the Ministry of Construction of the Moscow Region.  Throughout the year, he could not attract new customers to build houses.  At that time, the company went through bankruptcy proceedings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Unfinished houses" class="if uuid-2853440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2853440.jpg"></div><p>  2 applications with a total amount of 1,524,011 rubles were submitted to the register of creditors on Zemly Moskovii.  So it was found out that the company was not going to resuscitate the developer, and also did not pay taxes.  Later, the sum of the claims of all applicants for the developer amounted to about 75,000,000 rubles. </p><p>  More than once, meetings were held on this topic with the Governor of the Moscow Region, Vorobyov Andrei Yuryevich.  The Ramensky administration, district and regional officials were also attracted to them. </p><p>  On March 26, 2016, a meeting was held at the construction site of the residential complex “Birch Grove”, in which Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Region G.V. Yelyanyushkin participated.  Also present was the administration of Ramensky, representatives of the developer of the “Land of Muscovy”. </p><p>  There was a discussion of the problems that developed around the housing estate, and ways to solve them were discussed.  Then a statement was made that the developer suggested increasing the number of floors in the houses. </p><p>  Then the position was expressed that the problems concerned the old developer and the convict S. I. Bubnov. But a new developer was already appointed with a new concept, increased footage, which supposedly was to solve the problem.  The governor promised to approve the concept, which should have been submitted to the Interdepartmental Commission of the Moscow Region Government. </p><p>  At this commission, the issue related to the houses of RC “Birch Grove” was considered.  A new concept was put forward, the legal aspect of the issue was considered.  Vorobyov commented on the idea, clarified certain provisions.  As a result, it was decided to take into account the comments of the commission.  The Ministry of Construction was to send them after 14 days.  The revised concept should again be considered at a meeting of the commission.  It was supposed to be held on August 11, 2016. </p><p>  As a result, the new project was approved by the commission.  Next, documents were submitted to the office of the Ministry of Construction of the Ministry of Defense, so that it would be considered by the Interdepartmental Commission and the Town Planning Council of the Moscow Region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="News in the interest holders group" class="if uuid-2853444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2853444.jpg"></div><p>  The developer in letters to equity holders emphasized that he was carrying out large-scale work in order to resume construction at the facility.  Representatives of the company “Lands of Muscovy” discussed cooperation with the administration of Ramenskoye, the Ministry of the construction complex of the Moscow region, as stressed in her address to equity holders, the general director of “Lands of Muscovy” Tolstykh V.V. Audit and compilation of a register of all participants in shared construction of a residential complex . </p><h2>  Updated plan </h2><p>  When the leadership of the developer changed in 2015, the roadmap for the construction of the facility was updated and agreed with the Urban Planning Council of the Moscow Region.  The plan was planned for the following indicators: 722 people receive 28,000 square meters of living space.  All 14 houses are commissioned in 2020. </p><p>  Data was published according to which work on the construction of the complex’s houses began.  It was planned to complete the construction of the first house by November 2017, and another 7 houses in April 2018.  However, this did not happen. </p><h2>  For now </h2><p>  As of the end of September 2018, interest holders of the residential complex “Birch Grove” in Ramenskoye set up a camp near the unfinished objects.  For 8 years they had been expecting to move here and were never heard.  Although the developer was declared bankrupt, the general director was sentenced to 9 years in a maximum security colony, construction has not yet been declared a problem object. </p><p>  Interest holders said they would live in a tent camp until the issue was resolved.  On the houses of the residential complex "Birch Grove", the construction of which was once begun, but not completed, there are posters with calls to the authorities.  All deceived equity holders more than 700 people.  At the moment, dozens of families live in tents. </p><p>  They set up a common kitchen and eat all together.  Since there is not enough space, they approach the table in turn.  For families with children they made cabins. </p><p>  Among the residents of the camp there are many who bought apartments of the residential complex “Birch Grove” for a penalty.  People went into debt to be left with nothing.  This happened with Alexei and Irina, who invested 2,000,000 rubles into the apartment.  During the time the complex was “being built”, they already had 2 children.  They appealed to all kinds of authorities to be heard. </p><p>  At the moment, money holders have disappeared to nowhere.  The validity of the building permit has expired.  The Ramensky administration has more than 100 applications with requests to recognize the object as problematic.  But rejection came to all of them.  And deceived equity holders plan to go to court. </p><p>  The deputy head of the administration of the Ramensky district, Nikolai Vorobyov, announced that for the construction it is necessary to find a new investor.  But since it is not there, the construction and commissioning period remains uncertain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Calls for unfinished" class="if uuid-2853445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2853445.jpg"></div><p>  There are families that are waiting for replenishment and recognize that they do not have money left for a rented apartment.  During the years of waiting for the housing they bought, they spent their money and now live in tents. </p><p>  It is known that 3 interest holders have already died while waiting for their apartments. </p><h2>  On the struggle of interest holders </h2><p>  Interest holders themselves declare that, actively fighting for their rights, they came to the conclusion that their problem is being hushed up on purpose.  Or people working in government agencies that do not correspond to their positions. </p><p>  They note that the current situation has been repeatedly distorted by officials, and Governor A. Yu. Vorobyov ignores the problem.  It was he who promised to take control of the facility, but since 2013 construction has not been carried out.  Moreover, LCDs have not yet been included in the register of problematic objects, despite repeated statements. </p><p>  According to equity holders, they found out that during the construction of the object in 2011-2012, the builder did not have a building permit.  In 2013, the work was frozen.  In June of that year, the developer received a building permit.  Already at that time, it became clear that the money of interest holders was stolen, and the object will not be completed.  Despite active appeals to the prosecutor’s office, the administration of Ramensky, the Ministry of Construction of the Moscow Region, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs from interest holders, they all answered that they did not reveal a single illegal action from the builder. </p><p>  And he continued for 2 years the sale of apartments, during marketing campaigns on the Internet, reviews of real interest holders about the freezing of construction were deleted and refuted, as a result, the theft of money continued.  At the same time, construction work has not been carried out at the facility since 2013. </p><p>  In 2015, new owners appeared in the “Lands of Muscovy”, declaring that the previous owner was to blame for everything.  Construction resumed in the summer of 2015, apartment sales started again, but it lasted 2 months.  Since then, no construction work has been carried out at the facility, and so for almost 4 years. </p><p>  Interest holders found that the new owners at the time of their statements did not have the funds to invest.  Under no circumstances would they be able to complete the LCD.  Despite all this, they were supported by the Ramensky administration, as well as the government of the Moscow region. </p><p>  The financial viability of the new owners, who made high-profile statements and continued the previous business, stealing money, was obviously either not checked by officials, or their situation suited.  In 2017, only the first owner of the developer was convicted. </p><p>  Although real estate investors actively requested the verification of the actions of the new owners, all instances, including the prosecutor’s office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ramensky administration, the Ministry of Construction of the Moscow Region, stated that they had not found a single illegal action. </p><p>  And at this time, the sale of apartments was carried out, while the funds were not directed to the construction of the facility.  As a result, the amount of funds stolen from the facility increased.  As a result, after the omission of the Ministry of Construction of the Moscow Region, the “Lands of Muscovy” went through bankruptcy proceedings. </p><p>  In 2017, when a court decision was made to terminate the activities of the developer, equity holders of the housing complex were included in the register of persons whose rights were violated. </p><p>  In 2016, the governor of Moscow Region Vorobyov declared that the object was taken under his control.  Throughout the year, meetings were constantly held with the participation of equity holders, representatives of the Ministry of Construction of the Moscow Region, the city administration, and the Government of the Moscow Region.  And the term for the resumption of construction work was constantly postponed.  In 2016, a new construction plan was approved with a triple increase in living space (from 50,000 square meters to 150,000).  The houses were supposed to start surrendering in 2017.  But the developer did not have money, construction did not begin.  And the personal control of the governor did not appear in anything.  Questions were forwarded to the Ministry of Construction. </p><p>  2014  « »       ,          ,   :       9 ,           . </p><p>    ,     ,      –        .       . </p><p>  ,  ,     № 451-  19  2018     .             .       ,   .                   . </p><p> According to the testimonies of real estate investors, in April 2017, a tractor and two dozen workers appeared at the facility, who simulated work for photographs over the course of a day.  After that, on the website of the Ministry of Construction of the Ministry of Defense and in the media, news was published that construction at the facility was resumed. </p><p>  However, interest holders themselves have been filming the object for a month, clearly demonstrating that no construction was carried out.  They sent the captured material personally to Governor Vorobyov A. Yu. But there was no reaction to this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Governor of MO" class="if uuid-2853455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2853455.jpg"></div><p>  It is noted that at the moment the object is profitable, according to preliminary calculations for the LCD project.  But the profit is not big, why investors are not interested in the object.  It is enough for the MO government to give a small bonus to investors - to allocate a compensation plot, to pay for a social purpose facility, and the investor will be interested. </p><p>  There are no other problems that could arise at the facility, since due to the bankruptcy of the developer it was released from any obligations, excluding apartments for equity holders. </p><h2>  How can I get to </h2><p>  Minibuses No. 51 and No. 72 go from the Zhulebino metro station, from the ground transportation stop on General Kuznetsov Street. To get on them, you need to go to the even side of the street.  You need to follow to the stop "Experimental Field".  Then transfer to minibus No. 424 and follow to the Derkayevskaya Street station.  After leaving public transport, go along Derkayevskaya Street towards Priborostroiteley Street, and then onto Oktyabrskaya.  On the right side you will see unfinished houses of the Birch Grove residential complex. </p><p>  When driving from the Moscow Ring Road, they go along the Novoryazanskoye Highway, then turning onto the "M5 Zhukovsky" highway.  She goes to Tupolev street.  From it they turn to Gagarin Street, and then to Electrification Street.  Then they turn to Gastello Street, along which they move up to Pine Street, and then to Narodnaya Street.  There is a roundabout on it, along which they go to Cosmonauts Street.  She goes to the Northern highway.  Moving along it, then turn to the Doninsky highway, and then to Derkayevskaya street.  From it turn onto the street Priborostroiteley, and then move down to October street.  On the right side will be the desired housing complex. </p>
