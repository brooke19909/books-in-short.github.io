During operation, such devices not only differ in their characteristic bright light and original design, but also in durability and energy-saving function.  It is thanks to the last two qualities that LEDs are actively distributed in the fields of industry and housing and communal services.  Especially popular is the LED lamp for housing and communal services with a motion sensor that automatically turns on and off, which also affects energy savings. </p>

    <h2>  What objects are illuminated in the housing and communal services complex? </h2><p>  The public services sector includes an extensive list of zones.  The adjacent territory covers access entrances, facades, landscape design objects, etc. Street lamps of various degrees of power can be used here, depending on the area.  For individual decorative elements, LED backlighting is used, although most often practical solutions are applied without adjusting for the decorative value. </p><p>  In addition to the adjoining territory, communal infrastructure includes stairwells, flights, technical and office premises.  If LED streetlights are designed to provide light in a wide range, then inside buildings, devices are guided by local radiation.  At the same time, the devices themselves can have a different design - for example, ceiling, wall, built-in.  Miniature lamps are also used to illuminate information plates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of lamps for courtyards and porches </h2><p>  Special requirements are imposed on devices for lighting public utilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Street lights" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1664279.jpg" width="300"></div>  First of all, this is a high class of external security.  It is recommended to use luminaires with <span>protection class IP65-IP68.</span>  The most stringent requirements for this parameter are provided for external devices.  So, <span>LED street lights</span> must be isolated from heavy rain, snow and wind.  All models designed for use in accessible places receive an anti-vandal housing.

    <p>  Luminaires for porches and technical rooms are provided with special protection against dust and aggressive environments.  Design developers also increase the strength of attachment mechanisms and anti-vibration protection systems.  At the same time, both street lamps and indoor appliances must have a high operational resource.  This requirement is due to the interests of cost savings in the periodic replacement of lamps. </p><h2>  Luminaire selection options </h2>

If ordinary room lamps work with a power potential of 6-10 watts, then for the needs of housing and communal services, the optimal value will be in the range of 10-15 watts.  As for the voltage, it is standard - usually a 220 V LED lamp is used, although there are exceptions.  It is important to consider that there may be voltage drops.  The risk of damage to the lamp as a result of such surges can be eliminated either by choosing a device with an extended range of voltage indicators, or by means of a stabilizing unit.  Next, the amount of luminous flux is selected.  Again, for domestic use, users are limited to average values ‚Äã‚Äãof 500-700 Lumens.  For utilities, it is advisable to purchase devices of at least 1000 Lm.  You should also take into account the constant operating temperature of the lamp.  The most profitable solution is devices that work confidently in conditions of -30 to 60 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Additional functionality </h2>

    <p>  In modern models of LED-lamps, touch devices are actively used.  These are sensors by which the device can regulate its work automatically.  The most common option is models provided with motion sensors.  The system of ultrasonic radiation allows you to determine the presence of a person in the served area and at the time of fixing this fact activate its function.  Technological <span>LED luminaires</span> for entrances with <span>a motion sensor</span> are equipped with programmable controllers.  The device through a special driver can be electronically entered into a single control system for a common lighting system.  The operator can only adjust the operation parameters of the lamp or group of devices to a certain mode. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  On the domestic market there are special solutions for housing and communal services from the largest manufacturers of lighting equipment.  Among them, Philips, Osram and Samsung deserve attention.  Second-order manufacturers include ILLUMINEX, Feron, and Viled.  Recently, combined systems of Russian production began to appear.  For example, the enterprises ‚ÄúLeader Light‚Äù, ‚ÄúAS-Terra‚Äù, ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù and others use part of components from foreign companies in their development.  For example, Samsung‚Äôs own LED housing lamp with motion sensor may be offered.  However, electronic drivers and matrix elements are most often represented by Philips and Osram products.  Housing elements made of plastic and aluminum are mainly produced by domestic companies. </p><h2>  How much does LED lighting cost? </h2><p>  One of the main disadvantages <span>of LED lighting systems</span> is the cost.  Typical models for installation in public places can cost about 500-700 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lighting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1664285.jpg"></div>  Street lamps with large shades are estimated at 1-2 thousand rubles.  The most expensive is considered a LED lamp for housing and communal services with a motion sensor, the electronic filling of which increases the cost by 1-1.5 thousand. The complex provision of entrances can be estimated at several tens of thousands, including installation costs.  It should also be noted that the initial investment in lighting equipment is offset by savings during operation.  In fact, these are energy-saving lamps, which, in terms of maintenance costs, are more profitable than incandescent lamps and halogen devices.

    <p>  Housing and communal services are traditionally considered one of the most expensive in terms of maintenance.  According to these indicators, they stand next to mid-level factory enterprises.  The advantages of Led-lamps in this regard are determined not only by the initially economical energy consumption.  The mentioned LED lamp for housing and communal services with a motion sensor virtually eliminates unnecessary consumption of electricity thanks to the control system.  There are other advantages to such lighting.  LED lamps are considered the most environmentally friendly.  This factor is a plus from the point of view of safety for the health of consumers, and in terms of the disposal of unusable devices. </p>
