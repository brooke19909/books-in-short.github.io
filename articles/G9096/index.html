He began to enjoy popularity among the people thanks to his bread distributions and magnificent spectacles.  As a commander, he was very careful and at the same time decisive. </p><p>  Guy Julius Caesar.  Biography </p><p>  In 68, he was elected as a quaestor, three years later as an edil, and after three more years as a praetor.  In 61, Gaius Julius Caesar gained fortune and military glory during several campaigns against the Lusitans and Callaic in Far Spain. </p><p>  The politician reached the greatest popularity in 59, becoming a consul.  After concluding an agreement with Gnei Pompey and Mark Crassus, Guy Julius Caesar becomes one of the rulers of Rome.  The provinces of Illyria and both Gaul were assigned to him. </p><p>  In the period from 58 to 51 years, Caesar waged many wars.  As a result of the battles, free Gallic peoples were subordinated to Rome, occupying the territory between the Rhine and the Atlantic coast.  In 58, Caesar defeated the Helvets and the German leader Ariovista, in 57 he opposed the Belgians, the next year - against the Aquitans and Venets.  In 54, after a campaign in Britain, Guy Julius Caesar conquered several local tribes. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the Gauls began a war of liberation under the leadership of the leader of Vercingetorig.  It took Caesar about two years to crush the rebellion.  In Alesia in 52, he surrounded the rebels.  The Gauls could not break the blockade.  In October 52, the leader Werzingetorig surrendered.  After that, most of the Gallic peoples laid down their arms voluntarily.  Thus, in 51, Caesar finally conquered Gaul. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Meanwhile, relations between the Senate and Caesar escalated in the Roman state.  The politician refused to give his successor, appointed by the Senate, his province. </p><p>  In the year 49, on January 10, crossing the Rubicon River, Caesar moved with an army to Rome.  Not meeting resistance, the commander easily captured Rome and Italy.  Caesar's political opponents fled to Epirus. </p><p>  In the year 49, on August 2, the general won a victory at Illerd over the seven legions of Mark Petreus and Lucius Afranius. </p><p>  In 48, in January, the commander landed in Epirus.  But after the failure at Dyrrahius, Caesar retreated to Thessaly, where he dealt a crushing blow to the army of Pompey, who was able to escape.  In pursuit of Gnei Pompey, the commander arrived in September 48 in Egypt.  There he found out about the death of Pompey, who was killed by order of Ptolemy 13 (king of Egypt).  This allowed Caesar to intervene in the affairs of Egypt.  The commander took the side of Cleopatra in the "Alexandria War", as a result of which the queen took the Egyptian throne. </p><p>  In 47, Caesar made a trip to <span>Asia Minor.</span>  On August 2, he defeated King Farnak 2. By October, Caesar had landed in Africa.  In the year 46, on April 6, he defeated the remains of the Pompeans, defeated Yuba 1 (king of Numidia). </p><p>  Returning with a triple victory (in the Numidian, Alexandrian and Gallic battles) to Rome, Caesar became a dictator.  He was proclaimed for ten years.  Soon Caesar will be called "father of the fatherland", "emperor". </p><p>  Magna Gnei (son of Pompey) in the year 46 invaded Spain and took possession of it.  However, Caesar, who arrived in Spanish territory, completely destroyed the opposition at the Battle of Munda. </p><p>  After this victory, immeasurable honors began to be rendered to the dictator.  His statues were erected in temples, a list of his merits was displayed on silver columns in gold letters.  He wore royal clothing, sat in a gilded armchair.  The month of July was named in honor of Caesar. </p><p>  In Rome, the politician began to implement reforms in order to strengthen the weakened and shaken by continuous battles of the state.  In addition, the dictator planned to make major campaigns against the Dacians and Parthians.  But his plans did not materialize. </p><p>  Gaius Julius Caesar was killed in 44 (March 15) by conspirators who were in his inner circle. </p>
