    <p>  Non-operating expenses are the expenses of the organization unrelated to the sale of products or production.  Undoubtedly, they should be documented and be economically justified.  As an example of non-operating expenses, you can cite the interest paid on the loan, the cost of various bank services, discounts on goods, negative exchange rates, etc. Non-operating expenses also include losses incurred in the past, shortages in material assets, and losses incurred in the result of natural disasters. </p><p>  Premiums and discounts offered to customers </p><p>  Currently, sellers of goods may include in the number of non-operating expenses cash amounts that were provided to customers as discounts and bonuses.  Most often, such bonuses are provided by sellers to wholesale buyers.  Typically, these non-operating expenses represent discounts in the form of a reduction in the initial cost of the goods or write-off of part of the customer‚Äôs debt (without changing the initial price). </p><p>  When setting discounts in the form of a reduction in the initial price, the seller must display this condition in the sales contract.  It often happens that there are difficulties in determining the amount of discounts when shipping products, and this can not always be done.  In this case, the primary documents for the shipped goods are drawn up based on the initial price.  And then, after the buyer fulfills the discount conditions, the documents are rewritten. </p><p>  According to the Tax Code of Russia, income from sales of products is called revenue, which is determined from the account of all <span>receipts</span> related to settlements for <span>goods</span> sold <span>.</span>  From this definition it follows that the discount provided leads to a decrease in revenue.  If this occurs during shipment, then this is good.  But this does not always happen.  It happens that a company operates on an accrual basis and may experience some difficulties.  This is because the date of receipt of income from the <span>sale of goods</span> falls on the day of transfer of ownership of the product to the buyer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, it turns out that the discount amount must be taken into account in that reporting period when the specified goods were to be sold to the buyer.  It turns out that with respect to the discounts and sales to different periods, the company will have to recalculate taxes and submit an updated declaration. </p><p>  Organizations working on a <span>cash basis</span> will not have to adjust anything in tax accounting.  However, previously issued <span>primary documents</span> will have to be corrected anyway. </p><p>  Discounts may be granted without changing the initial price of the product.  Then it is included in non-operating expenses.  Moreover, they will be recognized in the period when the premium was paid or a discount was granted.  This method is more preferable, because the price of the discount does not have to adjust the price of the shipped goods.  Accordingly, it will not be necessary to rewrite primary documents, submit revised <span>declarations, and</span> correct data in tax accounting. </p><p>  You should pay close attention to whether the discount will be economically viable.  It is best to include this tool in the order on marketing policies pursued by the company.  This is indicated by the 40th article of the Tax Code, and the letter of the Ministry of Finance speaks about this. </p><p>  Other non-operating expenses </p><p>  This group includes the <span>expenses of the enterprise</span> for sports, cultural and educational events, entertainment, recreation.  This also includes transfers of funds associated with charity.  These non-operating expenses are reflected in the subaccount ‚ÄúOther expenses‚Äù. </p>
