Its shores are washed by the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, there are snowy peaks and mountain gorges, the vast sandy space of the Sahara and the golden beaches of resorts.  Numerous sights of Morocco can be seen in ancient cities, such as: Marrakech, Casablanca, Fet and Rabat, Meknes and Chefchaouen. </p><h2>  History and religion of Morocco </h2><p>  This African state has a rich history, whose roots go back to the Arab settlements that appeared here in the VIII-IX centuries on the territory of the Maghreb.  In ancient times, the lands of Morocco were inhabited by nomadic tribes that were the ancestors of the Berbers.  From the 12th century BC  there was a <span>Phoenician colony,</span> which in the VI-V century.  BC.  came under the rule of Carthage. </p><p>  In ancient times, the indigenous inhabitants were called the Libyans, Getuls, Numids, later the Romans called them Berbers.  The origin of the name "Moors" originates from the Phoenician word "Maura".  In the V-VI centuries A.D.  the northern regions were conquered by vandals, later came under the rule of Byzantium. </p><p>  And only in the VII century the territory was included in the Arab caliphate, the spread of the Muslim religion and the Arabic language, which was adopted by the local population everywhere.  In the VIII century, the Berbers and Arabs jointly conquered the territory of the Iberian Peninsula. </p><p>  The ancient cities are examples of classical Arab-Berber architecture, which presents fortresses, magnificent palaces, mosques and fountains, aqueducts and baths. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Beginning in the 15th century, European colonialists (Spaniards, Portuguese, British, and French) entered Morocco, and for many years the locals fought stubbornly and often successfully.  The struggle for state independence continued until the middle of the 20th century.  In 1956, national state institutions were created, reorganization of the socio-economic, ship and financial systems was carried out.  A constitutional monarchy has now been established in Morocco. </p><div class="photo" data-original="outgotrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interiors and architecture of Morocco" class="if uuid-2429650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2429650.jpg"></div><p>  Examples of medieval architecture, and what tourists can see in Morocco: Bahia Palace in Marrakech, the gates of Bab al-Mansour in Meknes and other architectural monuments.  They are distinguished by exquisite taste, a wealth of decorative design and oriental grace. </p><h2>  Casablanca </h2><p>  The city of Casablanca is located on the site of the old Berber village of Anfa, which was given the name Dar el Beyd (the ‚ÄúWhite House‚Äù) by Sultan Mohammed Ben Abdallah.  And he got a modern name from the Spaniards, under whose authority it was several centuries. </p><p>  The population of Casablanca, the largest city in Morocco, is 3.5 million inhabitants, and it is rightfully a business center with skyscrapers, its own port, many banks, and a modern airport named after  Mohammed, who is an excellent example of modern Moroccan architecture. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the attractions of Morocco is the huge <span>mosque of Hassan II,</span> in which 25 thousand worshipers can be at the same time.  It is the second largest after the mosque in Mecca and the tallest building in Casablanca (its minaret has a height of 200 m).  Designed by the French architect M. Pinso, 3300 workers and craftsmen, it also has a unique retractable roof, which in a matter of minutes turns the prayer hall into an open terrace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestadhan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casablanca, Hassan Mosque" class="if uuid-2424417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2424417.jpg"></div><p>  It is also distinguished by the fact that it is open for people of non-Muslim religion, which is very important for tourists who want to know in advance what to see in Morocco and where to get it. </p><p>  Not far from the Hassan Mosque are the magnificent Palace of Justice of Maham do Pasha, as well as the modern Notre Dame de Lourdes church with beautiful colored stained glass windows. </p><h2>  Marrakesh </h2><p>  This ancient city is the heart of the East and the former capital of the Berber Empire and Sultan Yusuf.  It is located in the central part of Morocco, at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, it is also called ‚Äúred‚Äù for the color of clay buildings.

It was here that the prophet Mohammed fled, fleeing from Mecca.  Here is the oldest university in the world, as well as a huge number of mosques (about 800), because in the Middle Ages this city was considered the spiritual capital of Islam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace al-Badi. Marrakesh" class="if uuid-2425153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2425153.jpg"></div><p>  Geographically, it is divided into 3 parts: </p><ul><li>  the old Medina, the main attraction of Fes, along the perimeter of which a medieval wall was erected, consists of narrow pedestrian streets in which artisans live in the districts; </li><li>  Fes-Dzhdid - the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new Medina, where markets, restaurants and countless shops are located; </li><li>  New Fes is a modern part with wide avenues, transport stations and the airport. </li></ul><p>  The city of Fes in Morocco is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Later it became the place where Jews expelled from Spain came.  Guided by the Talmud, they began to paint houses in blue and blue, the colors of the sky, to be closer to the Almighty. </p><p>  In fact, this is a small village where there are no Jews anymore, but local residents continue to paint their buildings in heavenly colors, which attracts tourists who want to fully appreciate the local flavor in order to leave their reviews about Morocco and its interesting ancient settlements.  They come here from nearby Fez. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets in Chefchaouen" class="if uuid-2427792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2427792.jpg"></div><h2>  Meknes </h2><p>  This is the ancient capital, located 60 km from Fez, on the Al-Hajeb mountain plateau.  The city of Meknes will interest tourists with the most beautiful city gate that exists in the north of the African continent - Bab al-Mansur.  Another attraction of Morocco is the grandiose ruins of the palace of Dar el-Kebir, which were built by Moulay Ismail. </p><p>  The monumental buildings of the Dar al-Ma warehouses for storing food surprise and delight with three-meter-thick walls, erected for reliable protection from thieves and conquerors.  From the terraces of this building you can clearly see the Agdal basin (4 hectares in area), used as a reservoir and irrigation of gardens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gate of Bab al-Mansur" class="if uuid-2429644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2429644.jpg"></div><h2>  Agadir - resort in Morocco </h2><p>  Located in the green and picturesque valley of Sousse, on the one hand it has mountains that protect from the sultry air of the Sahara desert, on the other - beautiful beaches and the Atlantic coast.  The medieval Agadir was conquered by the Portuguese, who built a fort and a trading port here.  In 1960, the city suffered from an earthquake, which turned into piles of dilapidated buildings and stones, but over the past decade it has turned into a modern European-level resort with many cafes and bars, shops and markets.  Tourists coming to excursions in Morocco can not only soak up the sandy beaches, but also engage in dynamic surfing and take boat trips. </p><h2>  Tours in Morocco </h2><p>  This African state is considered by tourists a colorful mystery that can only be solved by someone who sees it and appreciates its beauty and originality.  At any travel agency you can find trips to Morocco with visits to cities and interesting sights.  Many also offer trips: to the Sahara, to the Urika Valley and the Uzoud Falls (near Marrakesh), exploring the Phoenician settlement of Essaouira, jeep tours to the Massa Nature Reserve and other exciting activities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flightcentre.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mahia Palace in Marrakesh" class="if uuid-2427612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2427612.jpg"></div><p>  Morocco is not in vain called the country of the rising sun (El Maghreb), as well as the fabulous Middle Ages.  It is small, but very diverse: here you can find not only civilization, but also the desert sands of the Sahara, Atlas Mountains, and the ocean coast.  Just having arrived on an excursion to Morocco, having heard the call for prayer, tasting local delicacies (pastille, etc.), wandering around the market and exploring the rich handicrafts of local artisans, you can experience the spicy and fabulous ‚Äútaste of the East‚Äù. </p>
