    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Lino Mare 3 * (Crete) receives negative reviews not very often.  But it was not without them.  Some of the guests were dissatisfied with the quality of the services provided.  In their opinion, the administration should pay attention to the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Drain in the shower works very poorly, the water does not leave and floods the floor, so you have to wipe it every time. </li><li>  Breakfast in the restaurant is monotonous.  Every day they cook the same set of dishes, which quickly bothers. </li><li>  The promised satellite television broadcasts only one Greek channel in terrible quality. </li><li>  Maids do not clean the room every day.  You have to constantly remind them of the need to replace bedding. </li><li>  The Internet sometimes works very poorly.  In the evening, the speed becomes very low, so the browser refreshes one page for several minutes. </li><li>  Some rooms overlook a noisy street.  At night, the sounds of cars and the cries of people prevent sleep. </li></ul><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Lino Mare 3 * can be recommended to picky tourists who want to save on accommodation.  They will appreciate the cleanliness of the rooms, the friendly staff and the good location.  When coming here with children, it is worth remembering that at night the rooms can be quite noisy due to the highway.  Most often, adult couples stay here who need a room only for an overnight stay. </p>
