  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Baptism of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Undoubtedly, one of the events that determined the development of our country for years and even millennia ahead is the Baptism of Russia.  Despite the fact that a certain date was fixed in the history of this event, 988 g, in fact, Russia was baptized for a very, very long time. </p><p>  Since ancient times, isolated cases of conversion of the Slavs to the Christian faith are known.  Among others, <span>Princess Olga</span> was also baptized <span>.</span>  True, historians argue about the reasons for her act.  Someone says that she believed in one Lord, others believe that this act had a political motive.  There is even a beautiful legend, according to which Olga, who loved her husband, refused to marry a second time after his death.  And this did not cause special problems until <span>Emperor Constantine</span> embraced her <span>.</span>  It was difficult to refuse such a groom because of possible political consequences.  And Olga agreed.  And since the emperor was Orthodox, for marriage with him, Olga had to be baptized, and she asked him to become her godfather.  When, after the <span>rite of baptism,</span> Konstantin demanded that the wedding date be given.  Olga replied that the father could not become the daughter‚Äôs husband and left for Kiev.  Of course, this is just a legend that has nothing to do with real facts.  The baptism of Olga was one of the first steps that brought the Baptism of Russia closer. </p><p>  But her son, Svyatoslav, did not support the Christian religion.  He preferred to remain faithful to the faith of his ancestors.  As well, and the grandson of Olga, Vladimir.  Initially, he was also an ardent admirer of polytheism.  This did not prevent him from subsequently baptizing himself and baptizing all of Kiev in 988, it was this moment that entered the textbooks as the Baptism of Russia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is now difficult to say whether Vladimir really believed, or whether it was a completely and completely political act.  However, the enormous influence of the political situation on his decision cannot be refuted in any case.  His mind was dominated by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrallying the Russian people, which was seriously hindered by the fragmentation of religious beliefs, because many tribes lived on the territory of Kievan Rus, each with its own gods. </p><p>  The first attempt at unification was undertaken under the auspices of paganism.  Near Kiev, by order of Vladimir, a temple was erected, where five idols were installed, five different Slavic gods.  Thus, he wanted to create a single pantheon of gods, which could become the core of the union of tribes.  However, his expectations were not met. </p><p>  Then he began to look for another method.  Confident that only a religious association would give an adequate result, he set about studying other beliefs and cults.  It is reliably known that he actively communicated on these topics not only with Byzantium.  He also considered Islam and Catholicism as a possible option, and even maintained contacts with the <span>Khazar Kaganate.</span>  However, he ultimately chose Orthodoxy, thereby bringing the Baptism of Russia closer.  The reasons for this decision are understandable. </p><p>  First of all, Byzantium was for Russia the most coveted ally.  In addition, it was at this time that Basil II, the emperor of Byzantium, was looking for allies against his rival, claiming the throne.  And he tried to enlist the support of Vladimir and Russians, proposing to Vladimir in return a marriage with his sister, Princess Anna.  The advantages of this marriage are obvious for the Russian prince and he agreed to help the emperor, as well as to be baptized, since the pagan could not marry the Orthodox. </p><p>  However, after the Russian prince fulfilled his part of the agreement, Vasily began to drag out time, since in fact such a kinship did not suit him that much.  Vladimir had to achieve what was promised to him.  To do this, he captured the city of Korsun (now Chersonesus) and offered it to the emperor as a ransom for his bride.  The marriage was concluded. </p><p>  It was after this that the Baptism of Kievan Rus took place.  Of course, having exponentially driven the entire <span>population of Kiev</span> into the river and thrown into it the very same established idols, he did not solve all the problems associated with the adoption of a new faith.  Many people have long resisted his decision.  He was especially negatively received in Novgorod, where Vladimir initially reigned.  He was considered an apostate and could not forgive the betrayal of his father's faith. </p><p>  The prince did not want to use violent measures, he preferred to arrange open dinners and charity events, under the auspices of the church.  However, it was not possible to completely dispense with the forced planting of faith.  In many places they had to baptize with fire and sword. </p><p>  The baptism of Russia had tremendous consequences; it was it that allowed us to take a huge step forward in the cultural and social development of the state. </p>
