But in our native country there are no less interesting places to relax on the coast.  Take even the island of Popov - the pearl of the entire Primorsky Territory.  This is a small oasis of pristine nature in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan, as if created specifically for summer beach and outdoor activities. </p><h2>  When was Popova Island discovered? </h2><p>  For the first time, a series of islands was reported <span>in the Primorsky Territory by</span> French sailors who explored this area on the Caprice corvette in 1850.  It was then that the archipelago was named in honor of Empress Eugenia.  After 8 years, in 1858, the islands were explored by Russian sailors.  Under the unified command of Captain First Rank Andrey Popov, the ships Rynda, Griden, and Oprichnik took part in this expedition.  Washed by water from all sides, a piece of land, later called ‚ÄúPopova Island‚Äù, was then named after the corvette ‚ÄúRynda‚Äù.  This geographic feature was renamed in 1862.  Since then, the island of Popova has the usual name for us. </p><h2>  Legends, Traditions, Facts </h2>

Among the archaeological finds obtained in these places, there are clay shards.  It is also believed that the people who lived here used seafood as their main source of food.  At the same time, marine organisms were not only their favorite food, but they were also revered in a special way.  According to legend, there was a pirate base on the island near Alekseev Bay.  In the 80s of the nineteenth century, sea robbers were detained here, who had recently robbed a ship loaded with provisions and money to strengthen the fortress in Vladivostok.  The criminals were arrested, but the stolen material assets were never found.  It is possible that the island of Popova keeps treasures in itself today.  Pirates of those times were able to skillfully hide treasures, the uninitiated had no chance to find them.

    <p>  The beaches here are sandy and pebble.  Many of them have summer cafes or tents, where you can buy soft drinks, snacks and the freshest seafood.  Due to its geographical location, the island of Popova is not overly popular among tourists.  Most often, residents of the Primorsky Territory or neighboring countries come here.  But for guests from the central strip of Russia, the fare for the road to Vladivostok is too high, and it sometimes takes a lot of time.  At the same time, the cost of rest here is quite low, and the satisfaction of basic household needs will cost inexpensively. </p><h2>  Accommodation options for vacationers </h2>
