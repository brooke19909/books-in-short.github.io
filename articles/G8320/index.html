But Petrograd can make it a competition, which residents and visitors of the city affectionately and abbreviated call St. Petersburg.  Kamennoostrovsky Palace is an example of classicism, which, despite significant changes and restorations, did not lose the spirit of the 18th century. </p><h2>  Elite area </h2><p>  The northern capital has its own analogy near Moscow Rublevka, which boasts rich and famous residents.  Its total area is 10.6 km¬≤.  It is located in the delta of the main river of St. Petersburg and is washed by the rivers Krestovka, Bolshaya and Malaya Nevka.  Now Kamenny Island is the center of <span>St. Petersburg, where the</span> expensive residences of influential people are located. </p>

If it were not for the specific historical events and intrigues of the tsar‚Äôs court, perhaps Russia would not be proud of architectural wonders like the Kamennoostrovsky Palace, the <span>cottage Gauswald,</span> the Vollenweider mansion and others.

    <p>  The history of the site began immediately after laying the first construction of the Northern capital - the Peter and Paul Fortress - May 16, 1703. </p><h2>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe great emperor </h2><p>  Two interesting legends are associated with the name of this land.  According to the first version, there was a huge boulder on the island, which hung over the site like a rock.  The second myth tells: this territory is named after the great emperor-reformer.  Indeed, from the Greek petros, from which the name Peter comes, is translated as ‚Äústone‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The emperor had big plans on the coast of the Gulf of Finland.  In order to consolidate the status of Russian on the conquered Swedish lands, he gave large plots to his faithful subjects. </p><p>  So, the first owner of Kamenny Island was lucky to become Count Gabriel Golovkin.  It was to him, the diplomat and friend, that the emperor in 1709 presented this site.  It is worth noting that on the top where this man was built, today stands the Kamennoostrovsky Palace. </p>

    <h2>  Foundation for the residence </h2><p>  Sources testify that this diplomat, despite his high incomes, was extremely stingy.  To build a magnificent mansion was fantastic for him. </p><p>  But the count was very afraid that the emperor, who liked to visit the territories he donated often, would come to the island and would not see any changes for the better.  Therefore, Golovkin gave the order to build a cheap house of wood, behind which a modest garden was planted.  Then grew a dense swampy forest.  The fears were justified, and in 1715 the monarch visited the donated territory.  It was there that a few years later the Kamennoostrovsky Palace appeared, the work of the hands of the wife of his grandson Peter III. </p><p>  After the death of the first emperor, the count successfully cunning until his own death in 1734 and remained an important person at the court, which survived three coups.  But his son Mikhail could not get out of the water of intrigue dry and fell into disgrace of the new tsarina - Elizabeth Petrovna.  He and his wife were sent into exile.  Property and land confiscated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The founder of the ensemble </h2><p>  The empress gave the island to her cousin, Anna Skavronskaya, who married Count Alexei Bestuzhev-Ryumin and thereby transferred her property to him.  He actively took up the planning of the territory where the Kamennoostrovsky Palace stands today.  To uproot a dense forest and drain swamps, the count brought hundreds of Ukrainian families. </p><p>  Later, a beautiful French-style garden was planted.  The count initiated the creation of a beautiful magnificent ensemble, on the basis of which other structures were built.  They often held loud masquerade balls, to which the whole city nobility came. </p><p>  In 1758, the queen demoted and sent Bestuzhev.  However, no confiscation was made.  The Earl ran his estates from a distance.  So, for some time, through private announcements in St. Petersburg, he rented out his estate. </p><p>  Bestuzheva returned to power Catherine II.  She resumed the title, but because of his <span>debts bought</span> him an island for 30,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Start of work </h2><p>  In 1765, the empress gave this territory to her son and heir Paul I.  Construction work began to build the Kamennoostrovsky Palace in St. Petersburg, the best masters of that time were invited from all over the country.  The name of the author of the project is still not exactly known.  According to some, he was Vasily Bazhenov. </p><p>  The process was led by Yuri Felten.  After the flood of 1777, he was succeeded by Giacomo Quarenghi.  The construction process itself took about ten years.  It is worth noting that Paul I was not particularly addicted to this area.  The fact was that Catherine II presented her son Pavlovsk and Gatchina in the same period.  They became the favorite residences of the ruler. </p><p>  The enclosures were completed in 1780.  Then a magnificent ball was held in honor of the finish of the work, which the queen herself visited.  But only two years later they completely finished working with the interior. </p>

    <h2>  Monarch's love nest </h2><p>  The residence form is a stretched letter "P".  The style is sustained in strict Russian classicism.  In general, only 30 rooms have a Kamennoostrovsky palace.  Restoration was carried out outside several times, and each time the craftsmen managed to maintain the original appearance of the building.  But inside, the style changed often. </p><p>  The heyday fell on the reign of the son of Paul I - Alexander.  For 25 years, it was the main residence of the emperor.  The monarch's affection for this place is very easy to explain.  Opposite his estate, on the other side of Malaya Nevka, was the mansion of Maria Naryshkina, the emperor‚Äôs favorite.  Their romance lasted 15 years. </p><p>  When the sovereign moved to the island, he closed all the entertainment venues and taverns.  He wanted peace and quiet.  His thoughts were inspired by a lush garden that complemented the ensemble of the house.  You could go directly to him from the ballroom. </p>

    <h2>  Fashion of the time </h2><p>  The Kamennoostrovsky Palace grew very quickly.  Photos where you can see the decoration and interior of the castle are the work of different generations of craftsmen.  In the days of <span>Giacomo Quarenghi</span> , the facade of the building and the front yard, decorated with six columns in the style of the Tuscan order, were erected.  At that time granite steps were installed. </p><p>  In 1820, cardinal restructuring began.  An office was added for the ruler Alexander I, the garden was reconstructed.  The walls were re-painted by the artist Giovanni Batista.  All changes were carried out in accordance with fashion trends. </p><p>  The Great Hall is especially magnificent.  Its main purpose is balls and masquerades.  Today there are marble sculptures depicting the characters of Greek myths. </p><h2>  From kings to presidents </h2><p>  Many historical events saw these walls.  Here he was appointed army commander Mikhail Kutuzov.  Also in this residence, the emperor found out about the Decembrists.  The palace became the center of painting under Princess Elena Pavlovna.  Musical evenings organized by Rubinstein were also held.  A frequent guest of the mansion was Alexander Pushkin. </p>

    <p>  In 2008, reconstruction began.  Now real estate in this territory costs crazy money and is considered the most elite among all the plots in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  The workers of the complex conduct interesting and informative excursions to the Kamennoostrovsky Palace.  The address at which the ensemble is located: 1A Malaya Nevka River Embankment. </p><p>  Several buildings were to be remade under the residence of the governor, but the authorities changed their minds.  In September of this year, they plan to open an Academy of Talents here.  This will allow everyone to freely visit the architectural miracle. </p>
