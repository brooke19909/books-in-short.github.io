    <p>  Elbrus is a mountain that is rightly considered the highest point of the Russian Federation, located in the northern part of the <span>Greater Caucasus Mountain Range,</span> on the border of Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the exact border has not yet been established between Europe and Asia, sometimes the mountain is equated to the highest European mountain peak and is classified as the “Seven Peaks”.  Perhaps some time will pass and the geographers will finally resolve this dispute, but so far it is known for certain that Elbrus is a mountain, which is the so-called two-peak stratovolcano.  Its cone-shaped peaks formed on an ancient volcanic base, and from a geological point of view, both peaks are completely independent volcanoes, each of which has a classic shape and a clearly defined crater. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Caucasus Mountains ... Elbrus ... These places are actually famous for their ancient history.  Few people know that age is determined by the state of the upper part, which, for example, at the highest peak in Russia is destroyed by a vertical fault.  It was also possible to establish the date of the last eruption: it happened around the 50s of A.D.  e. </p>

    <h2>  Section 2. Secret of the name of the peak </h2><p>  Perhaps the question of where Mount Elbrus is located, albeit a little thoughtful, but the average average student will answer, but few know about the etymology of the name. </p><p>  In general, it should be noted that this vertex has several names at once.  In total, there are more than a dozen. </p><p>  Today it is quite difficult to determine which of the names appeared earlier, and which later.  The modern name of this mountain, according to one version, comes from the Iranian "Aitibares", which is translated into Russian as "high mountain" or "brilliant" (a variant from the Zend language).  In Karachay-Balkar, the peak is called “Mingi-tau”, which is translated into Russian as “a mountain of thousands”.  Nevertheless, there are Balkars who call it a little differently - “Mingetau”, which means “mountain saddled”.  Modern representatives of this nationality still say "Elbrus-tau" - "a mountain around which the wind swirls." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the many names of the stratovolcano, the name “Jinpadishah” is also distinguished, which is translated from the Turkic as “master of spirits”, “Orfi-tub” (Abkhazian) - “mountain of the blessed”, or “Yal-buz” (Georgian) - “snowy” mane". </p><h2>  Section 3.

    <p>  Perhaps this question at least once in my life interested many inquisitives.  But to answer it is not as simple as it might seem at first glance.  Why?  It's all about the features of its structure. </p><p>  As noted above, Elbrus is a mountain consisting of two cone-shaped peaks.  The height of the west is 5642 meters, and the east is 5621 meters.  The saddle separating them rises above the surface by 5300 meters, and the distance from each other is about 3000 meters. </p><p>  The size of Elbrus was first determined by the Russian academician V.K. Vishnevsky in 1813. </p><p>  Recall that today the highest peak in the world is <span>Mount Everest</span> (Chomolungma), whose height is 8848 meters, compared with which our mountain peak looks tiny. <strong></strong></p>

    <h2>  Section 4. Severity of the local climate </h2><p>  Mount Elbrus ... Climbing to its peak is often dreamed of both experienced climbers and beginners.  However, this can by no means be done at any time.  The most favorable is the summer period, July-August. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At this time, the weather is the most stable and safer to visit at such heights.  In summer, the air temperature rarely drops below -9 ° C, although it may well drop to -30 ° C when rising. </p><p>  From October to April in these places is a harsh and cold winter.  In the cold season, visiting the peak is almost impossible, and climbing it is tantamount to suicide. </p><h2>  Section 5. Volcanic activity </h2><p>  Elbrus is amazing and unique.  Description of the mountain takes too much time, because every time more and more interesting features are discovered. </p><p>  In this article, we will touch upon only the least known.  Geological studies of this extinct volcano showed the presence of layers containing volcanic ash, which was formed as a result of ancient eruptions.  According to the first layer, scientists have proved that the very first eruption of Elbrus occurred about 45 thousand years ago.  The second layer was formed after the <span>eruption of the</span> Kazbek <span>volcano</span> .  It happened about 40 thousand years ago. </p><p>  Now it is known for certain that it was after this second, most powerful, even by modern standards, eruptions that the Neanderthals, who settled in local caves, left these lands and went in search of more favorable living conditions. </p><p>  The most recent eruption of the Elbrus volcano occurred about 2000 years ago (the 50s C.E.). </p><h2>  Section 6.

    <p>  In general, the mountains of the Caucasus, Elbrus in particular, are shrouded in many of the most amazing and mysterious legends and myths. </p><p>  One of such tales tells that in ancient times father and son lived - Kazbek and Elbrus.  Both of them fell in love with one beautiful girl, whose name was Mashuk.  Only that girl could not make a choice between two glorious heroes.  For a long time, father and son competed, not wanting to give in to each other, and a deadly duel broke out between them.  They fought until Elbrus defeated his father.  But, realizing his terrible act, the son turned gray with grief.  He no longer wanted love, obtained at the cost of the life of a loved one, and Elbrus turned away from the beautiful Mashuk, a little later stabbing himself with the same dagger with which he killed his father. </p><p>  The beautiful Mashuk long and bitterly cried over the knights and said that there were no such heroes on the whole earth, and that it was hard for her to live in this world without seeing them. </p><p>  The god heard her moaning, and turned Kazbek and Elbrus into high mountains, more beautiful and higher in the Caucasus.  He turned the beautiful Mashuk into a smaller mountain.  And now, from century to century, day after day, a stone girl stands and looks at the mighty peaks, not deciding which of the two heroes is closer and dearer to her stone heart ... </p>

    <h2>  Section 7. The History of Great Conquests </h2><p>  In 1829, led by the head of the scientific expedition, George Emmanuel, the first ascent to Elbrus was made.  Members of this expedition were mainly representatives of the scientific community: physicists, botanists, zoologists, geologists, etc. They conquered the eastern part of Elbrus and went down in history as the discoverers of one of the largest peaks of our planet Earth. </p><p>  The first to climb Mount Elbrus was Kilar Khachirov, the guide.  A few years later, the higher peak of this mountain, the western one, was also conquered.  An expedition organized by English climbers, led by Florence Grove, made a trip to the western part of Elbrus in 1874.  The very first man to climb to its top was also a guide, this is the Balkarian, Ahii Sottaev - a member of the first expedition. </p><p>  Later, a man appeared who managed to conquer both peaks of Elbrus.  It was a Russian topographer A.V. Pastukhov.  He was able to climb the western peak in 1890, and to the eastern peak in 1896.  The same man made detailed maps of Elbrus. </p><p>  It should be noted that so far the stratovolcano is the most popular mountain among climbers from around the world.  To climb its peak, climbers spend on average about one week. </p><p>  But nowadays you can use the cable car, which greatly facilitates the journey and saves time. </p><p>  At an altitude of about 3750 m, the Bochki shelter is located, from where the climb to Elbrus usually begins now.  This shelter has six-seater insulated barrel-shaped trailers and a specially equipped kitchen.  At the level of 4100 meters is the highest mountain hotel in the world - Shelter of the Eleven. </p><h2>  Section 8. Stone mushrooms on Elbrus </h2>

    <p>  Elbrus is a mountain that can captivate travelers with its natural features, for example, unique rock formations called Stone mushrooms. </p><p>  Until now, no one knows why these stones were popularly called mushrooms, and nowhere else in the Caucasus are such sculptures observed anymore.  On a small flat area (250 x 100 m) a couple of dozens of such “mushrooms” are scattered picturesquely.  In many of them, you can see the recesses. </p><p>  Perhaps they were used by our ancestors for some cult purposes.  Particularly impressive are stones that resemble a face looking up.  Many people believe that this is a place with very strong positive energy, and even the weather here is very anomalous. </p>

Its development and the safety of collections are always monitored by a scientist and two employees. </p><p>  The collection contains more than 270 items.  It should be noted that during the Second World War, the highest mountain front was located in the Elbrus region.  In these places, fierce battles were fought over <span>mountain passes,</span> which the Nazis tried to capture in order to reach Transcaucasia. </p><p>  Photo-documentary materials of these events have been kept in this museum for many years.  The Elbrus Museum of Defense is an organization of regional subordination, in which cultural work is carried out. </p><h2>  Section 10. Interesting facts about grief </h2>

    <ul><li>  In 1956, in honor of the 400th anniversary of Kabardino-Balkaria, a group of 400 climbers were simultaneously able to climb Mount Elbrus. </li><li>  In 1998, the building of the Shelter of the Eleven hotel burned down in a fire.  Today, local authorities are building a new one on the site of an old wooden building. </li><li>  In 1991, Outside Magazine recognized the Shelter of Eleven toilet as the worst toilet in the world.  This is not surprising, given the fact that thousands of mountain tourists and climbers from all over the world for years have used this place for certain purposes. </li><li>  Elbrus is rightfully considered one of the most dangerous peaks in the world.  When climbing a mountain, accidents very often occur.  In 2004 alone, 48 extreme skiers and climbers died. </li><li>  In 1997, for the first time, a specially equipped and modified Land Rover was able to climb the top of Elbrus.  The man who drove this car was the Russian traveler A. Abramov. </li><li>  Mount Elbrus is one of the "Seven Peaks", in addition to it on the list are: Aconcagua in South America, Chomolungma in Asia, McKinley in North America, the Vinson Massif in Antarctica, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Punchak and Jaya in Oceania and Australia. </li><li>  Elbrus also has 22 glaciers in which three <span>rivers</span> originate <span>: the Kuban,</span> Baksan and Malka. </li><li>  Sometimes, from the top of Elbrus, climbers can immediately see the Black and Caspian Seas.  It depends on the pressure and air temperature, due to which the radius of view increases significantly. </li><li>  In 2008, Mount Elbrus was recognized as one of the <span>seven</span> <span>wonders of Russia.</span> </li></ul>
