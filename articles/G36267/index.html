The warmest time of the year is summer, which lasts from March to the end of September.  The biggest heat occurs in July, when the thermometer rises to an average of plus 25.

In 218 BC, the Romans created the city of Placentius, which became the progenitor of modern Piacenza.  For the Roman Empire, the city was needed as a defensive fortress for defense against invaders of the northern territories.  Piacenza was originally conceived as a fortified city.  A year after the advent of Placentia, it is necessary to reflect the attacks of the conquerors.  Warriors of the city heroically were able to withstand the siege of the great army of Hannibal.  The second siege that the locals were able to withstand was the attack of the Hasdrubal army.  However, at the end of the 2nd century, the city was still captured and devastated by the Gauls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Roman period </h2><p>  A little later, Placentia was made the capital of 53 Latin colonies, then the city gets its modern name.  It was connected by a direct road with Rimini, which contributed to the development of a trade center here.  This ensured the stable economic situation of the city for almost the entire subsequent history.  About 6 thousand immigrants from other provinces come to the city.  They are granted special rights: voting, marriage with the indigenous inhabitants of the empire, free trade.  All this contributes to the rapid growth of the city, it is built on the model of all Roman settlements.  And today, the center of the settlement with its straight streets and stone-paved roads recalls this period. </p>

    <h2>  Christian Piacenza </h2><p>  After the decline of Rome, the inhabitants of the city adopted Christianity en masse, in the 4-5 centuries there was a widespread construction of religious buildings.  So Piacenza (Italy), whose sights are significantly enriched by interesting Christian cathedrals, is entering a new round in its history.  In the wealthy city, several outstanding temples are being built, while the main activity of local residents is trade.  By the 10th century, an extensive merchant estate was formed here.  Rapid growth of buildings occurred during this period; many interesting monuments of medieval architecture appear in the city.  In the 13th century, all power over Piacenza was concentrated in his hands by Alberto Scoto.  He did a lot for the further development of the city.  At <span>this time,</span> Piacenza (Italy), the sights of which were supplemented by several significant objects, became a major center of culture and trade. </p><p>  In the 13th century, local elites wage an endless struggle for power, which significantly weakens its defenses.  This was corrected under the rule of the Visconti clan who built the local citadel.  But soon the fortress was destroyed during the almost century-long confrontation between Visconti and Sforza.  In the 16th century, the city is part of the Duchy of Parma, and in Piacenza begins the next period of strengthening defense structures and construction.  Over the following centuries, the city more than once passed from hand to hand of different rulers, but at the same time it always remained a prominent settlement for northern Italy.  This leads to a significant weakening of the city.  Only at the end of the 19th century did Piacenza enter a fairly stable period, becoming part of a united Italy. </p>
