But not everyone believes that rest in the beginning of spring can be bright, sunny, full of unforgettable impressions.  To verify this, just go to Thailand in March.  This country will captivate you with its magnificent nature, the warmth of the gentle sun and the smiles of the hospitable locals. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The Kingdom of Thailand is a state in southeast Asia, located in the southwest of Indochina, in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula.  In the east, it borders with Laos and Cambodia, with Myanmar in the west, with Malaysia in the south.  Until 1939, it was called Siam.  "Thai" is a word that translates as "freedom."  And this name justifies itself completely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to Thailand in March" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1480883.jpg" width="407"></div>

    <p>  Thailand is the only country located in southeast Asia that has maintained independence, while neighboring countries remained colonies of Great Britain and France.  The basis of the country's population is Thai people, which form 15 ethnic communities, including Lao, Khon-thai, and Thai-korat.  In addition, there are Malays, representatives of the Mao, Yao, Chinese and peoples who belong to the Tibeto-Burmese group. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Religion is Buddhism.  The official language is Thai.  It is professed by more than 95% of the population.  In addition to Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs live in the country.  The country has more than a hundred islands and seventy-two provinces. </p><h2>  Thailand: Islands </h2><p>  <span>Thai islands</span> differ not only in size, but also in vegetation, wildlife, as well as in popularity among tourists from all over the world.  They are unusually picturesque.  Such luxurious beaches, covered with white sand, the azure sea and amazing landscapes, perhaps, are not found anywhere in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand islands" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1477224.jpg" width="600"></div>

When in our country nature only wakes up from a cold and long winter, in Thailand the arrival of spring is already palpable.  According to many travelers, the climate of this country is its pride. </p><p>  March marks the beginning of the hot holiday season, which our compatriots like.  The thermometer column slowly rises up and reaches a peak in April.  Thailand is attracted to many in March.  The weather (reviews of tourists allow us to say this) during this period is very comfortable.  Nature is being rebuilt, and the amount of precipitation at this time is insignificant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to go to Thailand in March" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1477223.jpg" width="600"></div>

In March, daytime temperatures high in the mountains reach +31 Â° C, and in the evenings the air cools to +14 Â° C.  In Chiang Mai, weather forecasters record at noon up to +34 Â° C, and in the evening it gets pretty cool at +15 Â° C.  In the northern regions of the country there is no rain.  In some places even a severe drought is recorded. </p><p>  In the central provinces and Bangkok it is also hot, the night coolness does not save - +25 - +34 Â° C.  Precipitation is rare.  But this does not mean that you should not wait for the rains at all for travelers who leave for Thailand in March.  The islands are subject to the movement of the monsoon, which originates over the Indian Ocean.  Five rainy average days fall in Phuket and Samui, one less in Krabi, and only three in Pattaya. </p><h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  Tours to Thailand (March) are becoming more and more popular every year.  They are mainly focused on beach vacations.  Young people prefer the never-falling-asleep Pattaya and Patong Beach, gladly combining a traditional holiday on the sandy shore with their favorite water sports and noisy night discos. </p><p>  Those who come to Thailand in March are pleased to note a slight decrease in prices for excursions, tickets for adults and children for various shows.  Therefore, we strongly recommend that you get acquainted with the culture and history of the Kingdom, feel the national exoticism.  Arriving in Thailand in March, you can devote time to thematic types of recreation: rehabilitation in SPA centers and ecological in the open air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours in thailand march" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1477220.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Quite a lot of tourists come to the country in March, since absolutely all travelers have a passion for amazing beaches covered with white sand, palm trees bending over water.  Thailand has two vast water areas - in <span>the Gulf of Thailand</span> and the <span>Andaman Sea.</span>  Both abound on mainland and pristine islands. </p><p>  Those who want to enjoy the untouched wild beauty, indulge in relaxation and pacification, we recommend paying attention to the resorts located on the islands of Koh Samui, Phuket, Krabi, Phi Phi, Chang and Phangan.  The water is warmest in March in the Andaman Sea - +29 Â° C, in the Gulf of Thailand - + 28 Â° C.  During this period, there are practically no strong storms, although quite impressive waves can rise on some coasts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand march weather reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1477219.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sometimes clear weather quickly changes to cloudy, and it seems that the sun does not bake at all.  But this is a mistake, since ultraviolet rays easily penetrate through the clouds.  Therefore, do not forget to use sunscreen even in cloudy weather, because you can get a burn. </p><h2>  Entertainment and excursions </h2><p>  For some, Thailand is associated with wildlife and natural masterpieces.  Today, there are a lot of tours that satisfy the needs of this category of vacationers.  Resting in Thailand, you need to go at least one tour of the picturesque places.  Which of the proposed travel agencies to choose is up to you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand march weather reviews" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1477227.jpg" width="598"></div>

    <h2>  Natural beauty </h2><p>  If you want to enjoy the natural splendor of this country, go hiking in national parks, botanical gardens, marine reserves.  This is a great opportunity to see the rarest and sometimes disappearing representatives of the fauna and flora, which are listed in the Red Book, recharged with the energy of pristine nature. </p><p>  Specialized livestock farms are especially popular, where tourists come to chat with their inhabitants and watch the shows with their participation.  Colorful performances featuring elephants, monkeys, snakes, crocodiles or birds are impressive.  Some of them are completely harmless, while others make the audience nervous a bit during the performance. </p><h2>  Island Tours </h2><p>  One cannot fail to tell about trips to the islands organized in Thailand.  As a rule, these are day cruises on longboats or speedboats with lunch and entertainment.  In addition to world-famous coral reefs, which are admired by fans of snorkeling and diving from around the world, the islands attract fascinating walks to picturesque waterfalls.  In addition, tourists are interested in visiting the oldest settlements with fishing villages and ancient temples. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand in march tourist reviews" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1477226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fans of extreme relaxation can go mountain climbing or ride in the jungle on ATVs.  It should be noted that the active nightlife, which has made Pattaya famous throughout the world, is also on the most, at first glance, calm islands.  This primarily refers to Phangan, the worthy successor of Ibiza.  Each month, on the full moon, the islandâ€™s measured life is interrupted by the noisy fun of the world famous Full Moon Party, which is attended by amateurs from Europe, the USA, Canada and even Australia. </p><p>  The Kingdom of Thailand is actively developing the wellness industry.  Eastern and Western healing techniques, as well as spiritual traditions of Thailand formed its basis.  That is why spa tours have received worldwide recognition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand in march tourist reviews" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1477225.jpg" width="600"></div>
