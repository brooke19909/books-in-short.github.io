Now all the conditions for hand made classes are created - courses are held, materials for creativity are sold both in office supplies and in specialized stores.  Learning to do beautiful things is easy and simple, most importantly, have a desire. </p><p>  In the article we will talk about one of the interesting types of needlework - weaving, which also has many varieties, depending on the material.  There is weaving from vines and straw, from newspaper tubes and strips of paper, wire and satin ribbons.  Let us focus on weaving bracelets from laces. </p><p>  This is one of the easiest ways to learn how to create, as the material necessary for work can be found in any apartment.  Most often use 2 or 4 shoelaces.  For beginners to weave bracelets, it is best to train on natural products, as they are perfectly fixed by knots, do not slip and hold their shape well.  Yes, and when wearing the finished product will not be deformed.  How to weave a bracelet from laces, you will learn in more detail later in the article.  Photos that are selected with frame-by-frame work will help to make the product the first time, without errors. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  In order to make a bracelet yourself from laces, you need to prepare a workplace for convenience.  Depending on the type of work, you will need either a solid pillow on which the edges of the laces are fastened with pins with a bead at the end, or a rod on which the edges of the laces are attached. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having decided on the place of work, choose the laces of the desired size and shape.  There are thin and round products, but there are flat and wide, natural and synthetic, plain and multi-colored. </p><p>  If you decide to embellish the bracelet from the laces with additional elements, for example, beads or pebbles, then select them so that they fit well in the size of the hole with the cord and in color with the rest of the work. </p><p>  Think about what kind of outfit a bracelet made by yourself will be worn so that it harmoniously fits into the overall suit. </p><p>  When the laces are selected and the color scheme of weaving is thought out, it remains to choose a lock for the bracelet.  Think in advance how the product will be fixed on the hand.  There are special latches, rings with a carabiner, you can just make a loop at the end and a knot at the beginning of work.  It all depends on the thickness of the laces and the preferences of the master. </p><p>  Another important tool for a beautiful weaving of bracelets from laces will be a prepared scheme.  At first, be sure to use these step-by-step instructions.  Let's start learning the craft by looking at just such patterns. </p><h2>  Leather bracelet </h2><p>  To make such a bracelet, as in the photo below, you will need 4 thin and long shoelaces, as well as one wide leather as a base.  It is advisable to choose contrasting colors so that the pattern is perfectly visible on the bracelet.  To fix the base - in our case, leather lace - take a pin or a thick needle and pillow.  Laces of gray color are folded in half and put on the edge of the skin with a central loop, stretching them under the needle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet m leather base" class="if uuid-2870821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2870821.jpg"></div><p>  Then begins the actual weaving of the bracelet laces.  Separately, use the two ends of one pair and two - the other.  The threads are intertwined alternately, then under a leather strip, then above it, and the movements of the first and then the second pair of shoelaces that cross on the back are performed. </p><p>  The photo shows that the leather element is hiding behind the cords, then it is on top.  When the desired length of the bracelet is reached, the ends are hidden from the wrong side.  It remains only from both ends of the bracelet to strengthen the locks and put on the bracelet for a walk. </p><h2>  Openwork pattern </h2><p>  A bracelet made of laces can be made openwork, fastening the elements not tightly, but with distance.  First, find the middle of the yellow lace and secure it with a pin to the pillow.  Then fold the red lace in half and tie a knot with its central part around the double threads of the yellow lace.  This is the preparatory stage of work shown in the first frame of the photo below.  Further work is carried out alternately with either yellow or red lace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patterned bracelet" class="if uuid-2870815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2870815.jpg"></div><p>  Due to the fact that the central threads are tied on opposite sides, and the side ones are connected in the center of the craft, a patterned pattern is obtained.  The main thing in the work is to tie knots on the bracelet from laces at the same level, so that the product turns out to be neat and undeformed.  Do not start moving further until you have checked the quality of the previous ring.  If everything worked out smoothly and beautifully, continue to work further.  If at least a slight skew happened, then stop, untie all the failed knots back and repeat the tying again according to the scheme. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When the work is completed, you can sew a button or a large bead onto the last loop, which will fasten to the first loop of the bracelet. </p><h2>  Tight weave </h2><p>  To make a tight and tight bracelet on your hand, get two long but thin laces of the same color.  Use a pencil as a basis, putting the laces on it with double loops next to each other.  To do this, fold them in half and insert the ends into the central fold.  After tightening, you can begin to weave the bracelet from the laces.  The extreme end is pushed between 3 and 4 elements from above, and then the 4th end is pulled between 1 and 2, but only from the bottom.  Tie a tight knot and pull it up to the pencil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zszywka.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave a bracelet out of laces" class="if uuid-2872896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2872896.jpg"></div><p>  The next level is done the other way around.  The first end extends into the same loop, but now the movement is carried out from below, and the 4th edge starts inward between 1 and 2 already from above.  This alternation is carried out to the desired length of the bracelet.  Tighten all components with equal force so that the work looks neat.  When the entire row is done successfully, the ends are connected to each other on a volume knot.  The first loops are removed from the pencil and pulled on the ‚Äúlock‚Äù.  Now you know how to make a bracelet out of laces so that it is tight and the same along its entire length. </p><h2>  Pebble bracelet </h2><p>  If you have mastered this type of weaving, then it can be improved by adding small pebbles before you tie another tight knot.  How to weave a bracelet from laces with additional elements?  Before threading the lace into the loop, pull one pebble on the central thread.  And then fix it with the next node. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet with pebbles" class="if uuid-2873782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2873782.jpg"></div><p>  In order not to pull one pebble at the end of the cord each time, put them on all at once, and then just push it into place at the right time. </p><h2>  Original weave pattern </h2><p>  To make such a beautiful bracelet, take 4 long shoelaces of a contrasting color to make the pattern stand out more vividly.  In our sample, the colors popular this season were selected - 1 pink and 3 gray.  Fix the ends of the laces on the rod, for example, tie to the bridge of the chair.  The central two gray shoelaces will serve as the base around which the pattern will gather.  The main work is done with one pink and one gray lace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful bracelet" class="if uuid-2870825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2870825.jpg"></div><p>  The photo clearly shows how the ends are stretched into loops, so we will not stop in detail, so as not to waste time on things that are so understandable.  We add only that the edges of the bracelet are tightly tied to knots.  The threads are used soft, so you can fix the bracelet on your hand by simply tying the ends on a bow. </p><h2>  Checkerboard pattern </h2><p>  How to make a bracelet out of laces so that it is tight and at the same time has an original pattern?  The next weaving option will allow you to achieve the desired result.  It will take 4 shoelaces.  You can take all of one color, but you can choose different in pairs, 2 - one color, 2 - another.  Attach the central main threads to the pillow with pins, on which the pattern will be made in knots.  Further, from the laces of a different color, two loops are made as shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chess pattern" class="if uuid-2870831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2870831.jpg"></div><p>  After the prepared knots are tightened tightly, the pattern repeats again.  Do this until the required length is reached.  Use a flexible meter for measurements.  It remains to attach the selected type of fastener and fix the cords in them. </p><h2>  Wide bracelet </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself bracelet made of laces can be made flat and wide, using only three long threads.  Start by fixing them in the center with a rope. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave a bracelet" class="if uuid-2870786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2870786.jpg"></div><p>  Further, following the order of the photos below, bring the weaving to the required size.  Tie the ends together or fasten to a wide fastener. </p><h2>  Beginner Lace Bracelet </h2><p>  The next version of the bracelet on the hand, made by weaving from two contrasting colors of laces, looks originally.  It closes on the eyelet left at the beginning of the work, and the knot tied at its end. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wide bracelet made of laces" class="if uuid-2870812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2870812.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know how to weave a bracelet out of laces with your own hands.  As you can see, you need to strictly adhere to the scheme and not be distracted so as not to mess up the directions of the nodes.  Try it, good luck! </p>
