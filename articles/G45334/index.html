At least it can be described like that.  There is no exception here and right.  Being a collection of various norms and codes, it is not at all chaotic chaos, but a certain structure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The concept and elements of the legal system" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/261651.jpg" width="380"></div>  What do the concept and elements of the legal system demonstrate to us?  Everything that is basic in this structure, what it consists of, and how it is all related.  One can make such a definition: a system of law is a definite whole with an internal structure.  It does not add up arbitrarily, but is a theoretical embodiment of the legal norms that exist in reality.  It also changes, develops and improves in full accordance with the evolution of social relations.

    <p>  The concept and elements <span>of the legal system</span> allow us to see exactly what parts the law consists of and what their interaction is.  We can say that each such structure has developed historically in different <span>parts of the world</span> and even countries.  After all, every society consists of many groups having diverse, sometimes opposing interests and needs.  They must be regulated.  Therefore, various legal norms evolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Concept and elements of the legal system" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/260577.jpg" width="400"></div>  If we examine the concept and elements of the legal system, we will see that unity is the main concept of this organization.  Of course, lawyers and lawmakers have always tried to balance public relations and create a legislative system that would function like a clock.  But practice makes adjustments to these good wishes.  Therefore, the <span>rules of law,</span> although they are harmonized in every way, are usually not always harmonious.  There are so many cases when they contradicted each other.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These very norms represent the basic concepts of law - its basic structural unit.  This is a kind of codified standard of behavior.  The state defines and protects them.  They regulate not all relations in society, but the most important and fundamental ones.  They represent the "pebbles" from which the building of the law is built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Basic concepts of law" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/260585.jpg" width="300"></div>  Depending on the kind of such interconnections in society, norms are grouped by industry - criminal, civil, and so on.  The concept and elements of the legal system also include smaller subdivisions of industries.  This happens when a homogeneous group of norms can be distinguished into even smaller parts.  They are called sub-sectors.

    <p>  There are norms that govern any side of relations in society.  They can come from different industries, but can stand out from one.  They are called legal institutions.  This, for example, the institution of guardianship (family industry), property (civil).  But human rights are a group of norms from various fields (constitutional, criminal, and so on).  Institutions can be classified as procedural and material.  They may also differ in their purpose.  If such elements of the legal system can be divided into even smaller structures, then they are already called sub-institutes. </p><p>  In general, all these terms are more scientific than practical.  The concept and structural elements of the legal system are necessary for lawyers in order to define this phenomenon and to reveal its internal structure and hierarchy. </p>
