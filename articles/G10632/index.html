    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The territory of the United States Phoenix (Arizona) is about 1200 square meters.  km  The city is centrally located in <span>the Sonora Desert.</span>  The territory of Phoenix and its environs is located in the Salt River Valley, which irrigation channels have made dry.  Mountains surround the city from all sides, and it is located in a plain.  This location made it possible to create a network of roads and streets in the village and divide it into 15 quarters. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Initially, Indian tribes lived on the territory of the modern city of Phoenix (Arizona).  To cope with the drought, they created a large irrigation system here, some of which are still in operation.  Nevertheless, the local climate was so dry that the Indians had to leave the city.  The Spaniards who came in their place founded a settlement here under an interesting name, which means "risen from the ashes."  Officially, the status of the city was obtained in 1881.  Since then, it has been continuously growing and developing, and over its short history it has become one of the financial centers of the United States. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arizona Phoenix" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1368786.jpg" width="600"></div>
