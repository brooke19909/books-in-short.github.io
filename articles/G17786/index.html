Accession of Novgorod and Tver to the Moscow Principality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the XI century, the Old Russian state broke up into several independent principalities.  After the invasion of the Tatars and the establishment of the Mongol yoke, the influence of Moscow began to grow.  This small town has become the political center of all Russian lands.  Moscow princes led the struggle against the steppes.  After Dmitry Donskoy defeated Mamai in the Battle of Kulikovo, this leadership position was further strengthened. </p><h2>  Joining Novgorod </h2><p>  However, in addition to Moscow, there were still several rich and important cities that enjoyed independence.  First of all, it was Novgorod and Tver.  They were annexed to Moscow during the <span>reign of Ivan III</span> (1462-1505). </p><p>  Mr. Veliky Novgorod has always stood out from other Russian cities.  In the XII century, the republican system of government was established here.  The power in the city primarily belonged to the veche.  It was a meeting of citizens at which key issues of managing Novgorod by means of voting were decided.  Such democracy existed only in Pskov.  Novgorodians chose a prince.  As a rule, these were rulers from <span>the Rurik dynasty.</span>  The prince could not transfer his power by inheritance, as was done in other ancient Russian cities. </p><p>  The accession of Novgorod and Tver to the Moscow principality led to the breaking of the traditions familiar to local residents.  Ivan III did not like the love of freedom that reigned on the banks of the Volkhov.  In the early years of his reign, a treaty was in effect, according to which the Novgorodians recognized the Moscow autocrat as their patron.  However, there was a party of aristocrats who did not want to strengthen the influence of Ivan.  This group of boyars, led by the posadnik <span>Marfa Boretskaya,</span> entered into an alliance with Lithuania.  Ivan regarded this act as a betrayal.  He declared war to the disobedient.  In 1478, his troops finally entered Novgorod and annexed it to the possessions of the Moscow prince.  The main symbol of freedom of local residents - the veche bell - was dismantled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The position of Mikhail Borisovich </h2><p>  At this time, Tver was still independent from Moscow.  The young prince Mikhail Borisovich ruled in it.  Ivan III was temporarily distracted from his relationship with Tver because of the war with the Mongols.  In 1480, there was a standing on <span>the Ugra River.</span>  After him, Ivan Vasilievich finally got rid of the status of tributary of the Golden Horde. </p><p>  After this, accession to the Moscow principality of Tver began.  On the side of Ivan III was influence and a large army.  Tver became a new victim of the policy of ‚Äúgathering Russian lands‚Äù also because the possessions of Mikhail Borisovich were driven by a wedge between Moscow and Novgorod. </p>

    <h2>  History of Tver </h2><p>  Prior to this, in the XIV century, Tver had every chance to become the center of unification of all East Slavic principalities.  For some time, the rulers of the city even took possession of Vladimir, the ancient capital of the region.  However, the rapid rise of the Tver princes alarmed the Tatars and other Russian rulers.  As a result, the city was the victim of several wars, during which all the neighbors united against it.  Three Tver princes at different times lost their heads in the Horde.  Thanks to this, Moscow won the battle for supremacy over Russian lands.  Ivan III only finished the work that his predecessors began. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Union of Moscow and Tver </h2><p>  The rulers of Tver, having lost their former influence, tried to conclude an alliance with Moscow in which they would be equal members.  Under the father of Ivan III, Vasily the Dark, a troubles began in his possessions.  The war between the grandchildren of Dmitry Donskoy (candidates for the throne) led to the fact that the then Tver prince Boris decided to help one of them.  His choice fell on Basil the Dark.  The rulers agreed that Ivan III would marry the daughter of a Tver prince.  When Vasily finally entrenched on the throne (despite the fact that he was blinded), this alliance was finally formed. </p><p>  However, it was the marriage of Ivan III that made it possible to join the Moscow principality of Tver.  His first son (also Ivan), thanks to his mother, had all the rights to the grandfather's throne. </p>

    <h2>  Relationship cooling </h2><p>  A crack in relations between neighbors appeared when the wife of the Moscow prince Maria Borisovna suddenly died.  After this event, the ambitious and perspicacious Tver boyars began to move to Moscow, anticipating a future war.  Among them was, for example, Daniil Kholmsky - the famous governor and commander.  Joining the Moscow principality of Tver was to happen for unavoidable historical reasons, and the appearance of an occasion was only a matter of time.  Ivan III exalted the defectors, making it clear to the other boyars that it was best for them to go to the service specifically to him.  These measures made joining the Moscow principality of Tver an easy event.  The elite of the absorbed city did not resist the inevitable event. </p><p>  The next blow to Mikhail Borisovich was the appointment of Tver Bishop of Vassian.  In the world, it was the son of one of the commanders of Ivan III.  The new bishop became the eye of the sovereign in a neighboring city.  He did a lot for the accession of Tver to the Moscow principality.  Year after year, the bishop sent Ivan dispatches on the state of mind of the local aristocracy. </p>

    <h2>  New allies of Michael </h2><p>  The last hope of Mikhail Borisovich to maintain independence could be an alliance with the Polish-Lithuanian state.  The accession of Tver to the Moscow principality would be complicated if Western neighbors stood up for it.  At first, Mikhail was guided by the Orthodox magnates and descendants of Gediminas.  He entered into dynastic marriages, but they did not bring any dividends. </p><p>  In 1483, Michael was widowed.  He decided to send a secret embassy to the Polish king Casimir.  The prince wanted to marry his granddaughter and get a reliable ally.  The Poles were Catholics, and in Moscow they were treated more than coolly.  Soon, Ivan III learned of the secret relationships of Michael.  After that, he decided to begin the annexation of Tver to the Moscow principality.  The date of this event was inexorably approaching. </p>

    <h2>  The fall of Tver </h2><p>  At the end of August 1485, Ivan III assembled the faithful regiments.  With them he went to Tver, declaring war on Mikhail Borisovich.  There was nothing to resist the principality.  Michael fled to Poland.  The boyars who remained in the city asked Ivan to take them to their service, thus completing the accession of Tver to the Moscow principality.  Year after year, Ivan gradually left his neighbor without supporters and resources.  In the end, there was an accession to the Moscow principality of Tver.  With whom the townspeople now lived, they could not resist the central government.  Moscow expansion was the logical result of a centuries-long struggle between the specific principalities, in which one was to win.  Under the son of Ivan III Vasily, Pskov and Ryazan were also annexed, which ended the unification of Russia.  Moscow has become a national political center, which no one disputed. </p><p>  The last Tver prince Mikhail Borisovich remained in Poland, where he died peacefully in 1505 (in the same year as Ivan III).  From Casimir he received several estates, in which he lived until his death. </p>
