Why is Salt Lake considered the Siberian Dead Sea?  What legends and myths are associated with the lakes of the village of Okunevo, Omsk region? </p><p>  Russian tales of the power of living and dead water were not so far from the truth.  In folk tales, the heroes and good fellows, in order to get the miraculous water, had to make long journeys full of dangers and unexpected adventures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Secret lake" class="if uuid-2869847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2869847.jpg"></div><p>  In reality, the water of some lakes in Siberia can boast of healing power.  The lakes are located near two rural settlements with the same name - Okunevo, but one of them is located in the Tyumen region, and the other in the Omsk region. </p><h2>  Siberian Dead Sea </h2><p>  Lake Okunevo Berdyuzhsky district of the Tyumen region (Salt Lake) is known throughout Russia.  It is also called the Siberian Dead Sea. </p><p>  It is unique in its natural composition: excess salt in water and healing mud.  With the help of these organic deposits, diseases of the joints, musculoskeletal system, dermatological and gynecological diseases, and infectious diseases can be cured.  There are true legends about the power of the mud of the Salt Lake Okuneva: people who suffer from incurable diseases for years, after visiting the Salt Lake completely restore their health. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mysterious lakes" class="if uuid-2869849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2869849.jpg"></div><p>  However, scientists and doctors who have studied the composition of the water and organic deposits of the Salt Lake warn visitors: too long mud treatment and being in salt water can be harmful. </p><h2>  Help front </h2><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the water of the Salt Lake literally saved the locals of the village of Okunevo.  With the help of simple devices, they evaporated salt from the water in the sun and sent it to the soldiers to the front.  In this way, people helped forge victory and in exchange for salt received food. </p><h2>  Okunevo, Omsk region </h2><p>  This small village located in the Omsk region is known both in Russia and abroad.  It is famous primarily for its lakes, which, according to many, have real healing properties.  To this day, there are legends about the power of the water of the Okuneva lakes, which can cure terrible ailments and rid a person of a chronic disease forever. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turbina.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Five lakes" class="if uuid-2869852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2869852.jpg"></div><p>  The first inhabitants in Okunevo were officially registered at the end of the XVIII century, however, according to the research of historians and archaeologists, people appeared here long before this time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Anomalous zone </h2><p>  Other Okuneva lakes - Linevo, Danilovo, Shaitan Lake, Shchuchye - are known for their unique natural effects and the ability to have a rejuvenating effect on humans.  <span>Siberian shamans</span> have long believed that these lakes were formed as a result of an attack of falling stones - meteorites - from space.  Until now, local residents talk about mysterious glows over lakes, UFO flights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="omskrielt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Okuneva Lake" class="if uuid-2869853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2869853.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, ufologists from all over the country come to the Okuneva lakes in order to see firsthand the anomalous phenomena.  Mysterious multi-colored glows of water, leaving their rays into the sky, were repeatedly documented and photographed. </p><h2>  Mysterious civilization </h2><p>  Among the researchers of Omsk lakes Okuneva there is an opinion that one can find the remains of an ancient civilization here.  Especially interesting in this respect is Shaitan Lake.  It is believed that the water in it is ‚Äúdead‚Äù, and you should be very careful when bathing.  Otherwise, Shaitan Lake can take away the vital energy of a person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shaitan lake photo" class="if uuid-2869861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2869861.jpg"></div><p>  According to local legend, it is at the bottom of this reservoir that an underground temple dedicated to the ancient god of monkeys is located.  Once he was given Siberian lands as a reward for special merits, and here he founded a real city.  But then, due to a natural cataclysm, the city with its temples, shrines and untold riches went under water.  Since then, many adventurers have been dreaming of treasures lurking deep beneath lake silt, but so far no search has been successful. </p><h2>  Mermaids </h2><p>  Mermaids are considered one of the most unusual mythological characters.  Old-timers say that Okuneva lakes can reveal them to special people who will soon find real wealth.  Those lucky ones who observed mermaids splashing in one of the lakes never talk about it.  It is believed that due to the talkative language, a person will miss his luck and can even seriously harm his health. </p><h2>  Tunnel lake </h2><p>  Near Okunev, in addition to the famous four lakes, there is also the mysterious fifth lake - Potenoe.  Anyone who discovers it and bathes in its waters will have good health and a long happy life.  According to the legends of Siberian shamans, the Hidden Lake serves as a tunnel into a parallel world.  It was through him that the ancient people, with the ability to establish a connection with the other world, escorted the souls of the dead and communicated with entities from parallel worlds.  Now the entrance to another world is considered tightly sealed. </p><h2>  Rest, fishing </h2><p>  In addition to the mysterious and amazing stories associated with the Okuneva lakes, these picturesque places of the Omsk region attract tourists from all over Russia.  Here you can enjoy the beautiful forest air, silence, pick mushrooms, berries.  All lakes near Okunev (except for Shaitan Lake) are rich in fish: perch, carp, pike, roach.  You can get to the lakes of Okuneva in the Omsk region by your car and stay for a few days to rest in a tourist tent.  It is best to come to Okunevo in July, when the water in the lakes warms up properly.  Locals say that in the warm days of summer, you can count up to several thousand bathing in healing ponds. </p><p>  Excursion bus tours from various cities of Russia come to the sources of health and strength. </p>
