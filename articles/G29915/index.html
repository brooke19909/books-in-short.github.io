    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In general, our compatriots liked this hotel complex.  The Russians note that all their wishes expressed at the time of booking are taken into account by the administration.  The beach is very close.  The entrance to the water is convenient.  The only negative was the presence of algae in the sea, but this is rather a seasonal disadvantage.  I really liked the fact that beach towels are issued free of charge, without deposit. </p><p>  As for the housing stock, in most reviews the living conditions are called very comfortable.  Many kind words were said about the work of staff who speak different languages. </p><p>  The food, judging by the reviews of our compatriots, is simply excellent.  The restaurant is always a lot of empty seats.  Even five minutes before closing, half-empty trays change to full hot ones.  The waiters are attentive and friendly.  The menu has a lot of fruits, cheeses, there is always fish and delicious pastries.  Many really liked Ayran.  The only negative is the unpleasant taste of hardware coffee. </p><p>  Many Russians emphasize the excellent balance of quality of rest and price, expressing the hope to return to Von Resort Elite more than once. </p>
