  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the female body: anatomical and physiological features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The morphoanatomical difference between the two sexes has a specific name.  In biology, this phenomenon is called sexual dimorphism.  Moreover, the anatomical and physiological differences between men and women are quite extensive, due to genetic material, in particular, the presence of two sex-type X chromosomes.  This feature is the very first, it manifests itself already at the zygote level.  In fact, this means that already at the level of one cell, from which the embryo will later develop, one can judge the sexual difference.  However, it appears only at the level of genetic material. </p><p>  <strong>The anatomical structure of the female body</strong> </p><p>  The biological role of women in human populations is the bearing of children and childbirth.  In accordance with this, <span>the organ systems of</span> women are maximally adapted to carry out this process.  In this case, the genital organs should be distinguished in the anatomical structure.  Due to differences in the structure and physiology of functioning, the floors differ. </p><p>  Among the genitals of a woman, there is a division into external and internal.  Internal organocomplexes include the gonads, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina.  The former are glands with a mixed type of secretion, since they synthesize both sex cells and sex hormones, which have a physiological effect on the whole body of a woman.  The uterus is the organ in which the embryo develops all the time.  For some time after fertilization in an ampoule of the fallopian tube, the egg is in its cavity.  A delay in this anatomical formation leads to an ectopic pregnancy, the bearing of which does not provide for a woman‚Äôs body structure.  Therefore, with such pregnancy complications, it is recommended either to terminate it or to transfer an embryo, although this is a very complicated operation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The uterus is a muscular organ that actively grows during gestation.  She has a vault, body and neck, forming the genital tract of a woman.  On them, the male reproductive cells penetrate into a kind of expansion of the fallopian tube, where the egg is fertilized. </p><p>  The body structure of a woman is subject to an important <span>biological system,</span> within which nature provides all the possibilities for both the development of the fetus and childbirth.  The main anatomical structure that actually forms the birth canal is the vagina.  This hollow organ is located in the pelvis, and its walls limit the mobility of the fetal head at birth. </p><p>  <strong>Female body structure: external genitalia</strong> </p><p>  The external genitalia include mammary glands, large as well as small labia.  The logic of nature, which formed the structure of a woman in the process of phylogenesis, also lies in the possibility of feeding a newborn baby a high-energy product, which is the secret of the mammary glands - human milk.  The process of its allocation is subject to physiological changes in the body of a woman.  During pregnancy, glands develop, and excretory ducts converging in the nipple region begin to form from the secretory departments.  This is controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary system and the <span>hormone prolactin.</span>  As soon as a woman gives birth to a baby, the process of lactation, that is, the release of milk, starts.  Exclusively due to it, the child can eat for several months, and later it is necessary to start using instant cereals in his diet. </p><p>  The structure of the female body also includes auxiliary genital organs located outside.  These are the labia.  Their function is to protect the vestibule of the vagina from the penetration of pathogens.  Moreover, in the labia majora there are special exocrine glands.  They secrete an aromatic secret.  Its need in modern social conditions is not taken into account, since the <span>second</span> human <span>signaling system has</span> developed.  Previously, the secret of these glands served as a verbal signal of readiness for mating.  It is noteworthy that the structure of the female body does not differ only in the genitals, but has its own characteristics in physique, model of thinking, and character. </p>
