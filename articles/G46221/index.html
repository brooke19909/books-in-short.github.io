In such situations, notifications from a financial institution may follow each other to no avail.  But at the same time, the person does not respond to warnings.  Bank representatives usually wait 60 days, during which they give the customer the opportunity to pay past due installments without reminding them of the debt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what threatens for non-payment of a loan" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/366942.jpg" width="480"></div>  At the same time, many customers do not think at all about what threatens them for non-payment of a loan to the bank.

    <h2>  Contract </h2><p>  Given the fact that various unforeseen situations may occur in life, a specific period is provided for solving the problems that have arisen.  Two months is enough to somehow collect the required amount.  After the specified time has elapsed, the organization has the right to contact a collection company, and a big debtor will face big problems.  <span>The Bank goes</span> to such extreme measure only in hopeless cases.  Sometimes a visit to a financial institution and a conversation with the manager can provide another additional month of delay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what threatens non-payment of a loan to the bank" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/367434.jpg" width="321"></div>  It is much easier to negotiate with the bank.  They will meet you, they can rewrite the payment schedule in accordance with your wishes and explain what threatens the non-payment of the loan to the bank.

The bulk of overdue loans are consumer loans, the issuance of which was maximally simplified.  Previously, banks did not make claims against petty defaulters and sued mainly with legal entities.  Now they are fighting for every overdue loan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan default" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/366944.jpg?1396693081186" width="600"></div>  Each contract has clause 1 of <span>art.</span>  <span>819 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation,</span> which provides for the payment by the borrower of the loan amount.  It indicates that the client is liable to the bank for property collateral.  It also spells out in detail what threatens for non-payment of a loan.  However, paragraph 1 of Art.  333 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation can help a person in a difficult situation fight penalties and fines.

    <h2>  Collection companies </h2><p>  If the situation got out of control, and the malicious deadbeat simply does not respond to calls from the bank, employees of the collection company will visit him and will explain in a very cultural way how wrong the person is and what troubles his irresponsibility will bring him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan default consequences" class="if" height="467" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/366938.jpg?1396633431047" width="350"></div>  The main sanctions that can be expected in case of non-payment are spelled out in the loan agreement, and you should carefully read this document before endorsing it.  In case of temporary difficulties for the main debtor, the amount of the overdue contribution can be paid by a third party, presenting the bank employees with their passport.

The very next day after you miss the installment date, a penalty in the amount of 0.01% of the principal loan amount is added to the total debt.  It would seem that the percentage is ridiculous, but it is worth considering how much it is charged on a daily basis.  It turns out that you have to pay a lot. </p><h2>  Bank Rights </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the criminal liability does not threaten the payer.  However, you can lose your property, by court order, it will go to the bank.  If you have taken a mortgage loan and you have arrears for more than 60 days, the management of a financial institution has the right to auction your apartment.  The main amount will go to repay the loan debt.  Costs also have to pay the debtor. </p><p>  The collection company, taking up the return of the debt, receives 50% of the amount from the bank, so material interest forces the company representatives to act very tough.  It must be understood that failure to pay a loan cannot go unpunished - the consequences can be very dire. </p><h2>  Pressure on the debtor </h2><p>  Acting within the framework of the law, collectors begin with a usual explanatory conversation on the topic of what threatens for non-payment of a loan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible not to pay a loan" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/366937.jpg?1396633592826" width="360"></div>  Further, their actions become more aggressive.  According to the law, a company that has taken over the debt can go to court.  The property of a person who does not pay arrears will be described and sold at auction at the lowest prices.

    <p>  However, some collectors, in order to avoid judicial red tape, begin to morally attack the debtor.  Various methods are used: annoying with calls, warnings, they can inform you at your place of work or go around all the neighbors with stories about your duty. </p><p>  For a period of time, loans were issued on the basis of a simple application for a loan.  No additional data was needed, but practice has shown that the bank needs to protect itself from non-payment of loans.  To the bulk of the funds did not "hang in the air", the management had to tighten the conditions for issuing loans. </p><h2>  Fraudsters and "honest defaulters" </h2><p>  Banks strictly classify debtors into two categories.  The first is scammers who take loans under forged documents and hide from representatives of the institution.  They believe that it is possible not to repay the loan - they won‚Äôt have anything for it.  The second category is ordinary citizens who suddenly find themselves in difficult conditions.  With all their desire, they are not able to pay the monthly amount.  Often, such citizens apply (of course, not for free) to an anti-collection firm in order to avoid contacts with their opponents, since communication with them does not bode well.  So, it‚Äôs quite clear that the big problems are the failure to pay the loan.  What threatens this and what can happen with the intervention of the judiciary? </p><h2>  Deferment </h2><p>  If there is a force majeure situation and you have delayed payment of a loan, do not hide from the bank.  It is better to calmly talk with his representative, explain the situation and together decide how to proceed in the future.  Sometimes a client can count on a short vacation.  However, you should not take lightly the deferment granted to you - the amount must be paid necessarily, otherwise the bank will go to extreme measures.  At first, many debtors do not quite understand what is the failure to pay a loan, what threatens such a situation and what consequences it may cause. </p><h2>  Auction </h2><p>  If your loan is secured by property, the bank has the right to demand its sale as soon as possible.  Representatives of the organization will judicially seek an auction.  Do not bring this up, as your property will be sold at the lowest cost.  And it is not a fact that the proceeds will cover the total debt with all its fines and penalties.  If the court decided to impose a <span>penalty on wages,</span> then the debtor will only have a living wage, and the rest of the money will automatically be collected in favor of the bank to repay the loan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="non-payment of the loan than the forum threatens" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/366939.jpg?1396633503278" width="460"></div>

    <p>  Some people can share their personal experience by answering a question about what is fraught with non-payment of a loan, what threatens.  The forum always discusses all relevant issues in our lives.  Here, people will tell you how they got out of such situations and give advice.  Of course, you can find the answer to the question of whether it is possible not to pay a loan at all.  But is it worth it?  After all, now you know what this threatens. </p><p>  The law allows a bank to transfer a disputed loan to collect a debt from another organization.  About this he is obliged to notify the negligent client.  Otherwise, the debtor may appeal this decision. </p><p>  If the bank has ascertained that the client is a fraudster, he may demand that the law enforcement authorities institute criminal proceedings on this fact.  However, in this case, representatives of the financial and credit organization must prove that a similar fact has occurred. </p>
