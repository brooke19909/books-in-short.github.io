  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simple patterns with knitting needles: we knit quickly and beautifully</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For every craftswoman who is friends with knitting needles, it is a matter of honor to associate a beautiful thing to please their household.  But not everyone can immediately capture a beautiful pattern selected from a magazine.  Novice knitters first need to gain experience in order to understand how to make simple patterns with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Oh, these patterns! </h2><p>  If you want to understand the science of knitting, then first you need to familiarize yourself with the main types of loops, learn how they can be recognized and knitted.  Already by name alone it is clear that simple patterns with knitting needles are very simple.  So that a novice craftswoman can fulfill them, she needs to master the main types of loops, that is, the front and back.  After all, all the other loops are knitted precisely from these.  And then you need to understand that almost any pattern pattern uses a combination of garter and hosiery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knittingbypost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting" class="if uuid-3111063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45860/3111063.jpg"></div><p>  After learning the basics of this science, it‚Äôs time to start knitting simple patterns with knitting needles. </p><p>  Knitting with needles is called facial stitching.  To design the pattern, you just need to alternate the rows of front and back loops.  If knitting goes in a circle, then all the loops are knitted according to the pattern. </p><p>  Garter stitching is done with only one type of stitch.  When a woman knits a scarf pattern, she uses either the front or the back loops.  Moreover, she can independently choose those loops that she gets best.  If the product is turned over, the loops are knitted on the contrary, therefore, in the odd ones they will be purl, and in the even ones they will be facial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mesh Patent Pattern </h2><p>  So, knitting patterns are simple.  A description of one of them will show that knitting really does not require special efforts, and the result will please not only the craftswoman, but also the one for whom she will make a product with such a pattern. </p><p>  Here, the crochets are located on the front side, like a net.  From here came the name of the pattern - latticed or mesh. </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to dial an odd number of loops. </li><li>  The first row (this will be the wrong side): hem, * one front, one removed with a double crochet, as the wrong side;  repeat from *, end with one front and one edge. </li><li>  The second row (this is the front): edge, one front;  * the loop before the yarn is crocheted face, the yarn is removed as purse, and the thread is held behind the yarn, knit one front;  repeat from *, edge. </li><li>  The third row (wrong side): hem, * one loop is removed with a yarn, like the wrong side, knit the loop and yarn together with the front;  repeat everything from *, end like this: remove one loop with a crochet like a purl edge hem. </li><li>  Fourth row (front): hem, * we knit one front, remove the yarn like the wrong one, one front;  repeat knitting from *, end like this: one front, remove the yarn like the wrong one, hem. </li><li>  Fifth row (wrong side): hem eyelet, * knit the yarn and yarn together with the yarn together, remove one yarn with the yarn like the wrong yarn;  repeat from *, end the row as follows: knit the loop and the crochet together, edge. </li></ul><p>  Repeat everything from the second to fifth rows. </p><h2>  Beautiful herringbone pattern </h2><p>  Simple patterns with knitting needles include this interesting knitting, thanks to it the fabric is made dense.  If you look at its front side, it may seem that this is fabric.  It is necessary to knit by choosing either thick yarn or yarn of medium thickness.  Knitting needles are thick.  Such a pattern is suitable for making a pullover, sweater, poncho. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.pinterest.com/elenamunozarauz/espina-de-pez/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern &amp; quot; Herringbone &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-3107774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3107774.jpg"></div><p>  The rapport is only eighteen loops plus one and plus two hem. </p><p>  In the first row, the hem is removed, the next two loops are knitted together with the front for the rear walls.  From the left knitting needle, remove the loop located to the right.  Again, knit two loops together behind the back wall.  Remove only the right loop, leave the second on the left knitting needle.  So knit to the end of the row to get such a simple, but pretty pattern.  The last two stitches on the needle are knitted, one remains.  It must be tied to the front. </p><p>  The second row to start with the edge, like the first.  Next, knit together the wrong two loops.  Remove the loop located on the right from the left knitting needle.  Again, knit the two loops together from the wrong side and repeat the situation, but removing one loop located to the right.  So complete the series.  Tie the last remaining loop back. </p><p>  Two rows of knit in turn.  As a result, we get a little pattern, very similar to the branches of Christmas trees. </p><h2>  Embossed patterns </h2><p>  Such patterns are obtained due to the alternation of the front and back loops.  The finished canvas looks quite dense and three-dimensional due to the combination of a concave and convex section.  Therefore, such patterns are always very expressive.  A thing knitted with a relief pattern is not recommended to be ironed, because the relief may lose its shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allfreeknitting.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.allfreeknitting.com/Dish/Knit-and-Purl-Dishcloths"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pearl pattern" class="if uuid-3107786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3107786.jpg"></div><p>  The pearl pattern fits so well.  Loops are typed (their number at the request of the craftswoman).  Knit the first loop front, the second purl and so on until the end of the row.  Now, when the canvas is turned inside out, over the loop that was tied to the front, you need to tie the wrong side and vice versa. </p><p>  Rice pattern.  It fits in a similar way, but in the drawing it gradually shifts.  Loops are typed.  Tie the first loop to the front, then the second to the wrong one, and so on until the end of the row.  In the second row, the loops will change places: first knit the wrong side, then the front one, and so on.  In the third row, where was the front, it will be purl and vice versa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lionbrand.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.lionbrand.com/blog/studio-window-scarves-pt-4-claire-andrea-experiment-with-stitch-patterns/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting pattern" class="if uuid-3107824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3107824.jpg"></div><p>  This is how these simple patterns are made with knitting needles. </p><h2>  And about lace ... </h2><p>  And now let's pay attention to the patterns that many craftswomen like to knit.  The simple openwork pattern considered in this article with knitting needles looks very interesting when knitting sectional color with threads.  It is quite suitable for bedspreads, stoles, napkins.  During knitting, a wavy edge of the pattern is obtained, quite wavy.  Knit in a fairly simple pattern. </p><p>  It has 27 loops, plus one for symmetry, plus two hem. </p><p>  First row: </p><ul><li>  front loop, double crochet, front, double crochet, facial, double crochet, facial, double crochet, facial, facial; </li><li>  knit the following four stitches as follows: two stitches together front with a slope to the right; </li><li>  the next four loops fit like this: two front loops with an inclination to the right; </li><li>  facial, facial, yarn, facial, yarn, yarn, yarn, facial, yarn. </li></ul><p>  The second row is knitted only with facial loops. </p><p>  In such a simple way, a neat openwork is obtained. </p>
