This country is rich in priceless historical monuments that tourists from all over the world seek to see.  In addition, Greek resorts are among the best places to relax on the planet.  Among them, a special place is occupied by the Halkidiki Peninsula.  This is one of the greenest places in all of mainland Greece. </p><h2>  Famous greek trident </h2><p>  The peninsula of Halkidiki has the shape of a trident, which consists of three small peninsulas: Kassandra, Athos (Agion-Orosa) and Sithonia.  They are located on the northern coast of the Aegean Sea.  Compared to the southern <span>Greek islands,</span> which are distinguished by sparse vegetation and rocky shores, this coast of Greece is buried in lushly flowering gardens of fruit and ornamental plants.  There are many resort villages in which there are magnificent hotels of all categories.  Among them, the most popular are three-star hotels offering a quiet and comfortable stay for couples.  These include Julia Hotel 3 * (Halkidiki / Kassandra).  On the peninsula, almost all beaches are municipal.  Unlike the southern coast, here you can find sandy recreation areas, but most often they are small-pebble.  And also on Halkidiki there are many <span>wild beaches that</span> have retained their pristine beauty.  It is here that couples in love love to relax, and sometimes you can meet a gorgeous snow-white yacht of some multibillionaire, lonely swaying on the azure waters of the Aegean Sea. </p>

    <h2>  Kassandra </h2><p>  As already mentioned, one of the ‚Äúfingers‚Äù (the most western) of Halkidiki is called Kassandra.  Its coastline has a length of 50 km.  It is the most densely populated of the three peninsulas.  There are about 45 villages.  However, in width it is not at all large - only 15 km.  But this does not at all prevent tourists who dream of a relaxing holiday from here to seek.  After all, most hotels, although located near the villages, are, however, fenced off from them.  And Kassandra attracts tourists with its poetic name.  Everyone wants to get to a place called so melodiously.  Here, as elsewhere in Halkidiki, three-star hotels are popular, offering tourists a fairly high level of service at relatively low prices.  This can be said about the aforementioned Julia Hotel 3 * hotel.  Affordable prices attract young people here.  In addition, there is a huge number of entertainment venues: discos, bars, night clubs, restaurants and taverns.  In addition to young people, couples with children like to relax on Kassandra.  In addition to natural beauties, the area is characterized by a mild climate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="julia hotel 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/653748.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Julia Hotel 3 * (Greece / Fourka): general description and location </h2><p>  This cozy hotel, as you already know, is located on the Kassandra peninsula, near the village of Fourka, right at the foot of the mountain with the same name as the village itself.  The nearest airport is Macedonia, 90 km from Thessaloniki.  Tourists who choose this hotel will find peace and <span>tranquility here.</span>  <span>This</span> small hotel is literally immersed in the greenery of tropical trees and brightly <span>flowering shrubs.</span>  Needless to say, a kind of aromatherapy for hotel guests ... But from the windows of the upper floors there is a beautiful view of the sea.  The nearest beach can be reached in just 5-7 minutes, and the path runs along the picturesque paths. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Julia Hotel 3 * has a total of 37 standard rooms decorated in light pastel colors.  Among them are single and double apartments.  All rooms are furnished with modern furniture and electrical appliances (air conditioning with two modes, TV with satellite channels, refrigerator and minibar (for a fee), etc.), which contribute to a comfortable rest for tourists.  Each room has a balcony with comfortable summer furniture - a table and chairs, comfortably placed on which you can spend time under the starry sky of Greece.  All rooms include kitchenettes with <span>electric hobs.</span>  Of course, in a hotel with an all-inclusive food system, guests rarely use the kitchen, but you can‚Äôt do without it if a family comes with young children who need special meals.  By the way, Greece has a particularly warm attitude towards children.  For their convenience, the Julia Hotel 3 * always has cots and high chairs, which are available for tourists upon request.  Each staff member wishes to be helpful to families that have kids.  And in general, the Greeks are distinguished by special cordiality.  Often friendships are established between the hotel owner and other team members.  This is evidenced by the numerous positive reviews of guests at the tourist portals.  As for the bathroom, here everything is at the highest level: sink, shower or bath, bath and toilet accessories, hair dryer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Every day, except Sunday, guest rooms are carefully cleaned.  Linen and towels are changed every other day.  In reviews devoted to rest in Greek hotels, as a rule, you will not find complaints or complaints about cleanliness and order.  What can not be said, for example, about Turkey.  The Greeks are very clean.  Even the most modest hotel shines with cleanliness and freshness. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Despite the small territory occupied by the hotel, it has a well-developed infrastructure.  There is wireless internet.  In front of the building, right in the middle of the green park, there is a spacious pool, next to which there is a comfortable area with sunbeds, umbrellas and a pool bar where you can relax and sunbathe.  There is also a small pool for babies, as well as a playground with swings and slides.  There is a parking lot where you can rent a car (from 30 euros per day).  There are no kiosks and shops in the hotel, but you can buy everything you need in a supermarket or in shops located next to the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As already noted, the Julia Hotel 3 * has an all inclusive system.  During the main hours of the restaurant, the restaurant serves a buffet full of various hot and cold dishes, drinks, salads, desserts, etc. However, tourists can always have lunch and dinner at nearby taverns and restaurants serving local and international dishes. </p><h2>  Julia Hotel 3 *: guest reviews and ratings </h2><p>  Everyone who reads comments about this establishment should understand that this is not a 5- or 4-star hotel, but the most ordinary 3 * budget hotel.  Nevertheless, the reviews of vacationers indicate that the service, and conditions, and the friendliness of the staff here are at the highest level.  And the biggest plus of the hotel, as almost all guests note, is cleanliness, which is more important than many other attributes. </p>
