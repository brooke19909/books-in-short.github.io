Lyrically inclined people will be drawn to admire nature.  Be sure to visit West Lake, or Lake Xihu.  Around it are concentrated many interesting corners that have poetic names.  The lake is divided into five sections by dams and is surrounded by numerous pagodas.  It has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10.8 square meters.  km  Exquisitely carved boating is popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baochu Pagoda" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1426211.jpg" width="600"></div>  China has always treated the lake as a national treasure.  Here is the imperial palace, around which the park is divided.  Open space is constantly expanding, night parks are added, in which music plays.  There is an ancient legend about the immortal White Snake, who lives in the lake and knows how to turn into a woman.  On the islands of the lake there are three ancient low (two meters) stone pagodas, which are in the form of pumpkins with an elongated neck.  There are round holes in their walls.  At night, in the autumn, a fire is lit inside.  Passing through round holes, it gives the impression that the moon is repeatedly reflected in the water.
