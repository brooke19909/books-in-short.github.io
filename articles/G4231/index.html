And if winter takes its exquisite beauty, spring takes a riot of colors, then fall is characterized by a cool dawn, a wealth of flowers and an indescribable charm.  This is probably why our ancestors chose this period of the year to celebrate the harvest festival, on which the collected belongings were counted on the eve of long winter nights.  And the main autumn hero was rightfully considered a pumpkin, which is not only very tasty and healthy, but can also help create a special festive atmosphere in the house.  And in today's article we will look at how to make a vase from pumpkin. </p><h2>  A bit of foreword </h2>

    <p>  As practice shows, pumpkins create simply magnificent vases that will serve not only as an original decorative decoration on the festive table, but also as an indicator of your skill.  In addition, thanks to additional decorative elements (seasonal berries, leaves, flowers), a very beautiful pumpkin vase with flowers is obtained.  Also, when adding carving from a variety of vegetables (cutting roses, chamomiles, chrysanthemums from them), you can create a simply unforgettable masterpiece that will amaze everyone present to the core. </p><h2>  What do you need to know? </h2><p>  In order for everything to work out, and your pumpkin vase turned out for a feast for the eyes, you need to choose not very <span>large fruits,</span> and often very small ones.  But, of course, one must be guided in this case by the size of the proposed vase.  For example, for the floor you need to choose the largest.  But here it is worth paying special attention to the shape of the fetus, which can be either rounded or oblong.  The only unpleasant moment is that subsequently you can be very upset - such a pumpkin vase is not very durable.  But if you do everything properly and slowly (to peel the pulp and dry it), then the service life can increase significantly.  In addition, it is not in vain that for most peoples, crafts from this fruit symbolize protection from evil spirits.  Therefore, we will not hesitate and, finally, tell you how to make such a vase of pumpkin, the master class of which is presented below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What do we need? </h2>

    <p>  First of all, we get 5-6 pumpkins, thoroughly wash the purchased fruits under running water and wipe them well until they dry completely.  After this, slowly cut off their upper part so that an opening is formed in them, the diameter of which will allow you to place a glass with flowers.  Next, using a spoon, we clean the flesh from it and wipe it again with towels from paper until it dries completely.  For flowers, both glass glasses and cut them out of a plastic bottle can be placed in the fruit.  In addition, a pumpkin vase looks original, in which floristic lips for flowers are used as a flower stand.  After the cup is selected, we place it inside the fetus, not forgetting first to make sure that it matches the size.  If this is not the case, then the opening can be slightly increased.  Next, we proceed to decorate your future product.  Today there are several design options. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  DIY shiny pumpkin vase </h2>

    <p>  If you want to make your product shine, then in this case we will need sugar or <span>Epsom salt.</span>  But, given the fact that the last ingredient is available only to residents of the United Kingdom, and to the inhabitants of our country, it is known as <span>sodium sulfate,</span> which is sold in pharmacies, there is nothing left to do but use sugar.  Therefore, we begin with the fact that we apply <span>glue-varnish for decoupage</span> on the surface of the fruit <span>,</span> which is not only distinguished by its strength, but also by its high quality.  Next, put a pumpkin spread with glue in a container with sugar and dip it evenly on all sides so that the sugar sticks evenly.  Here we have a shiny pumpkin vase. </p><h2>  Vintage vase </h2>

    <p>  The effect of antiquity is currently used in almost all needlework styles.  Therefore, it is not surprising that he can also be present in this product.  So, in order to give our craft a little old charm, we take 1 more fruit and, using white spray paint, change its color.  Next, leave it to dry for a while.  After it dries, we take an emery cloth and grind it a little until gaps with an <span>orange color</span> appear <span>.</span>  Agree that such a vase will look not only very original, but also pretty enough. </p><h2>  How to make a colorful vase from pumpkin? </h2>

    <p>  Want your product to stand out?  Then, using bright shreds of fabric, you can make a fun and very juicy vase.  For this purpose, we cut ribbons of fabric of different colors, the width of which should not exceed 15 mm.  After that, apply glue-varnish to 1/3 of the fruit and begin to glue the tape on this area.  After a while, when they dry out a bit, go to the next area and repeat the same procedure on it.  After everything is finished, all that remains is to admire the unique beauty of the resulting product.  And what is especially important, when you look at it, no one will even think of what could serve as a basis for the vase. </p><h2>  Traditional option </h2><p>  The easiest option for creating <span>crafts from pumpkins</span> - vases - today is considered a way in which you just need to cut off the upper part from it.  Next, using a spoon, you need to clean it, dry it and put a glass with flowers in it.  In addition, its main difference from others is that it is completely devoid of decorative elements.  But, as practice shows, if you draw a parallel between such a vase and decorated, then we can say that it is not without its charm.  What to do, of course, is up to you to decide.  The only thing I want to say: starting to create, you need to listen to both your heart and imagination.  Therefore, it is especially recommended that before you start to do something, present an image of what you want to get in the end.  After that, take a pencil and draw it on a piece of paper.  And most importantly, do not be afraid that something might not work out.  Without trial and error, you will never achieve what you want.  And we hope that the tips presented in this article will help you achieve your goal. </p>
