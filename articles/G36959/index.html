This practice is quite common in oriental hotels, so many tourists try to choose the period of stay at the resort in such a way that it coincides with any solemn date.  This hotel provides compliments to the newlyweds as well as those on their birthday. </p><p>  If you want to spend your honeymoon at the resort, be sure to include this information at the time of purchase or booking a ticket.  Upon arrival at the hotel, you should remind the administration of the purpose of your visit and present supporting documents (the original or a copy of the marriage certificate).  If you did everything right, you will receive a large basket of fruits as a gift. </p><p>  The hotel will not disregard also those guests who during their stay at the resort celebrate their birthday.  A pleasant bonus for them will be a small, but very tasty and elegant birthday cake.  To become a member of the bonus program, indicate your date of birth at the time of purchase of the tour, as well as remind the receptionist about it directly during registration and check-in at the hotel. </p>
