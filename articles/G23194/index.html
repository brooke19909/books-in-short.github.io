A very convenient location makes it the most popular establishment of this kind in this resort.  Both adults and children can have a good time.  Dolphin was initially oriented towards family vacations.  Its popularity is explained, among other things, by very low prices for attractions, as well as a well-established work schedule.  Since the territory of the water park "Dolphin" is very small, it is convenient for parents to watch the children. </p>
