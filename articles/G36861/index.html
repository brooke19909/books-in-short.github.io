    <h2>  Beautiful legend </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine a modern city without the Bakhchisaray Palace.  And there is a beautiful legend about its occurrence.  Traditions say that once during a hunt the son of Mengli Giray saw a snake battle.  Watching them, he noticed that the defeated half-dead reptile barely crawled to the river, and when it got out of it, it was healed.  At that time, the young khan was thinking about the hard battle of his people with the Golden Horde.  He thought that his family was doomed like this snake, but when he saw a miracle, he hastened to tell his father about a good sign. </p><p>  And so it happened: the news of a grave victory over the enemy came to their castle.  The lucky khan ordered the construction of a magnificent palace on the site of the snake battle, and the reptiles themselves were depicted on the coat of arms of the new city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea Bakhchisaray" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/862015.jpg" width="356"></div>

Bakhchisaray is his pearl, his pride.  The name of the city is translated into Russian as "a palace in the gardens."  According to researchers, it arose at the end of the sixteenth century.  At that time, the <span>Crimean Khanate</span> waged a struggle for independence from the Horde and finally received it.  The new city on the banks of the Churuk-Su River has become the capital.  And at the gates of the palace you can still see the image of the battle of snakes. </p><p>  The city itself is located on the slopes of the Crimean mountains in the valley of the Churuk-Su river, surrounded by a forest-steppe.  It is only thirty kilometers from Simferopol.  This is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãamazing beauty and landscape, with a rich historical past and unique recreational opportunities. </p><h2>  Khan's Palace </h2><p>  Let's start a virtual trip with the most famous sights of the city.  That is, from the Bakhchisaray Palace.  Having passed the gate, which shows the <span>family coat of arms of</span> Gireyev, you will find yourself in a large courtyard.  Here, in a territory surrounded by walls, once an army gathered before the campaign.  To the left near the mosque are the Khan's cemetery and mausoleum, where many rulers of the Crimea found the last refuge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bakhchisaray excursions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/862016.jpg" width="338"></div>

    <p>  The modern palace is the result of careful reconstruction and reconstruction, since the building itself was completely burned by Russian soldiers in 1736.  Before the visit of Catherine II, the building was again repaired by order of the Governor-General de Ribas, one of the <span>founders of Odessa.</span>  And at the end of the eighteenth century, the palace was declared a monument of oriental architecture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A feature of the <span>Bakhchisaray Palace</span> is a very modest (in comparison with the residences of other eastern rulers) appearance.  But all his wealth is within.  Here you should definitely pay attention to: </p><ul><li>  The Hall of the Council and the Court, where the fate of the region has been for many centuries. </li><li>  Pool garden of rare beauty. </li><li>  A small mosque where she prayed to know. </li><li>  The sofa, that is, the council of elders. </li><li>  A harem with four buildings of lawful wives and with many small rooms. </li><li>  Summer arbor and fountains. </li><li>  Selsebil, or the Fountain of Tears, dedicated to Dilara Bikech, the lawful wife of the khan, who died very early; </li><li>  Catherine‚Äôs mile, framed by columns. </li></ul><h2>  Museum complex </h2><p>  The city that the Crimean peninsula is rightly proud of is Bakhchisaray.  And the settlement itself carefully guards the palace in paradise gardens as a memory of the turbulent past.  During World War II, many relics were saved - they were hidden in the caves of Chufut-Kale, but some of them were taken away by the Nazis and lost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bakhchisarai how to get" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/862030.jpg" width="600"></div>
