This is especially true for advanced models that had rich functionality and supported all modern formats.  They are often used by drivers who do not want to overpay for new features that they will not use anyway, but will not give up the high-quality sound of the same CDs or familiar radio stations.  One such radio is the Pioneer DEH-P6000UB.  Let's look at its main features, as well as analyze the feedback accumulated over recent years to understand its positive and negative sides. </p><h2>  Design and appearance </h2><p>  The radio tape recorder is compact, mounted on a classic seat.  She does not need to prepare a large nest, as for the <span>2-DIN radio,</span> which also will not look good in every car.  The appearance is pleasant and emphasizes the rather high cost of the device, allows it to look status and fits well into most automotive interiors.  The display received a fairly high-quality matrix that allows you to easily read information regardless of the viewing angle.  Bright illumination does not interfere with the display of characters and does not illuminate those blocks that are currently inactive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pioneerelectronics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh p6000ub panel" class="if uuid-2915632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2915632.jpg"></div><p>  The control keys and the rotary knob are located in convenient places, and allow you to not be too distracted from movement while switching tracks or radio stations.  However, to further facilitate this process, you can install a special remote control on the steering wheel, if it is not there initially.  The connection interface in the Pioneer DEH-P6000UB is standard, so when choosing a remote control, you should pay attention only to ease of use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sound sources </h2><p>  Since the radio tape recorder has been released for a long time, it cannot work with modern data storage standards and device connection protocols.  This suggests that you can‚Äôt connect the phone wirelessly to it or insert a USB flash drive with your playlist.  However, at the same time, she still has a good selection of options from where to play sound files. </p><p>  The main among them is the built-in drive with anti-shock system.  It can play music both with an AudioCD with high quality recordings without compression, and with the more familiar MP3 format, the quality of which is inferior due to more data compression.  To select the desired track, a two-line display is used, which is quite convenient, since it allows you to see the maximum information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caraudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh p6000ub connection" class="if uuid-2915633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2915633.jpg"></div><p>  With the Pioneer DEH-P6000UB you can listen to ordinary radio stations.  It has a built-in scanning system for available frequencies with a confident reception, which you can use to search for your favorite station.  If you don‚Äôt like music played on the radio, then you can connect any player or phone through the AUX input.  In this case, the radio will act as an amplifier, and all other controls will be on the player, including the track switching buttons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Installation and first setup </h2><p>  Almost every driver can deliver a radio tape recorder without assistance.  To connect the Pioneer DEH-P6000UB, standard connectors are used.  Therefore, if a radio was previously installed in the car, then most likely it will not be necessary to redo the wiring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.okidoki.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh p6000ub reviews" class="if uuid-2912984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2912984.jpg"></div><p>  On the rear panel, in addition to standard inputs and outputs designed to supply power and transmit sound to the speakers, there is also a separate output to the subwoofer.  It does not have a powerful amplifier and transmits a linear signal, so an additional bass speaker should be purchased and installed together with a separate amplifier. </p><p>  The Pioneer DEH-P6000UB can be set up quite quickly using the complete instruction manual.  To make it easier to do, a simple infrared remote control is provided in the kit.  Often it is used only for setting parameters, since it is very inconvenient to use it for control while the car is moving. </p><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  Most of the key parameters can be called standard for this class of audio equipment.  So, the characteristics of the Pioneer DEH-P6000UB are enough to connect up to 4 speakers with a power of 50 watts each to the built-in amplifier.  To connect additional equipment, a special IP-BUS data bus connector is provided, which allows you to expand the capabilities of the gadget if you wish by installing a special Bluetooth adapter.  Thanks to him, the radio can work in headset mode, not only playing music wirelessly, but also allowing you to talk on the phone while driving without distractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mans.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio 2 din" class="if uuid-2912981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2912981.jpg"></div><h2>  User opinion on the radio </h2><p>  After analyzing the reviews about the Pioneer DEH-P6000UB, you can highlight the main positive points that are mentioned by drivers most often.  This list includes: </p><ul><li>  Quality sound.  The radio tape recorder is capable of producing a natural and lively sound, in which each instrument participating in the recording of a musical composition is clearly audible. </li><li>  Pleasant appearance.  The strict design and the absence of annoying flashing indicators allow the radio to look more expensive than it actually is, and not attract inappropriate attention.  It does not look bulky, like a 2-DIN radio with large displays. </li><li>  Ability to connect devices from Apple with control using the keys of the radio.  Through the interface connector on the rear panel, you can connect most of the modern smartphones and players produced by this company and play music without losing signal quality, switching between tracks not from the phone, but directly from the radio buttons. </li><li>  Nice and clear menu.  During the setup, there are no unnecessary problems, everything is intuitive and simple even for those who have not read the instructions. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.okidoki.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh p6000ub specifications" class="if uuid-2912983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2912983.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  Not without some drawbacks, which should also be known and taken into account when planning a purchase.  One of the key inconveniences, drivers call the control of almost all functions using a rotating manipulator.  As practice has shown, due to frequent use, it can quickly fail. </p><p>  Another drawback of the Pioneer DEH-P6000UB is the inconvenient front panel mount.  After its removal, you have to spend quite a lot of time to return everything to its place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cardomain.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="box pioneer deh p6000ub" class="if uuid-2912986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2912986.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Although the radio was released a long time ago, it has not lost its relevance.  Easy to install, configure and use is a strong feature of not every losing device for a car.  Here, these pluses came together together with high-quality sound and a fairly wide range of audio inputs. </p><p>  If you need a relatively inexpensive option that will allow you to easily listen to your favorite audio recordings in the car, then this radio can be called optimal for these purposes. </p>
