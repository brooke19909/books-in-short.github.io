Sochi has always been very attractive to any tourist, and with the advent of the stunning city hotel Velvet Seasons, it has become able to surpass any European resort in terms of comfort.  Four huge complexes are located on its territory, each of which is ready to offer guests the best conditions.  However, today we will not consider everything.

    <h2>  Summer - Beach Time </h2><p>  Of course, all entertainment fades in front of the golden beach.  It is about how we bask in the warm sand that we dream of on winter evenings.  So, you need to pre-purchase tickets to Sochi.  Velvet Seasons (Chistye Prudy) are located directly on the coast.  Only 200 meters from the hotel buildings - and you find yourself on a city equipped beach.  Completely free you can sunbathe and swim, but if you like a more comfortable stay, you will have to pay extra separately.  Umbrellas and sunbeds, all kinds of water activities (water skiing and scooters, windsurfing and much more) - all these are commercial services. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  However, no matter how beautiful it is around, tourists are primarily interested in living conditions.  Believe me, you will not be disappointed if you visit Sochi.  ‚ÄúVelvet Seasons‚Äù (‚ÄúClean Ponds‚Äù in particular) was built according to European standards, and the priority was to provide the most comfortable conditions for vacationers.  The choice of apartments is quite large.  The hotel complex includes nineteen five-story buildings, each of which is ready to provide you with rooms of various comforts.  In total, the apart-hotel is designed for 1148 rooms, that is, it can accommodate more than 2200 people.  About 600 rooms offer stunning views of the sea, about the same with a view of the lakes and the mountain peaks of Krasnaya Polyana. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel clean ponds sochi" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1058439.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourist trips </h2><p>  The Chistye Prudy complex (Sochi) is located in one of the most beautiful corners of Russia.  Here at any time of the year there is something to see and what to do, so if you like movement, and there is a craving for adventure, then you will definitely like it here.  On the first day, we recommend a walk through the magnificent park near the hotel, as well as admire the stunning lakes.  When it's boring - choose any route and go on a trip. </p><p>  Local mineral springs are famous throughout the country, so do not be too lazy to visit the Chvizhepsinsky narzan spring, which is located in a village called the Bear Corner.  Here everyone can taste the healing water with a unique composition.  Having taken care of your health, you can go look at the largest and most beautiful Akhshtyr cave, which is located in the picturesque Dzikhrinsky gorge.  Stunning surroundings, including the Dry and Wet Canyons of the Psaho Mountain River, are a topic for a separate route.  Here you will find rivers and waterfalls, huge cliffs overgrown with forests, as well as karst caves.  Traveling through these gorges, you can see a lot of interesting things.  This is a very small part of what excursions the Chistye Prudy hotel (Sochi) offers you.  The reviews confirm that if you are an active and inquisitive person, then you will not have a single free minute, because there is something to look at.  You can visit the art Glass studio and watch the work of glass blowers and be sure to bring a small souvenir with you home. </p>

    <h2>  Opinion of tourists about the hotel </h2><p>  As usual, opinions about hotels are shared, but this does not apply to the Chistye Prudy hotel (Sochi).  Reviews for the most part express gratitude to the hotel staff for a superbly organized stay.  Separately, perfect cleanliness in the rooms, timely replacement of bed linen and towels, as well as high-quality and tasty food are noted.  What is especially pleasant, no one forces you to choose one restaurant or dining room.  Judging by the reviews, the most convenient option is breakfast at the hotel, and you can choose a place for lunch and dinner depending on your preferences.  Summing up, I want to say that Chistye Prudy is an almost perfect place for family vacations and business trips, absolutely everyone will like it here, regardless of age or preference. </p>
