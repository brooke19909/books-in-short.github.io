Siege weapon in the Middle Ages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Siege weapons are the same age as fortified cities.  As evidenced by archeology, they first appeared in Mesopotamia in the II millennium BC.  e.  In antiquity, the conquest of a neighboring state was reduced primarily to the capture of its main strongholds.  Thus, the siege was the decisive tactic for a successful war, and the siege weapon was an effective way to achieve this goal. </p><h2>  Siege weapons of the past </h2><p>  Thick ramparts and city gates were punched with rams before the invention of guns.  They were made of wood and lined with raw animal skins to protect from incendiary arrows and mixtures.  At the end of the ram, as a rule, a bronze and later iron tip was attached. </p><p>  Throwing machine - another siege weapon, often used by the enemy army.  The first samples were peculiar variations of slings and bows mounted on a stand.  Later, mobile versions with wheels and a carriage spread.  These include catapults, rocket launchers, ballista, onagra. </p><p>  Siege ladders were the most common means of assault, since they made it possible to quickly overcome obstacles.  If their length turned out to be shorter than the height of the wall, then rope nets with iron hooks attached to the wall teeth were used to extend them. </p><p>  The siege tower for many centuries remained one of the most used vehicles during the blockade of cities, and subsequently knightly castles.  The first of them appeared in the Ancient East and with some modifications were successfully applied until the Middle Ages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The oldest mentions of siege towers </h2><p>  The Assyrians turned the siege of cities into art.  Thanks to archaeologists, we now know what the palaces of Nineveh looked like - the capital of ancient Assyria.  On the gigantic reliefs that adorned the palace walls, all the techniques that the Assyrians used during the blockade of cities were captured. </p>

    <p>  Of particular interest is the siege tower depicted on them.  It was a multi-wheeled wooden structure covered with mats.  In front of such a machine had a small turret, where warriors with a ram took refuge.  Of course, the Assyrians were not the only ones who used such military equipment. </p><p>  Xenophon, an ancient Greek historian and commander, left us a description of the vehicles that accompanied the army of Cyrus.  From it we learn that the siege tower of the Persians had several floors.  The lower one, including the wheels, rose 5.6 m above the ground, while the weight of the machine itself exceeded 3 tons.  For its movement used 8 oxen.  However, some historians believe that these towers were intended not so much for assault as for supporting the army in battle. </p><h2>  Siege art of Carthage and Greece </h2><p>  The Carthaginians came from the East, so they were well acquainted with rams and siege towers.  <span>Diodorus of Sicily,</span> describing the siege of Greek cities on about.  Sicily is the Carthaginian army of Hannibal, in particular mentions towers of exceptional height, towering above the walls of Selinunte.  Slingers and archers, located on the upper platforms of the tower, easily hit the defenders of the city, as soon as they appeared on the city wall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Four ancient authors have preserved for us a description of gelepol - a giant siege tower used by the Greeks.  Each side of the wheel base of the machine was 21 m, and its inner space was divided by transverse beams, which rested against those who moved the tower forward.  Gelepol itself had 9 floors, connected by two stairs: for descending and ascending. </p><p>  Each floor on the front side had windows with wooden shutters that opened when projectiles were thrown.  It can be assumed that such a bulky siege tower about 40 m high moved very slowly, although descriptions of how it was set in motion were not preserved.  To protect the wooden structure from fire, the side and front walls were studded with iron or leather cushions. </p><h2>  Roman assault towers </h2><p>  Around the 2nd century BC  e.  the Romans began to use towers more actively during the siege of cities.  The military historian of Ancient Rome, Vegetius, left a rather detailed description of such combat vehicles.  It follows that the pragmatic Romans preferred a functional technique, not trying to hit the enemy with its size. </p>

    <p>  According to Vegetation, the tower ("tour" - from the Latin turres ambulatorie) was divided into three levels.  On the first floor there was a <span>ram ram,</span> on the second a drawbridge with a wicker fence and, finally, on the third - a platform for archers and spear throwers.  Such a tower, depending on the terrain and the height of the city walls, could reach 15 and even 27 meters. </p><p>  The structure was sheathed with sheets of iron or leather and patchwork bedspreads made of non-combustible materials.  When the tower reached the walls of the besieged city, the bridge of the second floor was extended, giving soldiers the opportunity to go to the city fortifications. </p><h2>  Siege Towers of the Middle Ages </h2><p>  Despite the fact that ancient civilizations eventually left the historical stage, their achievements in the field of military equipment continued to be used in the Middle Ages.  Siege machines, including assault towers, were used to blockade both cities and knight's castles.  Their design and tactics of use have not changed since ancient times. </p>

    <p>  As before, during the Middle Ages they were built of wood, lined with horse or bull skins.  On the upper platform of the tower were crossbowmen and archers, and sometimes small throwing machines.  The lower floor was occupied by a ram with an iron tip or a drill, which loosened the brickwork of the walls. </p><h2>  Siege of medieval fortresses </h2><p>  The preparatory work that preceded the storming of the castle or the city required a lot of time and money.  In addition, the besieged were also not inactive.  Often, they made forays into the enemy camp under cover of night in order to destroy siege structures, including wooden towers. </p>

    <p>  The assault on the fortress with stairs was the first means used by the besiegers.  If it did not bring success, then they proceeded to a long blockade and launched siege towers.  They moved them with winches close to the fortress wall.  In the case of a successful maneuver, the outcome of the assault could be considered resolved. </p>
