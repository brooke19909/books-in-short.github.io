  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of Cheap Hotels in the Center of Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Like any capital of the world, Moscow is not only the historical, but also the economic, cultural and business center of the country, and therefore thousands of tourists, businessmen, business travelers, students come here every day.  And most of the visitors want to stay in the city center.  At the same time, everyone wants to find housing at fairly low prices, which at the same time will differ in good service and living conditions. </p><p>  The most popular and most requested are <noindex>  <span>cheap hotels in the center of Moscow</span> </noindex>  three star category.  They are preferred by both tourists and participants in conferences, exhibitions, business trips.  As a rule, three-star hotels offer their visitors a standard set of services: a bathroom, refrigerator, minibar, daily cleaning, Internet, satellite TV.  Most often they have a laundry room, cafe or restaurant, sometimes a gym, a conference room and a business center.  Not far from Chistye Prudy is the Ulanskaya Hotel, next to the metro station of the same name - the Taganka Hotel, you will also like the Grand Victoria Hotel, located in a historic building not far from the Paveletsky Station. </p><p>  However, they are not much different from three-star hotels and two-star hotels (the so-called hostels) - most often the difference is that in some rooms the bathroom is combined with a neighboring room.  Among hostels in the center, many will provide you with decent service - this is a small but quite comfortable Napoleon in Maly Zlatoustinsky Lane, the VALS hotel near the Paveletskaya metro station, and the Traveler hotel chain.  If your point of arrival is Leningrad, Kazan or <noindex>  <span>Yaroslavsky railway station - Komsomolskaya metro station</span> </noindex>  , - then the closest thing you will get to the economy hotel is Reakom. </p><p>  Recently, mini-hotels are in great demand.  As a rule, they are not ranked by the number of stars.  Their only difference from standard inexpensive hotels is a smaller number of rooms.  However, at the same time you get the maximum comfort and coziness comparable to home - and all this for a much lower room price.  Here you will have the opportunity to cook your own breakfast or dinner, which will also save money.  Mini-hotels ‚ÄúOn Sadovoy‚Äù (metro ‚ÄúTsvetnoy Boulevard‚Äù), ‚ÄúOn Basmannaya‚Äù (station ‚ÄúRed Gate‚Äù), ‚ÄúOn Belorusskaya‚Äù (Leningradsky Prospekt) will cost you a lot.  Mini-hotels of the Sultan chain, which are located near the Mayakovskaya, Belorusskaya, and Novoslobodskaya metro stations, will also allow Senokomit. </p><p>  Whether you arrived in the capital on business, on a romantic trip or on an excursion, you will always find inexpensive hotels in the center that will allow you not to be distracted by uncomfortable living conditions and leave you only with a pleasant experience about the trip and about Moscow. </p></div></article>
