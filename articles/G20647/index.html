Manufacturers of even eminent brands regularly update the line of the budget segment.  Such models have a beautiful modern design, wide multimedia capabilities and other functions.  Of course, they differ from expensive gadgets, for example, the level of performance, camera resolution and screen.  But the low price fully pays for the missing technical specifications. </p><p>  LG K3 LTE is just such a "budget".  Its cost does not exceed 6000 rubles.  Does the device correspond to the declared price?  What technologies did the developers implement in this smartphone?  Does it have flaws?  Find answers to these questions will help us reviews of the owners, as well as a study of the technical characteristics declared by the manufacturer. </p>

    <h2>  What's in the box? </h2><p>  The manufacturer, even in budget models, does not step back a step from current trends.  This becomes noticeable when looking at the packaging.  It is framed with the latest fashion.  Based on the usual white color.  The name of the K3 LTE model stands out clearly on it.  At the bottom, the manufacturer printed the company logo.  The box itself is made of ordinary cardboard, has a rectangular shape.  Its dimensions are fully consistent with the dimensions of the phone.  As for the latter, it is laid almost back to back. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the smartphone, the manufacturer provided a standard set of components.  It includes only a USB cable and power supply.  Of course, there is all the necessary documentation.  However, the case for the LG K3 LTE will have to be purchased separately.  In principle, there should not be a problem with his choice, since a wide variety of models are available in the assortment of specialized stores.  Those who wish can choose both a regular silicone bumper and a book cover.  You will also have to buy a memory card separately.  The device supports the common microSD format. </p><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  The LG K3 LTE K100DS is a typical touch screen smartphone.  Its body is made of plastic, which is a common practice for budget gadgets.  It is worth noting that the material has pretty good qualities.  Unfortunately, in the model range there are only two color solutions: dark blue and black.  The device does not look bulky.  The rounded corners of the case played a large role in this.  Due to the fact that the device is equipped with a small screen, its dimensions can be safely called compact: height - 133.9 mm, width - 67.75 mm.  On the indicator of thickness it is worthwhile to dwell in more detail.  Unfortunately, this phone model is difficult to attribute to narrow ones.  Its thickness almost reaches 1 cm (9.4 mm).  The mass of the phone is small - only 127 g. </p>

    <p>  About 70% of the screen is dedicated to the front panel.  It is framed by a rather thick black frame.  At the bottom, the manufacturer introduced the company logo instead of the usual control panel.  In the top, in addition to a narrow speaker hole, there is also a ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù of the front camera and sensors.  The control panel is located directly on the screen.  Three buttons with a square of a circle and a triangle are displayed on it.  <span>The protective glass</span> LG K3 LTE will have to be purchased additionally, since the manufacturer did not provide it in the factory equipment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The back cover looks pretty monolithic.  In its lower part is the hole of the output speaker.  At the top there is a camera lens without a flash.  Under it, the manufacturer allocated a place for the company logo. </p><p>  Mechanical control buttons are located on the side faces.  The power key is displayed on the right side.  It is also used to lock the gadget.  On the opposite side is the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù, with which you can adjust the volume.  The upper end is occupied by only one jack, designed to connect headphones.  Below is a microUSB port and a microphone. </p><p>  In their reviews, the owners note the high build quality.  During operation, play and creaks were not found.  The only thing the owners noticed: when you try to bend the case, a small crunch appears.  Using the phone is very convenient, thanks to a well-chosen shape and compact dimensions. </p><h2>  Screen feature </h2><p>  The LG K3 LTE display has a size of 4.5 inches.  It is based on a matrix made by TFT technology.  What is this talking about?  First of all, it should be noted that the color rendition of the screen is not very high.  Also, do not rely on wide viewing angles.  However, for an entry-level gadget, these are perfectly acceptable characteristics.  LG K3 LTE will not surprise the user with a high resolution screen.  The maximum that this display is capable of is 854 √ó 480 px.  The display density of dots per inch is 218 ppi.  Of course, for modern gadgets this figure is very low, but with the naked eye, the "squares" on the screen will not be visible.  The manufacturer in the specifications indicated the presence of the ‚Äúmultitouch‚Äù option, but how many simultaneous touches this model supports is unknown. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The brightness level is ideal for working with the phone in normal lighting.  However, on the street in sunny weather, glare appears on the screen, and the picture immediately becomes fuzzy. </p><p>  Given the belonging to the budget segment, the manufacturer did not use <span>oleophobic coating</span> and protective glass. </p>

    <h2>  <span>LG K3 LTE:</span> hardware <span>features</span> </h2><p>  This phone model is available in two versions: for the domestic and European markets.  As for the latter, the developers equipped the device with a Snapdragon 210 processor (MSM8909).  This chipset is manufactured by Qualcomm.  At maximum load, it is capable of delivering a frequency of 1100 MHz.  For the graphics in this version, the Adreno 304 video card is responsible. </p><p>  Now it is worth considering the characteristics of the LG K3 LTE, intended for sale in Russia.  This version runs on the <span>MediaTek MT6737M processor.</span>  Based on the Cortex-A53 Crystal Core.  The maximum clock speed is 1100 MHz.  As a coprocessor, the developers chose a model with two computing modules Mali-T720 MP2. </p><p>  The size of RAM is small - only 1 GB, but for budget devices this indicator is quite acceptable.  Unfortunately, many owners comments were devoted to the size of the built-in storage.  Currently, 8 GB is critically small.  The ability to use external drives corrects the situation a bit.  If you install a memory card, you can expand the memory capacity up to 32 GB. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  LG K3 LTE K100DS runs on Android sixth version.  There are no special comments on the operating system for users.  The interface has a standard look.  The manufacturer did not make any additions. </p><p>  In the work, this gadget showed itself on the good side.  All applications open quickly, work without lags.  Of course, users will not be able to install modern resource-intensive games on the device, but its potential will be quite enough for everyday tasks. </p><h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  Unfortunately, this model cannot be used as a camera.  This becomes clear after studying camera resolutions.  The front module has a 0.3 megapixel sensor.  The maximum that it is capable of is 640 √ó 480 px.  The only thing this camera is suitable for is video communication.  Talking about the quality of photos is unnecessary, since the front module is simply not capable of high-quality images. </p><p>  The situation is slightly better with the main camera.  It is based on a 5-megapixel sensor.  Immediately worth noting: the developers did not provide for a flash, which makes it almost impossible to shoot in low light.  The quality of photographs is hardly even average.  Under ideal conditions, digital noise is clearly visible on them.  Colors are dim, detail is weak.  Using the main camera, you can record video in 720p format.  Its quality is rather mediocre. </p><p>  Unambiguously in their comments, users attributed optics to the weaknesses of this model. </p>

    <h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  If we talk about sound quality, the LG K3 LTE reviews are not getting the best.  The fact is that the main speaker works purely only at medium volume.  And if you increase to the maximum, then distortion and interference are clearly audible.  Unfortunately, it is also impossible to achieve good sound through headphones.  Definitely this ‚Äústate employee‚Äù will not suit audiophiles. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  LG K3 LTE Dual Sim has all the necessary wireless interfaces.  Particular attention should be paid to the Bluetooth module.  And in this device version 4.1LE is implemented.  It is currently the most energy efficient.  There were no comments from users and to the Wi-Fi module.  It has an 802.11 standard that works with all modern protocols.  An indisputable advantage is that the device can act as an access point.  Also in this model there is a radio, for which headphones must be used as an antenna. </p><p>  GPS navigation modules work quite clearly.  If located in an open area, a few seconds will be enough to detect satellites.  The speed decreases (but uncritically) if the user is on the street among the buildings. </p><p>  For data transfer, the gadget has a microUSB connector.  Its version 2.0.  All files are transferred very quickly, without delay.  Also in the apparatus there is an accelerometer.  And of course, support for 4th generation networks greatly expands the capabilities of this model. </p>

    <h2>  Battery Life </h2><p>  Unfortunately, this model cannot boast of autonomy.  The LG K3 LTE battery has a capacity of just 1940 milliamps per hour.  For a modern smartphone, such a battery will not be enough for full work.  The battery is manufactured in compliance with the lithium-ion chemical composition.  By type refers to removable. </p><p>  In the comments of the owners the following results of testing the terms of work on a single charge are given: </p><ul><li>  If you watch videos or movies, the battery life is enough for no more than 7 hours. </li><li>  If you use the phone in combined mode, then you will need to put it on charge in the evening. </li></ul><p>  It is important to keep in mind that some functions drain the battery most of all.  For example, Wi-Fi refers to them.  If you connect to the Internet using this module, then a 100% charge will be used up after 4-5 hours. </p><p>  Given such low battery characteristics, the owners of this model are advised to arm themselves with Power Bank.  A portable battery keeps you connected.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer did not provide for special energy-saving modes in this phone. </p><h2>  LG K3 LTE: reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about this model can be found in large numbers.  Unfortunately, they talk more about flaws.  The maximum rating that users put on the gadget is three.  According to all owners, without exception, this model will not suit demanding users.  In order to understand this, it is enough to study the technical characteristics. </p><p>  In their comments, the owners criticized the small amount of internal memory, the low resolution of the cameras, the lack of autofocus and flash, and a weak battery.  There are also reviews that sound complaints about the sensor.  Pressing the keys may not work at all.  A sensor failure appears irregularly, sometimes it goes away by itself, and in some situations even a complete reset does not help. </p><p>  When considering the comments of the owners, comments were noted on the quality of the conversational dynamics.  Wheezing is clearly audible during the conversation.  Also, many users complain that when you turn on the speakerphone, it is completely impossible to parse the subscriber's speech. </p>
