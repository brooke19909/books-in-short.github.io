The most famous southern regions of the country.  Everyone knows the famous resorts - the Canary and Bolear Islands, as well as one of the most beautiful autonomies of Catalonia. </p><h2>  So different but united Spain </h2><p>  Currently, it is the largest business, industrial and cultural center of Spain.  No less famous magnificent resorts of the Mediterranean are considered Andalusia, Castile, Valencia and Aragon, preserving their amazing centuries-old history, ancient architecture, ancient customs and cultural values.  It has a pleasant mild climate, hot summers, picturesque nature and clear waters of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mondoramas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spanish-Moorish Courtyard" class="if uuid-2332517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2332517.jpg"></div><p>  Which, in fact, attracts a huge number of tourists to relax on the coast in these heavenly corners created by human hands.  A special place is occupied by Spanish courtyards. </p><p>  Lucky in this regard, the locals, why go somewhere to relax, when there it is, everything is nearby.  For centuries, a certain national style and way of life has evolved, including under the influence of external climatic factors.  In summer, in Spain, air temperature can rise up to +40 degrees, and it is most reasonable during this period of the day to hide from the heat somewhere in the shade. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="hadleycourt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Midday cool" class="if uuid-2332520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2332520.jpg"></div><p>  Back in antiquity, for these purposes, courtyards were created in the palaces, corners sheltered from the sun to relax in coolness.  A natural occurrence for a country with a hot climate is siesta.  Such a temperature peak is usually reached at noon, and it is better to wait, indulge in afternoon naps, as the ancient patricians did, so that they can continue their work with renewed vigor.  How wonderful it is to sleep outdoors under the green crown of a tree or a canopy entwined with ivy. </p><h2>  Little Paradise for Individual Use </h2><p>  Cute Spanish courtyards are so diverse, it seems that there is no limit to the natural beauty and imagination of designers.  They can be square, rectangular or any other shape - everything is limited by the attachments of the owner. </p><p>  Small fences or lattices overgrown with odorous jasmine also serve as decoration, creating secluded nooks.  The walls can be twined with romantic ivy, shades of blooming morning glory, vibrant bougainvillea blooming. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hgtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Enough space for the whole family" class="if uuid-2332521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2332521.jpg"></div><p>  Through the plots of many plays by Spanish writers, the main scene is romantic Spanish courtyards.  A vivid example is the comedy "Pious Martha" by Tirso de Molina.  Well, how not to bloom the most beautiful feeling in conditions close to paradise? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  And feast and peace </h2><p>  In such peculiar courtyards <span>in Spanish houses</span> , not only the owners of the house gather for a midday rest, but also invite guests for business meetings or celebrations of the fiesta.  Patios, patios, gained popularity first in Italy and Spain, and then America and other countries took over the idea.  Until now, the style of the interior of the courtyard is called Spanish-Moorish. </p><p>  Everything here is for pleasure: comfortable furniture, favorite plants and flowers, located in the center of an artificial pond or fountain.  The barbecue corner or fireplace looks appropriate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gardendecors.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cozy evening by the fireplace" class="if uuid-2332523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2332523.jpg"></div><p>  Spanish courtyards are created using living plants and only natural materials.  Some people prefer canopies as protection against wind and rain.  Here it will be appropriate and a metal tent or wooden - pergola, which closes with the roof of the house. </p><p>  The floors are laid out of bricks, concrete and stone slabs or blocks, wooden flooring or with mosaic coating.  More often, everything is in terracotta shades. </p><h2>  There is no barrier to beauty and comfort </h2><p>  Patio design has gained popularity in world architecture, as well as among professional gardeners, amateur gardeners, owners of cottages and country houses. </p><p>  A magical oasis where everyone is happy, as if you are in a fairy-tale world.  The Spanish patios are a great opportunity to make your dreams come true anywhere in the world.  Looking at the photos of Spanish courtyards, you notice this captivating naturalness that pleases the eye and beckons with beauty and cool bliss in the hot afternoon of Spain. </p>
