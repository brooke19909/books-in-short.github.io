Romulus subsequently became his first king.  Initially, the inhabitants of the city were called Latins.  At an early stage, the state was ruled by people from the Etruscan tribe - the most developed ethnic group on the peninsula at that time.  Around the 5th century BC  the last ruler of this dynasty dies, and Rome becomes the Republic. </p><h2>  Roman republic </h2><p>  At the head of the Republic were two consuls, and the Senate was the constituent council, which made all important decisions by voting. </p><p>  By the 5th century BC  Rome has become the largest city of the Apennines.  In the following centuries, he captured many small settlements nearby, and by the III century BC.  e.  The republic practically owned the Italian peninsula.  In the 1st century BC  e.  Senators, generals and tribunes alternately fought for power.  The great commander Julius Caesar began another civil war.  Supporters helped him defeat his enemies and ascend the throne. </p><p>  Many were suspicious of the new ruler, and in 44 BC.  e.  the dictator was killed.  However, he managed to lay the foundations thanks to which the next 500 years, Rome developed and significantly expanded its territory.  Until the end of the <span>Roman Empire</span> , centuries remained. </p><h2>  End of the republic </h2><div class="photo" data-original="zeitreisen.zeit.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capitol hill" class="if uuid-2522098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2522098.jpg"></div><p>  The assassination of Julius Caesar led to the fall of the Republic and the beginning of the Empire.  Let's take a brief look at the <span>history of the Roman</span> Empire from beginning to end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 27 BC  Octavian Augustus, who became the first emperor, sits on the throne.  He took control of the army and the appointment of new senators, and also created powerful fortifications along the borders that stretched along the Danube River and reached the UK. </p><p>  Tiberius (14-37), Caligula (37-41) and Claudius (41-54) succeeded each other without incident.  However, the tyranny of Nero (54-68) led to the fact that the commander of the Spanish legions of Galba revolted against him.  When the rebel broke into Rome, he was supported by the Senate.  Nero shamefully left the city and killed himself with a knife. </p><p>  The ‚Äúyear of the four emperors‚Äù followed, since during this period generals Galba, Otton, Vitellius fought for power.  The fight ended when Vespasian (69-79), the commander of the legions, took firm power.  Then ruled Titus (79-81) and Domitian (81-96). </p><p>  We can say that the beginning and end of the Roman Empire were only a sequence of events and dates.  In fact, it only continued the Republic, and after the fall of Byzantium, the last stronghold of the Romans, the time came for new states and kingdoms. </p><h2>  Peace and prosperity </h2><p>  After the death of Domitian, the Senate elects Nerva as his successor.  From this moment begins one of the happiest periods for Rome, lasting from 96 to 180 years.  The time called the reign of the ‚ÄúFive Good Emperors‚Äù - Nerves, Trajan, Hadrian, Anthony Pius and Marcus Aurelius, when the empire was a strong and prosperous power. </p><p>  The economy of Rome was booming.  In rural areas, large farms were established and roads leading to all parts of the state were built. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the death of Marcus Aurelius and the ascension to the throne of his weak son Commodus (180-192), a long and gradual decline began, which led to the end of the Roman Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="galleryhip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Actors in clothing of the ancient Romans" class="if uuid-2538365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2538365.jpg"></div><h2>  Important Conquests </h2><p>  Between 264 and 146 BC  Rome fought with Carthage.  These wars led to the fact that Rome conquered almost all of Spain and North Africa.  In 146 BC  Carthage fell and was destroyed. </p><p>  By 150 BC  Rome added to its lands Greece, which became its richest province.  Since distant lands could not be controlled directly, rulers called ‚Äúproconsuls‚Äù were placed at the head of the conquered territories. </p><p>  Although the main goal of the Augustus empire was to maintain neutrality rather than conquest, some changes occurred during his reign.  In 44 A.D.  Britain joins Rome and several more small areas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="penulis-content.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of the Roman Empire of the 3rd century A.D." class="if uuid-2542164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2542164.jpg"></div><h2>  Advances in Science and Engineering </h2><p>  Rome is known for building roads that contributed to the development of trade and stretched all the way to the Silk Road.  In addition, they allowed the armed forces to quickly reach remote areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Aqueducts were invented to supply cities with water.  Water from freshwater sources or storages was directed along the aqueduct with a slight decrease in level to ensure constant pressure.  As soon as the aqueduct reached the city, lead water pipes led to fountains, public places, and even rich houses. </p><p>  Baths usually consisted of separate rooms for cold, warm and hot bathing.  Water and floors were heated using special underground stoves.  Caring for them was a difficult and dangerous job that the slaves did.  As the popularity of bath complexes grew, they began to include saunas and gyms. </p><p>  Despite all the achievements and developed culture, a slow fading began, which led to the end of the Roman Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="laufuhr-test.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roman aqueduct" class="if uuid-2538359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2538359.jpg"></div><h2>  Start of decline </h2><p>  In 192, the <span>Praetorian Guard</span> publicly betrayed the throne, killing Commodus.  The winner, Didi Julian, ruled for a year until he was overthrown and executed by <span>Septimius Severus.</span>  A talented commander, however, and he could not prevent the empire from plunging into chaos.  The North ruled from 193 to 211.  He was replaced by several rulers who were not particularly distinguished in the history of a great power. </p><p>  Then anarchy followed, plunging Rome into an abyss of unrest and chaos.  The time of decline from 259 to 268 years BC  it is called the ‚Äúera of thirty tyrants,‚Äù when a power was ruled in a short space by 19 different generals one after another. </p><p>  Next on the throne sat Claudius II (268-270), Aurelian (270-275), Mark Claudius Tacitus (275-276), Prob (276-281) and Kar (281-283).  In 284 A.D.  Diocletian came to power, which further contributed to the end of the Roman Empire.  The story begins with the decision to divide the empire. </p><h2>  The division of the empire and its sunset </h2><p>  When Diocletian appeared on the throne, he first tried to divide the empire into several autonomous regions.  One of his successors, Constantine the Great, forever divided it into two parts: Eastern, with the capital in Constantinople and Western, at the head of which was Rome. </p><p>  Constantine (311-337) granted freedom to Christians and promised not to pursue them anymore.  He also became the first ruler to publicly adopt Christianity. </p><p>  Dying, he transferred the empire to his three heirs: Constantine II, Constant I and Constance II.  However, the brothers were at enmity with each other, and the army soon rebelled.  After the uprising, the throne passed to John the Apostate (361-363), by the will of which the empire was once and forever split in half. </p><p>  The date of the death of Rome is considered September 4, 476.  Odoacer, a general of the Huns, led a rebellion among mercenaries in the Orestes army.  Vandals invaded the city, and Odoacre forced <span>Romulus Augustulus</span> to abdicate and seized control of Italy.  He renounced the title, ending 500 years of Roman rule. </p><p>  The Eastern Roman Empire lasted for almost a thousand years.  In 1453, the Turks stormed Constantinople and made it the center of the Ottoman state. </p><p>  So the Roman Empire died out.  The beginning and end of existence is considered to be 27-1453 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="galleryhip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residents of Pompeii buried under the ashes of Vesuvius" class="if uuid-2522106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2522106.jpg"></div><h2>  Holy Roman Empire </h2><p>  This state was a feudal monarchy that swept part of Western Europe.  Its beginning is associated with the ruler of the Franks, Carl, nicknamed the "Great". </p><p>  After Pope Leo III is attacked in the streets of Rome with threats to blind and cut his tongue, he secretly makes his way through the Alps to ask Karl for help. </p><p>  Nothing is known about the outcome of the negotiations, but the king arrives in Rome in 800.  In St. Peter's Basilica, when Karl rises from his knees after prayer, the pontiff puts the crown on his head and proclaims him emperor. </p><p>  After the death of Charlemagne, his heirs divided the empire into parts. </p><p>  In 924, the empire again lost its master until the coronation of the Duke of Saxony Otto I on February 2, 962.  From that moment on, the throne was inherited exclusively by the Eastern Franks, until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, due to the Napoleonic Wars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="funnyrepost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roman road in Africa 1800 years" class="if uuid-2522101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2522101.jpg"></div><h2>  Reasons for the decline </h2><p>  Why did the end of the Roman Empire come?  This question is still a stumbling block for many scientists.  Most historians believe that the cause could be a number of factors that caused the slow fading of the great state. </p><p>  People stopped volunteering for service, forcing rulers to recruit mercenaries who were expensive and easily sold.  Foreigners became part of the legions, including many generals.  Over time, the barbarians learned Roman tactics, which ultimately turned against the empire itself. </p><p>  Economic decline suggests a possible reason why the end of the Roman Empire came.  After Marcus Aurelius, the expansion of borders ended and the amount of gold entering the treasury decreased. </p><p>  It is worth noting that he himself was the greatest enemy of Rome.  Continuous civil wars have led to instability and weakening borders.  The Senate was removed from command of the troops in order to strengthen the power of the emperor, but this bled the army.  Epidemics and low birth rates have led to a decrease in the number of inhabitants. </p><p>  Civil war broke out in Italy, and the army had to concentrate in one place, leaving the borders free for the invasion of the barbarians.  Their invasion made it dangerous to move through the occupied lands, and the merchants refused to carry goods.  Because of this, the final collapse of the empire came. </p><p>  So, we learned about the beginning and end of the Roman Empire.  The dates of these two events are 27 BC.  and <span>1453</span> A.D. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weneedfun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colosseum in Rome" class="if uuid-2538367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/89825/2538367.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire collapsed after almost 500 years of existence, but Byzantium, which ruled in the east for almost a thousand years, became its successor.  The sunset of this great state actually marked the end of the Ancient World and the onset of a new stage in the development of mankind - the Middle Ages. </p>
