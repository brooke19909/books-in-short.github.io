    <p>  Today, working as an insurance agent at home (compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, hull insurance, property policies and much more) is quite prestigious and in demand, and if certain conditions are met, it can generate considerable income. </p><h2>  Who is an agent SC </h2><p>  Today's agents are ambitious young people, most often with higher education and considerable experience in the field of communication with clients.  After special training, such a person is able to sell you anything - from a toothpick to a skyscraper, and he is absolutely not intrusive.  Aerobatics - to conduct a deal so that after the <span>conclusion of the contract</span> the client has a full sense of his own importance and an understanding that he is the ‚Äúmaster of the situation‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54"></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, the insurance agent is not an <span>employee of the company,</span> but carries out its activities on the basis of a contract or power of attorney.  This means that in the event of any misunderstandings, all responsibility is borne directly by the UK, and the intermediary, as it were, has nothing to do with it.  However, this does not mean at all that the agent is not responsible for anything, just in case of overlaps, he will hold the answer to the IC, and not to the client. </p><p>  Before you become an insurance agent (CTP, CASCO, etc.), you should still think carefully, since this profession belongs to the category of ‚Äúwolf feed the legs,‚Äù that is, it does not imply a solid salary, and for people who prefer a certain stability, it does not will do. </p><h2>  Who can be an agent of SK </h2>

    <p>  In principle, in order to cooperate with insurance companies, you do not need to graduate from a specific university, such as, for example, doctors and lawyers.  The profile and scope of your education is not so important here.  The main criterion for those who are interested in how to become a CTP insurance agent is the availability of free time and a desire to communicate a lot.  As part-time employees, most UKs will be happy to consider: </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk"></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  students (current, former and future); </li><li>  seniors; </li><li>  retired military; </li><li>  young mothers; </li><li>  housewives; </li><li>  any person who does not have a permanent job, but who wants to comprehend the wisdom of a <span>new profession.</span> </li></ul><p>  The easiest way to take root in this area is those who already have rich experience in dealing with different people: sellers, teachers, marketers, networkers, psychologists, doctors, former district police officers and so on. </p><h2>  What a good agent should be </h2><p>  Those who have decided to clarify the issue of how to become a CTP insurance agent and try their luck in this field should have certain qualities.  It: </p><ul><li>  pleasant appearance - regardless of the level of his income, the agent of the insurance company should be clean, tidy, neatly trimmed and evoke positive emotions among potential customers; </li><li>  good memory - you should study and remember the features of a particular insurance product well, be able to correctly explain its advantages;  in addition, it is worth remembering the ‚Äúspecifics‚Äù of customers, even regular ones; </li><li>  sociability - you need to be able to make contact and quickly find intelligible answers to a variety of questions, not just pronounce a memorized text, but interest an interlocutor; </li><li>  resourcefulness - the ability to get out of an unfavorable situation is very useful, such as a combination lock at the front door or a huge dog of owners who met you at the doorstep; </li><li>  stress tolerance - people are different, not everyone knows how to speak correctly, so remember: the client is always right, and you will have to respond with even the most inveterate rudeness with a polite smile; </li><li>  industriousness - in this case, you can‚Äôt sit out ‚Äúon the bench of spare ones‚Äù, earnings will directly depend on the number of clients you found; </li></ul><h2>  I would go to insurers, let me teach </h2><p>  So, we have figured out our personal qualities, now let's talk about how to become an agent of an insurance company for OSAGO - INGOSSTRAKH, SOGAZ, RESO, VSK or any other company of your choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to become an agent of an insurance company for OSAGO Ingosstrakh" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/831020.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj"></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, no company will allow the first comer to represent its interests and draw up contracts on behalf of the company - in order to obtain such a right, it is necessary to undergo special training directly from the future employer.  These courses are most often free, there the future agent will be taught the basics of negotiating techniques, working with client objections.  Well and, of course, every insurance product offered by the company, its advantages and advantages over competitors will be sorted "by the bones". </p><p>  Typically, courses last from one to two weeks to several months, training can be carried out both in groups and individually.  Some companies also practice distance learning or distance webinars and skype conferences.  Before becoming an agent of the insurance company for CTP, CASCO and other types of insurance, the applicant must not only successfully complete the training, but also pass some exams and tests in the passed disciplines.  In some companies, training can also be phased - each new step provides access to additional insurance products - the higher the level, the larger the range of policies that you can offer customers. </p><h2>  Responsibilities </h2><p>  After completing the training, you can begin to work.  The responsibilities of the insurance agent for OSAGO and any other types of insurance include: </p><ol><li>  Search and attraction of new customers, expansion of our own <span>customer base.</span> </li><li>  The conclusion of new contracts for all types of insurance and the extension (renegotiation) of existing ones. </li><li>  Self-assessment of damage - despite the fact that most often this is done by a dedicated employee, each agent must be able to do it on his own. </li><li>  Strict accounting and preservation of documents - the responsibility for the storage of contributions and forms lies entirely with the agent. </li><li>  Conducting promotional events - the better the agent can present himself, the more customers he will have. </li></ol>

    <p>  Of course, the first two points are fundamental, and the income received directly depends on their quality implementation. </p><h2>  Salary - a lot or not </h2><p>  Before you become an agent of an insurance company under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance or other types of policies, it is worthwhile to understand that you will not get a clearly defined income here.  The salary of a freelancer directly depends on his activity, luck and hard work.  The first time, while you build up the base, it will be quite difficult.  Active and properly motivated beginners receive at first about 15 thousand rubles, and ‚Äúshark agents‚Äù can earn more than 100 thousand rubles a month. </p><p>  Of course, each company has its own wage system, but in the general case it can be said that the salary of an insurance agent is 10-15% of the amount of contracts concluded.  Some companies also offer certain bonuses and rewards when they achieve good performance. </p>

    <p>  The work of an insurance agent, although not simple, is still quite interesting, and under certain conditions it allows you to quickly move up the career ladder and improve your <span>financial situation.</span>  Nevertheless, before becoming an insurance agent for OSAGO ROSGOSSTRAKH, for example, it is worthwhile to once again evaluate the pros and cons of this profession. </p><h2>  All for </h2><p>  The advantages of this type of activity are quite obvious: </p><ul><li>  free training in a new business; </li><li>  free work schedule - such work can be combined with any other, as well as with studies, maternity leave, and so on; </li><li>  the upper level of profitability is not limited by anything - how much "ran", so much and received; </li><li>  an opportunity to acquire new ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù acquaintances; </li><li>  low competition - there are not so many people who can do such work well. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="work as an insurance agent at home" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/831014.jpg" width="550"></div></li></ul><h2>  And against </h2><p>  Before becoming a CTP insurance agent, it is worth soberly assessing the disadvantages of this profession: </p><ul><li>  lack of stable projected income; </li><li>  independent customer search - sometimes it is quite difficult to figure out where to get them; </li><li>  irregular working hours - it is very likely that the client will want to see each other on a holiday, a day off, or after 23:00; </li><li>  personal responsibility for the safety of documentation; </li><li>  work with "cash", personal responsibility for the safety of insurance premiums. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
