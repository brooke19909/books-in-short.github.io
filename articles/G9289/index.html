After eight centuries of peaceful existence, the center of the Bosporus kingdom was invaded by the Huns, who for centuries divided the city along with the highlanders and Bulgarians.  In the XV century, the Turks came to power and Russia conquered the territory, taking the Anapa fortress only at the beginning of the XIX century. </p><p>  Now the resort is famous for its natural and historical features among tourists, even those arriving at the end of the season, in September.  Reviews from vacationers in Anapa are full of interesting stories about vivid impressions. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  From those tourists who rested in Anapa in September, reviews remain mostly positive.  Sometimes a wind can stand for several days and the sea can storm, but calm, warm and low-wind weather predominates. </p><p>  The beaches in the city are clean and equipped with paid sun loungers, umbrellas, there are bars and cafes.  At the exit of Victory Park, the Central Beach is located, it takes about a kilometer in length and up to 500 meters in width, it is considered one of the best for swimming with children <span>- the</span> descent is gentle, and the heated sand is good for health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa in September" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2139700.jpg"></div>
