  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Classical Philosophy of Ancient China</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The philosophy of any country originated in the very core of mythological concepts, and used their material for their own purposes.  The philosophy of <span>Ancient China</span> was no exception in this regard <span>,</span> however, Chinese myths, in comparison with the mythical images of other countries, have their own unique specifics.  The heroes here are the real golden dynasties of past centuries.  A small amount of material presented by Chinese myths, reflecting the views of the Chinese on the interaction of man with the world, his formation and interaction, does not play a leading role in ancient Chinese philosophy.  Nevertheless, all Chinese natural philosophical teachings originate in mythology and primitive religion. </p><p>  Religion, like the philosophy of ancient China, is unique and unique, it is no coincidence that the two main philosophical trends - Confucianism and Taoism have rather vivid religious premises. </p><p>  Confucianism </p><p>  The main role in the history of political and ethical thought was undoubtedly played by the teachings of Confucius, his main philosophical views were described by his students in the book ‚ÄúLun Yu‚Äù.  For many centuries, this book has been the most influential instrument affecting the mentality of the Chinese people.  Confucius preached the patriarchal concept of state power, the state is represented in it as a large family, the emperor is the father, and all relations are based on the dependence of the younger on the eldest.  Simply put, Confucius advocated an aristocratic concept of government, while ordinary people were not allowed to rule the state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We must pay tribute to the great thinker, Confucius did not call for violence, but urged the ruling class to practice virtue and humility.  In his opinion, the main virtue of subjects is humility and submission to the government.  Confucius reacted negatively to the external conquests of the country, civil wars and the subordination of his power to other nations.  At the same time, the philosophy of Ancient China does not reject the importance of legislation, but, apparently, it gives it only an auxiliary role. </p><p>  Confucianism, immediately after its emergence, occupies an influential position in the political and ethical teachings of ancient China, is proclaimed the official ideology and remains the state religion.  <span>The philosophy of ancient</span> China does not represent Confucianism as an integral teaching, some of its elements are products of an autocratic centralized Chinese state. </p><p>  Taoism </p><p>  The philosophy of <span>ancient China was</span> not limited to Confucian views only; Taoism was an excellent alternative.  The focus of this teaching is on the cosmos, nature, and man himself, however, the comprehension of these concepts does not occur according to the type of ordinary logical thinking, but by means of a conceptual introduction into the true nature of existence.  Its founder, Lao Dan, was a contemporary of Confucius, and Ancient Chinese philosophy with its outlook on life was by no means alien to him. </p><p>  Today, the Tao is one of the most adequate concepts explaining the ways and origin of everything on the planet.  It manifests itself in the history of things, but in itself is not an independent entity, since the Tao has no sources.  Man is defined here as part of nature, he must maintain this unity with nature and live in harmony with the world from which he actually emerged.  This is the basis of the basic <span>mental balance</span> and tranquility of a person. </p><p>  Thus, the philosophy of China underwent significant changes at the earliest stages of its development.  The search for the meaning of life and the desire to find a place in this world has allowed many of the greatest minds of mankind to leave their unique and vivid trace in history. </p>
