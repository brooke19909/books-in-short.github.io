    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to reduce pants at the waist </h2><p>  Quite often it happens that owners of a thin waist and <span>wide hips are</span> faced with the problem of selecting trousers.  Often with such features of the figure, the thing in the hips sits perfectly, but on the sides and on the back it is large.  How to solve this problem and how to sew pants in a belt?  There are several ways that experienced craftsmen use in expensive ateliers. </p><h2>  1 way: along the side seam </h2><p>  Many believe that this option is only suitable for those models on which there are no <span>side pockets at the seams of the</span> product or any decorative rivets.  However, this is not at all true.  First, we will figure out how to suture classic-cut pants from a simple fabric without additional elements. </p><p>  To begin with, you should slightly unfasten the belt at a distance of about 10 cm from the side seam to one and the other side.  After putting on the pants inside out and measure the amount of excess fabric that should be removed, and at what angle to make a bevel seam.  It is best to use either tailor's needles or a basting for this.  It should be noted that when laying a new line, the transition from an existing side seam should be as smooth as possible so that no corners and irregularities appear on the fabric on the front side.  Then, using a special device or simple manicure scissors, you should open the old line and smooth this area with an iron.  After adjusting the trouser belt to size, cut off the excess fabric, sweep it in place and stitch it on a sewing machine. </p><p>  How to suture pants if there are a lot of decorative elements on the front and back panels?  In this case, you need to measure how many extra centimeters you need to remove in the belt.  You can open the side seam and displace one of the panels, covering all centimeters in a section of trousers that is free from decorative elements.  It should only be understood that in this case, the side seam will shift either forward or backward, depending on which side has more decorations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to suture women's pants" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/506139.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  2 way: additional tucks </h2><p>  This option is suitable for those whose pants are very puffy in the belt on the back.  Often, minor suturing of the product only on the sides does not solve this problem.  In this case, a few extra tucks on the back panel of the trousers will help.  In order to make them, you should tear the belt along the entire back and cut it along the middle seam.  After trying on the product, putting the pants inside out and, using tailor's pins, sew symmetrical tucks on both sides of the middle seam.  Thus, up to 6 cm can be removed in the belt. After that, it remains to adjust the upper bar to a new size and sew it in place.  Even an inexperienced seamstress will cope with such work, since suturing trousers in this way is easiest.  Here you do not have to tear open vertical factory seams and re-make decorative lines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew pants in a belt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/506138.jpg" width="500"></div>
