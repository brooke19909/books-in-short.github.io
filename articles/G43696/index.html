The first annalistic mention of the Chuvash-Bulgarian settlement dates back to 1469.  And since 1555, in its place there was already a supporting fortress of Muscovite Russia.  Its creation is attributed to Ivan the Terrible.  This fortress was a reliable defense on the southern borders of Russia.

    <p>  Only two centuries later, Cheboksary turn into a city.  This happened thanks to the development of trade, which was facilitated by the Volga River.  Bread, salt, furs, honey, leather raw materials - all these were sold by brisk Russian merchants.  At first, the city was assigned to the Kazan province.  However, already in 1781 it became an independent county town. </p><h2>  Cheboksary: ‚Äã‚Äãwhat region of Russia took the city under its "wing" </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, Cheboksary turned first into the center of the Chuvash Autonomous Region, then into the capital of the Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.  Finally, in 1992 - to the capital of the Chuvash Republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Because Chuvashia is a <span>republic</span> that is <span>part of the Russian Federation,</span> which has not only its capital Cheboksary, but also its own Constitution, coat of arms, anthem ...

    <p>  It is located in the center of the European part of Russia.  The closest to the city of Cheboksary is the Nizhny Novgorod region (in the west), as well as the Ulyanovsk region (in the south).  Bordered by the Chuvash Republic of Tatarstan, Mordovia and the Republic of Mari El. </p><p>  By the way, in Chuvashia, as in Cheboksary, the majority of the indigenous population, that is, Chuvashs, live.  There are two thirds of them in the republic, and 65% in the capital.  The entire population of Cheboksary is 468 thousand people. </p><p>  In order to finally close the question about the location of the city, it is worth saying that you can still find the following address on the map of Russia: Cheboksary, Tambov Region.  Only for clarification, it is necessary to insert the Nikiforov district, and write the village before the word Cheboksary. </p><h2>  What is Shupashkar? </h2><p>  It turns out that the Chuvash themselves call this name Cheboksary.  By the way, in Chuvashia there are two state languages: Chuvash and Russian. </p><p>  Translated from Chuvash into Russian, it means "wooden gutter."  True, as to why such a name arose and what caused it, the opinion of the local population diverges.  However, it agrees that this gutter is from a <span>water mill.</span>  But just which of them: the one through which water flows, or the one through which flour is poured? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

One of them is ‚Äúthe settlement of the Chuvashs‚Äù (from ‚ÄúChepe Suar‚Äù), the second is ‚Äúenclosed by water‚Äù.  Indeed, in ancient times, the city was comprehensively surrounded by water.  On the one hand - the Volga, on both sides - the Cheboksary, at that time a high-water river, on the fourth side the city was protected by a wide moat, also filled with water.

    <h2>  Location Cheboksary </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the area surrounding Cheboksary is distinguished by its color and beauty.  Still, this settlement is surrounded by water.  The Volga River, the <span>Cheboksary Reservoir,</span> the Cheboksark and Kaybulka rivers.  It is in the valley of the latter on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã233 square meters.  km is located today the city of Cheboksary.  What region of Europe boasts such a geographical location ?! </p><p>  In addition, the territory of the city has a picturesque relief, cut by ravines and covered with hills, so it is characterized by differences in elevations, a large number of green areas (whole pine and broad-leaved forests), breathtaking panoramic views of the Volga River, cozy valleys of small rivers.  Indeed, in addition to the above, Sugutka, Water Lily, Trusikha and Malaya Kuvshinka also flow here.  By the way, such ravine-hilly terrain necessitated the construction of bridges.  There are as many as five of them in Cheboksary, and through them, communication is provided between different urban areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  City climate </h2><p>  The temperate continental climate is typical of Cheboksary.

    <p>  The climate is characterized by relatively high humidity, this is due to the proximity of the Volga.  However, often evaporation can exceed the amount of precipitation, and then heat sets in. </p><h2>  The most beautiful place Cheboksary </h2><p>  In 1987, a hydroelectric power station was built in Cheboksary, and with it an artificial bay appeared on the site of the old district of the city.  It has become a place of cultural recreation for residents.  A pedestrian bridge is thrown across the bay, on which many citizens always walk. </p><p>  Of the old buildings near the bay, few have survived.  The Vvedensky Cathedral is of the greatest interest - it is the oldest temple in Chuvashia.  There was a letter of Ivan the Terrible from 1555, according to which a cathedral should be built.  And it was built in 1660.  It is a white stone church.  Inside, frescoes from the time of construction (17-18 century) and the iconostasis are preserved.  The cathedral houses the first icon of the Chuvash people - the Virgin of Our Lady, dating from the 15th century. </p><p>  On the shore of the bay, such ancient monuments as the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (1763) and the Trinity Monastery (17th century) look very beautiful.  The latter is a whole architectural ensemble. </p>

    <p>  In 1996, another dam was built across the <span>Cheboksary Bay</span> , which ran from Kazan to the Historic Embankment.  They began to call her "The Road to the Temple."  Soon new modern buildings appeared here, and the surroundings of the bay were improved.  Multilevel stairs, bridges, fountains ... </p><h2>  The symbol of the city </h2><p>  In 2003, on a hill near the Historical Embankment of the Cheboksary Bay, a 46-meter sculpture of the Mother Patroness was erected.  On the granite pedestal stands the figure of a woman in Chuvash national clothes.  The woman spread her arms; she is ready to hospitably meet everyone here.  And this gesture symbolizes the patronage of people and the city.  At the bottom of the monument is an inscription in Russian and Chuvash languages, it calls people to peace and love. </p><p>  The monument to the Mother Patroness became a symbol of the city of Cheboksary.  What an area of ‚Äã‚Äãindescribable beauty is covered by the look, if you rise to the monument!  After all, he stands on a hill.  Bay, Volga, bathed in churches, fountains, green parks ... </p><h2>  City of green spaces </h2><p>  There really are a lot of green spaces, i.e.  parks and squares, planted and equipped with people.  In addition, significant areas of Cheboksary's forests have been preserved.  What area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city would not be subject to close attention, everywhere you can see the <span>green areas.</span>  Their total area is 7634 hectares. </p>

    <p>  The square named after Chapaev is unique.  After all, it is located on the site of the Budaiki village, where this legendary hero was born not only of the Civil War in Russia, but also of the First World War.  <span>Vasily Chapaev</span> was awarded three crosses of St. George. </p><p>  A monument to Chapaev was erected in the square, and a memorial museum was opened in which you can learn about the heroic deeds, his associates, and the division.  In the square, Chapaev‚Äôs childhood home was even installed.  However, it took effort and time to find him, because in 1912 he was sold and transported to another locality. </p><p>  The square is very green, about 400 trees and a large number of shrubs are planted here.  Many paths were laid along which many benches were built and fountains were built. </p><h2>  Museums in Cheboksary </h2><p>  In addition to the museum, Chapaev has many other interesting institutions in Cheboksary.  For example, the National Museum, which tells about the history, life and culture of not only the ancient Chuvash, but also modernity. </p><p>  In the Museum of the history of the tractor you can see the collection of tractors.  Why <span>tractors?</span>  <span>The Cheboksary Tractor</span> Plant in Soviet times produced a large amount of this equipment and supplied it to a huge country.
