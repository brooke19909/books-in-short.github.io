  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bravo Bonus Program: How to spend Tinkoff points?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, many banks are trying to interest their customers in offers that are advantageous to them.  One of those who succeeded in this is Tinkoff. </p><p>  The Bank has developed the Bravo bonus program, which is offered for all credit cards except Odnoklassniki and All Airlines.  Each client connects to it automatically.  What is this program and how to spend Tinkoff points?  This is worth telling in a little more detail. </p><h2>  Briefly about the program </h2><p>  So, Bravo points are arbitrary units that allow Tinkoff credit card holders to refund part of their money back.  In other words, cashback. </p><p>  Every credit card holder is already connected to such a program.  It is free, neither money nor points are withdrawn for its use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bellaskin.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to spend Bravo points?" class="if uuid-2834690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2834690.jpg"></div><p>  For every 100 rubles spent, a person is awarded 1 point.  Thus, cashback is 1% of the purchase.  In order for this operation to be counted, a person must conduct non-cash payment by card through an ATM, terminal or cash desk. </p><p>  When thinking about how to spend Tinkoff points, you need to consider that the amount of return is always rounded down.  If, for example, a person spent 3,780 rubles, then he will not be credited with a 37.8 bonus, but only 37. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, there is a way to get more points.  Bank partners are often pleased with special offers, using which you can return up to 20-30% of the purchase. </p><h2>  Why can I not expect bonuses? </h2><p>  Before discussing how to spend Tinkoff points, you must list the operations for which they are not credited.  It: </p><ul><li>  Cash withdrawal. </li><li>  Transferring money by details to another organization. </li><li>  Payment for goods and services through a mobile or online bank. </li><li>  Transfer to electronic wallets. </li><li>  Payments for utilities, Internet, TV and communications. </li><li>  Transfer funds from a Tinkoff credit card to other cards. </li><li>  Transaction with some MCC.  Their list is presented by the official resource of the bank. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="vsekredity24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff internet" class="if uuid-2834675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2834675.jpg"></div><p>  It is also important to clarify that a maximum of 6000 points can be obtained per month.  The bank will not accrue more, even if a person spends a substantial amount. </p><h2>  Cashback algorithm </h2><p>  And now you can learn about how to spend Tinkoff points.  It should be noted that you can use them only after making a purchase by bank transfer.  The steps are simple: </p><ul><li>  You must log in to your personal online banking account. </li><li>  Find the Bravo section. </li><li>  Click on "Refund the purchase price for points."  This item is on the menu. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ul><p>  After that, you can wait for the funds to be credited to the card.  They will return within the next day.  Here are the important nuances to consider: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  All bonuses from the card cannot be reset.  At least 1 must be left. </li><li>  Returns for the purchase can be made only within the next 90 days after the acquisition. </li><li>  You cannot compensate for part of the purchase.  Points can only be paid in full. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneywise.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bravo" class="if uuid-2834679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2834679.jpg"></div><p>  In the process of spending bonuses there is nothing complicated, as well as in their accumulation. </p><h2>  Important Nuances </h2><p>  So, above it has already been considered how to use Tinkoff points.  Finally, you need to list the nuances that every person who is interested in this bonus program should know in order not to get into an unpleasant situation due to a misunderstanding of some points: </p><ul><li>  According to the terms of the loyalty program, bonuses can be spent on paying for railway tickets and orders made in public catering. </li><li>  Compensation is carried out at the rate of 1 point = 1 ruble. </li><li>  The bonus is accrued immediately after the bank processes the transaction made by the client. </li><li>  When closing the card or terminating the contract, the previously awarded Bravo Tinkoff bonuses are not returned in any way and are not issued in cash. </li><li>  If the client due to a system error accrued an insufficient number of bonuses, then compensation will be issued to him. </li><li>  The Bank at its sole discretion may conduct various promotional events, including promotional ones.  In their framework, the client is offered a larger percentage of cashback. </li><li>  Tinkoff, popular on the Internet, does not accrue bonuses if a person has not paid a monthly minimum payment on a loan or there are past due debts. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.diariotag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use tinkoff points" class="if uuid-2834682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2834682.jpg"></div><p>  All the necessary information on your account can be found in your personal account.  To do this, you only need mobile Internet. </p><p>  Tinkoff conveniently arranged everything, information on the funds available on the account, on accumulated points, on total debt and minimum payments is indicated in your account.
