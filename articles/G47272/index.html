The list can certainly be expanded, but these places are worthy of special attention. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tsar-events.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow hotels 4 stars" class="if uuid-2537624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/2537624.jpg"></div><h2>  "Mercure" - reviews </h2><p>  According to people who often visit hotels in Moscow 4-5 stars, "Mercure" is one of the best.  The rooms in it are always carefully cleaned and, most importantly, aired.  Among the pluses, visitors also note delicious food and an affordable price.  The picturesqueness of the place where the boutique hotel is located does not go unnoticed.  And, of course, disarming the courtesy and competence of local staff.  Quick placement, friendly communication, an adequate response to requests - all this can be found in the "Mercure". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.accorhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow hotels 3 4 stars" class="if uuid-2537632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/2537632.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews of the Garden Ring </h2><p>  Guests of the Garden Ring note the convenience of the location of two metro stations near the hotel.  Here you can stroll through the historical center of the capital.  Also, an unobtrusive staff and deliciously prepared chefs were called an important point in the service at the hotel.  There were also people who noticed a few negative points.  In their opinion, in the morning, administrators seem sleepy and not well-groomed.  Also, visitors had overlays with a mismatch of the ordered category and the actual number.  The administration solved the problem, but the negative still remained. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.accorhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of Moscow 4 stars" class="if uuid-2537635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/2537635.jpg"></div><h2>  "Aquamarine" through the eyes of guests </h2><p>  The first and most important advantage of the hotel guests consider the cleanliness and tidiness of the rooms.  The time spent here became so comfortable for hotel guests that they did not even want to return home.  The reason for such a good review was the presence of smiling staff, a varied morning menu, everything necessary for hygiene and personal care.  But the most important thing for people on a business trip and tired after a hard day was the space silence in the room.  Falling asleep and waking up here is a pleasure.  Unfortunately, some residents were faced with such unpleasant moments as the delay in the products of the minibar and the not very polite clearing staff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.roomguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow hotels 4 stars list" class="if uuid-2537641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/2537641.jpg"></div><h2>  About De Paris </h2><p>  The hotel‚Äôs convenient location alone makes guests praise it with the warmest words.  Also, guests celebrate excellent breakfasts, fresh interior decoration and very responsible staff.  The shavers were delivered to the room at the request of the guest within five minutes.  Like many 4-star Moscow hotels, the floor space of De Paris is not the largest.  But, according to guests, this gives him only comfort and homeliness. </p><h2>  Guest reviews for SunFlower Park </h2><p>  A special attention is given to the hotel restaurant by a luxurious restaurant.  According to guests, it is perfect not only for a pleasant and tasty dinner, but also for important banquets.  Guests here rest both in soul and body.  Many note an excellent sauna and conveniently located nearby shopping centers.  As for the negative aspects, then the guests also do not skimp on them.  Some people face much higher room rates than the promised amount.  There are also problems with the return of the remaining deposit.  One of the visitors advised to pay attention to the fact that the accounting documents, namely the invoice, can be received here only a day after departure.  This moment is very important for people who find themselves traveling to work in the capital, who choose 4-star hotels (Moscow).  The Prague metro station is located so conveniently in relation to the hotel that getting to any part of the city will not be the slightest difficulty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moscow-hotels.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4 star hotels Moscow Prague" class="if uuid-2537627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/2537627.jpg"></div><h2>  "Shenoso" - popular opinion </h2><p>  According to the guests, the main reason for choosing Shenoso among other 4-star Moscow hotels is its convenient location.  The city center is a 20-25 minute walk.  Pleasantly surprised the hotel by its guests with a very profitable loyalty system.  After the second visit to the "Shenoso", the guest is given a card that allows them to settle here not only with comfort, but also with good profit.  Very cozy interior design of rooms and simply royal breakfasts with inimitable presentation are also noted.  Not everyone can reserve a room here, as the demand is simply huge.  Many at this moment express great discontent.  Guests also cannot expect a stunning view from the window, since the hotel building is no more than three floors high. </p><h2>  "Pushkin" - words of gratitude </h2><p>  The advantages of the hotel guests celebrate its sweet decoration and serene silence in the rooms.  At first glance, it seems that the hotel has no one but you.  But breakfast reveals all the cards and shows that there are a lot of guests.  And serene silence is the merit of a good building and efficiently working staff.  Many people rate it as a great place to stop for long walks around the city.  Here you can leave your bags to be light, and then come and get a good night's sleep.  As for the minuses, for the most part, guests do not like to wash washed pastels.  It is clean, but it can be seen that it has been used for more than one year.  Also, people were faced with a malfunctioning shower and its not entirely perfect cleanliness.  Also, some were confused by the view from the window of the old shabby building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inyourpocket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4 star Moscow hotels in the center with breakfast" class="if uuid-2537644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/2537644.jpg"></div><h2>  About Borodino </h2><p>  The hotel rooms seem simply enormous and luxuriously furnished to the guests.  But, unfortunately, there are a number of negatively colored reviews.  So, according to some, the hotel seems to smell of antiquity and musty, but this opinion applies only to rooms located in the wing, in which the rooms begin their countdown from 14. Despite some discomfort, guests could not help but appreciate the luxurious view from the window hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="borodino-hotel-moscow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4 stars hotel rating in Moscow" class="if uuid-2537637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/2537637.jpg"></div><h2>  "Elegant" - reviews of guests </h2><p>  Low cost and advantageous location in the city center - these are the main reasons for moving to this place.  Dusty rooms and idle appliances still left many with a negative feeling.  This hotel is suitable mainly for those who do not plan to stay in their room for a long time. </p><h2>  "Empire City" and laudatory odes about him </h2><p>  The stunning view from the windows of the hotel rooms disarms and falls in love with the city of every guest.  Comfortable rooms and polite staff also come as an addition.  Many speak positively about the hotel administrator, his courtesy, stress tolerance and friendliness.  In difficult and controversial situations, the administration always maintains a positive attitude and tries to understand the point of view of any guest and client. </p>
