Biography and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Marie Duplessis (photo below) is the famous French courtesan, who is devoted to many poems and works.  The most famous of them is “Lady with Camellias”.  The first Parisian beauty, muse and lover of Franz Liszt, as well as Alexander Dumas the son, she still amazes biographers with both external and internal inconsistencies with these scandalous titles.  There was no particle of all-conquering beauty in Marie from the seasoned priestess of love.  The young, touching, almost ethereal nymph was more like a sensitive grisette, who did not want worship and passion, but participation, support and warmth.  Unfortunately, she received none of this during her lifetime. </p><p>  It should be noted that Marie Duplessis and Fanny Lear were the most talked about girls of that era.  And this is not at all surprising, because the first worked as a courtesan, and the second was an American dancer and mistress of Prince Nikolai Romanov.  Fanny's biography deserves a separate article, and below we will tell in detail the life story of Marie Duplessis.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Marie Duplessis was born into a farmer's family in 1824.  But at birth, her name was wrong.  The girl's real name is Alfonsina Plessis.  From childhood, fate did not spoil her with her mercies.  The destiny of the future courtesan was a miserable existence, constant hunger, an empty house, a drunken father and an ever-crying little sister.  Alfonsin's mother practically did not remember, since she ran away from home when the girl was not even five years old.  But two things were forever engraved in the memory of the future courtesan.  She remembered the name of her mother (Marie) and that she promised to return after her.  The first years of Alfonsin were waiting for her every day.  But then news came to the village - Marie Plessis, who worked as a maid in a rich house, died of consumption. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  First love </h2><p>  Now the girl had only one chance to avoid begging - marriage with a decent person, albeit not a wealthy one.  So the thirteen-year-old Alfonsin seemed a guy from a neighboring farm.  For the first time in her life, the girl fell in love and completely trusted her chosen one, hoping for a speedy wedding.  But the young man was in no hurry to marry.  Having satiated his fill, he not only threw Alfonsin, but also made her an accessible girl in front of the whole village.  This crossed out the future courtesan’s dream of marriage.  After all, no one in the area would go to get married to the "walkers." </p><h2>  Prostitution </h2><p>  Maren Plessis (Alfonsina's father) secretly rejoiced at the “fall” of her daughter.  Of course, she looked after her sister and ran the household, but she was very fragile - no one would have hired such a laborer.  The family needed money: father - for a drink, and sisters - for bread.  Now nobody needed and the “fallen” Alfonsin could work only as a prostitute.  According to Maren, it was for this lesson that God created women. </p><p>  Having learned what kind of “career” her father was preparing for her, Alfonsina was very indignant.  But Maren did not start a debate.  He immediately sold his daughter to a local innkeeper in order to repay a loan for wine.  Then the girl had to “work out” a few more debts of her father.  Realizing what awaits her in the future, Alfonsina fled to the capital of France.  There she hoped to find a decent job. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marie Duplessis photo" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1419254.jpg" width="260"></div>

She was not taken either as a saleswoman or as a servant - after all, Alfonsin was only fourteen years old.  In addition, she looked too fragile and not capable of any physical labor.  Alfonsina spent the night wherever she went, went hungry, and eventually returned to the craft of a courtesan. </p><p>  True, the first income did not help her get out of poverty.  After all, the clients of the night fairy were poor students who paid the girl pennies.  To search for rich fans, a decent “facade” was required - a well-groomed look and a good dress.  But Alfonsine barely had enough money for food.  In addition, the hope was still burning in her that one of the young men would be able to see in her not only the body, but also the person.  But every time Alfonsina’s expectations were not met.  The courtesan was convinced that men only crave pleasure from her. </p><h2>  Large fish </h2><p>  But with the assimilation of this bitter truth, fate gave the girl a chance to get out of poverty.  Once Alfonsina was walking with her friend in Paris.  Seeing the restaurant, the courtesans decided to go into it in the hope of picking up "big fish".  Usually there were few chances: restaurateurs immediately exposed night fairies.  They made an exception only for those who paid them part of the proceeds.  But now the owner received the courtesans very kindly.  He treated the girls to a drink and at the end of the conversation asked Alfonsin to come to him tomorrow - alone.  Already seeing off, the restaurateur inquired about the name of the girl.  “Marie Duplessis,” Alfonsina introduced herself.  She understood that a melodic and noble name would give her mystery and charm.  Suddenly, the courtesan realized - from tomorrow a comfortable life would begin for her. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  New boyfriend </h2><p>  Marie Duplessis was not mistaken.  The restaurateur dressed the girl, rented her a dwelling, and enveloped him with such care that his legitimate wife did not even dream of.  But the courtesan quickly realized that she could get much more out of life.  Once, dressing in the latest fashion, Marie went to the opera.  From there, the girl left in the carriage of the first womanizer of the 1840s, Count de Guiche. </p><p>  The new boyfriend not only showered Duplessis with money, he also made her the most chic lady of the capital.  Now Marie only dressed at expensive tailors.  Also, the girl did not deny herself jewelry, perfumes, gourmet food and flowers.  To the latter, the courtesan was very partial.  In the chic house of Duplessis there were so many flowers that the visiting guests had the impression that they were in the greenhouse.  Marie also enjoyed boasting rare plants from America and India.  Only roses were absent in her house - the girl was dizzy from their smell.  But at all smelling and modest camellias were in abundance.  The courtesan commented on her predilections very specifically: “I adore candied grapes, as it is tasteless, and camellias for their lack of smell.  I also love rich people because they don’t have a heart. ” </p>

    <h2>  The emergence of patrons </h2><p>  Soon de Guiche began to run out of funds to maintain such a luxurious woman.  Therefore, he was forced to retire.  Since then, the patrons in the life of Marie began to change one after another.  In part, this was facilitated by a team hired by her, collecting information about promising clients and negotiating with them about the contents of Duplessis.  In Paris, she had the “highest price tag”.  But fans only encouraged.  Philosophers, musicians, poets and artists often went to the salon of Marie Duplessis.  The portrait of the girl was just painted by one of her guests - a talented painter named Eduard Vieno.  He very reliably was able to convey on the canvas the amazing Victorian beauty of the girl.  Her glossy black hair, ivory skin, oval face and sparkling eyes delight even a modern sophisticated viewer. </p><p>  It should be noted that not all guests of the courtesan had the status of lovers.  Some came just to talk: sincere, witty and sensitive Marie was considered an excellent conversationalist and fan of all that was beautiful.  At the same time, coquetry and romantic sadness were inherent in her. </p>

    <h2>  Marie Duplessis and Dumas Jr. </h2><p>  But the courtesan did not pursue the "secular chatter" and passions.  The girl wanted devotion, understanding and falling in love.  She hoped that at least one of the boyfriends would see a man in her, and not an expensive trinket.  As soon as the courtesan felt even a hint of tenderness and sympathy, hope appeared in her soul, which in most cases did not grow into anything more.  Therefore, Marie’s romance with <span>Alexander Dumas Jr.</span> ended in a breakup.  The girl was mistaken, taking his moralist pity for true love. </p><p>  Dumas the son, or Ade (A.D.), as Duplessis called him, was the same age as the courtesan and not yet completely spoiled by the high society.  In addition, the writer was brought up only by her mother, so he knew better than others about the ruthlessness of public opinion to sinful women.  He sincerely admired Marie, was full of sympathy and understood that the girl was above her own destiny.  That is, selling the body for money, she is very suffering.  And Duplessis believed in Ada's love, hoping for swift changes in her life. </p>

    <h2>  The end of the novel </h2><p>  But, alas, this time the courtesan entertained herself with illusions.  Of course, Dumas Jr. was sincerely passionate about her.  However, the young man was not going to take care of Marie and become her "deliverer".  Ada had neither the means nor the desire to forever link her fate with some courtesan.  Instead, Dumas was jealous of the girl for wealthy fans, appealed to her morality, and then left Paris altogether, leaving for Spain. </p><p>  After that, Marie Duplessis, whose photo can now be seen on the cover of the book “Lady with Camellias”, plunged even deeper into the abyss of pleasure.  In fact, she could very well “tie up” with the profession and stay with only one fan who showered her with money - Stackelberg.  Moreover, the latter needed only tenderness and attention - the count stepped over the eighth dozen.  But the courtesan did not see the point of changing her usual way of life.  So the girl could spend more saturated measured for her several months, because she found incurable consumption at that time. </p><h2>  Recent hobbies </h2><p>  Before his death, Marie Duplessis, whose lifestyle discussion was then the main theme in many French salons, had two novels - with Eduard de Perrego and Franz Liszt.  Some people who confuse the courtesan with Fanny Lear, mentioned at the beginning of the article, mistakenly attribute to her another affair - with the emperor’s son Nikolai Konstantinovich.  In fact, Marie Duplessis and Prince Romanov never met. </p><p>  The last two hobbies of the courtesan ended unsuccessfully.  With Edward de Perrego, it came to marriage.  But soon Marie learned of his illegality in France.  Duplessis considered it a mockery and broke up with the count.  And <span>Ferenc Liszt</span> left the courtesan immediately after completing his tour in the capital. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  Marie Duplessis, whose biography was presented above, died in Paris in 1847.  In recent months, the girl has lived in poverty.  She was also pursued by creditors.  And numerous lovers left the once most striking courtesan of the capital.  And who needs a consumptive and dying girl?  But such a man was found.  It was her "husband" Eduard de Perrego.  He prayed to Marie for forgiveness and meeting.  But Duplessis did not agree.  The most coveted courtesan of Paris died in the arms of a maid.  Only two people came to the girl’s funeral: Eduard de Perrego, who bought a place in the cemetery, and who counted with creditors Count Stackelberg. </p><p>  The news of the death of a former lover found Dumas Jr. in Spain.  Arriving in Paris, he immediately went to the grave of Marie Duplessis.  “Lady with Camellias” - this is exactly the novel that was written “freshly followed” by a shocked young man.  The work turned out to be lyrical and expressing sympathy for the fallen women.  There was also a noble hero who had nothing to do with Dumas son.  There was also great love - sacrificial, romantic, like the one Duplessis had always dreamed about.  But, unfortunately, she did not wait for her.  The tragic life of the “lady with camellias” has become a usual love story with sentiments and tears.  Although ... Alfonsine, who took the name of Marie Duplessis, would love the novel. </p>
