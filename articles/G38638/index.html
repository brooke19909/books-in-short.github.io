    <p>  Nokia 7230 was created in order to compete with phones that were manufactured by Samsung.  It should be immediately noted that in the slider segment, the South Korean manufacturer of mobile phones has largely entrenched, and the struggle was not short-lived.  In general, the task of the Finnish company was as follows.  She was required to create an apparatus that would become of interest to a sufficiently large audience.  Moreover, among the voiced conditions were low cost and related manufacturing materials.  In fact, that's all.  This was the only basis for the creation of Nokia 7230, the price of which is seven thousand rubles. </p><p>  And if it was possible to somehow cope with the cost and bring it to the desired level, then the engineers obviously messed up something with the production materials.  At first, their manipulations were completely incomprehensible.  As a result, the developers, as it seems, decided not to bother with this and simply simply used the first material that came across, without regard to its characteristics and parameters.  What, in principle, one could still expect from the Finnish manufacturer, no offense to Nokia will be said.  Although the company knows a lot about smartphones, it sometimes makes decisions that go against the tradition (and, it should be noted, to the detriment). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conclusion on the reasons for the creation </h2>

    <p>  So, creating a Nokia 7230 phone, firmware for which is available on the official website of the company, the developers relied on the brand.  According to their plan, the name itself was already to displace the sliders of the South Korean manufacturer from the market.  Additional advantages of the model include a fairly high-quality screen and, by the way, good technical characteristics. </p><h2>  Everything for lovely ladies </h2>

    <p>  From the very beginning, it was clear that the Nokia 7230 mobile phone, whose display size is 2.2 inches, was most likely intended for representatives of the fair half of humanity.  Of course, it is also suitable for men.  Nevertheless, it is noticeable to the naked eye that the device, after all, lies better in the female hand.  It is possible that the reason for this positioning lies in the design of the device.  Based on some sales data (under the heading ‚Äútop secret‚Äù), we can say that the divergence of the model by gender was four to one. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  What can we find inside the package when we open it?  The device itself will be in the box, which is understandable, a wired stereo headset for it (these are WH-102 headphones), a microSD memory card (2 gigabytes in volume), a charger and a battery.  This lithium-ion battery, its capacity is about 820 mAh.  The kit is successfully completed by the user manual, as well as the warranty card. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Many users who purchased this phone admitted that at first glance the device seemed to them the most ordinary slider that did not have any distinctive features.  Nevertheless, in the characteristic that many women gave to the apparatus, the word ‚Äúcheap‚Äù constantly appeared.  It is completely justified and reasoned.  The device really didn‚Äôt cost so much at its peak. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Production material </h2>

    <p>  This, of course, is ordinary plastic.  The corpus consists of it for all 80 percent.  Nevertheless, plastic can be said to be harmless to the user, his environment, and indeed to the environment, it can be recycled after disposal.  Yes, about what, but the Finnish manufacturer this time took care of the environment properly. </p><p>  Almost the same thing is observed with the telephone box.  It is made of eco-friendly cardboard.  It can also be completely disposed of.  In addition, the dimensions of the box are such that during transportation the discomfort is felt minimally.  It is possible that the Finnish manufacturer has adopted these two factors, inspired by the example of Sony Ericson.  Although for us, ordinary customers, this does not play a special role.  We need a phone - we buy it.  Moreover, only a few pay attention to its environmental friendliness from a multi-thousand audience. </p><h2>  Side faces </h2>

    <p>  The sides of the phone are edged with colored plastic, which has a chrome texture.  The experience of the creation prompted Nokia experts that this material of manufacture begins to largely wipe and fly around after it has been deeply scratched.  But engineers and designers missed this remark by their ears, and again we all see the same plastic.  Absolutely nothing has changed. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  It is made in relief.  You can still find fault with execution, but this will be discussed a little later.  So, the structure of the back panel is corrugated.  This has its practical reasons.  Firstly, fingerprints are noticeable several times worse.  Secondly, such a panel will not receive so much (and less noticeable) mechanical damage.  Thirdly, this gives the device a more marketable appearance than with a monolithic, even face.  And finally, the tactile perception of such a cover is much nicer.  Now let's talk about the shortcomings of such a performance. </p><p>  It so happened that the back cover is very, very thin.  Due to the use of low-quality plastic grades, scratches and other mechanical defects are noticeable, even though the panel is made in relief form. </p><h2>  Latches and mechanisms </h2><p>  Completed the first, to put it mildly, very strange.  You can immediately note the inconvenience.  When the user opens and closes the back panel a sufficient number of times, it will begin to emit a constant creak.  So here - you use the device, and it begins to speak in a language understandable only to him.  A terrible dream of people who hate backlash.  At the same time, it does not take a lot of time to ‚Äúkill‚Äù the back cover. </p><p>  We can say that the Finnish manufacturer was chasing, first of all, a beautiful appearance, and in the backlashes and creaks it was this pursuit that played a fatal role.  However, nothing can be done.  The South Korean company Samsung in this direction has acted more reasonably.  What did the Koreans do?  They missed the move, without adding ostensibly chrome elements.  Why?  Yes, because chromed plastic is a favorite way of attracting attention from Chinese manufacturers.  So Nokia was in a trap, which, in theory, wanted to catch its competitor (well, or even in some way a colleague). </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  In all three planes, the dimensions of the phone are as follows: 98 by 48 by 14.75 millimeters.  The mass of the device is only one hundred grams.  I would like to say that this is such a brick.  However, the mass does not allow this to be done.  If she was at least fifty grams more, then another thing.  The rest can be said that the dimensions of the device are average, standard.  At the same time, the phone lies securely and conveniently in the hand.  There should not be any complaints in this regard. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  There is a connector for connecting a wired stereo headset standard 3.5 mm.  Also nearby is a charger cable slot.  The port for the MicroUSB wire is covered with a special plug. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  There is a key with which you can control the camera of the device.  She herself is on the back of the phone.  The camera resolution is 3.2 megapixels. </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  The device entered the smartphone market in two color variations.  It is pink and graphite.  Both options, in principle, look pretty pretty.  But the first, as you might have guessed, was for women, and the second for men. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The owners of the phone have repeatedly recorded in the advantages of the device a good quality of voice transmission.  And distinguished in a good sense of the word not only the microphone, but also the speaker.  The volume is good there, the interlocutor on the other end of the wire is heard just fine.  Not spared and voice call.  The ringer volume is at the level, the same applies to vibration mode.  Skipping an incoming call even in a noisy environment will be difficult. </p><p>  The disadvantages this time include the material of manufacture of the housing.  He really spoils the opinion of such a good device.  Backlashes immediately appear, the device begins to creak, which, by the way, can annoy the owner of the phone. </p>
