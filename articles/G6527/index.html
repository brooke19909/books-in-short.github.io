They are the key to the card account, to which we receive wages, scholarships, pensions and other money transfers. </p><p>  At the same time, there are a lot of banks and it is quite difficult to decide which one is the best to open a card for yourself.  After all, each banking institution has its own policy, and therefore the conditions for opening and servicing plastic cards.  In this article you will find an overview of the debit cards that Alfa-Bank offers its customers. </p><h2>  A little bit about the bank </h2><p>  When choosing a bank, you should always pay attention to its rating and position in the financial services market.  Because, of course, I don’t want to entrust the money to the institution that will burst the next day. </p>

All of them differ in their conditions and characteristics.  Thanks to this, the bank management is trying to satisfy the needs of absolutely every client. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is understandable, because someone wants to open a card account to receive social benefits, and someone to make payments abroad when traveling around the world. </p><p>  Next, consider the most popular types of such cards and find out what type of customers they are most suitable for. </p><h2>  “Russian Railways Bonus” </h2><p>  This Alfa-Bank debit card is designed for those who often travel on long-distance trains, as well as Sapsan high-speed trains.

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, already the first such exchange can be made six months later, if card payments are made for at least 20 thousand rubles.  This card can be issued in three levels: Standart, Gold and Platinum.  The higher the class of the card, the more bonuses will come for making purchases. </p><p>  For example, using a Platinum level card and paying with it at least 20 thousand rubles a month for a year, you can accumulate 15,000 bonuses, which are enough to travel from Moscow to Sochi.  Agree that it is very convenient and you can quietly accumulate free travel to the resort for the long-awaited vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Money back with “Cash Back” </h2><p>  Did you know that Alfa-Bank debit card helps you earn on your purchases?  The “Cash Back” card will allow you not only to make purchases in stores, but also to constantly receive transfers to your card for payments at gas stations, cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  It turns out that you can not only have a tasty meal in any restaurant, but also get a bonus of 5% of the money you spent.  And for those who often drive, this card is even more suitable - up to 10% of each purchase at gas stations will return to the account. </p>

    <p>  Since this card is issued only in Gold-class, the bank guarantees its high level of protection: 3D-Secure technology is provided for online purchases, an integrated chip for operations in retail outlets. </p><p>  This Alfa-Bank debit card also has a nice bonus.  She participates in the program “Priceless Cities”, which was organized by the Mastercard payment system.  Thanks to this, you can receive up to 15% discounts on products of partners of the bank and this program. </p><p>  Annual card maintenance will cost you 1200 rubles.  Is it a lot or a little?

For example, it’s worth refueling for 10 thousand rubles and a bonus of 1 thousand will come to the card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  “Men's card” </h2><p>  There are cards designed only for the stronger sex.

    <p>  It is called the “Men's Card”.  Its main advantage is up to 20% discounts <span>in cafes, restaurants,</span> bars, gyms, clothing stores, shopping centers, etc. On the bank's website you can find the full list of outlets that are ready to give a discount to a real man. </p><p>  One of the partners supporting the release of this card is the well-known magazine MAXIM.  “Male card” of each client regularly participates in the campaign, winning in which you can be in the jury of the Miss MAXIM contest finals. </p><p>  Do you want to participate and be surrounded by the most beautiful girls according to the magazine?  It is enough just to actively use the card, pay with it at retail outlets, make transfers, in general, conduct active financial activities.  Be an active customer and you can win. </p><p>  The bank also declares that the owners of such a card can always be lucky and get tickets or passes to various “closed” events. </p><p>  Although the reviews say that this is a trick of the bank and it is really impossible to track the winner.  Others say that the competition is too much and it is impossible for an ordinary person to win. </p><p>  The annual maintenance fee for Alfa Bank debit cards of this type costs from 450 to 600 rubles.  Given the benefits that bank customers receive with this plastic card, this fee is quite low. </p><h2>  No interest cards </h2><p>  Today, almost all major financial institutions can offer their customers debit cards, the terms of which provide for the accrual of interest on the balance.  This is a kind of deposit from which you can withdraw funds at any time or increase the total amount of the balance. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, Alfa Bank does not issue debit cards with interest accrual.  Reviews say that this is a drawback, since there are many who want to draw up a similar card. </p><p>  Instead, the bank offers customers to issue a so-called package offer, which includes both plastic cards of different levels and savings accounts. </p><h2>  Batch service </h2><p>  If you are considering how to issue an Alfa Bank debit card, then do not pass by the package offer.  They are a set of card, current and savings accounts.  All this can be discovered by issuing one contract. </p><p>  The bank offers its customers 4 levels of similar product: “Economy”, “Optimum”, “Comfort” and “Maximum”. </p><p>  The first of them makes it possible to open current accounts in different currencies, as well as issue a Classic debit card, which can be “linked” to any of the open accounts.  It will be useful both for students and for people receiving transfers from abroad, such an Alfa Bank debit card.  There are different reviews about it, but most customers agree that for those people who do not often use the services of banks, cards of this class are quite enough. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is possible to open a savings account “My safe”.  Rates on it, of course, are lower than on conventional deposits.  For example, at the level of the package offer “Economy” the bank is ready to pay you 1% per annum. </p><p>  The annual maintenance of such an offer will cost 959 rubles or 0 rubles, if the amount of over 30,000 rubles is placed on current and savings accounts.  On a monthly basis, you can withdraw no more than the equivalent of 5 thousand US dollars in rubles through ATMs. </p><p>  You can also not pay for the “Optimum” package, but the amount of funds deposited in your accounts must be more than 70 thousand rubles, otherwise 1929 rubles will have to be paid for the year. </p><p>  This package for more “advanced” users of financial services requires up to 5 cards of Visa Classic and Mastercard Standart level.  In addition, a wide selection of savings accounts is available, the interest rate reaches 7% per annum (750 thousand rubles per month). </p><p>  It recommends that you fill out the Comfort offer to existing Alfa Bank customers.  The gold debit card available in this package is designed for wealthy and active people.  If the accounts will be more than 300 thousand rubles, then the annual service will be free. </p><p>  Otherwise, you will need to pay 5099 rubles annually.  Judging by the reviews, the bank provides legal and medical support at discounts to the owners of such a package. </p><p>  What is interesting in the most expensive package offer “Maximum”?  This is a premium personalized <span>customer service.</span>  The bank is ready to offer such conditions for products that are not available to others.  A personal VIP manager is allocated to the client, who helps to understand and solve any issues that Alfa Bank is competent in. </p><p>  Debit cards, the limits for withdrawing funds from ATMs for which are quite high in this package offer (1.5 million rubles per month), are status ones.  This means that by presenting such a card, the person will have access to the best services around the world, including VIP rooms in hotels. </p><h2>  How to apply for a card at Alfa Bank? </h2><p>  You can order a debit card both in the department and via the Internet.  After spending 2-3 minutes of personal time, right on the site you can fill out a questionnaire and call a courier who will deliver a card for free. </p>
