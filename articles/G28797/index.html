It is worth seeing the sights of Liverpool before the city forever ceases to be the cultural capital of Europe. </p><h2>  Liverpool World Heritage </h2><p>  Modern Liverpool (UK) is an important trading metropolis, university and financial center, as well as a key place for Catholic and <span>Anglican churches.</span> </p><p>  Liverpool is the former <span>European capital of</span> culture and a modern football center.  In addition, it is the birthplace of a quartet of Liverpool ‚Äúbugs‚Äù that became megabytes in the sixties, and an architectural refuge for those who are trying to find something lost in time. </p>

    <p>  The city in its history has benefited from two events: the industrial revolution and the slave trade.  At the end of the XVII century, every fourth ship leaving the port of Liverpool was involved in the slave trade, and the company of the same name was involved in this sad operation for almost three centuries. </p><p>  Over the centuries, Liverpool has developed as a trading and port city.  Thanks to commerce with China, it is now the center of Europe's oldest Chinese communities.  Just a moment to look at Chinatown, and you can find yourself in a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Middle Kingdom, with its restaurants and eateries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Walking through the streets of Liverpool, you can sometimes feel that you are transported back centuries into the past.  No wonder its streets as scenery are often used by film companies.  The city is a place of shooting films in which the action takes place in the distant past. </p><p>  The City Museum will tell tourists about the films made in Liverpool.  Some names may remind you of this, such as ‚ÄúCaptain America‚Äù or ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù. </p><h2>  In the wake of the Beatles </h2><p>  Liverpool is the birthplace of the famous group.  Its participants were born here, met and played together as a team.  And from here they went to conquer the world. </p><p>  The Cavern Club is the place where the Beatles musicians debuted.  The group began to play here in 1961 and over time began to attract crowds of fans and arrange concerts in the evenings.  Soon, the small bulky cellar could no longer accommodate all the fans of the Liverpool four (the queue of those who wanted to listen to them was even blocked by Matthew Street). </p>

    <p>  It is also worth visiting the The Beatles Story Museum, dedicated to the famous group.  Here you can plunge into their atmosphere and imagine the milestones of the history of musicians.  For example, look at John Lennon‚Äôs white room and his piano, on which he composed Imagine.  Or consider his famous glasses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition, posters, costumes and many other memorabilia of musicians are exhibited there - even George Harrison's first guitar. </p><p>  Nearby is an interesting store for fans of Liverpool beetles.

    <p>  This is perhaps the most famous building in the city - the first skyscraper in the UK, built by architect Karl Bartels Bernard.  At the top of its two towers are six-meter mythical birds, looking in different directions.  Legend has it that these birds had an important purpose: one is watching the townspeople, and the other is watching the sailors who sail to Liverpool.  Each tower has a watch with a diameter of 8 m. This, by the way, is the largest electronic watch in the UK.  Royal Liver Building is 90 meters high (13 floors). </p>
