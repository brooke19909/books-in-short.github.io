But sometimes it does not fit into the interior of the kitchen.  And it happens that the appearance of the white ‚Äúcloset‚Äù is simply tired and I want to dilute the interior a little.  Therefore, today we will talk about how to decorate the refrigerator, what methods exist and what may be required to implement the plan.  Extra bonus!  Since the winter holidays are already around the corner, the article will provide information on how to decorate the refrigerator for the New Year and thus make the atmosphere in the house even more fabulous. </p><h2>  Simple stickers </h2><p>  Most likely, you remember how in the 1990s it was fashionable to glue fridges and furniture with stickers from chewing gum on which a wide variety of images could be printed.  For many, this idea still remains relevant, but if you want something newer and more refined, vinyl stickers will come to the rescue.  With the help of modern stickers, you can create an ornament on the refrigerator or collect an original graphic drawing, or you can simply paste it with images of flowers, animals, butterflies, etc. Such pictures have a number of advantages: they are sold in a huge assortment, you can definitely choose the one that suits you option, they can be easily glued and peeled off.  In general, if you do not know how to decorate a refrigerator quickly and simply, then this method will surely seem attractive to you, moreover, it is very budget-friendly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adorable-home.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge stickers" class="if uuid-3041767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3041767.jpg"></div><h2>  Photo printing </h2><p>  Wall murals have long been popular in the post-Soviet space, but no one could have imagined that they could be glued to the refrigerator!  In this case, they differ in their texture.  Any drawing, ornament or photograph can be printed on a glossy self-adhesive film or on a huge magnetic panel: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  If you are printing a photo on film, then for its installation you will need to first remove the handles from the refrigerator.  Then, under the influence of warm air (hair dryer), stretch the film on the surface of the door and flatten with a spatula.  Further, the edges are adjusted, and the handles are put in place. </li><li>  With magnetic panels there is no hassle at all - they simply stick to the metal case.  If you do not know how to decorate the refrigerator as quickly and simply as possible, then use this method. </li></ul><p>  With the help of photo printing, you can turn the refrigerator into anything: a telephone box, a machine with soda.  Also on it you can print an ornament, stylistic drawing or family photos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photo printing on the fridge" class="if uuid-3041775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3041775.jpg"></div><h2>  Blackboard </h2><p>  Do you have small children in your family?  Or maybe you yourself like to draw with crayons?  Then a slate surface is what your refrigerator needs to be turned into!  How to decorate the updated facade of this device in the future, you will decide depending on the mood.  Leave a note today, draw flowers tomorrow, then write someone‚Äôs portrait ... What will be needed to make a blackboard out of a simple refrigerator?  There are three ways, one simpler than the other: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  It is possible to glue the refrigerator with slate wallpaper both partially and completely.  The advantage of this method is that they can be easily dismantled.  The disadvantage is that they will be quickly worn out. </li><li>  Install a magnetic slate.  This option is the easiest. </li><li>  Paint the refrigerator completely with slate paint.  This method is the most time-consuming, plus you can not return the surface to its former appearance.  But at the same time, the frame will become more secure and will last you longer. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.couponraja.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slate refrigerator" class="if uuid-3041768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3041768.jpg"></div><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  Are you looking for not just a way to decorate the refrigerator, but trying to completely change its appearance?  Then repaint it!  An old, proven and effective method, which also allows you to make the interior more holistic and complete.  The most interesting thing is that you can color both the new refrigerator, making it both part of the kitchen set, and the old one (say, Dnipro), turning it into a bright accent in the kitchen.  Separately, we note that this technique is not only the answer to the question of how to decorate an old refrigerator.  It will allow you to visually change the parameters of the room.  If the kitchen is small, choose a dye to match the headset or walls.  So the refrigerator will not seem so bulky.  In the case when the interior is boring, you can dilute it with a bright juicy accent.  Below you will find a guide on how to decorate a refrigerator by simply painting it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="lalila.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="painting the refrigerator" class="if uuid-3041779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3041779.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  To begin with, a little tip: it is best to paint the refrigerator with paint from a spray can.  It will lie on the surface evenly and does not form stains.  If we are a painter with experience and experience, you can use special brushes in this technology, but the process will take a little longer: </p><ul><li>  Step one: we skin the entire body of the device. </li><li>  Degrease the surface of the refrigerator with alcohol. </li><li>  We apply a primer so that the dye is more firmly fixed on the metal. </li><li>  We protect all those areas that you do not want to paint.  We also seal the refrigerator chamber with a film or oilcloth </li><li>  Directly paint.  We put the first coat of paint - thin, and let it dry.  Then, if necessary, apply the second and also let it dry. </li><li>  We fix the result with transparent varnish - glossy or matte. </li></ul><h2>  Freehand painting </h2><p>  If you are an artist and think about how to decorate a refrigerator beautifully, it is strange that you have not guessed to paint it like clay dishes.  You can draw with a brush anything - from simple graphic ornaments to complex still lifes and landscapes.  With the help of painting, this kitchen device can be made part of the furniture, or it can be turned into an art object that will attract all the attention.  Here are some tips on this: </p><ul><li>  For painting, it is best to use acrylic paints. </li><li>  If you don‚Äôt know how to draw, but really want to paint the refrigerator, use stencils. </li></ul><p>  If you are not friends with brushes at all, then the next method will tell you how to decorate the refrigerator with your own hands, using pre-made drawings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prakticideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hand painted fridge" class="if uuid-3041802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3041802.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoupage </h2><p>  This decoration technique with an exquisite French name has long been a favorite among fans of decorating their home.  Decoupage - transfer to the surface of a picture, ornament or the whole composition and further fixing with varnish.  Everything can be decorated in this way - furniture, appliances, kitchen utensils and even walls.  Want to decorate the refrigerator, as in the photo below, and make it a masterpiece in the style of Provence?  Then our step-by-step instructions will help you. </p><h2>  Instruction for implementation </h2><p>  You will need: </p><ul><li>  Napkins with selected patterns. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Pencil. </li><li>  Thin and thick brushes. </li><li>  Acrylic paints. </li><li>  Acrylic lacquer. </li></ul><p>  Now go to the steps: </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to prepare a metal case.  If you are going to glue directly on the white surface of the refrigerator, degrease it with alcohol.  You can also paint the body in the color most suitable for the selected drawings and let the paint dry. </li><li>  Cut out patterns from napkins. </li><li>  We make markup: what and where to glue. </li><li>  We glue the back of the drawings with glue and attach them to the designated places.  Excess glue is wiped with a sponge. </li><li>  Inks draw the missing elements between the drawings. </li><li>  Fix the result with two layers of acrylic varnish. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="genial.guru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage fridge in provence style" class="if uuid-3041728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3041728.jpg"></div><h2>  We work with moldings </h2><p>  This type of decor of the refrigerator, as, indeed, of any other household appliances, is just a godsend for those whose home is decorated in a classic or old style.  Modern appliances do not fit into such an interior, so they all the time have to either be hidden or decorated.  In this section, we propose to turn the refrigerator into a buffet or into a kitchen cabinet.  The process will consist of two stages - painting and decoration.  For the first we need: </p><ul><li>  Primer. </li><li>  Chalky white paint. </li><li>  Chalk paint of the desired color. </li><li>  A set of brushes for painting. </li><li>  Dark wax. </li><li>  Colorless wax. </li><li>  Masking tape. </li></ul><p>  But for the decor, the following items come in handy: </p><ul><li>  Glue for metal. </li><li>  Saw for cutting moldings. </li><li>  The moldings themselves. </li><li>  Carved decor with furniture. </li></ul><h2>  Installation instructions for moldings </h2><p>  Step by step description: </p><ul><li>  We skim and degrease the refrigerator case. </li><li>  We glue moldings and carved decorative elements from the furniture to it. </li><li>  In two layers, apply white paint to the entire surface of the body and let it dry. </li><li>  We apply color paint with a brush in coarse and large strokes in one layer.  Thus, the effect of wear is obtained. </li><li>  Decor elements and moldings are covered with colorless wax.  After it dries, apply colored wax. </li><li>  The final step is to coat the entire refrigerator body with colorless wax using a round brush. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge trim moldings" class="if uuid-3041792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3041792.jpg"></div><p>  So we learned how to decorate an old refrigerator with our own hands, make it more expressive, or, conversely, turn it into a part of a wall or kitchen unit.  And now let's look at options for festive decor that will give the feeling of a real winter fairy tale. </p><h2>  You can‚Äôt imagine anything easier! </h2><p>  We have already discussed that the easiest way to decorate a refrigerator is with stickers.  This technique remains relevant for the New Year, only this time the drawings will be much more vivid and festive.  You can choose any image - a penguin, Santa Claus, a snowman - or just glue the case with snowflakes.  It is worth emphasizing that you can not only acquire ready-made pictures, but also make them yourself.  To do this, use either self-adhesive colored paper, or plain paper and glue.  By the way, to invent and cut out the details of the drawing will be especially interesting to the kids. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homesteading.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="christmas fridge stickers" class="if uuid-3041820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3041820.jpg"></div><h2>  More shine, more colors! </h2><p>  The most original and most festive way to decorate the fridge for the New Year is to create a picture on it using tinsel.  This element of New Year's decor is simply irreplaceable, and it can not be much.  Apply a light sketch with a pencil on the refrigerator case and glue the tinsel of the desired color on it.  It can be images of a Christmas tree, a snowman, Santa Claus, snowflakes and other attributes of this beautiful snow celebration. </p><h2>  New Year's magnets </h2><p>  A very simple and very cute way to decorate the refrigerator for the New Year with your own hands.  Holiday magnets are sold in all stores - even grocery ones.  All you need to do is find those that will be similar in style and that will worthily decorate your kitchen interior.  The advantage of magnets is also that they can be used to fix light toys, pendants or tinsel.  So the refrigerator will become even more elegant and colorful.  Moreover, such a design can be changed at least every day, moving magnets and changing toys. </p><h2>  Christmas Wreath </h2><p>  Hanging wreaths on the door is a tradition that came to us from America.  It is there that people like to place themed wreaths on the front doors: in autumn - from autumn leaves, in winter - from tinsel and balls, in spring - from flowers, and in summer from shells and starfish.  Why not hang the winter wreath on the refrigerator door?  You can buy such an accessory, or you can make it yourself.  It is important that it is not too large and heavy, as the refrigerator door constantly opens.  You can fix it with liquid nails or with double-sided tape.  The only recommendation is to choose plastic balls for decorating the wreath, as glass can shatter in a hectic kitchen atmosphere. </p>
