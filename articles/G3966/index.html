Shambhala is an ancient Indian legendary country similar to the famous sunken Atlantis.  She is hiding somewhere in the heart of Tibet, no one has been there, but many know that the area is inhabited by very special people, wise with higher knowledge and enlightened by the great universal Spirit.  From there, bracelets came to us, performing not so much the role of decoration, but a kind of amulet, a talisman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shamballa do-it-yourself bracelets" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/237941.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  It is believed that the bracelets of Shambhala protect a person from negative influences from hostile forces, <span>energy vampires,</span> help maintain peace of mind, peace, enter a state of harmony.  Depending on which stones are used in the bracelet, it can have beneficial effects on certain organs and systems of our body.  He is able to improve his memory, mental activity, help in various endeavors, and draw good luck. </p><p>  <strong>Some important rules</strong> </p><p>  Those who are interested in oriental spiritual practices will surely want to have the famous decoration of <span>Shambhala.</span>  Do-it-yourself <span>bracelets</span> - isn‚Äôt it a wonderful hobby, useful and interesting?  And, most importantly, learning this is not so difficult.  Just remember a few rules: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Firstly, the color.  Any piece of jewelry is a stylish elegant little thing, a great addition to an evening or everyday toilet (i.e. clothes), a great means of self-expression, individuality.  But everything looks much more serious and subtle in relation to Shambhala.  You can do any kind of bracelets with your own hands, but in order to bring real benefits, have a strong energy charge, the color of threads and beads should be correlated with the colors that are indicated in your personal horoscope, suitable for your zodiac sign.  If you are, for example, Sagittarius, and you are recommended green, purple, blue, crimson tones and shades, then they should be the basis of your jewelry.  Make yourself a few mascots of Shambhala - do-it-yourself bracelets are easier to make than to buy in a store. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Shambhala bracelet double" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/237942.jpg" width="365"></div></li><li>  Secondly, a stone.  Again, it is precisely those jewelry that is made from a natural gem, semi-precious or ornamental, that will have a real impact on well-being and aura.  And it is important that these stones are yours, combined with your zodiac sign.  Then the ancient magic of Shambhala will come into force: bracelets made with their own hands will protect you from many troubles. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Workshop at home</strong> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, a bracelet made of rubies or diamonds, and natural ones, you won‚Äôt gossip for the lack of these components.  But from ordinary <span>beads (metal,</span> wooden, glass), beads, colored laces, leather and other auxiliary material - it's easy.  So you will have the usual Shambhala bracelet, made with your own hands double or in several threads.  Let's get started?  Then pick up beads, a fishing line or a spool of rope thread, you can also <span>use a waxed cord,</span> colorless nail polish or glue like PVA.  By the way, learn the basics of knitting macrame along the way.  Now we will try to make ordinary, and then, having filled your hand, you can even make a triple bracelet of Shambhala with your own hands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Shambhala Triple Bracelet" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/237940.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Rules of Macrame and Shambhala</strong> </p><p>  Pick up a small chopping board.  It will be a weaving machine.  Drive a pair of carnations into it, the distance between them is 45 cm. Place the machine upright and work.  Tie the end of the fishing line from the reel to one nail, cut about 50 cm, string the beads (10 pieces) and tie it to the second nail.  Now we still need 2 m of fishing line;  the segment should be brought under the string with beads, tied with a knot, only so that both ends of the free ones are of equal length.  After this, the base knots should be knitted according to the macrame system - the <span>Shambhala weaving</span> technique is based on them <span>.</span>  When it comes to the beads, they are braided, and knitting continues.  The final number of knots after the pebbles should be 20. Then the fastener is made. </p><p>  To learn weaving, patience and perseverance are required.  But the new beautiful decoration will fully compensate the time spent and efforts.  And learning how to weave macrame is also very useful.  And the bracelet-mascot of Shambhala will become your assistant in life. </p>
