  <section class="page js-page"><h1>19th century woman: photos, how they looked, how they dressed, lifestyle</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The rights of beautiful women are discussed loudly in society today, despite the fact that they cannot be compared with the conditions in which a woman of the 19th century lived.  In the past, even not too distant, the rights of young ladies were very limited.  And if women of the 19th century in Russia and other countries of Europe and America were poor, then they had no rights at all.  Unless the right to life, and then with restrictions. </p><p>  With some irony, the Victorian philosopher noted that a woman of the 19th century has a limited choice: she can be either a queen or no one. </p><p>  For many centuries, young girls left their parental home, entering into marriage, without taking this decision on their own, only on the basis of parental consent.  A divorce could also be concluded only at the request of the husband, without questioning his word. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bl.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="19th century woman" class="if uuid-3262053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32842/3262053.jpg"></div><p>  No matter how strange these facts may be, this was exactly the way of life of a woman of the 19th century.  Photos and illustrations, portraits and descriptions of the Victorian era paint a picture of chic and magnificent costumes, however, do not forget that portraits and memoirs could only afford the most wealthy people.  But even famous women of the 19th century were faced with an insurmountable amount of inequality in the world, which was controlled exclusively by men.  Even when beautiful persons sat on the throne. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Voting right </h2><p>  Not so long ago, it was unthinkable to even think about the participation of women in public life.  Legally, women in the 19th century practically did not exist.  The women of Russia received the right to vote after the 1917 revolution, although in Finland, which was part of the Empire, they received the right to vote in 1906.  England introduced the right to vote for women only in 1918, and the United States in 1920, but even then only for whites. </p><h2>  Prevention of sexually transmitted diseases </h2><p>  Even at the beginning of the last century, in many countries women who suffered from sexually transmitted diseases were quarantined.  However, for men suffering from the same diseases, there was never quarantine, despite the fact that men were also carriers of these infections. </p><p>  In England, a law was passed according to which any woman who accused a man of having infected her with a sexually transmitted infection was subject to a gynecological examination ... by the police. </p><p>  Depending on the decision of the policeman, a woman could be punished and quarantined.  Which in fact was not a solution to the problem. </p><h2>  19th century woman as a ‚Äúsubhuman‚Äù </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="women in the 19th century in Russia" class="if uuid-3262052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32842/3262052.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time, beautiful persons wore the legal status of "non-personality."  This meant that they could not open a bank account in their own name, could not conclude a contract of sale and could not even make decisions about medical intervention in their own body. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All this, instead of a woman, was decided by the husband, father or brother.  Men also managed all of their property, often including the one they received as a dowry. </p><h2>  Sexual slavery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.clarabartonmuseum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="famous women of the 19th century" class="if uuid-3262060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32842/3262060.jpg"></div><p>  A British journalist found in a newspaper belonging to the second half of the 19th century the price set by the house of tolerance for the first sexual relations with underage girls: 5 pounds. </p><p>  Under the "premiere" in a sexual context was understood the right of the first night.  Brothel owners in big cities were constantly looking for 12‚Äì13-year-old girls from poor families, whom they could persuade to engage in prostitution even after the ‚Äúpremiere‚Äù. </p><p>  It should be noted that at that time there were no clear rules for the protection of minors.  Pedophilia was considered a simple and noble sexual fantasy, accessible to those who had money. </p><h2>  What did women look like in the 19th century? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sputniknews.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201602091034465987-abortion-uk-victorian-law/"><img itemprop="image" alt="women of the 19th century photo" class="if uuid-3262055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32842/3262055.jpg"></div><p>  The suit was terribly uncomfortable and unhealthy.  A large number of layers, corsets, ribbons and powders - all this greatly impeded the breathing of women.  It is good that in a good tone was to lose consciousness. </p><p>  How women dressed in the 19th century depended on their social status and financial situation.  At this time, fashion and style were changing at breakneck speed.  Already in the 1830s, the luxurious Empire style was replaced by romanticism.  Romanticism did not last long.  From the mid-nineteenth century, the style of the second Rococo came into fashion, which soon replaced positivism.  Unfortunately, only aristocratic young ladies and those women who were lucky to be born rich or successfully marry allowed themselves to follow all this. </p><h2>  Women's work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_France"><img itemprop="image" alt="economic inequality" class="if uuid-3262063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32842/3262063.jpg"></div><p>  Women who were forced to earn a living by honest labor had only two options: either hire a house from wealthy owners or work in a factory, usually in the clothing, weaving or knitting industries. </p><p>  However, no one ever entered into a work contract with them, therefore, 19th-century women had no rights at the workplace. </p><p>  They worked as much as the employer required, received as much as he was willing to pay.  If women suffered from asthma by processing flax, cotton and wool, no one provided them with medical care.  Sick, the woman risked losing her seat. </p><h2>  One-way divorce </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbcamerica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="victorian wedding" class="if uuid-3262071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32842/3262071.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, any man could divorce his wife on the basis of infidelity, which, however, was not applicable to the man.  The wife did not have the right to refuse to divorce her husband. </p><p>  Only in 1853, British law ensured the woman‚Äôs right to divorce, but for reasons other than infidelity.  These reasons were: excessive cruelty, incest and bigamy. </p><p>  In any case, even if the husband was guilty of a divorce, all the property and custody of the children remained with him, because the wife without her husband not only did not have the means of subsistence, but also did not have the legal status of ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù. </p><h2>  Inheritance Laws </h2><p>  Also in the UK until 1925, a woman could not inherit real estate by law (in the absence of a will), while there was a male successor, even if it was a distant relative. </p><p>  Even the inheritance of items such as jewelry, furniture, and clothing was limited.  In the case of a will, the possession of the property belonged to the woman, but the law established that she should have a male curator to monitor the use of real estate. </p><h2>  Abdication law </h2><p>  Two centuries ago, any husband, father or other close relative of a woman could declare renunciation of her.  For this, the presence of two witnesses was enough.  As a result, many women were sent to shelters, boarding schools and monasteries, and their property or property rights went to men. </p><h2>  Birth infections </h2><p>  Childbirth was one of the most difficult tests for women of the 19th century, especially before the benefits of sterilization were discovered. </p><p>  Midwives worked in the absence of hygiene, in addition, their work was sometimes performed by men who were not always doctors.  Often, a hairdresser could call for delivery. </p><p>  Even doctors did not know the primitive rules of hygiene.  They went to the woman in childbirth without washing her hands after the previous birth, which at times could cause fatal infections.  As a result, of the hundred women who gave birth, at least nine were infected, and three of them died of sepsis. </p>
