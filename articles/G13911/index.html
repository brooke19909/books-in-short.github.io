This is a rather old and fun entertainment that will suit both children and adults.  You are given cards that are marked with numbers (in a row).  They are closed by barrels, on which the corresponding numbers are indicated.  Barrels are most likely wooden or plastic.  One of the players takes these numbers from the bag (without looking).  The winner, of course, is the one who covered them with barrels before everyone else, but during the game there may be minor wins (the one who closed one or more horizontal rows is considered the winner). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian lotto reviews" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12475/66008.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  What is Russian <span>Lotto?</span>  <span>Lottery</span> - many will answer.  And indeed, this once family game turned into a means of earning.  Only earnings for whom?  For those who play, or those who provide such an opportunity?  Most likely for the second.  Nowadays, a lot of lotteries have spread, including the Russian Lotto, whose reviews differ.  Some say that it is very interesting and addictive, others believe that it is a waste of money and nerves, especially since now you can play this game on a computer, phone, tablet and so on.  For example, the reviews left about the Russian Lotto lottery show that many are interested in whether it is possible to calculate the winnings.  In addition, is there any kind of effective game scheme.  In essence, these are questions about how to win at the Russian Lotto. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian Lotto Lottery" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12475/66009.jpg" width="400"></div>  For the most part, it is believed that winning here is just luck.  But the organizers of the Russian Lotto television show, which was released in Russia, on the contrary, insist that every third ticket is a winning one.  Although, in fact, judging by the mathematical calculations, the probability of winning is only five percent.  But psychologists say that Russian Lotto, reviews of which are controversial on all sides, can make a profit.  You need to get enough sleep, have breakfast and in a good mood, with the thought that you will buy a winning ticket, go buy it.  Mystics unconditionally support psychologists.  They give recommendations on what to wear, what to eat and with what thoughts you need to go for a ticket.  Most likely, following absolutely all recommendations is not the most rational behavior.  For sometimes they simply contradict each other and common sense.

You can, of course, sometimes play and <span>buy tickets.</span>  But you do not need to get involved, especially very gambling people.  It is better to get a lotto home and play with the whole family.  You can even get together every weekend (in the country, for example).  The sea of ‚Äã‚Äãemotions is guaranteed!

    <p>  The game is fun and exciting, but in the end, everyone chooses for himself what he wants: excitement, money, adrenaline or a little healthy rivalry among friends and relatives.  To consider this game as a way of enrichment is clearly not worth it.  There are, of course, cases of winnings, as in any gambling game.  But no one knows if Fortune is supportive today.  So think and decide for yourself! </p>
