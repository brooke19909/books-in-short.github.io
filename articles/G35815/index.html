In today's article, we will tell you about one of these phones.  Despite the fact that it was released by a manufacturer from the Middle Kingdom, the quality of its assembly and materials is high enough to talk about this phone as a worthy competitor to some budget devices. </p>

    <p>  Meet the <span>telephone Telephone</span> P8000.  The review that we prepared will contain technical information about the device, its positive and negative qualities, as well as customer reviews.  After reading the article, you can form your own opinion regarding the device. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  As already noted, the quality of the phone we are describing is consistent with the global market.  This explains how the developers managed to ensure that the model was sold in different countries in such significant quantities. </p><p>  And Telephone P8000 itself (reviews confirm this) can be safely called budgetary (its cost is about $ 200), but a strong gadget due to the technical filling and the capabilities that it has.  At the same time, a stylish, peculiar design and pleasant to the touch materials do not give out a ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù at all in this ‚Äúaverage‚Äù (if not the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance of the model </h2><p>  The direct characterization of the model should begin with a presentation of its design - how the device looks and what the buyer notices in it first.  As they say, they are met by clothes ... </p>

    <p>  Outwardly, it seems that the developer did not spare the metal on his Telephone P8000.  The review shows that the back cover (having a plastic base) imitates the so-called embossed carbon fiber, and the model has metal elements along the perimeter of the case.  They look really expensive, and your hand is nice to touch cold metal;  the weight of the apparatus also plays an important role.  To some extent, the reviews of Telephone P8000 owner reviews determine the model is even too cumbersome - and it's hard to argue with that. </p><p>  In all other respects (as regards design), the manufacturers clearly did not fail.  The model has attractive touch buttons with backlighting on the front side, a chrome edging of the edges of the case, a black space around the display (which creates the appearance that the latter is an order of magnitude larger than it actually is). </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  By the way, about the display - Telephone P8000 (the review is confirmation of this) also has something to be proud of.  The model has a colorful IPS-screen resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, a diagonal of 5.5 inches.  This characteristic indicates a high density of the points that make up the screen - about 401 pixels per inch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In practice, this is all expressed in the form of a clear, colorful picture and excellent indicators of screen brightness.  Add some software settings and <span>a light sensor</span> - and get a display that can adapt to comfortable work in any environment. </p><p>  The display cover is made of durable glass, which can prevent scratches and chips during phone bumps.  According to reviews, to some extent this really saves the device from damage.  In addition, the display is also covered with an oleophobic layer, which should (ideally) prevent the appearance of fingerprints.  However, reviews indicate that this layer is not so effective. </p><p>  In all other respects, the display of the Telephone P8000 smartphone, which we are currently discussing, is commendable. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Now we turn to the characteristic of the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the phone - its processor.  According to the official technical information from the manufacturer, the model is based on <span>MediaTek MT6753.</span>  Of course, you cannot call it powerful or fast-acting.  As tests show, its 8 cores with a clock frequency of up to 1.3 GHz turned out to be in practice not as productive as it might initially have seemed.  Of course, the vast majority of games from the Market can be launched with its help without problems, but there is no need to talk about some bulky products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In addition, as noted by Telephone P8000 related characteristics of users who have experience working with the model, the phone may periodically freeze in everyday life, even when it is not ‚Äúloaded‚Äù.  Obviously, these are the disadvantages of the platform on which the developers decided to save. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  In addition to the not-so-strong ‚Äúheart‚Äù, 3 GB of RAM were installed on the model.  In general, this is enough to talk about the coordinated and accurate operation of the device from a software point of view. </p><p>  The developers did not disappoint in the matter of physical memory, having installed 16 GB on the device.  Of these, about 5 GB are occupied by system files.  Thus, 11 gigabytes are available to the user, which is enough for basic needs (no frills).  True, on the Telephone P8000 (the instructions confirm), you can install an additional microSD card, which can expand the space by another 32 GB.  Thus, it will not be difficult to transform the smartphone into a real portable multimedia center. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  On the phone, as practical tests show, the Android 5.1 OS is outdated, even at the time of writing.  It cannot be said that there can be any complaints to this platform, and the developers are simply trying to keep up with the trends and equip smartphones with the latest software. </p>

    <p>  The system is provided ‚Äúbare‚Äù and, in principle, no interface changes from the developer are observed here.  In addition, according to expert reviews, the model has support for OS updates.  This means that after connecting to Wi-Fi, the device will automatically update to the most current version of Android. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Considering the phone and its characteristics, the fact that manufacturers paid special attention to the performance of the device immediately becomes noticeable.  At least, a weighty battery with a capacity of up to 4165 mAh can testify to this.  Its dimensions are so large that by weight it probably occupies the lion's share of the total weight of the model.  Perhaps this also explains the bulkiness of the model as a whole. </p><p>  On the other hand, such a capacious battery allows us to assert that the phone is able to last longer on a single charge.  This, in turn, is the high autonomy that users value so highly. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  We were able to find many recommendations that would apply to the ‚Äúhero‚Äù of our review.  However, this was not particularly difficult. </p>

    <p>  Users who have managed to work with the phone have different opinions about what this device is.  Many, of course, praise its all sorts of advantages - a powerful battery, a productive ‚Äúheart‚Äù, a bright, colorful screen.  Along with such reviews, there are other characteristics that concern Telephone P8000.  A review cannot disclose all of them for the reason that to identify them, you must use it at least for several weeks. </p><p>  So, of the most significant drawbacks, it should be noted the inability of the device to stably ‚Äúkeep‚Äù communication.  This is a serious problem, since the device can switch to the ‚Äúout of access zone‚Äù mode for no apparent reason and, of course, leave the user without the ability to make and receive calls. </p><p>  Also, the smartphone‚Äôs disadvantages include too bright illumination of the ‚Äúhome‚Äù buttons located below the screen (it is impossible to change the intensity of their glow by default), or, for example, periodic (unreasonable) device freezes.  Perhaps the cause of these ‚Äúbugs‚Äù is the software part of Telephone P8000.  Firmware, however, allows you to get rid of only part of them.  But some problems are not related to this and relate, for example, to the hardware.  For example, users note the deterioration of the display over time, the appearance of ‚Äúripples‚Äù. </p><p>  All this and a number of other minor (and not so) flaws, of course, worsen the opinion of the smartphone owner about the product.  And, judging by the reviews, this is very annoying to anyone who has encountered such a situation. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Of course, conclusions must be drawn independently, based on the information that we provided.  I would like to note that the phone described in the article, in the case of refinement and elimination of the problems described above, could make a worthy competition to the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù and HTC.  Perhaps someday we will see the success of Telephone and the like, but so far we have to be content with what we have. </p><p>  The P8000 is functional, but it can fail at any time.  Therefore, it can be advised to use it as an auxiliary means of communication, but not as the main working device. </p>
