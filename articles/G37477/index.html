    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  If you look at the device at arm's length, it looks quite interesting.  In the design of the device there is a company logo of the company, printed with bright symbols.  In addition to the display, on the front surface there is a speaker slot for talking at the top and a microphone at the bottom.  Like other modifications released by this manufacturer, here the left end does not carry any functional purpose.  It only has a microUSB slot, designed to connect the Sony Xperia E Dual to a charger or to a computer.  On the opposite side you can see the <span>volume control, a</span> direct camera activation key, as well as an on / off button made of metal.  Although they are slightly tight, they are characterized by a fairly clear course.  The headphone output is placed on the upper edge. </p><p>  The back of the model is made of plastic and stands out with an embossed pattern applied to it.  Due to the dullness of its surface, fingerprints and other small dirt are almost invisible on the Sony Xperia E Dual case.  Reviews of many device owners at the same time indicate that the quality of the plastic used is poor.  There are three functional holes on the back cover: for the speaker, one of the microphones and the camera‚Äôs eye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia E Dual Specifications" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/557338.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The phone‚Äôs display of 3.5 inches and a resolution of 320 x 480 pixels surrounding could surprise only at the beginning of this century.  Now, such a screen with a TFT matrix often becomes the main reason for rejecting the choice in favor of this model for many potential buyers.  Why the manufacturing company stubbornly does not want to switch to IPS technology, which is characterized by much better quality and higher efficiency, is still a mystery.  Even the use of Sony Xperia E Dual software image enhancement, known as the Bravia Engine, does not compensate for half of the disadvantages associated with the display.  The vertical angles of the screen can be called quite acceptable.  However, when the device is exposed to sunlight, the picture becomes almost unreadable.  The distance from the matrix to the protective glass is almost one millimeter, which significantly aggravates the situation.  At the same time, one should not forget about the huge incomprehensible framework surrounding the screen. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Smartphone <span>Sony Xperia</span> E Dual, whose characteristics are not particularly different from other modifications from its price segment, is equipped with a Qualcomm processor, consisting of a single core.  It works at a clock frequency of 1 GHz.  The device uses an internal drive, the volume of which is 4 gigabytes.  It should be noted the nuance that only a little more than half of this space is available to the user.  The performance of the device does not even reach the average level.  As for RAM, this indicator is not impressive either - just 512 megabytes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia E Dual reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/557339.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, due to a single module, one of the cards is blocked during a telephone conversation on the other.  This kind of solution has only one advantage, which is reduced energy consumption. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The Sony Xperia E Dual is equipped with a 3 megapixel camera without flash and auto focus.  The images obtained with her help are not of high quality.  The colors of the picture are a little distorted, while it turns out to be somewhat blurry.  The number of settings and shooting modes is limited.  It should be noted that the smartphone does not have an additional front camera, with which it would be possible to make video calls. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Under the condition of an average load (not the most active use of the Internet and infrequent calls), a full charge of the battery will quietly last for a whole day.  In the event that the device is used exclusively for telephone calls, the charge can last for several days.  All this can be explained by far from the highest device performance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia E Dual review" class="if" height="494" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/557337.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In general, the Sony Xperia E Dual modification is a standard budget smartphone.  For the money that they ask for it, you can purchase some devices from competing companies with more impressive technical characteristics.  The fact is that in its price segment there are models that have more capacious batteries, high-quality cameras and displays created using IPS technology.  The only worthy excuse for buying this model is perhaps the support for working with two SIM cards.  As for the most significant drawbacks of this device, it is its overpriced, unsuccessful design of the back cover of the case, as well as a frankly outdated moral camera. </p>
