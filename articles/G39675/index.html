In winter, more than ever, I want to be in a paradise, enjoy the sound of the surf, the warm and gentle sea, get a beautiful even tan.  There is no better place than Thailand.  The season lasts from November to April - at this time the tours are most popular.  Do not mistakenly believe that at other times of the year the resort is inaccessible to vacationers, everything is extremely simple: from April to October the rainy season continues here.  But these are not the rains that many of you imagine - they are short-lived, but significantly reduce the cost of tours.  The most famous Thai resort is considered to be Pattaya.  This is a large city, offering tourists a lot of entertainment and at the same time the opportunity to spend time alone with nature, enjoy the picturesque views and local beauties.  Of course, in many respects the comfort on vacation depends on the right hotel.  Many tourists are inattentive to this item, believing that there is no point in wasting time choosing a hotel where they will spend only one night.  In the case of Asian options, one should be extremely careful and attentive, because most of them do not fit their description.  We suggest paying attention to the option quite popular among Russian tourists - Jomtien Plaza Residence.  Based on the reviews of real tourists and vacationers, we will try to give him an objective assessment. </p>

    <h2>  Features of Asian hotels </h2><p>  We want to warn all tourists who want to go to Pattaya: most of the hotels here simply do not fit their description.  When choosing the appropriate option, you should build on the experience of real tourists, your relatives and friends.  If you are used to relaxing in the luxury hotels of Turkey and Egypt, in Thailand you have nothing to do: here you will not find such a service and infrastructure.  The staff is extremely polite and attentive, but the hotels do not have an adjacent territory, even the pools here are on the roof of the buildings.  However, some regard this as a plus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All the beaches here are public, that is, municipal.  This is because you simply cannot find a hotel on the coast.  At best, you have to cross a busy highway: the coastline is separated from the city by a wide road. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Jomtien Plaza Residence 3 * is located in the heart of the city - a popular tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJomtien.  It is literally buried in a variety of shops, bars, restaurants and other entertainment venues.  The hotel has only 150 rooms, but they are all quite spacious and comfortable.  Each tourist will be able to choose for themselves the premises of the necessary category. </p>

    <p>  When checking into the room, the hotel takes a deposit of $ 100 from tourists.  At the reception quite often there are hitches with check-in, especially when several clients arrive at the same time.  Not always have the strength to wait after hours of tiring flight and transfer to the hotel.  But the kind staff takes all the necessary steps in order to speed up the process. </p><p>  Of course, it‚Äôs foolish to assume that the staff speaks Russian at Jomtien Plaza Residence.  But many speak excellent English, quite often the explanation with tourists who do not speak this language occurs with the help of gestures, which is not a special problem for vacationers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Regardless of the chosen category, the room will not only have a bedroom, but also a living room, a kitchenette, a full dining room, and a balcony with amazing views of the coast.  Just imagine: you can enjoy the sunrise and sunset with a glass of aromatic drink.  A wide coastline, palm trees, pristine tropical nature - and all this Pattaya.  Jomtien Plaza Residence is indeed located in one of the most beautiful areas of the city, so almost every tourist dreams of relaxing here.  On the balcony there is a table and two comfortable chairs, which makes spending evenings here even more pleasant and comfortable. </p>
