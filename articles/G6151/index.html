The photos of the city are so different among themselves that it is difficult to imagine the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis metropolis - the third largest in the Middle Kingdom after Beijing (the capital) and Shanghai.  The ultra-modern skyscrapers and busy traffic on the streets of Guangzhou give it a universally recognized world trade center.  But no, no, and the centuries-old antiquity will appear through this gloss of modernity and hi-tech.  After all, the city is over two and a half thousand years old!  In this article, we will tell you everything that is possible in a brief outline about the glorious history of Guangzhou.  This port city is famous even for the fact that the long but famous Silk Road to Europe began with it.  Today, only the memory of the legendary trading past is stored in its "stone jungle" by Guangzhou.  We will talk about the main attractions of the city.  How to see the color and interesting places of Guangzhou, spending as little money and time on transportation as possible? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guangzhou city" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2031037.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Total information </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that this is the third largest metropolis in China.  Guangzhou, formerly known as Canton, is the administrative center of Guangdong in the south of the country.  This metropolis lies on the seashore, in the Pearl River Delta (Pearl River).  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Guangzhou is seven and a half thousand square kilometers.  But this is not the limit.  After all, Guangzhou forms one of the largest conurbations in the world, which is called the "Economic Zone of the Pearl River Delta."  Together with the small settlements that were absorbed by the city, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe metropolis was 9123 square kilometers.  Guangzhou is densely populated.  In the center alone, seven and a half million people live.  And along with the outskirts, the population of Guangzhou is 14 755 000 people.  As for the Economic Zone of the Pearl River Delta, forty-seven million live in it.  The population density in the city is serious - one and a half thousand people per square kilometer.  The following statistics show the rapid growth of Guangzhou.  In 1977, the population of the city was ‚Äúonly‚Äù five million.  In 2003, it more than doubled (10.5 million). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Guangzhou: the history of the city </h2><p>  This Chinese metropolis actually has several names.  It is often called Yang Chen (City of Five Goats).  These animals even decorate the coat of arms of Guangzhou and, of course, they are depicted on souvenirs.  Another metropolis is called Sui Chen (City of five rice spikelets).  There is a beautiful (but far from historical truth) legend about animals and cereals in Guangzhou.  Once there was a small village.  And its inhabitants were starving.  The sky took pity on the poor peasants and five boddisattvas descended from the clouds on five goats.  The animals had rice ears in their mouths.  All the inhabitants ate these grains, and even planted their fields with them.  After that, the era of prosperity began for the Chinese city of Guangzhou. </p><p>  But in reality, everything was a bit wrong.  The city was founded in 862 BC as a port on the coast of the South China Sea.  Its prosperity was based on trade with India and the Arab world.  The Silk Road began with Guangzhou.  This city was the first in China to maintain trade relations with Europe (from the 16th century).  The backbone of the Guangzhou economy has not changed now.  Twice a year, it hosts a world trade exhibition. </p>

    <h2>  Guangzhou areas: where tourists can stay </h2><p>  The huge metropolis is administratively divided into ten districts and two counties.  But for the average traveler, not all of them are of interest.  To tourism in the city of Guangzhou took as little as possible the cost of transport, it is best to find a hotel in the areas of Yuexiu, Lebanon and Haizhu.  For those who are interested in shopping, the Tianhe district is suitable.  But, besides markets and shopping malls, it also houses the Futuristic Opera House and the Guangdong Museum.  Yueshu is the most prestigious area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGuangzhou.  There are many parks, there is an orchid garden.  All the famous temples of Guangzhou are also located in Yuexiu.  But the hotels in this area are solid ‚Äúfours‚Äù and ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  For a frugal tourist, Lebanon is more suitable.  In addition to budget housing, this area attracts by its proximity to the Cheng Clan Academy and Lake Garden.  In Haizhu, there is such a landmark of the city as the TV Tower.  You can climb to its observation platform to enjoy aerial view of Guangzhou. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  When to go to South China: the most suitable seasons </h2><p>  The geographical parallel on which the city of Guangzhou lies is twenty-three degrees north latitude.  It is <span>south of the tropic of</span> Cancer.  But the climate in the city is cooler than might be expected from the geographical position.  It can be described as subtropical.  In January 2016, there was even recorded snowfall.  True, this event occurs once in 80-90 years.  Winters here are mild, with a temperature of + 14-15 degrees, and relatively dry.  It is often rainy and hot in summer.  July temperatures range from +25 to +32 degrees.  The climate of Guangzhou is formed by the monsoon, the season of which covers a long period from April to October. </p><p>  As for the weather, it is best to go here in late autumn.  At the end of October and November it is dry and moderately warm.  However, the budget tourist should take into account the periods when the World Trade Exhibitions are held in Guangzhou (April and October), as well as the celebrations of the European and Chinese New Years.  In mid-January, a season of unprecedented discounts begins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tianjin city guangzhou province china" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2031042.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beijing street </h2><p>  The time has come to describe the main attractions of the city of Guangzhou.  To list them all makes no sense, since in the ancient capital of South China there are about five hundred of them.  So, if you want to make the first (and far from erroneous) opinion about the city, go to Beijing's pedestrian street Beijing.  This is one of the main commercial highways of Guangzhou - both ancient and modern - located in Yuexiu district, in the old center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The nearest subway station is Haizhu Guangchang.  Glancing at the neon signs of fashion stores, don‚Äôt miss the testimony of the ‚Äúancient times.‚Äù  They are inconspicuous.  These are fragments of the medieval bridge <span>dynasties of the Yuan</span> and Song.  In addition to pleasant shopping, here you can and thoroughly eat.  Beijing Street is an addition to another city highway with the eloquent name of Party Pie (Party Pier).  All kinds of entertainment are also concentrated here. </p><h2>  Pearl river </h2><p>  A city in China, Guangzhou, stands in the delta of the country's third longest waterway.  The length of the river reaches more than two thousand kilometers.  Pearl (Zhujiang - northern pronunciation, Jugong - local) is called because it has a rock island, polished with waters to a ‚Äúmirror shine‚Äù.  By the way, this attraction rises in the riverbed not so far from Guangzhou.  Due to its length, Jugong played a huge role in the life of South China.  And now its shores are decorated with top hotels, offices of international corporations and the like beautiful buildings.  A young tourist in Guangzhou has two types of evening entertainment to choose from: go to Party Pier, where the establishments work weekends all night, or buy a river cruise on the night Pearl River.  In the dark, the beaches and bridges are beautifully illuminated, and the buildings seem to be just works of art made of shining crystal.  Among cruises, reviews are advised to choose the one that is carried out on a wooden, antique-styled ship.  Then you can not only admire the bridges and promenades of Guangzhou, but also enjoy the <span>tea ceremony</span> to the accompaniment of the harp. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guangzhou city tourism" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2031054.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hua Cheng Square </h2><p>  The name of this place translates as "City of Flowers."  In fact, this is not a square, but a whole pedestrian boulevard.  It is located, like many other attractions of the city of Guangzhou, on the banks of the Pearl River.  Everything here is buried in flowers.  In the middle is a small lotus pond.  It‚Äôs better to come to Hua Cheng Square in the evening - you are guaranteed excellent photos.  On the other side of the Pearl River you can see the <span>Guangzhou TV tower.</span>  We will talk about this attraction below.  And on both sides of the square are the two largest skyscrapers of the city - the IFC tower. </p><p>  Other attractions are nearby: futuristic-style opera house, a library and a museum in Guangdong.  Under the square is an ultramodern underground shopping center.  The entire complex was built in the new center of Guangzhou relatively recently - to the opening of the 2010 Asian Olympic Games.  Getting to the City of Flowers Square is easy.  Directly below it is Zhu Jiang Xin Cheng Subway Station. </p>

    <h2>  Canton tower </h2><p>  Located on the other side of the tower is the second highest in the world - six hundred meters from the base to the spire.  But this is not what it attracts tourists.  The tower is a landmark of Guangzhou city due to the unique Ferris wheel.  It is not vertical, as is customary, but almost horizontal, only with a slight tilt.  The booths revolve around the tower at a great height.  No money for such an attraction?  Then you can simply take the elevator to the 107th or 108th floor to stand on the glass balcony with transparent floor and enjoy the city.  And for the most daring TV tower, Guangzhou can offer the most extreme attraction.  From its very spire, with a free fall speed, a platform with seats rushes down.  It does not reach the very base of the tower, it slows down, but the impressions of the flight will be remembered for a long time. </p><h2>  Parks </h2><p>  The city in China, Guangzhou, is one of the most landscaped in the country.  And even if you are indifferent to the beauties of nature, you just need to visit one of the parks, because there, besides the usual malls and flower beds, there are interesting sights.  The largest is Yueshu.  This park is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã200 hectares among seven hills and three lakes.  Here you can see the sculptural group "Five Goats", which are a symbol of Guangzhou.  In the park, the old Zhenhai-lou lookout tower also rises, inside which is a museum in memory of Sun Yat-sen.  Nearby stands a monument to the revolutionary and the first president of the Republic of China, who was born in Guangzhou. </p><p>  You can also see fragments of the city wall dating back to the Ming Dynasty on the territory of Yuexiu Park.  About a more recent history - the Opium Wars and the occupation of Guangzhou by the troops of France and Great Britain (19th century), twelve cannons that have survived from that era will tell. </p><p>  The second park in the city, which will be worth visiting, is called Pearl River.  It was defeated relatively recently and surprises visitors with the imagination of Chinese landscape designers.  Pearl River is located near the "City of Flowers". </p>

    <h2>  Temples </h2><p>  The Chinese city of Guangzhou is multinational.  This is evidenced by his temples.  Here is the Christian Cathedral of the Sacred Heart (Catholic), Huaishen Mosque.  But most of all there are temples in the city that honor Confucian values: filial piety, Five Spirits, etc. For tourists, the ‚ÄúMast visit‚Äù is the Buddhist monastery complex ‚ÄúSix Banyan Trees‚Äù (Liu Rong Temple).  It was built in 537 - about 1.5 thousand years ago.  The monastery complex consists of the Flower Pagoda and the Hall of Great Heroes.  In the last room you can see three statues of Buddha - the oldest and largest in Guangdong.  Of interest to the tourist are six old banyan trees, in whose honor the temple complex is named.  The smell of incense, muffled meditative music immerses you in the world of Buddhist spirituality.  And many shops with antiques and religious utensils, which are at least a dime a dozen around the monastery, lead you to reality.  You can find very interesting gizmos in them at very low prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guangzhou city history" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2031063.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Guangzhou Suburbs </h2><p>  In this city, antiquity and hi-tech merged together.  It carries out the most daring economic reforms to develop a free market.  At the same time, it is very environmentally friendly and comfortable for living.  In this, Guangzhou is similar to the city of Tianjin located in the north of the country.  Guangzhou (China) is teeming with natural attractions.  A tourist should visit the Lotus Mountains.  They are located in the Pearl River Delta, in fact, on the outskirts of Guangzhou.  In fact, these are old quarries.  In the Middle Ages, red limestone was mined here, and quarries under the streams of rains took the smoothed shape of lotus petals, for which they received this name.  This is not only a natural attraction, but also a cultural one.  In a former quarry, a beautiful park with peach gardens was built and Lotus Pagoda was built. </p><p>  Next to it stands a gilded statue of the bodhisattva Guanyin.  The height of the sculpture is 40 meters.  Numerous pilgrims come to her and it is interesting to observe their rites.  If you have more time and opportunities, you can visit the ancient capital of Yue Shavan in Guangdong.  It is located on the outskirts of the modern city of Panyu and is a huge open-air museum. </p>
