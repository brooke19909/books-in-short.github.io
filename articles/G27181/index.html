In winter, this is one of the most popular destinations due to the mild and pleasant ambient temperature.  In December, in Tenerife there is no scorching sun and crowds of tourists.  This Mediterranean resort will welcome excellent quality of service and paradise landscapes. </p><h2>  Some features of the climate of the island </h2><p>  The Canary Islands, although they belong to Spain, are closer to Africa than to Europe.  This largely determines their climate.  Winter, such as we used to see it, is not here.  The lower limit of temperatures fluctuates around 16 degrees above zero, and this already seems to be a resident of terrible frosty weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tenerife in December" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2124820.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The climate in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is very changeable.  If it began to rain, then in a couple of minutes the sun will appear.  And if the morning pleases with a beautiful bright sunrise, then clouds may appear already in the afternoon, rain will fall during the day, and the evening will give a bright, saturated sea sunset. </p><h2>  What to do in December </h2><p>  First of all, this is an extensive excursion program.  You can get to know the indigenous people of the island, their culture and traditions. </p><p>  In early December, Tenerife hosts a feast of oranges.  A day in honor of sweet fruits is even declared a day off.  The central squares of cities are turning into orange rivers.  Everywhere they offer to taste citrus varieties and buy a couple.  At the end of the day, the results are held and the best gardeners are selected who receive valuable prizes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In December, the most important holiday of all Catholics is held - this is Christmas.  Already a week before December 25, the streets of the city are filled with a pleasant atmosphere of New Year's bustle.  Only the usual snow and Christmas trees are not here.  And there are palm trees, fruits and artisans fairs. </p><h2>  What to fear in December </h2><p>  In December, in Tenerife you should not get involved in water sports.  You can go diving near the shore or drift on a yacht, not leaving far from the resort.  But going out into the open sea is not recommended.  The ocean at this time of the year is very troubled.  His mood can change very quickly, and it is almost impossible to predict. </p><p>  If you plan to relax with children, then it is worth remembering that swimming in the pool is also a very pleasant experience, sometimes even better than in the sea.  In winter, the waves are high, the water is turbulent.  And the pools always have a warm comfortable environment with minimal health risks.  Tourists note that in some hotels the pools are so warm that the water seems hot.  As, for example, in GrandKanaree, where the mark was + 28 ° . </p><h2>  Beaches and resorts in Tenerife in December </h2><p>  Our compatriots prefer to stop in the winter on the south side of the island.  In addition to more comfortable weather conditions, the infrastructure is most developed here.  It’s closer to all interesting sights than from the north.  Well established weather in Tenerife in December.  Reviews of tourists indicate that it is very comfortable to relax here, and a tan can be obtained in cloudy weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temperature in tenerife in december" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2124735.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Another beach near Las Americas is Las Vistas.  Its length is more than two kilometers, so there is plenty of space.  In December, the influx of tourists is small, and the prices of sun loungers range from 140 to 210 rubles, which is a very low price for the Caribbean resorts. </p><p>  Admire the <span>black sand</span> at Playa Jardin Beach.  Its highlight is an unusual waterfall on one side.  Clean, well maintained and very warm.  Playa Jardine fall in love at first sight. </p><p>  The most beautiful black beach is considered to be San Marcos.  It is located near Puerto de la Cruz. </p><h2>  We ride in Tenerife in the winter with children </h2><p>  December should not scare parents.  Reviews about this period at the resort are only the most positive.  Children are very sensitive to climate change, and cool weather has a beneficial effect on health.  This region is indicated for frequent colds, as saturated with clean southern air helps strengthen immunity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tenerife december weather reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2124732.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A small influx of tourists will protect against various spa diseases, including intestinal infections.  It excludes the possibility of being bitten by insects, because at this time of the year they prefer to hide in their minks.  And on the other hand, Tenerife is a paradise for children.  Animators, entertainment, a high level of service - all this helps to enjoy your vacation for real. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Rest in Tenerife in the winter is spring bliss.
