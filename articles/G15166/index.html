    <h2>  Features of rest in Marmaris </h2><p>  Marmaris is one of the best and most "European" resort of the Turkish coast.  Until recently, the main part of vacationers here were residents of Northern Europe.  And they, as you know, know a lot about high-quality leisure.  What attracts tourists to Marmaris?  The main advantage of the resort is mild climate.  It is ideal for a beach holiday.  In addition, this town lies in a fenced island and a peninsular bay, as a result of which there are almost never high waves and strong winds.  All this creates ideal conditions for the rest of the kids.  But!  Unfortunately, Turunc Dream Boutique Hotel Sc does not offer lodging with children.  But noisy young people and people who prefer active pastimes will be happy!  Marmaris attracts dance lovers: in the many discos of the city, real dance festivals are organized in the evenings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turunc dream boutique hotel 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/597462.jpg" width="600"></div>

The nearest is 120 kilometers away - in Dalaman.  From Moscow there are regular flights of <span>Turkish Airlines.</span>  The cost of the flight is 20,316 rubles (round trip).  From the airport, Marmaris can be reached on the labeled Hava≈ü bus (for 3 euros).  In addition, the resort can be reached from Bodrum (travel time - 3 and a half hours), Istanbul (13 hours), Izmir (4 and a quarter hours) and Antalya (6 hours).

    <h2>  Holidays in Turunc </h2><p>  In principle, this small resort village is unremarkable.  However, the places here are simply amazing, natural landscapes amaze with their picturesqueness.  Dense coniferous forests cover the mountains, which gradually descend to the shores of the Aegean Sea, framed by golden sand.  It is always quiet and calm.  There is not so much entertainment, except for dance floors, where grandiose discos are organized in the evenings.  On the beaches you can meet families with children.  However, on the private beach of the Turunc Dream Boutique Hotel, you are unlikely to see kids, because, according to the concept of this hotel, there is no place for little vacationers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location of the Turunch Dream Boutique Hotel </h2><p>  It is located in the very center of the village.  From it to the beach - a stone's throw (50 m).  Until recently, Turunch was a fishing village.  However, due to its excellent location, construction companies chose it, subsequently deciding to build hotel complexes and individual hotels here.  Turunc Dream Boutique Hotel (Marmaris / Turunch) covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1200 square meters on the shores of its own bay.  From a distance it seems that it is on an island. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  Turunc Dream <span>Boutique Hotel 4 *</span> opened its doors to guests in 2013.  The boutique hotel consists of a small three-story building with 42 comfortable rooms.  In front of the main building there is a rather spacious swimming pool with a solarium (a sunbathing platform), as well as an open terrace of the restaurant.  As already noted, this hotel does not accept families with children under 15 years old.  And this is one of the main features of the Turunc Dream Boutique Hotel.  Probably, the administration made such a decision, because the hotel‚Äôs not fully developed infrastructure (due to the small size of the territory) is not able to provide the kids with a full-fledged rich rest.  Most of the guests are newlyweds.  There are special apartments for them, as well as presentations in the form of a fruit basket, a cake or a bottle of champagne at the entrance, or a special decoration for the bed and the whole room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turunc dream boutique hotel reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/597463.jpg" width="600"></div>
