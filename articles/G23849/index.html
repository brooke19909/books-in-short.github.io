    <h2>  Movses Khorenatsi: a biography in his youth </h2><p>  There is no reliable information about the life of the chronicler.  The only source of information about the life of Khorenatsi is his work ‚ÄúHistory of Armenia‚Äù, in which he sometimes makes digressions and gives some facts about the events that happened to him personally. </p><p>  It is traditionally believed that the historian was born in the village of Khoren, Syunik region in the 5th century.  It is with its name that the nickname of the chronicler is associated.  It translates as ‚ÄúMovses from Khoren‚Äù.  According to the story of the author himself, he received primary education in his native village, where a school was founded, founded by the creator of the Armenian script Mesrop Mashtots.  Later he was sent to study in Vagharshapat, where Movses Khorenatsi studied Greek, Pahlavi (Middle Persian) and Syriac.  Then, among the best students, he was sent to continue his education in the city of Edessa, which at that time was one of the most important cultural centers of the whole region.  The success of the young schoolboy was so obvious that he received recommendations and went to study in Alexandria - one of the greatest cities of the Roman Empire of the late period, where he became acquainted in detail with the Neoplatonic philosophy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  After returning home </h2><p>  It is believed that, having returned to Armenia, Movses Khorenatsi, together with Mashtots and his other students, translated the Bible into Armenian, becoming one of the first ‚ÄúTargmanich‚Äù.  Later, all these clergymen were canonized. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  In 428, Armenia was captured and divided between the Byzantine Empire and Persia.  Before his death, Movses Khorenatsi wrote: ‚ÄúI am crying and grieving for you, the country of Armenia ... You have no more king, no priest, no symbol and even teacher!  Chaos reigned and Orthodoxy shook.  Our ignorance sowed pseudo-wisdom.  Priests are arrogant self-lovers with penance on their lips, lazy people, ambitious people who hate art and love holidays and libations ... ‚Äù </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúHistory of Armenia‚Äù </h2><p>  This main work of the whole life of Movses Khorenatsi covers the period from the moment of formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD.  Its main value is that this book is the first complete exposition of the country's history.  At the same time, it contains an account of mythology, works of folklore, pagan religion, semi-destroyed at the time of writing the manuscript, the internal life of the state and its political and economic ties with the world.  It also contains various data on the culture and history of neighboring countries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The chronicle consists of three parts: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúThe Genealogy of Great Armenia‚Äù, which includes the chronicle of the country from its mythological origin to the founding of the Arshakids dynasty in 149 BC. </li><li>  "A statement of the average history of our ancestors" (before the death of St. Gregory the Illuminator). </li><li>  Conclusion (until 428 A.D., when the fall of the Arshakids dynasty occurred, to which the Armenian historian himself witnessed). </li></ul><h2>  Pseudo-Khorenatsi </h2><p>  There is also a fourth part, which, according to most researchers, was written by an unknown author who brought the account of history to the time of the reign of Emperor Zeno, which fell on the period 474-491.  The first 3 parts also contain anachronisms, which contradict the information provided by Lazar Parpetsi and Koryun.  At the same time, the latter confirms in his writings the existence of a bishop named Movses. </p><p>  It still remains unknown why the author and the anonymous editor of the 4th part of ‚ÄúHistory of Armenia‚Äù used the name of Movses Khorenatsi.  There is a version that he intended to glorify the Bagratid dynasty, which since the end of the 7th century has been dominant in the country.  In 885, Ashot the First reigned on the throne.  Most likely, the task of Pseudo-Khorenatsi was to create the ground for the exaltation of this dynasty. </p>

    <h2>  Creation </h2><p>  The book ‚ÄúHistory of Armenia‚Äù by Movses Khorenatsi is not the only literary work written by the chronicler.  He is also known as a writer of church hymns, a poet and grammarians.  Among his works can be noted: </p><ul><li>  "Rhetoric." </li><li>  ‚ÄúGeography‚Äù (some researchers are inclined to consider Anania Shirakatsi as the author of this work). </li><li>  "Speech about the Holy Martyr Virgin Ripsime." </li><li>  "The Doctrine of the Transfiguration of Christ." </li><li>  ‚ÄúComments on Armenian Grammar‚Äù, etc. </li></ul><p>  As was accepted by the first <span>Armenian monk writers,</span> in his works, regardless of their content, there are digressions in which he tells everyday details or describes events that happened to people around him at the time of work.  Literary scholars have noted Khorenatsi‚Äôs unconditional writing and poetic talent, which is especially pronounced in his hymns and sermons. </p>

    <h2>  Scientific disputes </h2><p>  The fact that Movses Khorenatsi was a real person is not in dispute at the moment.  However, many Western historians do not agree that Khorenatsi lived in the 400s and insist that he carried out his activities much later, between 7-9 centuries.  The reason is the mention in the History of Armenia of a number of toponyms related to a later period.  However, Armenian scholars of the life of the chronicler, they argue, were inserted later by the census tellers, who replaced the outdated names of settlements, rivers and regions with modern ones. </p><p>  The circumstance that Khorenatsi is a student of Mesrop Mashtots is also called into question, since he may have called himself so in a figurative sense.  The fact that the Armenians to this day call the creator of their writing the Great Teacher also speaks in favor of the latest version. </p><p>  Some anachronisms in the text of the ‚ÄúHistory of Armenia‚Äù cast a shadow over the statement, according to which Khorenatsi‚Äôs customer was King Sahak Bagratuni.  Perhaps his name was also inscribed for political reasons. </p>

    <p>  The Armenian historian Khorenatsi played a huge role in the development of the culture of his people.  Thanks to his monumental work spanning a period of several millennia, many myths and legends have come down to us, as well as a holistic picture of the events and calamities that people experienced during his life. </p><p>  To this day, Armenians have great respect for Khorenatsi, and every student knows about his contribution to the culture of his country. </p>
