Polar Dawns is a small town located on <span>the Niva River.</span>  Also on its territory there is a beautiful Pinozero.  The total territorial area was 3.6 square meters.  km  And the population does not exceed 15,000 people.  An interesting fact is that polar nights almost never occur here.  And the shortest day is only once a year, in December. </p><h2>  City development </h2><p>  After the large-scale project - NPP - was completed, the city itself began to come to life.  The founder is considered to be the chief architect of the station A. Andrushechko. When the nuclear power plant started operating, the whole Murmansk region began to develop rapidly.  Polar Dawns in 1974 was awarded the status of a working village.  And already in 1991, it was officially named the city.  His first mayor was A. A. Chistova. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Polar Dawns can rightfully be called the energy capital of the Murmansk region and the entire Kola region.
