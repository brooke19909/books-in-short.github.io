For babies up to two years old, on request it is possible to provide a cot (for an extra charge).  From the age of twelve, a child must be paid as an adult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  The history of tourism in Phuket began recently (about 50 years ago).  Tourists from all over the world quickly fell in love with the tropical island, so the necessary infrastructure began to actively develop here.  The capital of the island is the city of Phuket, which is connected to the mainland by several bridges. </p><p>  Diving is incredibly popular on the island.  Numerous schools and dive centers, equipment rental points, and specialized shops are scattered along the coast.  In the waters of Phuket there are many different places that are suitable for divers of various levels (from pros to beginners). </p><p>  In each province of Thailand, they prepare their delicious desserts and sweets, the names of which are simply impossible to remember.  To taste them, it is best to visit the Sunday Fair in the heart of Phuket Town. </p><h2>  Phuket Attractions </h2><p>  Phuket is a fairly large island where you can find many attractions and beautiful places.  There are also beautiful waterfalls, bays, mountains, the jungle, next to which there are cultural and historical monuments.  Any guest here will find for themselves what he will like. </p><p>  To get to the most interesting places, you need to rent a car, taxi or buy a tour, since public transport is poorly organized. </p><p>  In the center of the island's capital is the Thai Hua Museum, which is dedicated to the history of Phuket.  Equally interesting is the national museum founded by Princess Maha Charkri Sirindhom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique Bungalows 3" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1538300.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The symbol of the island is a large Buddha statue located on Mount Moutain Naka Kerd (mountain height - 370 meters) in the south of the island.  The attraction is not yet completed, but is open to visitors.  It's always crowded here.  The statue reaches a height of 45 meters, it is perfectly visible from anywhere in the island.  Not a single excursion in Phuket is complete without a visit to the Buddha. </p><p>  Tourists will be interested to see the main temple complex of Buddhists on an island called Chalong.  It contains a real shrine - the bone of the Buddha.  Anyone can see it, because it is displayed for viewing in a glass sarcophagus.  Chalong Temple is Phuket's most colorful landmark. </p><p>  A favorite place for tourists is an observation deck called Karon, located next to the famous Kata Noi beach.  E visitors enjoy a unique view of the Kata, Karon and Kata Noi.  Tourists come here to watch the sunset and see the Buddha statue.  The site is well equipped, there are several restaurants near it. </p><p>  In the north of the island you can see National Park Khao Phra Thaeo.  It is here that you can see the pristine jungle untouched by man.  The park is inhabited by a variety of animals and more than a hundred species of birds.  On its lands is the largest waterfall on the whole island - Bang Pae Waterfall. </p><p>  The Similan Islands is a group of islets off the west coast of the country in the Adaman Sea.  They are considered a national park, and not all of them are open to visitors.  The islands are called a paradise because they have the most beautiful beaches and landscapes in all of Thailand.  There are no hotels on them and, going to them with an overnight stay, you can only live in a tent city. </p><p>  For young tourists, you can offer a visit to the Phuket Zoo.  The establishment is private, and therefore tickets to it are quite expensive.  The zoo is home to a huge number of amphibians and other animals, there are about 5000 alone crocodiles here. On the territory you can also see an aquarium and a real park of orchids.  In the zoo you can not only look at birds and animals, but also visit the show with the participation of wild animals (they include elephants, crocodiles, monkeys).  Programs involving crocodiles are an amazing sight, during which trainers fearlessly stick their heads into the mouth of an amphibian. </p><h2>  Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique Bungalows 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to pay close attention to the reviews of tourists who visited it.  According to vacationers, the Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique Bungalows 3 * hotel is a budget complex in Phuket.  The cost of tours to this hotel is much less than to other hotels.  Therefore, it is chosen by those tourists who do not want to overpay for the best conditions.  When planning a vacation in this place, you need to understand that in an economy class hotel you are unlikely to be provided with the service and rooms that are available in five-star complexes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="karon cliff contemporary boutique bungalows 3 phuket" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1538310.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique 3 * (Phuket) is suitable for unpretentious and uninhabited vacationers who appreciate above all the beautiful nature and great sea.  The hotel is located in a quiet place, away from the hustle and bustle.  This is the advantage and the disadvantage of the complex.  It can be a good place for a relaxing holiday, but it will not suit those people who want to be in the center of spa life. </p><p>  Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique Bungalows 3 * (Phuket) is built on a mountainside and has many transitions and steps.  The place is stunningly beautiful, since the hill offers amazing views of the sea coast.  The hotel does not have its own beach, as well as other complexes of the island.  Tourists can visit the municipal coast.  Near the hotel is the beautiful Karon Beach.  Tourists can choose a more suitable area for recreation on the coast.  In this area, the coastline is not overloaded with vacationers, as, for example, in the center of the resort.  There is enough space for everyone here.  To get to the beach, you need to go down the ramshackle steps, which in some places have already become worthless.  You will also have to go back upstairs.  In principle, for healthy people, such a walk will only benefit, but older people should take into account a similar nuance so that such a descent does not become an unpleasant surprise. </p><p>  The local coast is very beautiful and clean.  The sand cover, combined with the turquoise sea and green palm trees, is like a beautiful picture from a commercial. </p><h2>  Room and Room Reviews </h2><p>  Tours in Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique 3 * (Phuket) can be purchased with or without breakfast.  The hotel also offers half board.  According to tourists, in the morning the food is quite modest.  The menu includes five different options, of which vacationers need to choose one thing.  The hotel does not serve buffet meals.  The scarcity of breakfast is not for all tourists.  Fried scrambled eggs with a few toasts and tea is a common dish for a morning meal.  Therefore, anyone who loves more hearty breakfasts, it is better to immediately choose food in a cafe.  Vacationers who prefer half board note that the restaurant dinner is good and tasty. </p><p>  A 20-30 minute walk from the hotel is an area with many restaurants and cafes.  Eating in them is much cheaper than in the cafe complex.  There are also grocery stores where you can buy everything you need.  You can get to the center by walking along the beach or along the road, but it is deserted, and you can‚Äôt catch a tuk-tuk on it not so often.  If you come back with full bags, replenishing supplies of food, then experienced tourists recommend not to save money and use the services of a tuk-tuk.  Since wandering in the sand is very difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="karon cliff contemporary boutique 3 phuket" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1538312.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In local cafes, the food is very tasty, especially here there are many seafood dishes that are certainly worth trying. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  What are the rooms at Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique 3 *?  Reviews of tourists indicate that the complex has quite spacious apartments.  Especially good are those that have panoramic sea views.  The rest of the rooms look at the palm grove on the hill.  Since the rooms have large windows, it seems that you are directly in the jungle, and not in the room. </p><p>  The situation in the rooms is quite acceptable, given the three-star status of the complex.  According to vacationers, the furniture is far from new, but fulfills its purpose and is in good condition.  All rooms have large double beds.  Apartments are cleaned daily.  However, do not forget to hang the appropriate sign on the doors (otherwise the maids may not clean the room).  In general, cleaning is carried out efficiently.  Towels are changed daily, and bedding (synthetic, poor quality) - once every three days. </p><p>  Initially, when checking in in the minibar for each tourist there is drinking water (the norm per person is 0.5 liters per day).  In the future, guests can exchange empty bottles for new ones at the reception.  If this amount of water per day is not enough for you, you will have to buy it in a supermarket. </p><p>  Ants sometimes appear in the rooms, so you can‚Äôt leave food outside the refrigerator.  Hotel workers explain this by the proximity of the jungle, which is not so easy to fight with its inhabitants. </p><p>  The apartments are equipped with cable TVs, including two Russians.  The rooms overlooking the sea boast not only beautiful views.  Their inhabitants have a great opportunity to fall asleep to the sound of the surf. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique 3 * (the reviews are given in the article) has a good friendly staff, which, unfortunately, does not speak Russian at all.  As for English, things are not much better with it, sign language comes to the rescue.  However, the hotel staff is always friendly and happy with the guests. </p><p>  There are always guides at the hotel who can help you choose excursions and advise you on what sights to see.  However, far from all guides, tourists respond warmly.  Experienced vacationers do not recommend paying attention to bonuses (in the form of discounts or fruit baskets) when buying tours for a certain amount, this is just an advertising trick that attracts unaware beginners. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Karon Cliff Contemporary Boutique 3 * (photos, reviews are given in the article) can be recommended to active tourists who prefer outdoor recreation.  Resting in the center of the resort, it is impossible to feel the atmosphere of the jungle.  And here, on the contrary, you will spend an unforgettable vacation in the lap of nature, surrounded by palm trees and the sea.  Despite the shortcomings, the hotel fully complies with the ratio of "price / quality". </p>
