As a rule, they are attracted by the low cost of the local options for accommodation, as well as the commercial and gastronomic orientation of the city.  From mid-May to the end of October, Salou is filled with tourists.  If you are looking for an extremely inexpensive place to stay in this resort, pay attention to Rentalmar Salou Pacific 3 * apartments.  We will tell you in more detail what level of service they offer their guests. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The cost of living is greatly influenced by the location of the hotel.  The closer it is to the coastline and mass entertainment facilities, the usually more expensive its price.  However, Rentalmar Salou Pacific is an exception to this rule.  It is built on a busy tourist street with restaurants, cafes and small private shops everywhere.  The city's free beach is only 300 meters away, so guests can easily reach it in 5-10 minutes on foot.  1 km from the hotel is the famous promenade of King Jaime I, which guests of the resort choose for leisurely walks in the evenings.  Another <span>attraction of Salou,</span> Port Aventura Theme Park, is 2 km away.  The historic center of Tarragona can be reached by taxi in 20 minutes.  There is a Roman and early Christian necropolis, as well as large <span>shopping centers.</span> </p>

    <p>  A small airport is 9 km from Salou, but tourists rarely choose it for travel.  They usually fly to Spain on planes landing at Barcelona International Airport.  It is located much further - the distance to it is about 80 km.  From there, the hotel can be reached by bus, rental car or taxi.  The complex does not offer transfer for its guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  The hotel has virtually no territory of its own.  It consists of one building, which houses 215 apartments.  They are more reminiscent of full-fledged one-room apartments equipped for independent living and recreation, rather than rooms that are usually used only for overnight.  Rentalmar Salou Pacific Apartment (Salou) is completely surrounded by a fence so that passers-by do not interfere with the rest of tourists.  The hotel building is surrounded by a lush forest area.  At the entrance to the hotel there are swimming pools and a tiled sun terrace. </p>

    <p>  The hotel staff speaks good English, Spanish and French, but does not speak Russian at all.  The apartment can accommodate children of any age, however extra beds are not available for them.  Guests with pets are not allowed.  Upon registration, future guests will require a document proving their identity, as well as a credit card.  Upon check-in, a deposit of 50 euros is also charged, which is returned to guests upon eviction. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that in the low season (from September to June) the hotel reception is not open around the clock.  The administrator is at the hotel in the morning and in the evening, so if you arrive earlier or later, you need to notify him so that he can give you the room keys. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rentalmar Salou Pacific Apartment: room description </h2><p>  This complex is an apart-hotel, therefore its rooms are slightly different in size and equipment from the usual hotels.

    <p>  Coming here, it is worth knowing that the rooms do not have ironing facilities, a hairdryer and cosmetics.  The hotel offers views of the adjoining sun terrace with pool or city buildings.  Residents of the last floors can reach their apartments by elevator. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  As a rule, tourists who come to rest at the Rentalmar Salou Pacific hotel prefer to organize their meals on their own - to cook food in their apartments or to dine in restaurants outside the hotel.  For them, the hotel has the concept of Room Only.  That is, living without meals.  If you want food and drinks to be included in the price of your stay, then arrange half-board or full-board systems.  Their cost, as a rule, includes good food in a local restaurant, where meals are served in the form of a buffet.  Guests will also have access to some non-alcoholic drinks - mineral water, fruit juices and Coca-Cola.  Alcohol is not included in the price of accommodation and meals. </p>

    <h2>  Negative feedback from guests </h2><p>  On the expanses of the network there are many tourists who criticize this hotel.  In their reviews, they describe the following disadvantages of relaxation here: </p><ul><li>  rooms in the hotel are in need of repair - guests did not like the <span>ragged walls</span> ; </li><li>  from the bathroom it smells like sewage; </li><li>  the bed linen issued by the hotel has dirty stains that are not completely washed out; </li><li>  loud music comes from the hotel opposite late into the evening; </li><li>  dirty poolside terrace with cracked tiles; </li><li>  Internet at the hotel is extremely slow. </li></ul><h2>  Should I choose this hotel for relaxation? </h2><p>  Thus, we can say that the Rentalmar Salou Pacific hotel will be a good place for a budget holiday.  Yes, the complex has many shortcomings, but for such a cost it is quite difficult to find the best option for accommodation in Spain.  Most often, quiet tourists stay here - married couples with young children, older couples and friendly companies who love a relaxing holiday. </p>
