    <p>  If this is a small room, then heaters are needed for the apartment.  Cost-effective performance of such devices will play a big role in the selection.  In this case, it is worth paying attention to oil or convective heaters.  They can be turned on for a long time and programmed to maintain the required temperature. </p><p>  They are also safe for children.  The outer surface of these devices does not heat up to high temperature.  Therefore, touching them is safe.  The absence of noise during work creates the conditions for relaxation.  <span>Night work</span> is normal for them. </p><h2>  Workplace heating </h2><p>  At the beginning of the day, when everyone comes to work, the temperature in the offices is usually minimal.  Often it falls overnight due to savings on heating.  Heating of office premises can be carried out by fan heaters or infrared radiators, which have proven themselves in such conditions.  They quickly start working and in a matter of minutes warm up the room. </p><p>  You can combine the operation of these devices.  For example, to quickly heat up, use fan heaters, and then switch to another, less noisy option.  It can be infrared heaters that will stand next to each employee.  Thus, you can create individual comfortable conditions for everyone. </p><p>  In this case, the convective option is also suitable.  But when using it, you will have to wait a bit until the heat disperses naturally. </p><h2>  Heat supply in country dachas </h2><p>  If you had to visit a summer house or other room in the cold season, you should take a heating tool with you or install it there in advance.  The easiest option is a fan heater.  But it is also worth paying attention to the gas heater.  It can be mounted in advance in the wall and used only if necessary.  In addition, there is not always electric energy in such buildings, so this option will be simply irreplaceable.  Only a new gas cylinder will have to be connected to it periodically.  If there is a gas pipeline, then this greatly simplifies the situation. </p><h2>  Security measures </h2><p>  Before choosing a heater for the apartment, you should find out the specifics of its work.  If there are children and animals in the house, then it is necessary to prevent dangerous situations in advance.  When using oil radiators, they must be well fixed to the floor.  Installation of these devices from above near stairs, basements and other recesses is not allowed.  The weight of such heaters is quite large, and if they fall, they can cause serious harm. </p><p>  If possible, convective heat sources should be attached to the wall in a place inaccessible to children.  If there are poultry, then you should additionally use a special cover so that they do not want to bask inside the device where the red-hot spiral is located. </p><p>  In the case of using floor fan heaters and infrared emitters, they should be placed in places where foreign objects will not touch them.  Also, when buying, you should clarify whether they have a system that turns off the power of the device when it is capsized. </p><h2>  Keep track of quality </h2><p>  When buying, you should not try to choose the cheapest heaters possible.  For an apartment, economical options can be with a big loss of quality.  And this threatens premature failure of the equipment or possible fire.  It is better to overpay once for a quality heater and be calm than to save a small amount and constantly fear for its work. </p><p>  It also happens that a good manufacturer can make a product with a defect.  To identify this, you need to turn on the heat source at full power after purchase and observe it for several hours.  Such a test will detect marriage. </p><h2>  Beneficial features </h2><p>  There are models of heaters with additional devices that increase comfort when using them.  For example, a heating element and a device for humidifying air can be placed in one housing.  Such combinations allow you not to spend extra money on other auxiliary devices. </p><p>  A good addition to a heat source is a timer with a programming function.  With this, you can set the on and off times.  It is convenient in that you can come after work to an already heated apartment, and at night not be afraid for a device that will work until morning. </p><p>  There are also models with automatic support for a given temperature in the room.  For this purpose, the device turns on and off independently throughout the entire time only to maintain the temperature.  Therefore, before choosing a heater for an apartment, it is worth taking a closer look at models with such properties.  They will help to save the family budget by replacing other devices, and will not require attention during their work. </p><h2>  General recommendations </h2><p>  When choosing means for heating, preference should be given to proven manufacturers.  Such companies protect their reputation and carefully monitor the quality of their products. </p><p>  Heaters, the review of which the seller offers you, should be carefully studied and chosen by you.  Otherwise, you can purchase what the seller needs, not you.  Also, you should always be interested in the price of products of different brands.  This will help you understand what you have to pay for. </p>
