Executioner profession in the Middle Ages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Medieval Europe</span> left a huge bloody trail in world history.  And all because the <span>death penalty</span> in those days was put on a par with entertainment programs, so not a single weekend could pass without this ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù.  The execution of the death sentence could not have taken place without the executioners.  It was they who carried out the torture, chopped off their heads and prepared the guillotines.  But who is the executioner: cruel and heartless or forever damned unfortunate person? </p><h2>  Noble calling </h2><p>  The executioner was considered an employee of the judiciary, authorized to implement the punishment and death penalty by the ruler of the state.  It would seem that the executioner‚Äôs profession could well be honorable with such a definition, but everything was different.  He was not free to change his occupation, to go to public places. </p>

    <p>  They had to live outside the city, where prisons were located.  He carries out all the work himself from beginning to end, that is, he prepared the necessary tools, and after completing the case, he buried the corpse.  Their work required a good knowledge of anatomy. </p><p>  There is a myth that they wore black masks.  In fact, they did not hide their face, and they could be recognized by their black robes and highly developed muscles.  Hiding his face did not make sense, because everyone already knew who the executioner is and where he lives.  They covered their faces only during the execution of kings, so that their loyal servants would not take revenge afterwards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Position in society </h2><p>  A paradoxical situation: citizens enthusiastically watched the executioner, but at the same time they scorned him.  Maybe the people would treat them with great respect, if they had a decent <span>financial situation.</span>  They received a small salary.  As a bonus, they could take all the things of the executed to themselves.  Often earned money by exorcists.  In the Middle Ages, they were sure that torturing one‚Äôs body could drive out demons, this was at hand for professional tormentors. </p>

    <p>  But the executioner - what kind of profession, if he does not have certain privileges.  He could take what he needed absolutely free in the market.  This kind of privilege is explained by the fact that no one wanted to take money from the hands of the killer.  At the same time, such people were necessary for the state, and therefore merchants followed this rule. </p><p>  Another way to earn money for them was to trade unusual gizmos.  These included parts of the body of executed people, skin, blood, various potions.  Alchemists were confident that special potions could be made from such ingredients.  They bought up the ropes of the gallows, according to some traditions, she could bring luck to her owner.  Doctors bought up the bodies completely and conducted their research on the human body and viscera on them.  Mages bought skulls for their rituals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Who such an executioner in his position could be understood by coming to church.  Like any other Christian, he was allowed into it, but had to stand at the very entrance and take communion last. </p><h2>  Bloody dynasty </h2><p>  Who had the idea to begin to engage in such a craft?  The profession of the executioner in the Middle Ages was inherited - from father to son.  As a result, entire clans formed.  Almost all executioners living in the same region were related by kinship.  Indeed, for such a man, representatives of other classes would never have given their beloved daughter. </p><p>  The low position of the executioner was able to tarnish the whole clan of the bride.  Their wives could only be the same daughters of executioners, grave diggers, flayer, or even prostitutes. </p><p>  People called the executioners "whore sons" and were right, because they often became the executioners' wives.  In tsarist Russia, executioner dynasties were not created.  They were chosen from former criminals.  Those agreed to "dirty" work in exchange for food and clothing. </p><h2>  Subtleties of craftsmanship </h2><p>  At first glance, this might seem like a pretty simple job.  In fact, it took a lot of knowledge and preparation to decapitate the criminals.  On the first attempt, cutting off his head is not easy, but when the executioner knew how to do it, it was believed that he had reached a high level of skill. </p>

    <p>  Who is the executioner as a professional?  This one who understands the structure of the human body, knows how to use all kinds of torture devices, has sufficient physical strength to wield an ax and dig graves. </p><h2>  Executioner's curse </h2><p>  A legend circulated among the people that the executioner was cursed.  Who knew this, understood that there was nothing in common with magic and the supernatural.  This was due to the view of society on the life of people engaged in base craft.  By tradition, becoming an executioner, it was no longer possible to refuse this work, and if a person refused, he himself was recognized as a criminal and executed. </p><p>  So, having become a torturer-executioner by origin, a man was forced to do dirty work all his life.  No free will.  Life away from people, the inability to change jobs and the limited choice of life partner.  For centuries in the dynasties of executioners more and more new hereditary killers were born. </p>
