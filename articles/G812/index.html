After nine years, he became the capital of Russia and carried this proud title for more than two centuries.  The construction was difficult, because there were only swamps all around.  And no roads.  Nothing but a river.  But despite the bitter impassability, the city developed and required considerable attention.  In 1843, the construction of the Nikolaev railway begins.  She was to connect Peter and Moscow with the help of steam locomotives.  Outlandish at the time for many citizens of cars.  The road was vital and, above all, for the development of industry.  And the steam engines, releasing smoke from their pipes, began to ply between the cities, spreading goods, and at the same time passengers. </p><h2>  Steam engine and "Water pump" </h2><p>  But this strange beast is so arranged that it needs water to work.  Warming up and turning into steam, she actually was the driving force of a huge roaring machine.  And the road is long ... Where can I get this steam engine?  Therefore, artificial reservoirs began to appear along the railway.  One of them was built in 1861 on the territory of modern Zelenograd. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="School Lake Zelenograd" class="if" height="152" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/2035021.jpg" width="600"></div>  And the name was given - "Vodokachka pond."  Before the advent of electric locomotives, all steam boilers of railway transport were filled with life-giving moisture here.  Like every pond, Vodokachka, and later Shkolnoye Lake in Zelenograd, has its own history.  There were fables about him.  Often with a mystical color, which was reinforced by the grimy and cheerful stokers.  That was before the war.

Around him was a forest of centuries-old pines and young firs.  The children bathed in the summer in spite of all parental prohibitions, as if this water attracted and attracted.  Time passed, the war passed.  The most terrible and bloody for this land.  In the postwar period, the lake has changed little. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="School Lake Zelenograd" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/2035020.jpg" width="600"></div>  Here are just the tops of fir cut by shells, and the ditches reminded of past battles.  All the same frolic boys and girls, birds sang the same way.  And silence ... And also boats that were easily tied to a small pier with oars at the bottom.  Everyone could ride on the lake.  And as a rule, returning, they left the boats in the same place, on the pier.

    <h2>  Shkolnoye Lake in Zelenograd, the history of the name </h2><p>  And industry has developed.  Having risen from the ruins, our country was rebuilt.  By the end of the 40s, electric locomotives began to appear.  The former Nikolaev railway, of course, was no exception.  In 1948, the first electric trains were launched.  The need for ‚ÄúVodokachka‚Äù seemed to disappear.  And the lake turned into a bathing place for local children, who happily came here from the summer camp.  It was located in the school and was open all summer for children of different ages.  Since that time, the reservoir beloved by the locals was renamed Lake Shkolnoye in Zelenograd.  Currently, two schools are located next to it, so it justifies its name. </p><h2>  Recreation area for everyone </h2><p>  And the city is developing rapidly.  Already instead of Khrushchev‚Äôs are elite houses.  Shkolnoye Lake in Zelenograd turned into an accessible recreation area.  Nearby is a forested area, benches, benches where you can sit with children or a fun company.  Free parking is nearby, many come here when the public beach opens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="School Lake Zelenograd" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/2035019.jpg" width="600"></div>  There are on Shkolnoye Lake in Zelenograd and volleyball and table tennis courts, playgrounds.  Little mischievous people spend a lot of time here with their mothers, so they feel cozy and comfortable.  And for the safety of swimmers, lifeguards are on duty.  On the lake you can relax not only in summer but also in winter.  When snow falls, paths for hiking are cleared around the lake.  On the magic night of Epiphany on the Shkolnoye lake in Zelenograd, an ice hole appears for everyone to plunge.  At any time of the year on the lake, clean air and beauty, which is impossible not to admire.  And silence...
