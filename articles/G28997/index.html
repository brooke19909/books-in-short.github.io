    <p>  Education in pedagogy is one of the basic concepts and the main subject of study.  In a broad sense, it includes preparing the younger generation for modern life.  In a narrow sense, education is a process in which the younger generation must learn the material that has already been accumulated by society over the long years of its existence: </p><ul><li>  theoretical knowledge; </li><li>  certain labor skills; </li><li>  experience and norms of behavior in society. </li></ul><p>  The methods of upbringing in the pedagogy of schools and families should be aimed at ensuring that children and adolescents are able to develop a specific, their system of views and opinions on life.  In addition, considerable attention should be paid to the formation of the qualities necessary in order to solve new, urgent problems.  Thanks to proper education, the <span>younger generation</span> must acquire a system of skills that will help them adapt to changing working and living conditions, as well as engage in creativity. </p><p>  Currently, pedagogy has been able to accumulate a rich fund that reveals the patterns and essence of methods of education.  There is a traditional classification of them, which will help to understand the meaning and main features inherent in each group. </p><p>  Based on this, we can distinguish <span>educational methods</span> in pedagogy.  Let's consider them in more detail: </p><p>  - Methods that form the consciousness of the individual.  These include the method of example, debate, lecture, conversation, story.  They contribute to moral and moral education. </p><p>  - Methods that develop the organization of activities and shape public experience.  They will determine the behavior of the individual.  This group includes the following methods of education in pedagogy: demonstration, illustration, instruction, demand and training.  The most optimal will be their use in collective activities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Methods of stimulating the motivation of behavior and activities of the individual.  It is about competition, cognitive play, discussion and emotional impact.  Thanks to them, a desire will be formed in order to comply with accepted social rules and norms. </p><p>  - Methods of assessment and self-esteem, control and self-control in education.  They may be different.  A properly organized upbringing will be built in such a way that the external assessment gradually "grows" into self-esteem, and control - into self-control.  The child should not be an object, but the subject of this process. </p><p>  But the <span>methods of upbringing</span> in pedagogy must appear in a contradictory and complex unity.  The decisive role will be assigned not to separate, "secluded" means, but to a harmoniously organized system. </p><p>  Naturally, at any stage of the educational process, some method can be applied in isolation.  But it must be supported by others, because without their interaction it will lose its significance and also slow down the movement of this process towards a specific goal.  In this capacity, the <span>types of education</span> in pedagogy usually act: </p><ul><li>  mental, which focuses on the development and formation of human intellectual abilities, as well as cognitive interests in the world and oneself; </li><li>  moral, determined by the ethical requirements of society and aimed at the development of personality; </li><li>  <span>labor education</span> is aimed at developing and preparing for activity, a conscientious, responsible and creative attitude to work, the accumulation of experience; </li><li>  aesthetic should form a sense of beauty; </li><li>  physical education promotes proper physical development, development of character, will. </li></ul><p>  But it must be borne in mind that the methods of upbringing in pedagogy must be aimed at naturally inducing the child to self-education and self-development. </p>
