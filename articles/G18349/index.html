There are many amazing cities in which people of various nationalities and cultures live. </p><p>  In Asia, in the very center of the mainland, in the Republic of Khakassia, there is the city of Abakan.  Where is it, how do the locals live there, what are they doing?  We will try to tell about this, about the history of this city, about the economy and much more in this article. </p><h2>  G. Abakan: area, facts from history </h2><p>  In 1675, the first Russian fortress was built on the island of Sosnovy at the mouth <span>of the Abakan River</span> , which lasted until 1679. The Cossacks who built it were then the very first inhabitants of it.  Families of immigrants from Russia settled near the village of Ah-Tigey, in this very fortress.  They were engaged in agriculture. </p><p>  For local residents, they became an example for the desire for a settled life.  Thus, this village began to grow rapidly and turned into a village with the name Ust-Abakan. </p><p>  Subsequently, the village (1822) was transformed into an administrative center (Kachinsky Steppe Duma).  The latter was one of the four entities that united the tribes living at that time between the rivers Iyus and Abakan.  Such thoughts (and councils) existed until 1912, after which the Abakan volost was created. </p><p>  Curious and noteworthy is the history of the emergence of such a locality as Abakan.
