Military ranks in the tsarist army</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In this article we will consider some <span>military ranks</span> in <span>tsarist Russia.</span>  This list, however, is incomplete, it can be continued.  We present to your attention only the main ranks. </p><h2>  Foreman </h2><p>  We begin our list of "Military ranks in the tsarist army of Russia" with the <span>foreman.</span>  <span>This is a</span> military rank in the Russian Imperial Army, which existed in the 18-19 centuries, below the Major General and above the Colonel.  It was introduced by Peter I. </p><p>  The rank of captain-commander corresponded to him in the fleet.  <span>The brigadier general</span> in some armies today corresponds to the rank of "brigadier". </p><h2>  Wahmister </h2><p>  This post was distributed in the cavalry, non-commissioned officers, as well as in artillery in the army of our country (Cossack troops, cavalry, as well as the gendarme corps).  It existed until 1917, when the military ranks of the tsarist army of Russia operated.  Not everyone had an analogue of ranks in the USSR.  A vakhmistra, for example, was not in the <span>Soviet army</span> .  The duty of the person with this rank was to help the squadron commander in conducting the training of troops and organizing the internal order and economy.  The corresponding rank in the infantry is sergeant major.  For non-commissioned officers, this rank would be the highest until 1826. </p><h2>  Lieutenant general </h2><p>  We continue to describe military ranks in tsarist Russia, and we will turn to the lieutenant general.  This rank and military rank was in the Ukrainian and Russian armies.  It was used simultaneously (almost as a synonym) with the <span>rank of lieutenant general.</span>  The latter during the Northern War, more precisely, in its second half, replaced the rank of lieutenant-general. </p><h2>  Field Marshal </h2><p>  This is the highest military rank in the ground forces of the Austrian, German and Russian army.  It was introduced in our country by Peter I in 1699.  This rank of class I corresponded in the fleet with the rank of admiral general, in the civil service - the chancellor, as well as secret adviser (also class I).  The field marshal‚Äôs wand served as a distinction sign; since the 19th century, in the buttonholes of field marshals, they began to be depicted in a crossed form.  Distinguished military ranks in tsarist Russia epaulettes, where the representatives of the rank described by us also depicted wands.  An example of the famous Field Marshal in the history of our country is D. A. Milyutin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Since 2009, this symbol is also present on the emblem of the current <span>Supreme Commander-in-Chief of</span> all the Armed Forces of our country. </p><h2>  Generalissimo </h2><p>  In the Holy Roman Empire, this was the highest military rank, and later became such in the Russian Empire, as well as in the USSR and several other countries. </p><p>  Historically, it was appropriated to the commanders of several, mainly allied, armies, commanders, and in some cases also statesmen or persons belonging to the families of reigning dynasties, as an honorary title.  This rank stood outside the system of other officer ranks. </p><p>  A.V. Suvorov on October 28, 1799 received this title in accordance with the Military Charter, since he was the prince of the Sardinian kingdom, and at the same time the count of the Roman Empire, the prince of Russia, as well as the commander in chief of the Austrian, Sardinian and Russian troops.  Currently, in our country it is not provided for by law. </p>

    <h2>  Esaul </h2><p>  Continues our list of "Military ranks in tsarist Russia" next rank.  Esaul is the rank of officer in the Cossack and Russian troops.  This title means an assistant, deputy military leader.  Yesauls are: military, general, hundred, regimental, marching, stanichny, artillery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Captain commander </h2><p>  This rank existed in 1707-1732, and also in 1751-1827 in the fleet of our country.  It was introduced in 1707 and entered in the Table of Ranks in 1722, belonged to class V, and was considered lower than rear admiral and higher than the rank of captain of a ship (captain of the first rank from 1713).  In the army, this rank corresponded to the foreman, and in state (civilian) posts - the state adviser.  An appeal to the representative of this title is "Your Highness".  His duties included the command of detachments of ships (small), as well as the replacement for the time of rear admiral. </p><h2>  Corporal </h2><p>  This military rank, which the junior command staff had, is the lowest sergeant (non-commissioned) officer rank.  In our country, it appeared in 1647, introduced by Peter I "Military Charter".  Later, in the first half of the 19th century, he was replaced by the rank of non-commissioned officer.  Today in modern armed forces corporal corresponds to such a title as "Junior Sergeant." </p><h2>  Cornet </h2><p>  This is the military rank that was in the armies of some countries, mainly in the cavalry.  Its name comes from the ancient post of trumpeter, who was with the commander, who, by his order, transmitted signals to the troops during the battle.  The owners of this rank are in the same class with the army lieutenants, so they wear the same epaulettes.  Note that in the cavalry of the rank of second lieutenant does not exist. </p><h2>  Podseaul </h2><p>  We continue to describe military ranks in tsarist Russia, we present to you the following.  This post existed from the 16th century, and then in Russia it was the chief officer rank in the Cossack troops of the X class (in 1798-1884) and the IX class in the above-mentioned list "Rank Table" (1884-1917), in which military ranks in tsarist Russia and their salaries are indicated. </p>

    <p>  We continue to describe military ranks in the tsarist army.  The ensign exists in the armed forces, as well as other power structures in a number of countries.  By decree of Alexei Mikhailovich, in 1649 the standard-bearers who were appointed from among the most physically strong, courageous and battle-tested warriors began to be called ensigns in the Russian army.  Creating a regular army, Peter I in 1712 introduced this rank as a junior (first) officer rank in the cavalry and infantry.  Until 1917, it was assigned to persons who had completed an accelerated course in ensign schools or military schools and passed exams according to a specific program.  In <span>wartime, his</span> assignment was allowed without an exam for military distinctions to non-commissioned officers who had secondary or higher education.  Warrant officers were usually appointed by platoon commanders.  In the Red Army (in 1917-1946), as well as the Soviet (until 1972), a similar rank of ensign did not exist.  Since January 1, 1972 it was introduced (along with the rank of warrant officer) in the Armed Forces of the USSR.  In the modern army of our country, he corresponds to the position of junior lieutenant. </p><h2>  Captain </h2><p>  The captain completes our list of "Military ranks in the tsarist army."  This was the senior officer rank in the cavalry (in the Russian Empire, the chief officer).  In 1730, in connection with the creation of the heavy cavalry, new names of ranks appeared, among which was the captain.  The Ulan and <span>Hussar regiments</span> were transformed into dragoon <span>regiments</span> in 1882, and to establish uniformity in ranks throughout the cavalry, dragoon captains became known as captains.  In 1917, this rank was abolished.  In the 20th century, it existed, for example, in Poland. </p>
