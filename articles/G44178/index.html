Royal Tombs: Paphos, Cyprus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ancient and mysterious Cyprus, offering an incredible number of excursion programs, is incredibly popular among curious tourists who want to get acquainted not only with amazing nature, but also with unusual sights.  The picturesque city, which was once the capital of a picturesque island, is rightfully considered a treasury of archaeological and architectural monuments, involuntarily evoking the romance of bygone centuries. </p><h2>  The oldest burial places in the world </h2><p>  Two kilometers from Paphos is a giant necropolis - an atmospheric place where fantasy is played out.  Despite the fact that the royal tombs were looted, and some of the unique artifacts were lost forever, they are of great interest to scientists around the world.  Amazing in size and fanciful architecture, the memorial, the exact date of discovery of which is unknown, attracted the attention of organized research groups in the 70s of the last century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal tombs" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2094259.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Some travelers believe that Tombs of the Kings is the burial place of kings, but in reality the tombs are not the people of blue bloods, but the local nobility and a high-ranking elite.  And this name was given to the tombs thanks to the luxurious decor and extremely expensive ritual jewelry found by archaeologists.  This is one of the oldest attractions in the world, which reached the descendants in relatively good condition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Royal tombs on Paphos appeared in the 4th century BC, and later the first Christians hid from persecution, leaving images of crosses on the walls.  BC was part of the great Persian Empire, and after Alexander the Great entered the international arena, who accepted the title of Pharaoh, a new period in history begins in Egypt - the Hellenistic one.  All lands from Iran to the Balkans are united in an ancient state called the Macedonian Empire.  After the death of the valiant commander, Cyprus, passing from hand to hand, becomes part of Egypt.  However, they buried here according to Greek customs, which is why all the tombs of Alexandria and the islands are similar to each other. </p><h2>  Looted and destroyed </h2><p>  Now, some catacombs cannot be dated, since there is nothing besides stone slabs.  The thing is that the royal tombs (Cyprus) were often robbed, and for more than two millennia they stood empty.  There are no coins or any inscriptions that could establish the exact time of the burial or tell about the deceased.  In the Middle Ages, stone is mined on the territory of the necropolis, and many tombs are destroyed.  And only two tombs for unknown reasons reach the descendants intact. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal tombs of pathos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2094258.jpg"></div>

And if outside the memorial complex does not look monumental, then the tourists who descended into the catacombs note the gigantic dimensions of an archaeological masterpiece.  Spacious royal tombs, similar to palace halls, are decorated with frescoes and obscure images, and later archaeologists have established that these are the family emblems of the repose.  Inside, you can see tall columns, powerful arches, deep wells. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main types of royal tombs of the middle kingdom" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2094290.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In stone buildings, scientists have found jewelry that amaze with amazing beauty.  Now they are all in the archaeological museums of Cyprus, and tourists observe only the empty niches of the necropolis. </p><h2>  Bizarre underground labyrinth </h2><p>  Each tomb covers a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãseveral hundred meters.  All the royal tombs are connected by a bizarre network of numerous passages and stone stairs, and careless visitors entangled in the labyrinths may find themselves in the well.  Some graves exactly copy the dwellings of local aristocrats. </p><p>  Equipped with cozy courtyards, they delight with amazing architecture and expertly executed sculptures.  In many catacombs, one can find the so-called ritual chambers in which offerings for the dead were brought.  Such structures were faced with marble-like stucco. </p><p>  This is a real underground city, in the center of which is the main square.  To make it easier for tourists to search the necropolis, all rooms are numbered.  A walk through the UNESCO-protected attractions takes about two hours.  Tourists will be able to get acquainted with only eight tombs, which you can go down to view the burial chambers. </p><h2>  What are the main types of royal tombs in the Middle Kingdom? </h2><p>  The tombs buried the wealthy citizens of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece, and soon the nobility from Rome rested beside them.  Many catacombs, untouched by time, resemble spacious apartment buildings with everything you need, or even temples, because they were built under the influence of Alexandria, founded by A. the Great. </p><p>  There are several basic types of royal tombs in the Middle Kingdom: </p><ul><li>  fossiform; </li><li>  tombs with an atrium; </li><li>  tomb chambers. </li></ul><p>  Pit-shaped tombs are niches carved into the rocks where the body of the deceased was placed, and outside, around the hole, an ornament was made or inscriptions were made.  Through stone stairs you could go to the inside of the tombs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the main types of royal tombs of the middle kingdom" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2094263.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The tombs with the atrium are not in vain called the home for the deceased.  Here they built a well for ritual ablutions and broke a patio, connected to the burial staircase.  And from it already departed in different directions funeral tunnels. </p><p>  Tomb chambers are a real necropolis, designed for several burials.  In the center was the main chamber, and branches departed from it, and in each such tunnel there were graves. </p><h2>  Royal Tombs, Paphos: how to get there? </h2><p>  The state-protected memorial complex, located on the very outskirts of the city, is the place to visit during a vacation in Paphos.  However, it is not necessary to do this as part of an organized excursion, because you can come here yourself, significantly saving.  The shuttle bus at number 615, leaving for Coral Bay Beach, reaches the stop of the same name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal tombs cyprus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2094250.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Entrance to the tombs, which receive guests all year round, is paid, and its cost is about two euros. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  It is best to visit the royal tombs in the early morning, as it can be too hot during the day. </p><p>  You should not shoe high-heeled shoes, as wandering through the caves is most convenient in sneakers. </p><p>  Since there are no eateries on site, be sure to bring food and water with you. </p><p>  In order not to get lost, pay attention to the installed plates with inscriptions and diagrams.  In addition, at the entrance to the museum complex sell information brochures intended for tourists. </p>
