    <h2>  West African Fire Velvet Weaver </h2><p>  These are bright as <strong> </strong>  little bird flames found their place in Africa, from the Sahara to the south and to the equator.  Males build nests, and not one, but several.  Even if you keep them in captivity and create maximum conditions for comfort, they will still do it.  This is, so to speak, in their blood. </p><p>  In size they can be compared with our sparrows.  When they descend to the ground, they move in small leaps.  It is not so difficult to find them in Africa, they settle in green meadows, which are located near cold ponds. </p><h2>  Longtail Velvet Weaver </h2><p>  This bird differs from the previous one in that in flight it shows its long tail.  In the sky, it seems like a ribbon that flies after a bird.  These are beautiful black birds with a red and white stripe on their wings. </p><p>  True, it is worth noting that only males have such plumage.  Females are unremarkable, and really look like sparrows. </p><p>  You can also find such an expression as "black widow", which the British nicknamed her, of course for what. </p><h2>  New Guinea Swallow </h2>

    <h2>  Balinese Starling </h2><p>  As the name implies, this is an inhabitant of the island of Bali.  This species is protected, since there are not so many individuals left, we can say they are on the verge of extinction.  These are beautiful birds, they have white with blue rings near their eyes and with inserts of black feathers.  They settle on mangrove swamps, in acacia forests, shrubs.  Starlings create permanent pairs.  It is especially interesting to watch the mating demonstration when a male with a raised crest flaps its wings and tail. </p><p>  This starling is one of the symbols of the island of Bali and is depicted on an Indonesian coin (200 rupees). </p><h2>  Cuban Trogon </h2><p>  And who is it, who is it?  This is the national living symbol of Cuba!  If you remember the colors of the <span>Cuban flag,</span> you should know that they are taken from this cute bird.  It is red, blue, white.  The female and the male are the same in color. </p><p>  They are small in size, and in addition to this, they can be found in the moist forests of America, Asia, Africa. </p><h2>  Quesal </h2><p>  This bird can be safely classified as the “most beautiful bird in the world”.  She is small, but so beautiful that she simply cannot believe that she exists.  Due to deforestation of mountain and tropical forests where these birds live, their number is also reduced.  To this day they are considered a rare and protected species. </p>

    <p>  This bird lives from southern Mexico to Panama.  Its main advantage is a long tail, which can exceed the length of the quasel by several times. </p><p>  Just like in Cuba, the quasel is related to Guatemalan money.  Only here it is not depicted on coins, but a monetary unit is named in honor of the bird. </p><h2>  White-backed Lory </h2><p>  It belongs to the parrot family and is a resident of New Guinea.  The feathers are yellow, orange, <span>red, brown</span> , only at the bottom of the back and under the tail you can see white.  The color of males and females can not be distinguished, this can be understood by size.  The males have a slightly larger head than the females, and they are slightly larger.  It feeds exclusively on fruits, various nectars.  At home, such a bird will be difficult to contain. </p><h2>  Hyacinth macaw </h2><p>  Besides the fact that they can be classified as the “most beautiful birds in the world”, they are also <span>the largest parrots</span> in the world.  In height, they can grow up to a hundred centimeters.  They have a rich blue feather color.  They can be found in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay.  They are kept in small groups and live mainly where there are palm trees. </p><p>  They can be kept in captivity, as there are no problems with food.  Macaws feed on fruits, nuts, sunflower seeds and others.  Every day they gnaw on fresh branches of trees.  To keep such a bird at home, she should make a special aviary with a strong metal frame. </p><h2>  Osprey </h2><p>  Very dangerous and <span>predatory bird.</span>  She looks out for her prey from a flight altitude.  Habitat - large reservoirs.  It can be seen on almost all continents except Antarctica.  Her back is dark <span>brown</span> and her stomach is white. </p><p>  Osprey can catch fish on the surface of the water easily.  After she takes aim, she flies sharply downward, plunging into water with almost her whole body.  Slippery fish do not fall out of their paws due to the fact that they are large, strong and have sharp claws. </p><p>  When it’s the rainy season and the fish cannot be caught, the osprey catches mice, toads, etc. </p><h2>  Black Swan </h2><p>  This is a beautiful and graceful bird, which, unlike its relatives, also has a voice, it can be heard when it begins to call out to other swans.  They are inhabitants of Australia.  They fly very rarely, it’s hard for them to rise to the sky from the earth. </p><p>  Swans are those birds that create couples for life. </p><p>  For their maintenance it is not necessary to prepare a huge reservoir, as for ordinary swans.  A small trough of water is enough for this species, and they will be happy.  The food for them can be chosen the same as for ordinary geese, they also eat greens. </p><h2>  Tangerine </h2><p>  This is a small and cute duck, whose homeland is Japan, China, Korea.  The name of the bird was not in honor of citrus fruit, but in honor of senior officials and the emperor, who were called mandarins. </p>

    <p>  Among other things, they have a very melodic voice. </p><p>  The most beautiful <span>birds, photos of</span> which are above, are just the top of the iceberg.  Around the world there are much more amazing representatives of the family of birds.  And it's impossible to tell about all.  Nature has created a lot of wonderful birds that shock us with beauty and voice. </p><p>  But, in addition, they are incredibly useful to the world.  Beautiful birds are white, black, this is not so important, the main thing is that they are an integral part in the food chain of living organisms.  They are of great importance in regulating the number of small insects.  Birds also distribute seeds, which is important for the crop, they pollinate plants, exterminate harmful insects and rodents.  So birds should be protected so that their number does not decrease, and rare species, on the contrary, increase in numbers. </p>
