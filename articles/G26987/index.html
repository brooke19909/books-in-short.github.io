They easily fit in your pocket, palm and purse.  I went into the store, scored various goods, held a card at the checkout, paid.  What could be easier?  Only occasionally do incidents happen.  Yes, such that all the goods put in the basket have to be returned back to the store.  This happens when the plastic does not work.  How to unlock a Belarusbank card? </p><div class="photo" data-original="mybelarusbank.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inetent banking of Belarusbank" class="if uuid-3195469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3195469.jpg"></div><h2>  Brief information about the financial institution </h2><p>  Belarusbank is the largest credit organization in the country.  It appeared in 1987 and was called the Savings Bank of the USSR.  Closer to 1991, the organization was renamed the Savings Bank of Belarus.  Later, this financial institution received its modern name. </p><p>  Currently, the organization is in the TOP-25 of the largest banks in Europe.  Its clients are individuals, entrepreneurs, ordinary citizens, various enterprises. </p><h2>  Why do I need a card lock? </h2><p>  You must admit that a blocked account is not timely - this is unpleasant.  But most often this measure is forced.  By such an action, the bank seeks to protect the client's account.  After blocking the card of Belarusbank OJSC, no financial transactions with it are possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Briefly about the reasons for blocking </h2><p>  We can say that there can be a lot of reasons for blocking your bank card.  One of them is the exceeded limit.  For example, you had a certain amount in the account, you purchased goods in excess of this amount - and the balance went into minus. </p><p>  So that this behavior of the client does not become a habit, the bank often blocks cards.  In this case, before you unblock the Belarusbank card, you must compensate the amount issued to you in excess of the limit. </p><p>  Another reason is the expiration of the card.  Such plastic, unfortunately, cannot be unlocked.  But with the opening of a new card, part of the amount remaining on the previous card is transferred to your new account. </p><p>  The third lock option is associated with an incorrectly entered PIN code.  This happens when using an ATM.  Usually this is a three-fold error in the code - and the card is automatically blocked. </p><p>  The same thing happens if the bank notices excessive spending.  For example, if you regularly spent a small amount, and then suddenly started to litter money left and right, exceed your limit.  The bank often perceives such actions as suspicious activity.  And, fearing that the card got to the attackers, it is temporarily frozen.  How to unlock a Belarusbank card if the account is blocked? </p><div class="photo" data-original="recard.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank Card Velvet" class="if uuid-3195467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3195467.jpg"></div><h2>  We restore the state of the account by phone </h2><p>  One of the easiest options to restore the status of your card account is to call the bank hotline.  Such a phone number is on the official website of the organization.  The line operates around the clock. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The bank operator assists you by answering your questions by phone.  How to unlock a Belarusbank card, you will learn from the first minutes of communication with him.  A representative of a financial institution speaks about the reason for the lock and informs that he will ask you questions for a return unlock. </p><p>  Additional operator questions help him understand if you are the person you claim to be.  And are you the real owner of a blocked bank card.  For example, the operator will ask you for an answer to a secret question.  It is often indicated when filling out a questionnaire and registering an account.  But how to unlock the Belarusbank card if the answers to the operator‚Äôs questions are given in full? </p><p>  The final step for defrosting a card account is to enter your PIN code.  If, under some circumstances, the attempt was unsuccessful, you will have to duplicate the card while maintaining your details.  And only your current PIN code will change. </p><p>  To get a duplicate card, you will need to come to the nearest bank branch with your passport.  This procedure is very simple and involves writing a statement from a plastic card holder.  However, be prepared to pay an extra amount of money for this service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finbelarus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unlock step by step instructions" class="if uuid-3195457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3195457.jpg"></div><h2>  How to unlock a Belarusbank card through online banking? </h2><p>  Another option that involves defrosting your account is the use of Internet banking.  To do this, you must perform the following simple steps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Log in to your personal account. </li><li>  Go to the tab ‚ÄúAccounts‚Äù. </li><li>  Click on the picture ‚ÄúAccounts with a card (balance)‚Äù. </li><li>  Select ‚ÄúPersonal Payments (ERIP)‚Äù. </li><li>  Click on "Get Payer Number by Card Number". </li><li>  Enter the payer number (ERIP) in the free field. </li><li>  Choose the card that needs to be unlocked (usually it is highlighted in red). </li><li>  Select the "Operations" option, and then approve the "Unlock" function. </li></ul><p>  If everything is done correctly, you will be able to unlock the Belarusbank card via the Internet.  What does it look like?  Usually, with a successful outcome of events, the information message ‚ÄúSuccessfully Unlocked‚Äù is displayed opposite your card.  This entry lights up in green.  When it appears, you should know that now all operations on your account are available. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finbelarus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Menu to unlock" class="if uuid-3195458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3195458.jpg"></div><h2>  Important Lock Information </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that you don‚Äôt unblock the Magnet card of Belarusbank yourself.  The same applies to other plastic products of this financial institution.  The reason is blocking.  For example, you can‚Äôt unlock your plastic via Internet banking if the reason for freezing your account is three times the incorrect PIN code.  In such cases, you must personally come to the bank office. </p><p>  It will not be possible to liquidate the block even when you called yourself and for some reason asked the operator to block your account.  In this case, unlocking the ‚ÄúMagnet‚Äù card of ‚ÄúBelarusbank‚Äù is possible only after a repeated call to the bank.  The representative of the organization should hear from you the approval of the launch of the plastic bill. </p><div class="photo" data-original="probelbank.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone Unlock" class="if uuid-3195461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3195461.jpg"></div><h2>  How to unlock using mobile banking? </h2><p>  Mobile banking is another way to return your card to normal working condition.  To do this, you first need to download the appropriate mobile application of the bank, register in it, change the password and log in. </p><p>  At the next stage, enter your personal account, move the cursor to the icon of your card located on the main menu page.  For example, it will be a Velvet card of Belarusbank.  If your mobile banking account is tied to several plastic media, you need to click on the one you need. </p><p>  Next, go to the "Services" section and select the appropriate option.  In your case, this will be the ‚ÄúCard Lock‚Äù tab.  Go to the tab and select the ‚ÄúUnlock‚Äù command.  If the command is executed, a message will appear next to the card stating that it is active.  But in this case, the unlock service will also not work when ordering a lock on your behalf.  And also it will not work if the PIN code is entered incorrectly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="recard.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank card &quot;Magnet&quot;" class="if uuid-3195485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3195485.jpg"></div><h2>  How to remove a block from a card using SMS banking? </h2><p>  If mobile and Internet banking are not suitable for you, there remains one more option to unlock the card.  This is to use SMS banking.  So, how to unlock the Belarusbank card via SMS? </p><p>  SMS-banking allows you to manage a card account using SMS-informing.  For example, if you expressed a desire to block your card, for this it is worth sending a message with the word Block to the short number 611 with your password. </p><p>  To unlock the card after such a request, you must send an SMS with the code word Unblock and specify a five-digit password.  And do not forget to put a space after the code word.  After sending such a message, the previously frozen card will be unlocked within a few minutes. </p><h2>  Where can I connect SMS banking? </h2><p>  SMS banking connection is available upon personal appeal to a financial institution.  And also performed when accessing the services of the nearest infokiosk.  To register, select the option ‚ÄúConnection of services‚Äù.  Insert a card.  Enter your secret code.  Confirm.  Make a choice in favor of SMS banking and select the option ‚ÄúRegistration‚Äù. </p><p>  Next, study the instructions and the cooperation agreement with the bank, tick off your agreement with its policy.  Indicate your mobile operator and phone number.  Send the digit ‚Äú1‚Äù from your number to the number indicated by the bank. </p><p>  And finally, take the check with the password for your personal account.  Log in using SMS confirmation and log in as a new banking user.  Check your personal data, post a photo and attach the cards on which you want to track financial receipts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="epayinfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card Unlock, ATM" class="if uuid-3195472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/3195472.jpg"></div><h2>  Contacting the nearest bank branch </h2><p>  This is the most suitable option for those who do not like to work through the Internet or by phone.  To unlock the card you need to choose a bank branch suitable for you and come there with your passport. </p><p>  All that remains is to write a statement, answer operator questions to identify you as a card holder.  And if the operator no longer has any questions about you, in a few minutes the card will be unlocked.  Therefore, you can easily use it. </p><p>  In short, when blocking your bank card, there are many ways to get rid of this trouble. </p>
