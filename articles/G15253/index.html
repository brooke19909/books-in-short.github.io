    <h2>  The uniqueness of the park </h2><p>  Sochi-Park is unique first of all because the most dizzying modern attractions are based here on the historical heritage of our country, as well as on Russian legends and myths.  The park operates a single ticket system.  When you purchase it, you can go on an adventure with fairytale characters.  You can ride on any rides as much as you like. </p><p>  Today, Sochi Park has twenty new modern <span>attractions.</span>  <span>The slides,</span> which are breathtaking even for the most desperate extreme lovers, wonderful family attractions, carousels and playgrounds for children - all this is created in an amazing place for the entertainment of young and adult guests.  And now we offer you to get acquainted with some attractions in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Firebird" </h2><p>  In the "Enchanted Forest" guests will find an incredible flight up.  Today it is the highest free fall attraction in our country.  The height of the Firebird is 65 meters.  Seeing this huge structure, many begin to experience excitement. </p><p>  The essence of this attraction is that it throws you up with a powerful push.  Feeling is difficult to convey.  Top offers great views of the surroundings.  But you can not admire them for long: after a minute, the design drops sharply down. </p>

    <h2>  Hill "Serpent Gorynych" in "Sochi-Park" </h2><p>  On the top of a high mountain in the park lives the fire-breathing Serpent Gorynych.  An incredible road crosses his lair.  The length of the route is more than a thousand meters, the speed reaches one hundred and three kilometers per hour, and the height is thirty-eight meters. </p><p>  In November 2014, it replenished with a new, stunning Sochi-Park facility.  The “Serpent Gorynych” attraction is the highest and fastest <span>roller coaster</span> in our country <span>.</span>  It takes three seconds for the train to accelerate to 103 km / h on the track.  It passes slides, the height difference of which is more than 50 meters, in just 54 seconds, makes a dead loop and crosses the spiral section of the track, rotating around an inclined axis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many believe that after the "Firebird" this attraction is not at all scary.  But this belief evaporates after the attraction begins to move at great speed, spinning and turning over in the air. </p>

    <p>  Russian and foreign experts created Sochi-Park.  The “Serpent Gorynych” was designed and built by specialists of the well-known company MACK Rides, which is one of the leading manufacturers of attractions in the world and the owner of the theme “Europe Park” in Germany.  Other foreign specialists worked here. </p><p>  Today, many tourists visit the amusement park in Sochi.  “Snake Gorynych” can be visited by adults and children from ten years old and taller than 130 cm. For younger children, the park has many other interesting attractions. </p><p>  Russian filmmakers drew attention to Sochi Park.  “The Serpent of Gorynych” was shot in an episode of a feature film, which bears the working title of “Classmates”.  In this romantic comedy starring and already well-known actors are shot: Ekaterina Vilkova, Svetlana Khodchenkova, Olga Kuzmina, <span>Evgeny Kulik,</span> Danila Yakushev. </p><p>  If you visit Sochi-Park, the “Serpent Gorynych”, the photo of which is posted in the article, will amaze with its scale and speed, unless, of course, you decide to ride it. </p><h2>  "Quantum leap" </h2><p>  And this is perhaps the fastest and highest extreme slide in our country.  The train has a speed of up to one hundred and five kilometers per hour.  It is the sixth in the world and the only giant inverted boomerang in Europe.  First, the train goes back and rises upward along the vertical section.  This is followed by a suspension in limbo.  After a few seconds, the train abruptly breaks down and flies into a dead loop, making several “barrels”.  Feels like the attraction eclipses everything that Sochi Park is famous for.  The "Serpent Gorynych" next to him seems like a carousel for kids. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can arrive at the park by car or public transport.  There is bus number 124 from the railway station. You can get bus number 100 from Adler station. You need to get off at the Olympic Park stop.  You can take the “Swallow” electric train, which will take you to the same stop. </p><h2>  Mode of operation </h2><p>  In winter, the park operates only three days a week - from Friday to Sunday from 11:00 to 19:00.  From the end of March, the working hours are changing: the park is open at the same hours, but daily. </p><h2>  Cost of visiting </h2><p>  The cost of an adult ticket is 1900 rubles, a child ticket - 1615 rubles.  On birthday, admission is free.  Children under five years old and guests over seventy visit the park for free. </p><p>  In addition, discounts apply to visitors with disabilities, pensioners, large families and combatants - a ticket for them costs 500 rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Everyone who has already visited Sochi-Park believes that they will have enough impressions for a long time.  There are many great attractions for children and adults.  Many have opted for family (for example, "Geese-Swans" or "Buyan Island"), and the time that your children spend on the "Carousel of Fairy Tales" will turn into a fascinating journey, though accompanied by adults.  Negative reviews about the park are associated only with a very high ticket price. </p>
