Now this city of the Anatolian Riviera, very popular with tourists, is easily accessible.  From the airport, a bus will take you to Kemer in just an hour.  But did you know that until the sixties of the twentieth century, this city could only be reached by boat?  And when the sea was storming, Kemer’s communication with the rest of the world was interrupted.  Only in the 1970s, the D400 highway was built through the impregnable mountains.  This ensured the rapid growth of the resort city.  Already in the 90s, he, together with the surrounding villages, turned into a conglomeration of Kemer.  The resort's accessibility increased in 2010, when three tunnels were laid on the D400 road.  This reduced the accident rate of the track and reduced travel time.  Now Antalya and Kemer are separated by 42 kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Kemer" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1975714.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The resort is located at a latitude of 36 degrees north of the equator.  This location determines the subtropical Mediterranean climate.  It has very hot and dry summers and rainy winters.  But, despite the proximity to the lowland of Antalya, the area where Kemer is located has its own climatic features.  After all, the city from the north is surrounded by high Taurus mountains.  This leads to a decrease in total rainfall, especially in winter.  Summer here remains very hot.  In July, the air temperature reaches +40 degrees in the shade.  In winter, small night frosts are observed, but snowfalls are extremely rare.  The Mediterranean Sea in summer warms up to quite comfortable + 25-26 degrees.  In winter, the water temperature in the water area does not fall below +9 C. The sky above Kemer is mostly clear.  The only exception is the winter months, when heavy rain clouds hang over the coast.  The tourist season in the resort conglomerate Kemer lasts from early May to late October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Kemer in Turkey" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1975715.jpg" width="493"></div>

But the fishing village, which was destined to turn into a resort city, existed in antiquity.  In the ancient era and under the rule of Byzantium, it bore the Greek name Idrios.  When the Ottoman Empire took possession of Anatolia, the village became known in Turkish as Eskikoy, which means "Old Village".  Its inhabitants constantly suffered from mudflows coming down from the Taurus Mountains.  Huge streams of mud and water formed lakes and swamps around the village, resulting in outbreaks of malaria.  Only in 1910 the government began to build a wall that would save the village from mudflows.  This stone belt stretches along the mountain slopes for 23 kilometers.  It was then that the old village of Eskikoy turned into Kemer.  The Turkish word Kemer translates to "belt." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is the city of Kemer" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/1976719.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  The area where the city of Kemer is located in ancient times belonged to the province of Lycia.  Here the reign of Alexander the Great, as well as the Romans Mark Anthony, Hadrian and others, left traces.  In the city itself, you can also find ancient artifacts.  But there are much more of them in the vicinity of Kemer.  These are the ruins (well preserved) of such ancient cities as Olympos and Phaselis.  And in the city itself it is worth seeing the Uzur Kami Mosque on Dortyol Street.  The region where Kemer is located in Turkey is also rich in natural attractions.  What is only Mount Chimera, wherefrom, as if from the mouth of a dragon, sometimes flames burst out!  The longest cable car in Europe (over 4 kilometers) leads to the observation deck, located on the highest peak in southern Turkey - Tahtali (2365 m above sea level).  There are also Beldibi caves with rock paintings of the Stone Age, national natural parks, deserted bays and wild beaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  When asked about where the market is in Kemer, local passersby smile: everywhere.  The number of textile stores per square meter is simply huge.  But seriously, the best route for a shopaholic is Liman Boulevard.  The food market with the freshest vegetables and fruits is open on Mondays near the bus station, on Ataturk Boulevard.  On Tuesdays, the city center is filled with shopping stalls with bathrobes, towels, leather goods, national ceramics and even carpets.  The lion's share of tourists vacationing in Kemer comes from Russia.  Therefore, do not be afraid of the language barrier.  Many merchants know Russian well.  The lowest prices are on the market, which operates on Fridays west of the center, in the Aslabunchak district.  The choice of food and clothing there is not as huge as on the main thing.  But since tourists often do not know about the existence of a market in Aslabunchak, the prices there are “for their own”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is the market in Kemer" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1975720.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Even children know where Kemer is located, because in one of the city’s districts, the resort village of Tekirova, an ecopark is open.  Reptiles live there, including their rarest species.  Pythons, chameleons, crocodiles - this is all modern fauna.  What about seeing reptiles disappearing from the face of the earth millions of years ago?  This can be done in the Dinosaur Park, which is located in the Goynuk area.  In addition, Kemer has a small dolphinarium and a large water park "AquaWord". </p>
