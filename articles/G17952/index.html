This company has been around for twenty-five years.  However, the first direction of her activity was not the construction of buildings, but assistance in concluding real estate transactions.  Today the company calls itself "A101 Development".  The range of services provided by her includes the whole range of works from the development of an architectural project to its immediate implementation.  A101 Development has already successfully completed a number of housing complexes.  Among them are La Defense, Three Poplars, Smolenskaya Zastava, and Nadezhda.  Today the company does not slow down.  The Green Line housing complex was successfully commissioned, and work is underway on the construction of the residential complex ‚ÄúSpanish Quarters‚Äù and the residential complex <span>‚ÄúMoscow</span> 101‚Äù. </p><p>  For about two years, A101 has been part of the large Bin holding. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  About five years ago, significant territories (about one hundred and forty-eight thousand hectares), which were located southwest of the capital, were officially introduced into the city limits.  Now this area is called New Moscow.  Of course, these territories are actively being built up; a number of new residential quarters are being massively erected.  Including the Spanish Quarters.  LCDs of this type fit perfectly into the overall architecture of the new district.  The quarter under consideration will be located not far from Kaluga, Kievskoe shosse, near the village of Nikolo-Khovanskoe, 4 kilometers southwest of the MKAD.  In the neighborhood of two other major projects of the same developer (Green Line and Moscow 101), as well as the following townhouses: Vyazemskoye and Kronburg.  The territory of each of them will be closed.  The quarters will provide developed infrastructure, designed to fully satisfy all the needs of residents.  The maximum height home will be seventeen floors.  Townhouses will be created according to the designs of modern foreign suburbs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do real estate investors say about the Spanish Quarters residential complex?  Reviews show that the project is popular with potential customers.  Apartments are purchased regularly.  In general, future residents highlight a number of advantages and disadvantages of such a solution.  So, what will the purchased apartment in the residential complex ‚ÄúSpanish Quarters‚Äù mean for the shareholder? </p><p>  Pros: a developer with a good reputation;  excellent pace of construction of the building;  good environmental situation in the area;  the ability to choose an apartment with decoration or make repairs to your taste;  designed infrastructure inside the complex. </p><p>  Cons: not the most convenient traffic intersection;  high probability of environmental degradation due to active construction in the area;  insufficiently developed infrastructure near the residential complex "Spanish Quarters". </p><p>  Customer reviews express confidence in the developer and hope for timely arrival in the purchased apartments.  Time will tell whether it will be possible to complete the work on time. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Where is the residential complex "Spanish Quarters"?  It‚Äôs difficult to call the address familiar to us, since the area has just begun to be actively built up.  Construction is underway in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Nikolo-Khovanskoe, just four kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  This area is considered an incredibly good choice to start the construction of such a project.  Interest holders value proximity to the capital, which is especially important for those who need to get to their workplace daily. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The future residents are pleased with the location of the complex in relation to major highways.  Nikolo-Khovanskaya street will lead directly from the construction to the Kaluga highway.  To MKAD will have to drive less than four kilometers.  Five kilometers from the complex is located Kiev highway.  Therefore, the owners of personal vehicles will not have problems. </p>

    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  It will be much more difficult to get to the complex by public transport.  The nearest bus stops are ten minutes walk from the buildings, and the nearest metro stations Teply Stan and Salaryevskaya will have to drive five kilometers.  Perhaps the city authorities will decide to increase the number of buses and minibuses that run from this area to the center.  In 2019 and 2020, it is planned to open two new metro stations (Prokshino and Mamyri).  So, probably, after a few years the problems with using public transport will simply disappear. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Architects would like the new quarter to become completely independent, like a separate city.  Will this be the case with the residential complex "Spanish Quarters"?  Photos of the current construction and computer models of the designed objects demonstrate the active desire of the developer to implement this plan.  The infrastructure of the district promises to be developed and diverse.  All houses will form small quarters that are closed in cozy courtyards.  Between the groups of houses a spacious boulevard has been designed, which will be framed by shops, offices, restaurants and cafes.  A comprehensive school will be built for more than a thousand places, as well as two kindergartens equipped with everything necessary for the development of children. </p><p>  For many, parking is important.  The developer says: parking will be built.  It will be underground and will consist of several levels.  Thus, such a parking can accommodate about two and a half thousand cars.  Several buildings will be equipped with their own underground parking.  Overground parking was not designed. </p><p>  In addition, a pool, <span>tennis court,</span> fitness club, skating rink, bicycle, as well as jogging tracks, a number of sports grounds will be equipped for residents of the housing complex under consideration.  On its territory there will be a shopping and entertainment center, shops and, of course, a clinic. </p><p>  Landscaping will also be done by professionals.  The quarta will become pleasant and incredibly beautiful due to the numerous green spaces, flower beds, benches, cozy and safe playgrounds. </p>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Shareholders' opinions on how environmentally friendly the area is in which the construction of buildings under the Spanish Quarters (LCD) project continues.  Most of all future residents are worried about the neighborhood with the <span>Khovansky cemetery,</span> which at the moment is less than two kilometers from the complex in question.  In addition to being considered the largest in the entire region, it still continues to expand annually.  An integral part of it is the crematorium.  And about a year ago, the territory of the cemetery became a platform for the battle between several Asian groups.  Not without a shootout.  Interest holders are afraid of a repetition of the described events and hope that the cemetery will not be expanded in the direction of the residential complex "Spanish Quarters". </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  According to eyewitnesses, the construction of buildings is moving at a fairly brisk pace, which gives hope for the timely completion of the project.  The first phase should be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.  It implies the presence of seven buildings.  In mid-February, all construction work with the buildings was completed and the implementation of internal and external decoration of the residential complex "Spanish Quarters" continues.  Phase 2 will be completed in the third quarter of 2018.  It will consist of nine buildings.  Each is a business class level.  Their construction continues.  The third phase with the planned nine buildings will be completed in the first quarter of 2019. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost of real estate in the housing complex under consideration does not exceed the average price level for housing of a similar type in other residential buildings.  At the beginning of construction work, one square meter here cost seventy-one thousand five hundred rubles.  Thus, the minimum price of an apartment was one million nine hundred ninety nine thousand two hundred rubles.  Over time, the property of the complex has risen somewhat. </p><p>  There are several ways to pay for housing.  Among them: full prepayment;  installment plan;  mortgage.  Banks set their own payment terms, so they may vary slightly.  On average, the first installment should be at least twenty percent of the total, and the mortgage should not exceed twenty years. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Housing class "business" and "comfort", which offers the developer, will be the perfect solution for any family.  Differences between apartments in different buildings will be in a variety of layouts, different finishes, cost, ceiling height.  In the "business" -cases will also be built underground parking.  All houses will be equipped with luxurious halls, which will provide a concierge workplace, as well as modern comfortable elevators. </p><p>  The construction technology is monolithic.  Nevertheless, the pillars will not be the walls.  This means that the owners of the apartment will be able to create that layout there, which they like, without being attached to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan architect. </p><p>  Aerated concrete will become the main material of the exterior walls.  Its main characteristics: high thermal insulation, vapor permeability and ease of installation.  The disadvantages of the material include moisture capacity and sound permeability, however, their manifestation can be leveled by coating the surface with porcelain stoneware, clinker tiles, as well as textured plaster. </p><p>  Thus, the housing complex described above can become a really cozy home for you and your family.  Drop vibrations and anxieties! </p><p>  Make the right choice. </p>
