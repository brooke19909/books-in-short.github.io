It falls at the end of March and by 2014 will be celebrated on the 20th.  But the equinox is not only an astronomical phenomenon, but also an important period of the year in the culture of different peoples.  From ancient times, on this day, the onset of spring was celebrated. </p><p>  <strong>The vernal equinox: what is it?</strong> </p><p>  As already mentioned, the equinox is associated with the movement of the earth around its own axis and the sun.  On this day, the planet passes so that the sun's rays fall directly on the equator.  This is the point of the vernal equinox.  Interestingly, the sun is visible over the horizon for 12 hours and its rays are hidden for about the same time.  This means that <span>the equinox is</span> characterized by almost the same length of day and night. </p><p>  <strong>The vernal equinox and its traditions</strong> </p><p>  This day was of great importance for different nations.  Indeed, in those days when there was no calendar yet, it was the end of March that was considered the beginning of spring.  People believed that, starting from this moment, winter time loses its rights, the earth begins to come to life slowly, buds appear on trees, and in the sky you can see the first lightning and thunder. </p><p>  And to this day, residents of Mexico hold celebrations that are accompanied by ritual dances and prayers. </p><p>  But each nation has its own traditions, according to which it is necessary to celebrate the arrival of spring.  And one of such holidays is the well-known Maslenitsa.  Yes, Shrovetide is now celebrated at a different time of the year due to Christian fasting.  But the original date coincided with <span>the spring equinox.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Originally Pancake week was the <span>god of fertility</span> and the outgoing winter.  <span>The ancient Slavs</span> prepared very carefully for this period of the year, because this day marked the departure of the winter season and the new birth of the solar god Yaril.  Of course, bonfires that helped the deity gain strength were an integral attribute of the holiday.  In some villages, it was even customary to set fire to the wheels and roll them along the roads - this symbolized a burning solar disk. </p><p>  In addition, it was customary to create a scarecrow of straw.  He was tied up in women's clothing, and a frying pan was attached to his hand.  And during the triumph of such Shrovetide was revered as songs, carried around from house to house, sleigh rides.  And by the end of the holiday, the scarecrow was either burned or buried in the ground - winter was gone. </p><p>  <strong>Vernal equinox in japan</strong> </p><p>  This day is celebrated in Japan, but here it has a completely different meaning.  The celebration is timed to the ancient Buddhist tradition of Higan. </p><p>  Holidays begin a little earlier than the vernal equinox - about three days before its onset and last three more days after.  For the inhabitants of the country, this is a very important time of the year when everyone goes to bow and pray at the grave of their ancestors. </p><p>  Of great importance here is the preparation.  Women carefully clean their homes.  It is also necessary to put things in order in the tomb of relatives or on their graves.  And on March 20-21, family members visit deceased relatives, perform the necessary rituals, and visit temples. </p><p>  Another important tradition is a gala dinner.  But on the table should be only vegetarian dishes, according to ancient Buddhist laws. </p><p>  <strong>The vernal equinox and its significance for Christianity</strong> </p><p>  Of course, such a holiday has pagan roots.  But this day was the starting point for the celebration of Easter.  Such a law was adopted back in 325 at the <span>Council of Nicaea,</span> when Christian countries adopted the <span>Julian calendar.</span>  And Shrovetide remains an important holiday, despite some discrepancy in time. </p><p>  And although it is not customary for us to celebrate this day, the beginning of spring is felt in everything.  This is a wonderful day when you can forget about the dark, cold and long evenings of winter and begin to revive life with nature. </p>
