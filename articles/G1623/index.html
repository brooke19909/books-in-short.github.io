    <p>  It was formed several millennia ago on the site of the sea bay, which in the process of natural changes was separated from the main part of the sea by a sand embankment, the width of which is about 300 meters.  Therefore, we can confidently say that this is a lake of estuary type. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In hot summer weather, a large evaporation of moisture occurs, but the replenishment of water from salty springs, due to precipitation and the crime of sea water through the sand, does not allow it to completely dry out.  The water level in the estuary is almost 30 centimeters below the sea. </p><h2>  Historical knowledge </h2><p>  Local residents tell myths that in ancient times Moynak Lake hosted the famous Hercules on its beaches, as evidenced by the exhibits stored in one of the historical museums of Yevpatoriya.  A few millennia ago, the ancient Greeks lived here.  Then in this area there were impassable forests and swamps with high thickets of reeds. </p><p>  Even in antiquity, the lake in the Crimea became famous for its unique healing properties. </p><p>  In the 18th century a tribe of nomads settled here, who called themselves Moynak.  It was from there that the name of this estuary went.  The doctors of those times, having studied the therapeutic effect of mud, already then used it for recreational purposes. </p><p>  In our time, all the ancient knowledge about the healing properties of silt has gone far into history, so first they were engaged in the extraction of salt on the lake.  One of the watchmen decided to improve his health by smearing himself with mud.  The result was just a grand discovery, fame spread very quickly throughout the country. </p><p>  Only then did one of the owners of the salt industry decide to retrain his business and build a hospital on the lake.  There were no conditions there, everything was simple and primitive, but the desire of wealthy people to recover, rejuvenate and heal takes precedence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The first boarding houses </h2><p>  And only in 1886 Moinak Lake was ennobled by the construction of a high-level dispensary.  Here, all the benefits of civilization for recreation were created: the division into male and female buildings, comfortable rooms. Prices are more than affordable, therefore not only wealthy people, but also simple workers sought here.  Also, one of the most famous people in the world, strongman Ivan Poddubny, came to Moinak Lake to improve his well-being. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the health resort received significant damage and large stocks of therapeutic mud were removed.  After the end of hostilities, the government very responsibly approached the restoration of mud baths.  And nowadays, you can use the unique healing method for free. </p>

    <h2>  Therapeutic mud </h2><p>  The estuary has a rocky bottom, which is completely enveloped in muddy mud, the thickness of the formed layer up to 80 centimeters.  The dirt is not very pleasant in appearance and is a viscous oily mass of dark blue or black color with a very specific smell - hydrogen sulfide. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But, despite this, its useful properties are very large.  Over the years, as a result of complex chemical and biological processes, a unique composition has been formed. </p><p>  Moinaki Lake is very famous due to the unique composition of its mud.  In addition to the healing salts and microelements present in it, it also has radioactivity.  It also increases the protective functions of the body to various diseases and contains bactericidal and anti-inflammatory functions. </p><p>  It is worth noting that under the upper black layer there is a silt of blue color, which is used more for cosmetic purposes.  It is very difficult to get it, since water does not allow you to dive, pushing it to the surface. </p>
