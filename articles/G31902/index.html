The recreation center "Emerald Lake" in Toksovo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  20 kilometers from Kazan is the Emerald Lake - one of the most beloved and frequently visited places for residents of the city.  The water here is clear, the bottom is sandy.  Dense coniferous forests grow along the coastline, pines prevail, and only in some places closer to the water can lonely deciduous trees be found. </p><h2>  Hydronym </h2><p>  The second name of the lake (often used by local people) is Quarry.  Its origin is not accidental.  After all, the Emerald Lake, a photo of which can be seen in the article, was created artificially on the site of a former sand pit.  When the extraction of sand in it stopped, water came to the surface.  This happened as a result of the rise of the lower waters of the Volga, and in an anthropogenic place an amazing natural attraction formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emerald lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1121321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the lake </h2><p>  Near the quarry is the village of Yudino, and the lake itself is surrounded on all sides by a pine forest.  Therefore, these places are quite lively, both in summer and in winter.  The quarry itself has existed here for a long time, but water began to arrive about 25 years ago.  So the Emerald Lake is a young reservoir. </p><p>  There are many lakes in the vicinity of Kazan, but this is the most popular.  This is facilitated by a well-developed infrastructure near the reservoir.  And the name speaks for itself: the water in the lake is so clean and cool that it really resembles an emerald.  Add here the air, saturated with coniferous aromas, and we get a great place to relax and improve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, you should be careful while swimming.  The quarry is quite large, not only in width, but also in depth.  There are hollows that are 10 meters away from the water level. There are also places where the depth increases sharply to 4-5 meters! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emerald lake photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1121322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the Emerald? </h2><p>  Emerald Lake is located outside the city, away from dust and city bustle.  Getting to it is easy, there are several ways.  Buses go from Kazan to the Yudino village (flights 46, 72).  It is also possible to take an electric train or <span>train for the Children's Railway.</span>  This journey is especially interesting as the paths pass through the forest.  By personal transport, getting to the lake is not a problem at all.  A road has been paved here, so drivers can not be afraid for their "iron horses."  Paid parking is also organized near the lake, which allows you to completely relax and not worry about the car. </p><h2>  Emerald Lake in Toksovo </h2><p>  Very many, having heard the story of Lake Emerald, represent a recreation center located in the Leningrad Region in Toksovo.  There really is a pond of the same name.  The water in it is a beautiful emerald color.  A cultural recreation center is organized around the lake, where they are happy to provide a wide range of entertainment for both children and adults. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Varied summer holidays </h2><p>  Currently, on the territory of the quarry in Yudino, guest houses of economy and business class have been built, a clean wide sandy beach has been equipped.  There are so many entertainments that they are ready to satisfy the needs of any vacationer.  This place is ideal for families: a summer water park, attractions for children, a tennis court, beach volleyball, bungee, cafes and restaurants, parties and open-air discos. </p><p>  Recently, a diving center is also gaining popularity.  The emerald lake is very poor for representatives of the animal and plant world.  At a depth, only crayfish and fish can be seen.  But this lake is ideal for beginners.  It beckons with its crystal clear water.  Diving into the depths without special equipment is prohibited - a lot of pressure.  Diving is carried out all year round.  Specialists of the center will help and train newcomers.  It is possible to rent a suit and other equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emerald Lake in Toksovo" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1121329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What awaits vacationers all year round? </h2><p>  Although the Emerald Lake is most popular in the summer, there is something to do there at other times of the year.  Near the quarry, an artificial slope for climbers is equipped, and paintball games are held in a pine forest. </p><p>  In winter, there is a skating rink, you can go snowboarding.  There is a special snowmobile trail.  For the last couple of years, festivals and motocrosses have been held at this place. </p>
