  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We knit a cardigan-cocoon with our own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The fashion industry offers us many interesting and original things that are so simple that they are accessible even to beginners.  In the material presented below, we study the technology for making a cardigan-cocoon.  The reader can choose the tool by himself.  Our master class is universal and will help to fulfill the idea using both knitting needles and a hook. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  To create a truly beautiful product, you need to work hard at the preparatory stage.  Start by choosing a pattern.  In this case, each needlewoman can rely on her own taste.  The main thing is to compare the rapport of the selected pattern with the calculations, the technology of which we will study a little later.  And it is also worth considering that for knitting patterned cardigan-cocoons, you should choose plain yarn.  In this case, it can be pastel shades or saturated acid. </p><p>  If, however, a person who is just beginning to get acquainted with the basics of knitting is going to associate the studied product, it is more reasonable to focus on the unusual yarn.  For example, patchwork, motley, gradient and others.  In this case, it is permissible to alternate the front and back rows or to knit on both sides only with front loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fitnessalert.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan cocoon" class="if uuid-3024658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3024658.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of model measurement </h2><p>  Cardigan-cocoon, of course, refers to products called oversize.  But despite this, knitting it, as they say, at random, is completely unreasonable.  Therefore, further we will find out what parameters are required in order to produce a product that will fit the figure exactly.  There are only two of them: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  product width - from the base of the neck to the proposed lower edge; </li><li>  product length - from the intended end of one sleeve to the other (hands spread apart parallel to the floor). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="pretty-ideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted cardigan" class="if uuid-3024662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3024662.jpg"></div><h2>  Loop and row calculation technology </h2><p>  Regardless of whether crochet or knitting a cardigan-cocoon will be performed, the previous mathematical calculations will be identical.  But first you need to prepare a square sample of the selected pattern.  For knitting the studied product, a fragment of 10x10 centimeters is enough. </p><p>  We prepare it, count the number of loops and rows, and then divide by 10. As a result, we find out how many necessary units fit in one centimeter.  Now divide the product width by the number of loops, and the length by rows.  Two new values ‚Äã‚Äãare written.  After all, they will help us to knit the coveted wardrobe item, which will definitely fit the figure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crochet-ideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted cardigan" class="if uuid-3024663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3024663.jpg"></div><h2>  We knit a cocoon cardigan as described </h2><p>  With knitting or crochet, the intended product will be made, not so important.  If desired, you can combine the work of two tools.  For example, knitting the cuffs and collar with knitting needles, and the main part - crochet.  In any case, the technology implies the following actions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  We collect the number of loops equal to the width of the product. </li><li>  We knit a flat cloth, without making increases and decreases. </li><li>  When we reach the intended length, close the loop. </li><li>  We outline the width of the cuff in the middle of the smaller side. </li><li>  We take a needle with a thread and sew the fabric along the lines shown in the diagram in green. </li><li>  If desired, this can be completed.  Or add a cardigan with cuffs and a collar. </li><li>  To do this, prepare the hook and pick up new loops in the necessary zones.  If we continue to use knitting needles.  Or immediately crochet cuffs of the desired length. </li><li>  In the same way we make out the gate.  But in this case, we move not in a circle, but back and forth. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan cocoon scheme" class="if uuid-3024661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3024661.jpg"></div><h2>  Cardigan from bottom to top </h2><p>  To tie this version of the cardigan-cocoon with a crochet or knitting needles, you should perform several other manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Multiply the number of loops in one centimeter by the length of the product, and the number of rows in one centimeter by the width. </li><li>  We collect the calculated loops. </li><li>  And we knit without increases and decreases the fabric of the desired length. </li><li>  Then we collect it in the same way as described in the previous paragraph. </li><li>  However, it is important to note that if desired, the reader can make a two-color cardigan.  To do this, tie the product to half, and then switch to a different thread color. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, the principle of operation is quite simple and quite accessible even for beginners.  Although this does not mean at all that the finished product will turn out simple or uninteresting.  Experienced needlewomen advise to ‚Äúrevive‚Äù it with a combination of unusual yarn and a simple pattern, or a monochrome knitting thread and a complex pattern.  In any case, the work will be creative and very exciting.  Therefore, we recommend that the reader connect their imagination. </p>
