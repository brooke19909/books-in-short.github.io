Everything can be handled with the help of improvised tools that are almost always available.  If you feel the awakened talent in yourself, and are ready to prove yourself a sculptor, then you will need the following materials: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Sculptural gypsum.  This strong enough material is great for creating shapes.  It can be purchased at specialized stores. </li><li>  Water.  The most common, from the tap. </li><li>  Plasticine for modeling.  You can use both a special and a children's product. </li><li>  Foil (the usual one is suitable for food). </li></ol><p>  In addition to the above consumables, to create DIY crafts from gypsum, you will need to stock up on the necessary tools.  You will need: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a container for mixing gypsum and water; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a sharp clerical or ordinary kitchen knife; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ brush for painting (from hard bristles, medium size); </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ smooth smooth board; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a flat small spatula made of wood or metal. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The first steps in creating gypsum products </h2><p>  Having prepared everything you need for sculpting, you can go directly to the process itself, at the end of which gypsum crafts will decorate your home.

Using a thin knife, along the whole figure you need to outline the connector line.  Next, along the intended line, gently push small pieces of foil.  Naturally, they must be dense.  Due to the foil it will be possible to prevent the adhesion of gypsum.  After the solidification of the figure, the foil can be removed without applying much effort.

In this case, it is necessary to gently stir the mixture until it reaches the state of fluid pastry for pancakes or thin sour cream.  Only from such a mass can you create crafts with your own hands from gypsum, which will delight you with their beauty and durability. </p><p>  Using a small brush, gypsum is applied to the plasticine figure, layer by layer.  After the first layer has hardened, the next one is applied over it, then one more and one more. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Final stage </h2>

    <p>  The number of layers that you need to apply in the process of creating DIY crafts from gypsum depends on what strength you want to give the product.  After applying the last layer, you will need to leave the figure for a while, until it finally hardens.  This can take about thirty minutes.  After this time, it is necessary to remove all unnecessary from the figure and again postpone the work until it finally dries.  After that, it will be possible to remove its plaster form from the plasticine base. </p><p>  Ready-made, well-dried gypsum crafts emit a slight ringing when tapped.  Figures can be decorated or left in their original form.  In this case, it all depends on your imagination and creativity. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY plaster crafts" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/349016.jpg?1394147383282" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Create and enjoy! </h2><p>  DIY gypsum crafts, as a rule, are much more interesting and original than the standard ones purchased in the store.  In addition, they can be made by the whole family, when everyone is able to add something of their own - unique, inimitable and unexpected.  We hope that your gypsum crafts, the master class on the creation of which was given above, will become a worthy decoration of the interior and will take their rightful place among other products created with their own hands. </p><p>  In the end, I would like to wish you good luck in this creative and interesting process, we hope it will bring a lot of pleasure and give you a good mood. </p>
