    <h2>  Start </h2><p>  Born in 1947 in the outback of the Kursk region, Zhukov from childhood loved history lessons.  However, he treated the rest of the subjects with full attention, which allowed him to finish school with a gold medal, and Voronezh University with honors.  In addition to history, the diploma noted the German language, which was also allowed to be taught, which was Vasily Ivanovich Zhukov, and since 1970 he studied at school No. 64 in the city of Voronezh.  After some time, he was already an assistant at the department of the Polytechnic Institute. </p><p>  This was followed by service in the air defense of the Soviet Army and graduate school at his native university, followed by teaching at the Voronezh Polytechnic.  In 1985, the second, doctoral, dissertation was defended on the topic of modern historiography, which made it possible to become a professor at the Department of History of the CPSU of the Polytechnic Institute.  Further career quickly went up.  Two years later, Vasily Ivanovich Zhukov was appointed head of the Higher Party School (VPSh) department in Moscow, which in 1991 was transformed by Zhukov‚Äôs efforts into the Russian State Social University, where he was awaited by a long rector. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Credo </h2><p>  The Russian State Social University was devoted to a great extent to historical education, and the blackening of the Soviet past that took place in those years, but did not stop even now, painfully wounded the rector of the former Higher School of Economics.  In 2010, a conference was held at which Zhukov said that the rehabilitation of the Soviet historical period was simply necessary. </p><p>  Naturally, modern "young historians" vehemently objected, including Igor Kurlyandsky and Nikita Petrov, because now it will be difficult to falsify archival documents that incriminate Soviet authorities in terrible crimes, despite the free media outlets with these materials.  The Russian State Social University has come to know the real war on its territory. </p>

    <h2>  The evidence </h2><p>  The public immediately learned that Zhukov was prohibitively rich.  Among the rectors, anyway.  The figures for his huge salary were given: every month he received as much as 579,400 rubles at the university box office.  It‚Äôs ridiculous.  In the same 2011, a good programmer - not an academician, not a professor, not a rector, in general no one could call, for a month was quite capable of earning such an amount. </p><p>  You can compare this salary with the needs of any provincial regional administration.  In Vladimir, for example, brushes and toilet paper were ordered more expensive than the monthly salary of the rector of the RSSU.  But many were still convinced of Zhukov‚Äôs criminal wrong.  And the rest elected him a member of the Public Chamber of the Central Federal District of Moscow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Zhukov‚Äôs whole life was a contribution to scientific and pedagogical work, to the training of highly qualified specialists.  At different times, academician Zhukov Vasily Ivanovich was awarded.  These are two orders of Merit for the Fatherland, and the Order of Prince Daniel of Moscow for strengthening the moral foundation in the education of modern youth. </p><p>  The Soviet and Russian scientist, a member of the Presidium of the Higher Attestation Commission of the Russian Federation, Vice-President of the Russian Academy of <span>Social Sciences</span> (Academy of <span>Social Sciences)</span> and the National Committee "Russian Family", conducted in addition to this enormous public activity. </p>

    <h2>  The science </h2><p>  So far, the Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation has made more than five hundred scientific publications.  The main directions of his research were all the same sociology and social history of education in Russia, many topics explored the theory and organization of political activity. </p><p>  As the <span>plenipotentiary of the President of the</span> Russian Federation among the Central Administrative District of Moscow, he headed the Russian Academy of Social Education, worked to strengthen Russian-Chinese friendship as the chairman of this society, and sat on the presidium of the chess federation.  But the most important thing is to solve the issues of education at scientific councils under the head of the presidential administration.  In addition, the list of public duties that Zhukov Vasily Ivanovich performed here is far from complete. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Almost all close relatives of the academician are close to him in lifestyle.  His wife, Galina Sevostyanovna, also graduated with honors from the University of Voronezh in 1974.  Applied mathematics, please note.  The fact that in Soviet times a <span>diploma</span> and insufficient knowledge are incompatible things, everyone now knows.  In 1979, she defended her first dissertation, in 1991 - the second, doctoral.  Mathematics.  But no, these postulates are also called into question.  And these are just those who studied much later, when Russian education ceased to be truly higher, because they received it not for free and by competition, but for money. </p>

    <p>  Due to the struggle for the quality of knowledge received by young people, which her husband was leading, Galina Sevostyanovna had to go through quite a few unpleasant minutes.  Their two daughters also went to science.  Learned and repeatedly defended themselves.  And at the same young age as their parents.  And then their academic ranks were stripped.  For plagiarism.  It‚Äôs interesting, is it possible today, as well as thirty or even fifty years ago, to find at least one dissertation in which there are no borrowings?  But it was necessary to detect plagiarism in them.  And found, of course.  And that's why. </p><h2>  VPSh </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, V.I. Zhukov, among several young (up to forty years old) scientists, was sent from Voronezh to Moscow to step under the arches of the Higher Party School.  Anticipating the collapse of a great country, the teacher in February 1991 turned to the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR with proposals to create a special center on the basis of the Higher School of Economics, where they would train highly professional workers for the social sphere. </p><p>  Moreover, he had already developed curricula and programs for social work, social psychology, social pedagogy, social ecology, which highlighted the problems of politics and economics and gave examples of comparative historical sociology.  They met him, and already in April 1991, Vasily Ivanovich Zhukov, whose biography was adorned with the creation of a new university, began to serve as vice-rector of the Russian Higher School of Economics, raising the former MPS to the level of the most prestigious and progressive universities.  But the piece was too tasty to leave everything as it is. </p><h2>  Wealthy heirs </h2><p>  But in August 1991 the coup struck, the country ceased to exist, breaking up into a number of independent, but very small, with the exception of the Russian Federation, and weak republics, including the Russian Federation.  RSPI was liquidated to create three new universities at once, but the university did not provide for a sociological direction. </p><p>  The former Higher School of Internal Affairs broke up at the Russian State University for the Humanities (with two main educational buildings, five dormitories, a postgraduate house, two residential buildings, all vehicles, a treasury, a library and much more), Moscow State Law Academy (with correspondence department rooms and hostels along Sadovaya-Kudrinskaya Street) and fill in the carcass!) Soviet-American University, which took over the buildings on Leningradsky Prospekt, the hostel and restaurant on Skakova, the unfinished house and near dachas with land plots of the Central Committee of the CPSU, and much, much more. </p>

    <h2>  Poor relatives </h2><p>  Five hundred eighty-six full-time students, sixty graduate students, one hundred and fifty-four teachers were simply thrown out into the street.  Documents of sociologists were placed in garbage cans and for the most part destroyed.  What was the way out of the situation so ugly?  Sociologists could only fight for the right to start all over again. </p><p>  Here again, the future rector, founder of the Russian State Social University, Professor Zhukov, discovered his remarkable organizational abilities, and he represented the interests of students and teachers in the struggle for the right to receive the desired education and work in the specialty chosen with all my heart.  The fight was hard.  With pickets, demonstrations, rallies, appeals to the government, courts and the media.  There were even hunger strikes.  And finally, the case was crowned with success. </p><h2>  October, for the RSSU - the great </h2><p>  Politicians Khazbulatov, Vilchik, Lakhova and some others showed responsibility and foresight, having contributed to the adoption of government decisions, and on October 14, 1991 Zhukov opened the RSSU!  As a rector.  It is not even a matter of personal and public victory over the arbitrariness of this difficult time.  Russia began its renewal; it clearly needed representatives of a social profile who had received an appropriate education. </p><p>  Although harmony in the relationship between government and society has not yet been present even in the sweetest dreams. <em> </em>  It should be noted that Zhukov was elected to the post of rector, and not appointed.  And - four times.  And - more importantly - unanimously!  Only in 2012, after the sixty-fifth anniversary, he left for the post of honorary president of the Russian State Social University.  But it should be remembered that after ten years the university under his leadership became one of the most attractive and prestigious universities in the country. </p>

    <h2>  results </h2><p>  Fourteen of the fifteen indicators received the highest rating from the commission that conducted a comprehensive audit of the university - is this not an indicator of the rector‚Äôs excellent work?  And his youngest daughter - Galina Vasilievna, one of the youngest doctors of science in the country - came up with and worked out a model of student self-government, which became the best in Russia and was accepted by many other universities. </p><p>  The work of Academician Zhukov was highly appreciated.  "The rector-founder of the RSSU" - became the lifetime title, which was awarded to him by the Minister of Labor of the Russian Federation, Pochinok.  But most importantly, the university, headed by the founding rector, quickly became the flagship of national education.  Thousands of excellent specialists and first-class scientists have come out of its walls, new scientific schools have been created, a methodological base that meets all modern requirements, hundreds of manuals and textbooks have been published that have no analogues in the world. </p><h2>  Education height </h2><p>  For several years, a powerful faculty was formed at this university, capable of preparing specialists with both secondary and higher education.  More than three hundred thousand of them now work in social institutions, in employment and labor agencies, in pension and social insurance. </p><p>  Graduates of the RSSU became both federal ministers and their deputies, heads of social services in the regions, prominent scientists, and teachers.  Talented youth from all over the country flocked to this university.  Alexander Povetkin and <span>Ekaterina Gamova,</span> Olga Kapranova and Roman Shirokov, Sergey Karjakin and Valentina Gunina and many more voiced names among graduates of the Russian State Social University.  Nine Olympic champions, five Paralympic champions, seventy-two world champions among students of this university promoted the right way of life.  Since 1994, the university has not smoked at all! </p><h2>  Personality </h2><p>  The RSSU is grateful to Academician Zhukov not only for its creation, formation and development.  First of all, the honorary rector is a researcher and scientist, and the scope of his scientific interests is impressive.  This is social history, and migration, and population, and historical comparative studies, and demographic processes, and the management of social processes using the methodology of mathematical modeling, and social statistics, and ethnosociology, and political processes and institutions, economics, sociology, history in all of it. hypostases, the policy of educational processes. </p><p>  His works were published in many languages: in addition to everyday German, English and French, Zhukov is also read in Chinese, Korean, Serbian, Bulgarian and many others.  The university is proud of this, and students and post-graduate students strive for this - to socially useful activities as much as possible.  But they did not save.  The RSSU, as noted above, is a tidbit.  And for the control over it, many see the point in fighting ‚Äî even against all sorts of rules.  Recently, academician Zhukov was attacked: he was almost killed with baseball bats.  Two years in hospitals and disability.  But the academician continues <span>scientific work</span> even in this state. </p>

    <h2>  Public opinion </h2><p>  The reasons for the brutal beating of the academician seem to many to be very simple.  His eldest daughter was dismissed from the RSSU, and in her place the widow of Minister Pochinka now works.  Attempts to recover through the court led to telephone threats and even their partial implementation.  Vasily Ivanovich is sure that the purpose of those who attacked him was precisely his death.  Sambo knowledge and the Wasp gun helped.  What will happen next - time will tell. </p>
