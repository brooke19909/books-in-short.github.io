    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The resort infrastructure of the town of Mahmutlar is built along a single highway.  These are small economy hotels.  In addition to them, on this street, as well as on two or three perpendicular, there are shops, cafes, restaurants. </p><p>  Small hotels have a special charm.  The guest is immediately remembered and treated with caution.  The hotel is clean, there are basic basic amenities, the chef of the restaurant prepares well, the staff is polite and good-natured.  The Gold Twins Suite <span>Hotel has been hosting</span> tourists since 2005, but thanks to renovations and repairs carried out in 2012, it has become more attractive to tourists. </p><p>  The hotel area is small but neat, with its own adult and children's pools and its own lined garden. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  Two 6-story buildings of this small hotel complex accommodate 63 rooms. </p><p>  The guest rooms of the hotel complex are spacious and offer sea views.  There is a spacious and comfortable balcony.  There is serviceable and unworn furniture.  Air conditioning, minibar.  Is there a safe in the room.  However, there are no televisions, as it is written on the website of travel agencies, in the rooms.  But one big one is in the lobby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gold twins suite hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1109058.jpg" width="600"></div>

They clean cleanly, you can not leave a tip. </p><p>  Wi - Fi only works near the reception. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Dining at the Gold Twins Suite Hotel 3 * is organized in two options: boarding and half board.  Mostly Turkish dishes are prepared.  And this is not surprising, because the contingent of vacationers in the hotel complex is 30% Turkish, 70% Russian.  Vacationers should discard the Napoleonic complex and just enjoy the specific, but tasty food.  Pleasantly surprised by the presence on the menu of Gold Twins Suite Hotel 3 a whole assortment of cheeses, a variety of vegetable dishes.  In addition, the local coffee is just wonderful. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel beach is very close, however, to get to it, you must cross the road.  This is quite convenient to do, since an underpass is equipped under the highway. </p><p>  You should get used to the beach of Gold Twins Suite Hotel 3 *.  A loose sand strip 100 meters long with sun loungers and umbrellas is quite good.  However, the pebble bottom is inconvenient for small children.  Although for adult swimmers who wish to swim, such a bottom is uncritical. </p><p>  To solve this problem in principle, we recommend that guests of the Gold Twins Suite Hotel 3 * have stocked slippers in advance. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel infrastructure is developed at the level of a four-star hotel.  The reception is open 24 hours a day.  Services are paid, including, and payment cards.  There is a currency exchange. </p><p>  The hotel is convenient for active tourists.  There is a car rental nearby.  Moreover, the resulting car can be put free of charge on a guarded parking lot of the hotel.  The hotel has a laundry, dry cleaning, ironing service is available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gold twins suite hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1109051.jpg" width="600"></div>

Massage.  Also operates a beauty salon at Gold Twins Suite Hotel 3 *.  Guest reviews contain a recommendation: on the first day after arrival, visit the hammam and buy a massage.  In this case, the pores of the skin are cleaned, and it becomes ready for maximum interaction with the healing spa climate.  However, after such a procedure, a beach vacation should be postponed for a day until the skin adapts. </p><p>  The hotel also has a mini club with its own children's infrastructure: a playground for games and a swimming pool.  While the children are being looked after, parents have the opportunity to visit a hammam or enjoy a massage. </p><p>  In addition to children's animation, in the evenings there is an adult: either a Turkish night, then a fire show, or a disco. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  A Mahmutlar Antalya bus stops in front of the hotel.  Many guests, having breakfast, use its services.  In Antalya itself, they carry out shopping.  Most often on the famous Ataturk shopping street, where there are hundreds of leather, souvenir and jewelry shops and shops.  However, here you must be able to bargain. </p><p>  Traders will invite you to their store, show respect in every possible way, like a distinguished guest, talk about fabulous discounts ... But all this is a performance.  They will in fact call the price at least twice as high. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gold twins suite hotel 3 alanya turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1109047.jpg" width="600"></div>  A competent buyer, knowing the real supply and demand, will knock down the price of a terry dressing gown from $ 30 to $ 10, and a women's jacket from $ 500 to $ 300.  The merchant, upon hearing your offer, ‚Äúwill be very sad‚Äù, he will start calling the director (in fact, the same seller will approach you).  Together they will ask you to increase the price.  However, knowing the conjuncture, you should not give in anyway.  However, in eastern trade there is a nuance.  Once you name your price, you should pay it.

    <p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists who do not know how to bargain, they shop in Antalya supermarkets with fixed prices.  Such trading giants are ‚ÄúAntalium‚Äù and ‚ÄúMetro‚Äù. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Most hotel guests buy excursions at the tour desk located next to the hotel.  Turkey (in ancient times - <span>Asia Minor)</span> is rich in historical monuments and unique natural sites.  Traditionally, tourists tend to swim in the healing mineral natural baths with the springs of Pammukale, see the unique city carved in the rocks - Cappadocia, take pictures in the once formidable Seljuk fortress Kyzyl Kul.  Christian tourists traditionally buy an excursion along the Demre - Mira - Kekova route.  And those who want to admire the amazing beauty of the underwater world tend to get into the Dalmatash grotto. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Really sound economy-rest is provided by Gold Twins Suite Hotel 3 *.  The reviews of its guests indicate the ideal price / quality ratio of the tour they bought.  The healing Mediterranean Sea, the therapeutic effect of the resort climate, good nutrition, friendliness and helpfulness of the staff contribute to the restoration of the strength and health of the guests of the hotel complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel gold twins suite hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1109041.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the hotel has created conditions for children to relax.  In a word, the hotel complex considered by us clearly has a service level of 3+. </p>
