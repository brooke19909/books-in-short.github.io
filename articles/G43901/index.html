    <h2>  DIY knitting hats </h2><p>  There are several conditions by which a novice needlewoman will be sure that she will be able to knit a female hat.  After reviewing the description in our article, you can easily get a fashionable new thing.  But remember that the following steps must be completed: </p><ol><li>  According to individual preferences, you should choose yarn and tools for it.  For knitting hats for the winter, it is better to choose yarn with a 100% wool composition.  They will be warm, comfortable and convenient.  The thread and tools should be selected so that the thickness of the thread is 2 times less than the thickness of the spokes.  Most often, the yarn indicates the number of knitting needles that should be used. </li><li>  From a wide variety we choose a suitable pattern.  Beginner knitters can use simple patterns that consist only of the back and front loops.  Simple women's hats made of face or garter stitch look attractively. </li><li>  We knit a sample of 10 x 10. Measure it with a ruler, write down the parameters.  Now the sample must be washed and dried on a horizontal surface on a towel.  Then it should also be measured and compared with the previous parameters.  This way we know if the yarn is stretched after washing or not. </li><li>  We carry out the calculations.  You need to know how many loops and rows are 10 cm. These data will help to correctly calculate the required number of loops and rows for a future product.  Head circumference should be measured in advance. </li></ol><h2>  Knitting fashion hat </h2><p>  This season, caps made of mohair are especially popular.  They are very similar to the models that were popular in the 60s.  And most importantly - they are warm and fluffy.  In addition, these caps are ideal for winter wear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The pattern that is used is quite simple.  Is it possible to knit a women's <span>hat</span> with <span>knitting needles</span> with a description of the pattern shown in the photo?  Of course, yes, and it is very simple.  The pattern is called patent gum.  It is characterized by increased elasticity, so it must be knitted more tightly than ordinary gum.  Many needlewomen the name of this pattern is also known as "English gum", which has several varieties.  Its peculiarity is that it looks the same on both sides (with the wrong side and the front) and is voluminous. </p><p>  Many beginner needlewomen worry that they will not succeed.  But experienced craftswomen know that you just need to pick up the knitting needles and start knitting.  So, knitting a female hat with the description that we proposed above will be completely uncomplicated. </p><h2>  Yarn </h2><p>  Particular attention should be paid to yarn.  After all, the quality of a headdress made of mohair directly depends on the thread.  It must be of high quality in the first place.  Better to choose kid mohair.  This thread does not prick, ideal for children.  The description uses yarn with a content of 60% acrylic and 40% mohair, in 100 grams of 500 meters.  Knitting hats occurs in two addition with knitting needles No. 5.  It is better to knit a product with circular knitting needles, or hosiery.  There will be no seams in such a hat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Model description </h2><p>  Let's look at an example of how to knit a women's hat.  With the description of the circuit, you can quickly remember the sequence of loops in this pattern.  Modern models of mohair hats are called takori.  This model has a wide lapel, which provides volume to the product.  The pattern also makes the <span>cap voluminous</span> and elastic.  It will be warm even in the strongest wind, which will not be able to get through the many fluffs of mohair. </p>

    <p>  How to knit a women's hat with knitting needles for beginners?  First of all, it is necessary to prepare a description of the pattern, scheme: </p><ul><li>  On knitting needles we collect 65 loops, which were calculated from a previously connected sample.  This must be an odd number of loops to close the knitting in a circle. </li><li>  Using the scheme, we knit the hat sheet 35-40 cm high. At this stage, you need to perform the reduction. </li></ul><p>  There are three ways to reduce the loops of a takori hat: </p><ol><li>  We turn to knitting the front surface or gum 1 x 1. The total number of loops should be divided into 3 parts.  We mark these places with a marker or eraser.  In each front row we knit 2 loops together at the same distance.  Thus, a smooth reduction of the loops occurs, and the reduced loops take the form of a neat vertical pigtail.  So you need to knit 32-34 rows of fabric. </li><li>  Self adjustment.  In this case, 4 loops in each 3rd row should be reduced.  To do this, the main number of loops should be divided into 4 parts, in each of which evenly decrease.  It is necessary to monitor the slope of the loops to get a nice vertical pigtail.  Thus, we knit 34-36 rows. </li><li>  This method is similar to the second.  They also divide the main number of loops into 4 parts, but these wedges should be located so that their top connects at the crown.  Loop reduction should be performed either at the beginning of the wedge or at the end.  Knit together 3 loops in each 4th row.  It is necessary to monitor the slope of the loops to get a nice vertical pigtail.  If decreases are performed at the beginning of the segment, the loops are reduced with an inclination to the right.  If at the end - with an inclination to the left. </li></ol>
