For some, this is lazy time on the beach, and for others, exploring the sights.  But there is another category of tourists.  They are trying to learn a new sport during the holidays.  Often it is characterized as extreme and makes it possible to experience a lot of unusual sensations. </p><p>  In recent years, surfing has become increasingly popular, the occupation of which has become a real "love" for tourists of any age from the first test lesson.  In places suitable for surfing, new schools and campsites are opened annually, where you can come even with your whole family and settle in the most comfortable conditions.  Most in demand are similar schools in Goa and the Dominican Republic.  Surfing in these countries is actively developing, and now tourists come here only in order to fly along the waves on the board.  In the high season, when the waves are both high and long, there is no free place on the beaches from lovers of this type of water sports.  We will tell you a lot of interesting things about surfing in the Dominican Republic.  Where to go surfing?  Which school to choose?  What beaches and resorts are best suited for such a pastime?  We will cover these and many other questions in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vacationidea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2546585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2546585.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>Dominican Republic</span> in terms of extreme water sports enthusiast </h2><p>  Surfing in the Dominican Republic began to develop actively from the beginning of the 2000s, when the authorities of the republic began to pay close attention to tourism infrastructure.  The country, located on one of the <span>islands of Haiti, is</span> ideal for holidays for people with different interests.  There are many kilometers of white beaches, luxury all-inclusive hotels, unique sights and simply incredible sea.  More precisely, two seas.  The Dominican Republic is washed by the Sargasso and Caribbean Seas, so nature itself has created all the conditions for practicing water sports.  Its most popular types in the Dominican Republic - classic surfing, kitesurfing, windsurfing.  All this can be learned in specialized schools. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They open in large settlements and small villages that only fishermen once knew about.  In addition to them, <span>in the Dominican Republic</span> there are campsites, rental of sports equipment, shops where they sell specialized equipment, and new surfing bases are being built. </p><p>  Thanks to this infrastructure, the flow of tourists coming to the resorts of the country for the sake of water sports annually only increases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kiting and surfing" class="if uuid-2546573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2546573.jpg"></div><h2>  Five reasons to come <span>to the Dominican Republic</span> for surfing </h2><p>  If you are considering whether it is worth spending time traveling to the Dominican Republic, because you are not aware of the level of surfing training, then do not worry - it will be comfortable for beginners and professionals on the beaches of the republic.  There are a lot of spots of different difficulty levels.  Among them, you can always choose a place suitable for skiing, and if you wish, try all the locations that exist on the beaches. </p><p>  The second reason to come here on vacation is a large number of surf schools.  There are more than twenty of them in the Dominican Republic, and many of them conduct classes in Russian.  A beginner surfer can choose a school only with Russian-speaking instructors, but also with classes conducted in two or even three languages ‚Äã‚Äãat the same time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another factor that acts as a kind of ‚Äúplus sign‚Äù for the Dominican Republic is the developed infrastructure for surfing.  Almost on every beach there are rental centers, small shops and diverse training schools.  Thanks to this, even beginners surfing is easy and simple. </p><p>  Tuition and accommodation are the fourth reason surfers travel to the Dominican Republic.  Here you can find a center that you can afford.  Moreover, the average cost of living in campsites and surfer hotels is equal to fifteen dollars.  One lesson with an instructor at a price usually does not exceed thirty-five dollars.  Compared to other overseas resorts where surfing is taught, these numbers are well below average. </p><p>  The fifth reason to come to the Dominican Republic can be considered the ease of paperwork for the trip.  A tourist will need only a wish and a plane ticket, because for our monthly stay on the island our compatriots do not need a visa. </p><h2>  Dominican Surfing Season </h2><p>  This country is good in that you can surf here almost all year round.  If we simply consider the weather conditions of the Dominican Republic, it turns out that the high season begins here in November and ends in April.  During these months, the island rarely rains, a fresh wind blows, and the temperature often exceeds thirty degrees of heat. </p><p>  In May, the Dominican Republic begins the rainy season.  Precipitation falls mainly in the morning and in the evening, and the temperature fluctuates within twenty-five degrees of heat.  Hurricanes and storms come to the coast in May and September. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can draw conclusions about suitable seasons for surfing.  Tourists should come to the north of the island from September to March.  This part of the coast is washed by the waters of the Sargasso Sea, which during this period give surfers the most coveted waves. </p><p>  From June, surfers can go to the south of the country.  Here, sports are held in the waters of the Caribbean Sea.  Despite the frequent rains at this time, during the day the weather is favorable for skating on the board along the waves. </p><p>  Interestingly, one part of the country is separated from another by one to three hours by car.  Therefore, tourists can always change their location to a more suitable one if there is such a desire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caribjournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best riding spots" class="if uuid-2546577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2546577.jpg"></div><h2>  The best resorts and surfing schools in Dominica: north coast </h2><p>  If you decide to go to this country to practice this sport, then you should still at home choose a place where you will master the art of skating on the board.  Where is the best place to surf in the Dominican Republic?  You might be surprised, but there are a lot of similar places. </p><p>  Since we found that the seasons for surfing vary depending on the coast, we will consider the beach areas separately.  If you are attracted to the northern part of the country, then beginners and professionals should seriously consider two areas: </p><p>  1. Puerto Plata.  This province is famous for its luxurious beaches, which attract both ordinary tourists and lovers of extreme water sports.  In general, the coast here stretched for one hundred and fifty meters.  It is well maintained and well equipped, and wild stretches of coastline alternate with private beach areas owned by hotels.  The advantage of Puerto Plata is its own small airport, which greatly simplifies the road to a vacation spot for tourists.  Three beach areas are considered the most suitable for riding on a board along the waves: </p><ul><li>  At the city of Sosua. </li><li>  In the resort of Playa Dorada. </li><li>  At the city of Cabarete.  By the way, this beach area is included in the world list of places ideal for riding on a board on the waves.  The bottom topography and special climatic conditions contribute to this.  In season, the waves on this beach often reach one hundred and fifty meters, which is the dream of both beginners and professionals in surfing. </li></ul><p>  2. Rio San Juan.  This area has long been considered the fishing center of the country.  Hence, daily morning catch diverges in hotel complexes and catering establishments.  But the beach zones brought great fame to the province: </p><ul><li>  Playa Grande. </li><li>  El Barco. </li><li>  La Prechios. </li></ul><p>  A distinctive feature of these places are waves of different nature.  They rise to a height of from fifty to three hundred meters, moreover, they are not of the same length.  Naturally, this attracts surfers from around the world to the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nomadsurfers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="surf training" class="if uuid-2546527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2546527.jpg"></div><h2>  A selection of surfers on the south coast of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  In the Dominican Republic, surfing in the south is no less developed than in the north.  Therefore, if you go on vacation in June or July, you are sure to find the right place for yourself to ride on the board. </p><p>  In the south, two provinces are the most famous among water sports enthusiasts: </p><ol><li>  Juan Dolio.  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country is famous for its calm coastal areas.  The beaches are mostly suitable for bathers, but not for surfers.  However, one interesting place for them in the province still exists - this is Playa Caribe.  A distinctive feature of the beach is the unpredictability of currents and waves.  They constantly change their height and size, which is very attractive to surfer athletes. </li><li>  Barahona.  In this province there are several beach areas where you can enjoy a ride on the board: </li></ol><ul><li>  San Rafael. </li><li>  Barranca. </li><li>  La Chinaga. </li></ul><p>  Usually, athletes with an average level of skating gather here.  The waves on the beaches are intermittent and rise from twenty to two hundred meters in height.  In recent years, surfing competitions are often held here, where beginners come to get invaluable experience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="schools and campsites" class="if uuid-2546566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2546566.jpg"></div><h2>  East coast of Dominican Republic </h2><p>  Tourists come here not only for the thrill, but also for the usual beach holidays.  Indeed, on the east coast is the most famous resort in the country - Punta Cana. </p><p>  Surfing in the Dominican Republic and so develops by leaps and bounds, but in this place the most famous schools and campsites are collected.  The resort itself is famous for its luxurious hotels, an abundance of entertainment venues and a wide selection of opportunities for a memorable vacation.  Surfers are attracted here by the wavelength and height.  Nowhere else in the country are there such suitable conditions for practicing water sports. </p><p>  Most often, surf schools in Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) are located near <span>Macau Beach.</span>  It is considered wild and it is impossible to find even sun loungers with umbrellas.  The entire beach area is covered with golden sand and stretches for several kilometers.  This coast is away from the tourist centers, the hustle and bustle.  Surfers are attracted to Macau with a clean and flat bottom, lack of algae and depth, starting literally on the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="republicapro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="surfing in the Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2546540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2546540.jpg"></div><h2>  Brief characteristics of surf schools </h2><p>  There are many centers in the country where a beginner can choose a suitable training program and get a certificate in the end, which will indicate his level of knowledge of the board.  If you plan to closely study surfing in the Dominican Republic, then you should settle far away from major cities.  Campers and schools gather like-minded people from all over the world.  Here you can meet newcomers who practice basic movements on the shore, and surfers with an initial skill in skiing and who have come to raise their level. </p><p>  Often, water sports enthusiasts come to schools to prepare for competitions.  The infrastructure in such places is usually very well developed, so families can come to them, even if one of its members is engaged in surfing.  Living conditions in campsites are selected for any wallet: from Spartan to the level of a five-star hotel. </p><p>  If you are a beginner and you just have to get acquainted with surfing, then pay attention to three schools that provide a high level of training for tourists who prefer active and extreme recreation: </p><ul><li>  Surf Camping in Rio San Juan. </li><li>  La Preciosa. </li><li>  Cabarete Surf Camp. </li></ul><p>  They will be discussed in the following sections of the article. </p><h2>  Camping in Rio San Juan </h2><p>  This Russian surf school in the Dominican Republic is pretty well known.  It is located near the best spots and offers a wide selection of training programs.  For beginners, a package that includes accommodation and training is suitable.  The course lasts from one to three weeks and costs one hundred dollars per person. </p><p>  If you already have experience riding the board, then you should choose a different program.  It means that the surfer has his own board and costs ninety dollars per person. </p><p>  Those who live in the hotel, but wish to surf, can advise the package without accommodation.  It will cost seventy dollars per person.  The duration of the course is limited to three weeks. </p><p>  At the Russian campsite, only group classes lasting two hours are practiced.  During this time, tourists master the theory, conduct a warm-up, train and finally make an analysis made by a group of mistakes. </p><h2>  La preciosa </h2><p>  There are a lot of Russian surf schools in the Dominican Republic, but La Preciosa is very popular.  It was formed about sixteen years ago and over the years has managed to gain the trust of tourists from around the world. </p><p>  The school uses modern methods that have proven to be very effective.  In addition, professionals in their field work here, receiving prizes at various surfing competitions. </p><p>  Some of the instructors are Russian, but local guys also teach at La Preciosa.  Usually the group does not exceed ten people, which allows you to pay maximum attention to each student. </p><p>  La Preciosa has a very convenient location.  Nearby are restaurants and cafes, so tourists have no problems with food.  In addition to training, the school organizes excursions to the most beautiful places on the island.  One day of surfing costs tourists ninety dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="magicseaweed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best beaches for surfing" class="if uuid-2546534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2546534.jpg"></div><h2>  Cabarete Surf Camp </h2><p>  This campsite is an ideal choice for family vacations and training.  It is located in a secluded and quiet lagoon.  But just five minutes from Cabarete Surf Camp there are shops, shopping centers, restaurants and entertainment venues. </p><p>  You can stay at this school with a high level of comfort - in cottages, bungalows, studios and family apartments.  In addition, the Cabarete Surf Camp has a swimming pool with a relaxation area and a restaurant known throughout the island for its delicious cocktails. </p><p>  This school also has very good quality boards and a staff of highly professional instructors. </p><p>  Many of our compatriots go for surfing in Punta Cana (Dominican Republic).  Reviews of local schools are always full of enthusiastic comments.  Since there are always many tourists in Punta Cana, it is mainly one day packages that are practiced here.  They include transfers from the hotel to the ski area, training and lunch.  Usually it is with such mini-programs that a great love of surfing begins. </p>
