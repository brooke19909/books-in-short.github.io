    <p>  The main restaurant, located on the second floor of the Gumbet Sun Club Bodrum, invites you to enjoy the taste of Turkish dishes and international dishes.  Here is a varied menu: </p><ul><li>  wide selection of desserts and pastries; </li><li>  assortment of gifts from the Aegean Sea and greenery; </li><li>  buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner; </li><li>  there is a restaurant that operates on an a la carte system; </li><li>  alcoholic drinks are served in the hotel bars; </li><li>  special children's menu. </li></ul><p>  Gumbet Sun Club Bodrum is a true oasis of comfort and rightfully deserves its four stars. </p><h2>  Country and manners </h2><p>  Turkey is a country that combines elements of Europe and Asia, and there are many stereotypes around it.  It was formed in 1923 as a result of the division of the Ottoman Empire.  The country is washed by four seas - the Mediterranean, Aegean, Marmara and Black.  The capital is Ankara, but, of course, Istanbul is <span>Turkey</span> 's <span>largest city,</span> its industrial and financial center.  And everyone knows the <span>resort of Antalya,</span> surrounded by large hotels.  Almost all industries are developed here, the climate is warm, there are fresh fruits and vegetables all year round, nutmegs, cherries, apricots, pomegranates and dates. </p><p>  The richest regions of the country are the north-west and west, the cities of Istanbul and Ankara, where the main industries are concentrated.  Turkey has achieved impressive results in the field of tourism, introducing the world to new formats of recreation, namely: all inclusive club hotels.  There are many restaurants, pool bars, noisy parties and fiery dances.  Mostly Europeans (Germans, Scandinavians, British) rest here, as well as Ukrainians and Russians. </p><p>  Turkey attracts Russians with its geographical proximity, quality of service, cheapness, and the absence of a visa requirement.  Even the Turks deal with the language barrier quite quickly.  The best hotels in the world are in Turkey! </p><p>  It is also a historical region.  There are no less attractions than in Europe: ancient cities, hot springs, ruins of castles and, of course, magnificent nature with mountains and endless beaches. </p><p>  It will be useful for tourists to know that in Turkey: </p><ul><li>  high quality roads; </li><li>  in cities there is no priority for pedestrians and you need to be careful; </li><li>  public transport is well developed; </li><li>  cities are constantly being modernized and improved; </li><li>  widely used solar panels; </li><li>  a peculiar manner of conducting trade and excessive perseverance, obsessive marketing; </li><li>  in many stores and markets, prices are not indicated, it is customary to bargain; </li><li>  leaving a store without a purchase is very difficult; </li><li>  oranges and lemons grow in the main streets, but they do not taste very good; </li><li>  but alcohol prices are high, on average two times higher than in Europe (by the way, Efes beer is a Turkish brand); </li><li>  blocked access to Wikipedia; </li><li>  dress in European style (t-shirts, jeans, etc.); </li><li>  it is a democratic secular state. </li></ul><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  Bodrum - this is where you need to go to the sea for new underwater experiences.  It is located on the Aegean coast just opposite the Greek island of Kos.  The water here warms up to 24 degrees, and a walk through the underwater depths is comfortable and very interesting. </p><p>  In these parts there are many small picturesque bays with crystal clear water;  it is here that the dream of anyone who wants to swim among the rocks and reefs, go down to the sunken ships, explore underwater caves, see the unusual species of fish that live in the Mediterranean Sea will come true. </p><p>  The main events of the city are connected with the port, where yachts from all over the world come, the ships of diving clubs moor here, and the hotel in Bodrum Gumbet Sun Club Bodrum 4 * is located near the marina.  In the deep sea are found: </p><ul><li>  barracudas; </li><li>  yellow-tailed moray eels; </li><li>  octopuses; </li><li>  giant snails; </li><li>  sea ‚Äã‚Äãlily that lives on reefs; </li><li>  spirograph; </li><li>  two-meter slopes; </li><li>  sponges; </li><li>  fish soldiers. </li></ul><p>  Many inhabitants arrived here from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal. </p><p>  Divers should visit the amazing underwater "bubble" caves and get a lot of unforgettable experiences. </p><p>  There is even an opportunity for curious divers to look at ancient artifacts.  Copies of valuable items laid at the bottom exactly at the place where they were found.  Drivers can now visit this underwater museum and touch the time.  It is a pity that the Gumbet Sun Club Bodrum e 4 * hotel (Bodrum) does not have a diving school and beginners have to look for training elsewhere. </p><h2>  Where to go on a tour </h2><ol><li>  The remains of a rich antique castle in Halicarnassus. </li><li>  The mausoleum is one of the seven wonders of the world. </li><li>  St. Peter's Fortress on the coast and its Museum of Underwater Archeology (Turkish divers replenished the museum collection). </li><li>  To see all this overnight, you need to visit the bay of Paradise, from there all the sights are visible in the best way.  Romantics will appreciate a boat trip to the Turkish islands, which are located near Bodrum.  Beautiful nature, panorama of the clear sea and secluded bays with deserted beaches, what more could you want?  From the beginning of July until mid-September, a Schengen visa is not required here. </li><li>  30 kilometers from the Bodrum Peninsula are the thermal springs of Pamukkale - this is truly one of the magical places in Turkey.  Calcium-saturated hot springs originate high in the mountains and cascade down to form pools.  When the water cools, the calcium salts on the mountainsides turn into dazzling white terraces.  The healing properties of thermal springs have been known since ancient times - the temperature of the water is 36 degrees, it is saturated with calcium carbonate and carbon dioxide, which helps a lot with heart diseases, and also the water is good for the skin and helps to recover quickly after operations.  Many come here for treatment, take baths, and the skin becomes ruddy like a peach and soft like silk.  Here you can definitely relax and calm down. </li><li>  A small village near Bodrum, where residents weave traditional carpets for sale using natural materials and dyes.  They can be purchased as a souvenir for friends and relatives. </li></ol><h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  Based on numerous reviews, it can be noted that the Gumbet Sun Club Bodrum 4 * hotel (Turkey) is fully responsible in terms of service and services to its four stars.  But, importantly, it is considered one of the youth party places, so when you come here, you do not need to hope for a calm and measured vacation.  The hotel is located on the street of bars, there are constantly fun parties, dancing until the morning, drunk people and quite noisy.  Therefore, it is better to go with children to another place, otherwise the rest will be ruined. </p>
