And Lenovo smartphones are among the most productive and secure devices.  But it also happens that the owner simply forgot the password or pattern.  And the device does not have a fingerprint scanner.  How to unlock the Lenovo phone in this case?  It‚Äôs good that there are several ways at once.  We will analyze them all.  But first, some general information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidtab.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock lenovo phone" class="if uuid-3003543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3003543.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I unlock a smartphone? </h2><p>  So, how to unlock the Lenovo TV if you forgot your password or pattern?  There are several ways to do this.  All of them differ in the degree of complexity and efficiency.  If one of them did not help, then you can always try the other.  These methods are: </p><ul><li>  Use of a Google Account.  It works only if the user has linked the device to a Google account.  Requires an active internet connection. </li><li>  With the help of special programs.  Some file managers can work from recovery and edit system files.  With their help, you can remove the lock.  It works only if a graphic key has been installed to unlock the smartphone. </li><li>  Fint with a bell.  It is based on the well-known vulnerability of Android, which allows you to enter the gadget settings menu during a call to this device.  Used quite often. </li><li>  Reset.  The most radical way that unlocks the device with a 100% guarantee.  But at the same time, all user data will be deleted.  Therefore, it is worth using in a pinch. </li><li>  Firmware.  Used only as a last resort, if nothing else helps.  It can fix many problems.  But improper firmware can kill the device. </li></ul><p>  All of the above options are answers to the question of how to unlock the key on a Lenovo phone.  Use of some of them is required only in extreme cases.  Others are absolutely safe.  We will consider everything.  Let's start with the simplest and most affordable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="roscase.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock lenovo phone if forgot" class="if uuid-3003555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3003555.jpg"></div><h2>  Method number 1. Using a Google Account </h2><p>  How to unlock the phone if you forget the password?  Lenovo in this regard are exactly the same as smartphones from other manufacturers.  They can be unlocked after confirming your Google account.  But for this, several conditions must be met.  Firstly, you need the phone to be tied to a Google account in advance.  Secondly, you need an internet connection on your smartphone.  If all this is, then we can proceed to the actions themselves: </p><ol><li>  Enter the pattern and password incorrectly 6 times. </li><li>  After that, the message "Forgot your password / pattern?" Appears.  Click on this button. </li><li>  A window appears for entering a username and password to access your Google account. </li><li>  Enter the necessary data and click the "Unlock" button. </li><li>  We are waiting for the verification and launch of the smartphone. </li><li>  We go to the settings menu and remove the password or pattern. </li><li>  We use the device in normal mode. </li></ol><p>  The above instruction is another answer to the question about how to unlock the graphic key on the Lenovo phone.  It suits almost everyone.  But sometimes it does not work, because there is no Internet connection or the user doesn‚Äôt corny remember his username and password.  In this case, you can try another option. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="paidfreedroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock a graphic key on a lenovo phone" class="if uuid-3003583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3003583.jpg"></div><h2>  Method number 2. We use special programs </h2><p>  There is such an interesting file manager Aroma Filemanager.  It allows you to load the device in recovery mode, find the file responsible for the graphic key, and delete it.  This is another answer to the question of how to unlock Lenovo.  The phone will not be affected.  If something else is not accidentally deleted.  The algorithm of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Download the program from the official website of the developer and copy it to the USB flash drive. </li><li>  We insert the USB flash drive into the smartphone. </li><li>  We reboot the device into recovery mode (the button "Volume up" plus "Power"). </li><li>  Open the conductor, which was previously downloaded to a USB flash drive. </li><li>  Find the file "gesture.key" and delete it. </li><li>  We reboot the smartphone in normal mode. </li><li>  We use it. </li></ol><p>  This method may help.  But it is more suitable for older models.  In new manufacturers, the bootloader is blocked.  But still, this is another answer to the question of how to unlock Lenovo.  The phone will remain safe and sound.  If this option does not help, then move on to the next. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lenovo-smart.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock password phone lenovo" class="if uuid-3003566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3003566.jpg"></div><h2>  Method number 3. Fint with a bell </h2><p>  This option is also good for phones released about five years ago.  In modern software versions, this bug has already been fixed.  How to unlock a Lenovo phone?  You definitely do not need to know the pin code for this.  All actions are extremely simple.  But this will require another smartphone that can make calls.  Algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  We call on our phone from another device. </li><li>  During the call, lower the curtain and enter the settings. </li><li>  Go to the security settings. </li><li>  Disable password or pattern. </li><li>  We complete the call. </li><li>  We use the phone. </li></ol><p>  An extremely simple option, which, unfortunately, does not work on all devices.  If it didn‚Äôt work on your Lenovo, then only the last resort remains.  The most radical.  But with a one hundred percent guarantee.  After applying it, the password or pattern will definitely disappear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lenovo-smart.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock the phone if you forgot the password lenovo" class="if uuid-3003571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3003571.jpg"></div><h2>  Method number 4. Reset to factory settings </h2><p>  Use this option is only in the most extreme case and with a certain amount of caution.  It is fraught with consequences if you do something wrong.  But this is another answer to the question of how to unlock Lenovo.  The phone will lose all user data: applications, contacts, music, videos and pictures.  In general, everything that is stored on the internal drive.  But the device can be turned on.  So what do you need to do?  The algorithm is very simple: </p><ol><li>  First of all, turn off the smartphone. </li><li>  Then we press the "Volume +" button along with the power button. </li><li>  We go into the recovery and immediately move to the "Wipe Data and Factory Reset" menu. </li><li>  Click on the item "Wipe All". </li><li>  Confirm the action. </li><li>  We are waiting for the completion of the process. </li><li>  We return to the main recovery menu. </li><li>  Select "Reboot now". </li><li>  We are waiting for the phone to fully load. </li><li>  We enter all the necessary data and configure the first launch. </li><li>  We use it. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  It is worth noting that after a reset to the factory settings, you will have to re-link the phone to your Google account, enter personal data and perform other routine configuration steps.  But in your hands will be a pristine device.  It will even work faster. </p><div class="photo" data-original="firmware.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock a key on a lenovo phone" class="if uuid-3003573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3003573.jpg"></div><h2>  Method number 5. Firmware upgrade </h2><p>  Another answer to the question of how to unlock Lenovo.  The phone in this case will also be pristine.  Nothing left.  Just what will be on the flash drive.  Unfortunately, there is no universal instruction for flashing Lenovo devices.  It all depends on the specific model: some require firmware via a computer, while others need a flash drive with firmware copied to it.  However, an approximate algorithm of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We search for the necessary firmware on the Internet and download it. </li><li>  Download and install the necessary drivers and software. </li><li>  We flash the phone according to individual instructions. </li><li>  We load the device, enter the necessary data and configure it. </li><li>  We use it. </li></ol><p>  Of course, the above algorithm of actions will not give an answer to the question of how to unlock the password of the Lenovo phone.  For this we need a special instruction based on the model of the device.  In the search for these instructions, you can post forums on the firmware of mobile devices.  There you can find the necessary firmware and the necessary software. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fight.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to unlock password phone lenovo" class="if uuid-3003587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3003587.jpg"></div><h2>  If nothing helps </h2><p>  It also happens that all of the above methods are powerless.  This happens once in a million.  In this case, do not be wise, reinvent the wheel and try to somehow flash the device.  It is better to bring it to the service, where qualified specialists unlock it quickly and efficiently.  Of course, you have to pay for it.  But it is likely that your data will not go anywhere. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we sorted out the question of how to unlock the Lenovo phone if you forgot the graphic key or password.  There are many ways to solve this problem.  And only the user to choose which suits him more. </p>
