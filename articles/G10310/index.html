  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From which station does the Aeroexpress train go to Vnukovo, who knows?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow is a big city.  This is a metropolis.  And before you go somewhere, it is better to clarify the reliability of the route.  This is especially important when the question is about a trip to the airport or train station.  Neither the plane nor the train will wait.  And the route must be planned taking into account time, money and reliability, that is, the likelihood of traffic jams.  How many people know, for example, from which station is the aeroexpress train to Vnukovo? </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.59964799999999" data-lng="37.271234100000015" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/1/3/1813.png"></div><p>  Now let's figure it out.  With train stations it‚Äôs easier - everyone can be reached by metro. </p><h2>  Ways to get to the airports of the capital </h2><p>  How to get to the airports?  There are several ways. </p><p>  The first way is a taxi.  There are many advantages here, except for the price, as well as the opportunity to get into a large and long traffic jam on one of the Moscow highways.  You can go by minibus, bus, that is, by public transport.  An economical option, but costly: </p><ul><li>  by time - there may be traffic jams; </li><li>  physically - it‚Äôs difficult to go with luggage in public transport, and not every minibus comes with suitcases. </li></ul><h2>  Airport within the city </h2><p>  Vnukovo Airport is the only airport terminal located in the city.  The rest are in the suburbs.  And, therefore, it will be more convenient to get there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The best way to get to Vnukovo Airport is by aeroexpress.  Aeroexpress trains now run from the city to all the airports of the capital.  But not everyone knows where the starting point is - from which station to which airport the train departs. </p><p>  To find out from which station the aeroexpress train to Vnukovo goes, the schedule and ticket prices can be checked via the Internet if access to the World Wide Web is at hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vnukovo-aeroport.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vnukovo Airport" class="if uuid-2349058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2349058.jpg"></div><p>  This question is asked in advance so as not to be late for the flight due to your own fault.  So, in any case, it is necessary to advance in advance in order to be in time on board the aircraft.  For this reason, having found out from which station the aeroexpress train goes to Vnukovo, you need to clearly calculate the time for the journey.  The express ride to the airport will take 30-35 minutes, but how long it takes to get to the station depends on which area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMoscow or Moscow region you live in. </p><h2>  The main factor is time </h2><p>  The airport is located in the south of Moscow.  But what is the aeroexpress train to Vnukovo station closest to.  This is Kievsky station.  You also need to get to him, it will take time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wallpaperup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev station in Moscow" class="if uuid-2349074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2349074.jpg"></div><p>  Aeroexpress runs every 30-60 minutes.  There are <span>technical breaks that</span> are best to be familiarized with in advance.  Ticket price varies in the range of 420-500 rubles.  Find out your trip details as early as possible to avoid wasting time, nerves and money. </p>
