  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew a boho style skirt.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Boho style is not just clothes, but a whole philosophy of life, the concept of combining the incompatible.  At first glance, it may seem too cumbersome, since layering is in use here.  Underskirts, lots of ruffles and lace, fur vests and boas as if from a grandmother's chest ... I can describe boho charms endlessly, since I literally fell ill with them and now I can not imagine life without all these romantic, cute outfits. </p><p>  When I decided to sew a skirt in this style, the first thought was to find something suitable in sewing magazines.  After reviewing the mountain of literature, I regretted that it was not so easy to find a pattern.  Therefore, I decided to sew a skirt in the style of boho based on the usual "tatyanka".  For her, I needed a piece of fabric equal to two volumes of the hips (if you don‚Äôt like excessive pomp, one and a half will be enough).  Since boho is, first of all, natural fabrics, I chose linen with a discreet floral pattern. </p><p>  It also took 10 m of hat gum to sew a skirt and 6 m of cotton narrow lace and velvet braid for decoration.  All this wealth was used for decoration. </p><p>  So, we sew a boho style skirt.  Pattern for "Tatyanka" is not required.  Just take a rectangle of fabric of the required width.  Calculating it is very simple.  It is necessary to take a measure of the circumference of the hips and multiply it by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 (the larger the number, the more magnificent the frills).  Since we plan to sew a <span>long skirt,</span> take another measurement.  To do this, measure the distance from the waist line to the ankle <span>with a centimeter tape</span> .  Then we postpone the resulting value on the fabric and cut off the excess. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With the opening of our skirts is over.  You can proceed to sewing.  To start, we cut the slices and process the upper edge with a double hem.  The bottom of the skirt will be trimmed with braid and lace, so we will not hem it. </p><p>  So that the model does not look too simple, we will decorate it with pinches, which will be arranged in random order.  They are performed in this way.  On the fabric we lay two shallow folds, one above the other, we sketch them and build up. </p><p>  On the lower edge, we sew and sew lace with a zigzag seam.  To close a not-so-attractive connection point, we adjust the braid over it. <br>  I note that you can sew a boho skirt according to the most elementary pattern, but without a lush decor in this case can not do. </p><p>  In addition to the tucks and lace hem along the hem, I found two more strips of lace with lace on the bottom.  After all the frills are sewn in, we sew the side seam.  Allowances will need to be laid out in opposite directions and well ironed with steam. </p><p>  Well, now it's time to move on to the design of the top edge.  It‚Äôs very easy to pick up fabric.  First, we wind the hat gum on the bobbin, then weaken the tension of the upper and lower threads and set the stitch length to 3 mm.  We build the edge without breaking in a spiral.  The distance between the lines is about a centimeter.  Do not worry that it does not turn out too smoothly.  For assemblies, no one will see small flaws. </p><p>  For completeness, do not forget to sew the lower skirt from a thinner fabric.  You can even take ready-made coupon sewing and finish it with satin ribbons. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt need any extra volume, make the petticoat a ‚Äútrick‚Äù.  To do this, sew a frill of contrasting fabric to the wrong side.  It will not be so difficult to do this.  If the fabric is thin, the frill can be sewn along the seam's sewing line. </p><p>  You can wear the finished outfit with loose blouses in the "Carmen" style, knitted vests, cardigans and even a poncho.  However, if you don‚Äôt like these options, a simple monophonic t-shirt with a fitted cut is quite suitable.  The main thing is that the whole set is a single and harmonious whole.  Boho style is characterized by a combination of expensive accessories (leather bags, ankle boots, vintage jewelry) and handmade products.  To combine such seemingly incompatible things in one set and not look like an urban madwoman, you need to have an exceptional sense of fashion. </p>
