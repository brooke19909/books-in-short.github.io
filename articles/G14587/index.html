In this case, the bankruptcy estate of the debtor is evaluated.  All property owned by the company at the start of bankruptcy proceedings is subject to valuation.  Money earned from the sale of these facilities is used to pay off debt. </p><h2>  Legal Aspects </h2><p>  The procedure for the formation and evaluation of the bankruptcy estate is prescribed in the Federal Law No. 127 ‚ÄúOn the insolvency of the borrower‚Äù.  The register includes all property recorded on the balance sheet of the enterprise, and revealed during production.  Very often seized objects undergo changes.  Some of them can be returned to the debtor, and the second is included in the bankruptcy estate, as it can be used to pay off debt.  Exceptions include objects withdrawn from civilian circulation, property rights, social funds, rented premises.  The lack of ownership of the objects must be confirmed by documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thisismoney.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bankruptcy estate" class="if uuid-2976882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2976882.jpg"></div><h2>  Manager </h2><p>  The duty to form a bankruptcy estate lies with the trustee, who is appointed by the court.  The main goal of this event is the proportionate satisfaction of creditors' requirements.  The procedure itself lasts up to one year, but if there are reasons, it can be extended for another 6 months.  Therefore, the applicant must not only understand the essence of the bankruptcy procedure, but also comply with a number of requirements.  The manager performs the role of property manager.  He must draw up a register of objects, evaluate them and propose a distribution scheme of funds from the sale of property. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Manager functions: </p><ul><li>  Carrying out activities aimed at preserving the bankruptcy estate, in particular the seizure of property. </li></ul><ul><li>  Search for objects that belong to the debtor and are under the jurisdiction of third parties for the purpose of concealment. </li></ul><ul><li>  Publishing bankruptcy information, drawing up a register of creditors, making settlements with them. </li></ul><ul><li>  Assessment of property at market value and inventory. </li></ul><ul><li>  Providing the court with reports on the sale of property and settlements with creditors.

An insolvency declaration can be made as part of the liquidation process.  At the same time, the legal entity should not have enough funds to carry out all settlements with creditors.  Formal publication is necessary for the correct conduct of the liquidation process in order to inform all creditors of bankruptcy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.startupdonut.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue puzzles" class="if uuid-2976056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976056.jpg"></div><p>  The announcement should be published in the newspaper Kommersant with the submission of the head or representative of the organization or employee of the FSN.

A correctly composed announcement must be signed by the head of the enterprise.  A separate copy of the message must be completed by hand.  The electronic version of the document should be given to the publication.  Documents confirming the rights of managers must also be provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agus-prom.hr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="inclusion in the bankruptcy estate" class="if uuid-2976907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2976907.jpg"></div><p>  The announcement is accepted for publication if: </p><ul><li>  Copies of OGRN and TIN. </li><li>  Two copies of the message. </li><li>  The document in which the court decision is registered, and its copies. </li><li>  An accurate description of the events that occur at the time of publication in a bankrupt company. </li><li>  Receipts for payment for services (180 rubles per 1 cm <sup>2 of</sup> the advertisement area). </li></ul><h2>  Features of the publication procedure </h2><p>  General information: </p><ul><li>  Information is updated in the source every Saturday. </li><li>  The application is submitted in electronic form through the website of Kommersant. </li><li>  All official bankruptcy information has been stored in the archive since 2004, access to which is open on the website. </li><li>  All publication costs are borne by the debtor. </li><li>  Applications and payments are accepted at most three days before the release of the issue (that is, until 14:00 on Wednesday inclusive).  According to the law, the bankruptcy trustee must publish an announcement within 10 days after the appointment. </li><li>  If there are spelling, punctuation errors in the text, editors may reject the application. </li><li>  On the newspaper‚Äôs website you can find information about whether the organization is bankrupt by SRO, organizer, bankruptcy trustee or case number. </li></ul><h2>  Bargaining </h2><p>  All bankruptcy estate presented in the register should be valued at market value.  For this purpose, appraisers may be involved whose services are paid by creditors.  Valued objects go to auction.  The procedure for the sale of property is detailed in art.  84 Federal Law.  <span>The sale of property of the debtor</span> from the bankruptcy estate is carried out at open bidding.  Information on bankruptcy and information on property 30 days before the auction, the manager must publish in the media.  Starting price is fixed at market value.  The place of bidding is determined by the general meeting of creditors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.delfi.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bankruptcy trustee" class="if uuid-2976891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2976891.jpg"></div><p>  Due to heavy burdens in practice, no one buys an asset for the first three months.  At each subsequent auction, the price is reduced by 10%.  The auctions themselves are held with increasing prices.  According to statistics, property is often sold in the 3-4 procedure with a discount of 30-40%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.startupdonut.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cubes with numbers" class="if uuid-2976063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2976063.jpg"></div><p>  The new bill proposes an alternative bidding procedure.  The property will have an initial sale and minimum price.  If no applications are received at the first stage, then the price will be reduced by 10% or to the minimum level.  This will significantly increase the chances of the first successful bidding and reduce the cost of financing the bankruptcy estate.  At the same time, there is a danger that large creditors will abuse their influence if there is loyalty on the part of the manager.  In addition, the Ministry of Economic Development reduces the terms of bidding up to 40 days from the date of the decision to hold them.  Here are some changes to the code in the near future. </p>
