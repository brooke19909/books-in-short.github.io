    <h2>  Sights and interesting places </h2><p>  The state of Ohio, whose cities are known all over the world as large industrial, educational and recreational places, can tell a lot of interesting things about itself.  Take, for example, Zanesville.  It is in this city that the bridge is located, one of a kind.  It is notable for its structure - in shape it resembles the letter “Y”.  There are three ends and roads at this bridge.  Still in the state there are <span>roller coasters,</span> which are the second in the world in speed and height. </p><p>  And in the city of Sandusky you can ride an attraction, the height of which reaches as much as 128 meters!  If you want to admire the beauties of nature, then you should definitely visit the Cayahog Valley.  Its area is about 33,000 acres, and this is perhaps one of the most picturesque places in all of America (with a rich fauna).  No wonder almost all tourists go here.  You can also visit the Brandywine Waterfall - an amazing place surrounded by conifers.  And in the Tinkers Creek Gorge, you can admire the mysterious landscapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Pure nature </h2><p>  Not without reason in this state there are so many beautiful places with untouched nature.  In fact, most of its territory is represented by endless plains.  The state of Ohio is also called the state of horse chestnut - all because these trees grow here almost everywhere.  But in the western part you can see many wetlands.  But in the east - the Appalachian Plateau, not very high (only 460 meters), but picturesque. </p><p>  In the north of the state is Lake Erie.  There are several interesting facts about him.  For example, it is the tenth largest freshwater lake in the world.  In addition, the warmest of all the Great Lakes - all because it is not very deep.  Erie is also the border between Canada and the United States - because of this, disputes often arise regarding the payment of negotiations on mobile phones.  It just happens that operators consider certain calls international.  Erie is far from the only body of water that Ohio (USA) can boast of.  There is also the river of the same name, it is located in the south.  Ohio is considered the deepest tributary of the Mississippi. </p>

    <h2>  A little bit about the capital </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the main city of the state is Columbus.  Its history began in 1812 - it was then that it was founded.  By the way, from the very beginning it was thought that the city to be built on this site would become the state capital.  And so it happened.  Today, Columbus is a superbly developed metropolis - from an economic, commercial, logistic, industrial and educational point of view.  It is not surprising, because here they are engaged in trade, banking, healthcare, as well as in the aviation, defense and food sectors.  All this gave a certain result, for example, in 2009, the city’s GDP exceeded the figure of 90 billion dollars! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Higher education in a prestigious university </h2><p>  Also in Columbus is the largest Ohio state university, abbreviated as OSU.  Moreover, this institution is the third largest in all of America.  This is a university with a fairly long history, since it was founded in 1870.  But initially it was a simple technical school.  Who would have thought that an ordinary agricultural college located on the outskirts of the city would turn into a popular educational institution.  And if initially only 24 students studied here, today about 42,100 bachelors and about 11 thousand doctors and masters study at the university. </p><p>  At the university you can get education in the specialties related to journalism, medicine, law, veterinary medicine, trade and the agricultural field.  However, this is not the only university in which they provide a good basis for further professional activities.  In total, there are about 150 educational institutions throughout the state.  And education can be obtained in almost any specialty - from journalism to engineering. </p><h2>  State Cities </h2><p>  About 12 million people live in Ohio, and the state has several dozen cities.  The largest are (in addition to the capital) Cleveland, Cincinnati and Toledo.  New Lexington, Warren, Findlay, Parma, Canton, Dayton - all these names of megacities are heard by almost every person.  But there are also small towns in the state, one of the smallest is Oberlin - the population is only about 9 thousand people.  A small cozy town, designed for a quiet life, is the exact opposite of, say, Mansfield or Cambridge. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Each city or state has its own characteristics and interesting facts, which will always be useful to learn about.  For example, few people know that tomato juice is Ohio's official drink.  Or, for example, that the law supposedly forbids six women (and more) to live under one roof.  Five is still allowed.  There is even a law banning dueling, although it is unlikely in our time they are held.  And before selling chickens, they are forbidden to paint in any color. </p><p>  And finally, another funny law - it is forbidden to install slot machines in such non-standard places as a barn or stable.  For information, we add that Ohio is a state whose time differs from Moscow by 8 hours.  That is, when people come home from work in the Russian capital, in Cleveland they just wake up to go to the office. </p>
