It seems that every corner of this romantic city has been replicated on tourist brochures and it’s already impossible to find something new here.  But anyone who wants to experience incredible sensations and completely immerse themselves in childhood should definitely visit Asterix, an amusement park.  Have not heard of this?  Well, we will be happy to fill this gap in your knowledge. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Asterix Park" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1713312.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Asterix Park, France: history of construction </h2><p>  If we talk about various attractions and theme parks, the first thing that comes to mind to the Russians is the American Disneyland.  It is the most famous and popular entertainment destination in the world.  But few people know that the very idea of ​​such territories, where people can have fun and relax with their whole family, belongs to Europeans.  It was here that the first rides gathered in one place began to appear. </p><p>  France is a fairly developed country in the field of organized family vacations.  At the service of Parisians and guests of the city are three huge entertainment parks that are open almost any time of the year.  A special place among them is the amusement park Asterix. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This fabulous place arose in contrast to the growing popularity of American culture in France.  Parisians wanted to have their own national park, offering a lot of entertainment that would be filled with French color and reflect the history of the country in a fabulous and cheerful manner.  That is how the idea came to light to build a luxurious and magical park thirty kilometers from Paris.  Asterix and Obelix became the main characters of this fabulous place, we can say that all the attractions, shops and cafes were built around their people. </p><p>  The park opened in 1989 after two years of construction and immediately attracted a lot of visitors.  About twenty investors took part in the implementation of such a grandiose project, and they invested more than eight hundred million francs in Asterix (an amusement park).  At that time, it was the most expensive construction site in the country.  In its process, about one thousand jobs were created, and still the park allows a large number of its employees to earn a living, which ensure the smooth operation of all parts of the complex. </p><p>  The opening took place in a festive atmosphere, the Minister of Culture himself led this process.  Now Asterix Park in Paris is visited annually by about two million tourists and local residents. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Asterix Park" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/133/1714795.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  main idea </h2><p>  The French managed to turn their most beloved characters into the most important characters in the park.  Asterix and Obelix are almost everywhere here - they will look at you from the plates in the cafe, meet on the streets of the Gallic village and take part in each attraction.  In parallel, the children will be able to get acquainted with the history of France, and this will happen in an unobtrusive way, which is very attractive for parents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Asterix and Obelix first appeared in French comics.  Two charismatic galls, with whom various curious cases constantly occur, literally from the first instant fell in love with the French.  They appreciated their appearance, the ability to get out of any situation and the solid character that the Roman legionnaires could not break.  After all, they did not expect at all that they would have to face the village where the magic potion was brewed. </p><p>  The French are so in love with their fictional characters that as soon as the idea of ​​creating a theme park arose, its main characters became clumsy and funny galls. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Asterix Park in Paris" class="if" height="154" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1713310.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Description and characteristics of the entertainment complex </h2><p>  Asterix Park is located in a very convenient location, but keep in mind that on any form of transport you will have to get here for about an hour.  You can enjoy relaxing on the rides for several days, so for tired tourists, not far from the main entertainment areas, a pretty comfortable hotel is built where you can spend one or several nights after a noisy and fun day. </p><p>  Everyone who was lucky to visit Asterix (the park remains in their memory for a long time) claims that it is surprisingly sincere and fabulous.  Of course, perhaps he is inferior to Disneyland in colorfulness and enchanting, but definitely wins in many other respects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Asterix <span>theme park</span> currently has thirty-six attractions.  Among them, the majority are various water slides, which are incredibly pleasant to ride in the sweltering summer heat.  Thrill-seekers will be pleased with eight roller coasters, considered one of the highest in the country. </p><p>  The creators of the park divided it into five fabulous zones: </p><ul><li>  Gaul village; </li><li>  Roman empire; </li><li>  Ancient Greece; </li><li>  viking country: </li><li>  point of intersection of times. </li></ul><p>  Each zone has its own characteristics and character, so it’s worth telling about every corner of this amazing French entertainment center. </p><h2>  Gaul </h2><p>  The Gallic village looks exactly like in the famous cartoon.  On the well-groomed streets you will meet all its main characters and will be able to take part in their daily lives.  Gallia has the largest number of shops and cafeterias.  Here you can buy a lot of souvenirs with images of Asterix and his friends, as well as try dishes of national cuisine. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the Gallic village there is an excellent French restaurant serving simple but incredibly tasty cheeses, sausages and other delicacies that France is proud of. </p><p>  If you want to explore the whole of Gaul, then ride a stylized train through the picturesque hills and valleys of the country.  Most of the entertainment shows also take place in Gaul: in a huge tent every hour there is a bloody battle between the Romans and the Gauls, and in the dolphinarium you can enjoy a magnificent view with sea animals. </p><p>  Of the many attractions in the Gall village, the following deserve attention: </p><ul><li>  Loop. </li><li>  Big Splash. </li></ul><p>  On the first you can ride at high speed along a mountain serpentine, and on the second you have to experience horror, going down from a 35-meter peak directly into a huge pool. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Asterix France" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1713314.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Ancient Greece </h2><p>  This is a territory of madness and unrestrained fun.  The Greek gods will let you on Olympus and overthrow you back to earth, and the most desperate and courageous will be able to repeat this experience several times.  After you go down the language of Zeus at a speed of eighty kilometers per hour, be sure to experience the flight of Icarus - an incredible boat ride.  And if you still have little adrenaline, then look at the hydra, which will grab you and twist you until you ask for mercy. </p><p>  Here you can visit the Poseidon Theater and, finally, satisfy the awakened hunger with the help of national Greek food. </p><h2>  The Roman Empire </h2><p>  Rome is a family holiday destination.  Here you can rafting on unusual inflatable boats on mountain rivers and test your strengths on the new 3D attraction, which will cause a lot of positive emotions.  All visitors to the park will be able to take part in a theatrical performance or explore the main castle of the emperor. </p><p>  Usually, tourists make numerous photos in this zone, as well as arrange picnics in special specially designated places.  Asterix is ​​a park, which is a rather unique territory where guests can bring their food and then enjoy it in the fresh air. </p>

    <h2>  Admission fee </h2><p>  At the entrance to the "Asterix" (an amusement park), there is a ticket office where entrance tickets are bought.  The cost of rest in an adult park is equal to fifty euros, a children's ticket (up to twelve years) costs forty euros.  If you come with a large company, you may receive a discount.  It is equally profitable to purchase entrance tickets over the Internet, a small discount is always provided on the site. </p><p>  Having bought a ticket, visitors can ride all the rides during the day and have access to each zone of the park. </p><h2>  How does an entertainment project work? </h2><p>  An incredible number of attractions working with water, makes significant adjustments to the theme park's work schedule - it operates only in the warm season.  Usually the season opens in April and ends in early November.  From September to November, the project works only on weekends, as the flow of visitors is significantly reduced. </p><p>  You can come to the park by ten in the morning and stay there until six in the evening.  Keep in mind that traveling here is by public transport, because parking in front of the entrance is paid.  Tourists can use the special bus departing from the Louvre, or get to the park by train. </p><p>  In winter, a beautiful ice rink is poured on the territory, where you can have a great time and enjoy a mug of mulled wine or hot chocolate in an absolutely fabulous atmosphere. </p><p>  If you come to Paris, be sure to take the time to visit the Asterix Park.
