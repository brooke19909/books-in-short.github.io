More recently, in 2012, in the neighborhood of Dorokhovo, a small comfortable village, several buildings of the luxurious LES Art Resort 4 * appeared - a modern hotel complex.  Almost immediately, the institution became one of the most visited suburban hotels near Moscow.  If we decipher the abbreviation, which in Russian sounds like  (free time, events, spa), then the name Leisure, Events, Spa says a lot to future guests of the institution.  And thanks to the three letters at the beginning of the phrase - LES - for smart tourists it immediately becomes clear that they will not only have a rest in the hotel, but in the woods. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Six buildings of the complex - the main and 5 bedrooms - are located near the <span>Minsk highway</span> among the dense birch and spruce thickets that successfully protect the LES Art Resort 4 * from gases, noise and dust.  If we compare the hotel territory - more than 20 hectares - with famous historical sites, then it can accommodate about eight Red Squares or two Petersburg Summer Gardens.  In addition to well-maintained buildings, 10 cozy villas are open for vacationers, “Laguna” - a modern complex with a swimming pool, “Belvedere” - a banquet hall, - a ski, bicycle and other sports equipment rental center.  Here a tiny chapel is modestly "hiding" among the trees.  Guests will also enjoy leisure and entertainment on an artificial pond, a football field and three playgrounds - a nursery, a barbecue and a sports one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Villas </h2><p>  Vacationers at LES Art Resort will not have any problems choosing a comfortable room.  Hotel guests who prefer rural colors can stay in one of 10 two-story wooden villas, each of which is designed for simultaneous accommodation of no more than 11 people.  In order to become the master of any cottage for one day, the total area of ​​which is 170 m², it is necessary to pay at least 25,000 rubles, which for a group of 8-10 people is considered quite a democratic cost. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel LES Art Resort received positive reviews for the food.  Guests of "LES Art" note several advantages that they get in comparison with similar institutions of the Moscow Region, choosing this particular hotel.  First of all, in the LES Art Resort 4 * All Inclusive hotel.  Not many hotels in provincial Russia can “boast” of such a system, so popular with tourists who are used to relaxing in the resorts of the Turkish Riviera.  In LES Art Resort 4 * "All Inclusive" primarily involves three meals a day, rich in a variety of low-calorie, but tasty dishes, mainly in a hotel restaurant.  Although tourists can have lunch or dinner at several other hotel establishments: </p><ul><li>  The “Gallery” will delight you with the romantic atmosphere created by musicians who play the piano or violin soulfully.  The taste of exquisite dishes of Italy and France successfully harmonizes with the melodies in the restaurant.  The institution is also famous for its desserts and diet menus. </li><li>  In Dali, a small and inexpensive art cafe, connoisseurs of the work of the great Spanish master of brush, whose last name is a cozy place, enjoy relaxing.  But ordinary visitors, looking for a quiet chamber environment for friendly communication, become its frequent guests.  About Salvador Dali here are reminiscent of reproductions of the famous canvases of the famous surrealist hanging on high walls. </li><li>  The “Podium” is exactly the restaurant where the guests will find the buffet included in the All inclusive, or, as they usually call it, a buffet.  Tasty dishes of fruits, herbs and vegetables, offered here most often, will not let vacationers gain kilograms of excess weight. </li><li>  The open bar, located in the spacious lobby, also applies to All inclusive.  Guests enjoy tasting a variety of beer or wine brands.  Young travelers do not pass by ice cream and confectionery. </li><li>  Barbecue enthusiasts will be pleased with the unexpected opportunity to have picnics even in winter.  For this fun lesson, several heated gazebos are built on a special site. </li><li>  At 5 O'Clock, the main bar open in the evening and at night, you can not only enjoy an original cocktail, but also treat yourself to a cigar or hookah. </li></ul><p>  To order a dish or drink in their room, hotel guests only need to dial four digits - 0033 by internal telephone. You just need to remember that the request will be fulfilled if vacationers are willing to spend at least 500 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Health, sport and beauty </h2><p>  Hotel LES Art Resort (Moscow region) will certainly suit those who can not imagine a single day, even on vacation, without physical exertion and sports.  During the summer, guests enjoy cycling around the picturesque surroundings.  Moreover, here, in the zone of mixed forests, you can enjoy clean air and the absence of annoying noise of big cities.  In the winter months, cycling is successfully replaced by skiing.  A rental point will provide everything you need for fans of active pastime, and it’s completely free. </p><p>  Vacationers in the “LES Art Resort” are not limited to skiing or cycling, but enjoy using all the leisure and sports facilities available to them: </p><ul><li>  The large pool accepts swimmers of different ages from 9am.  Almost all day it is full of amateur athletes and ordinary fans of water fun.  Only at 9 pm its 50-meter paths become inaccessible to vacationers.  Kids can not bother their caring parents and splash around on an artificial reservoir specially fenced off for them. </li><li>  “Laguna” - a separate pavilion - offers a relaxing holiday in two baths - Russian and Finnish.  Here you can have a bite to eat and have a beer in the small bar.  Swimmers have fun in the heated pool built next to the Laguna, where even in cold weather the daredevils happily splash in warm water, admiring the snow-covered firs and birches standing around.  In the winter months, an artificial pond located nearby turns into a good skating rink, next to which low slides for tubing “grow”. </li><li>  Two summer playgrounds - football and sports - will suit fans of active games.  In the warmer months, competitions are often organized between gambling vacationers.  Inveterate football players play on their site and do not interfere with volleyball players and basketball players having fun in the neighborhood.  Fans of minigolf, which is gaining popularity in Russia, are not far behind them.  Their field is not so crowded and noisy, but the aristocratic game attracts tourists with the opportunity to escape from everyday worries and feel like relaxing in some luxurious foreign resort. </li><li>  Inside the main building, guests will find two spacious rooms - for yoga and for training on all kinds of sports equipment.  Thanks to professional instructors, vacationers can choose for themselves the program that will give them the desired result without harm to health. </li><li>  While men build muscle or entertain themselves with bowling in a separate room, women take care of their beauty in a well-equipped spa.  A relaxing environment is created here with the help of sounds unexpected for this place: the singing of tropical birds or the roar of a mountain waterfall.  Thanks to a scented shower, hot tubs, a walk through the cascade of mini-pools and many other procedures, demanding women are satisfied with the rejuvenating effect, a surge of energy and the excellent mood that they maintain for the duration of the vacation. </li></ul>
