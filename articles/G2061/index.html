This allows you to quickly find the necessary paper, as well as protect them from the influence of external factors.  In order to ensure the systematization and preservation of documents, it is necessary to know how to archive them correctly and what means are needed for this. </p><h2>  Document Archiving </h2><p>  Any area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman life from birth to the last day is accompanied by paperwork.  They can be of different importance, value, storage duration.  But the fact that most of them must be kept in proper condition for a certain time is a fact.  In order to ensure the preservation of papers over a long period, use boxes for storing documents.

Today, blanks for them are available for sale.  As a rule, they are provided for A4 paper.  But there are other sizes.  Some manufacturers offer consumers special paper boxes in which you can store several boxes of paper.

To use them, it is necessary to distribute materials into groups on the subject and collect either in bulk, or in separate files, or in folders, folders or other types of them.  And then pick up the boxes in accordance with the required dimensions.  They are inexpensive, so you can purchase the required number.  Boxes are characterized by spaciousness, durability and environmental friendliness.  Slots for hands allow you to easily take them and carry them to the right place, and the cover (hinged or removable) protects against dust.  Outside on a cardboard it is possible to sign a type of documents.  As a rule, office boxes for storing documents are sold disassembled with printed graphic instructions, so they can be easily assembled or disassembled and, if necessary, hidden in a secluded place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bizpenguin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Office storage of documents" class="if uuid-2877990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70900/2877990.jpg"></div><h2>  Submission of documents for long-term savings </h2><p>  No government agency or private enterprise engaged in serious activities can do without archiving documents.  Administrative, tax, personnel, accounting and other documentation has a different storage period, which is regulated by list No. 578. This is a mandatory procedure, which often provides for a rather long period of savings (up to 75 years).  In this case, all the papers are sorted, stacked in boxes and handed over to the premises provided for these purposes.  In this case, there are special requirements for boxes: they must be made of durable cardboard (ideally, if they meet the requirements of GOST, then they also have a similar warranty period).  In this case, it is better to use archive boxes for storing documents and cardboard boxes.  The latter are a container for several paper containers.  They have ties, as their long-term storage is provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For convenience, you can also pick up boxes for both vertical and horizontal storage of materials.  It should also be taken into account that there are private enterprises ready to manufacture paper containers according to the sizes given by the customer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abcmovingnc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Document Archiving" class="if uuid-2878360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70900/2878360.jpg"></div><h2>  House Archive </h2><p>  Every adult should worry about keeping important papers in the walls of their home.  Indeed, very often you have to provide documents proving your identity, education, ownership of property, etc. In order to avoid unnecessary financial expenses and to be able to use your rights, you need to store warranty cards for household appliances, manuals for its use, and purchase receipts.  Documents may be urgently needed in an emergency: in case of a sudden departure, fire, natural disaster, evacuation of the population ... </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents in order" class="if uuid-2879760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2879760.jpg"></div><p>  Originals and copies of securities should be located in one place, hidden from prying eyes, be sorted and protected from external factors.  Well, if for this purpose a box for storing documents at home will be prepared.  It can be purchased, made by buying a cardboard blank in a store for a small price, or you can adapt any unnecessary box.  If you do not archive the originals, then their painful searches will be provided, and restoration in case of loss will require a lot of time, finances, and most importantly - nerves. </p><h2>  Systematization of home values </h2><p>  In order to purchase boxes for storing papers and documents or to make them yourself, you need to disassemble all materials and sort them into groups, for example: </p><ul><li>  personal documents; </li><li>  evidence of ownership; </li><li>  loan agreements, payments on transactions; </li><li>  papers on the health status of family members, examinations taken, and doctors ‚Äôopinions; </li><li>  materials confirming the payment of goods, warranty cards, etc. </li></ul><p>  It is necessary to take into account the validity period of securities, because some of them may be irrelevant at the time of analysis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.verywellfamily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Systematization of documents at home" class="if uuid-2879378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70900/2879378.jpg"></div><h2>  Material Distribution Tips </h2><p>  Originals and copies can have a different format, so boxes for storing documents can also be made in appropriate sizes.  In this case, the scripts can be sorted: </p><ul><li>  by importance; </li><li>  to size; </li><li>  by period of relevance; </li><li>  by type (workers, homework ...); </li><li>  by events. </li></ul><p>  Such a systematization will save time on searching for the right papers and protect them from children, outsiders and exposure to external factors. </p><h2>  DIY document storage boxes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="paper-design.wonderhowto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY box" class="if uuid-2878585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70900/2878585.jpg"></div><p>  The main difference between family materials and office materials is their size: at work, this is usually the A4 format, while paper houses are very different.  Therefore, you can make boxes for storing documents with your own hands.  There are several options: </p><ol><li>  You can buy a blank in any department of the supermarket and, following the instructions, collect it. </li><li>  If a box of small sizes is needed, then you need to take the drawings, download them, transfer them to cardboard and glue them.  If the specified dimensions do not suit the user, you can transfer the drawing to paper, while reducing the dimensions of the workpiece several times. </li><li>  The easiest option is to take any box that is unnecessary on the farm and take it away for storing the originals. </li><li>  Make according to your own drawing.  So, for example, in order to make a box for personal documents (passports, birth certificates, rights, diplomas), you need to take 2 sheets of strong paper (cardboard), cut from each square the required size, add one additional 1.5 cm to each (for cover).  Then fold each sheet in half and along different diagonals.  In total, you should get 3 lines.  Next, the corners should be bent to the center, and then folded each side so that its edge passes through the middle of the sheet.  The final step is to assemble the paper box along the existing lines and glue the sides. </li></ol><p>  At the same time, any such box can be made to match the color of the interior using colored paper, glue, scissors.  Filled "storage" must be hidden away from direct exposure to sunlight, humidity and children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bredainrete.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY boxes" class="if uuid-2878478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70900/2878478.jpg"></div><p>  Documents are companions of human life.  You can ensure their safety with the help of boxes for storing documents in the archive, and if the financial situation does not allow this, you can construct them yourself, using improvised materials.  And then a calm atmosphere at work and at home is provided. </p>
