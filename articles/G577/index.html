And therefore, each client should be aware of the possible scenarios.  After all, in fact, replenishing the balance of plastic is one of the main components.  Without this operation, paying with a card for goods and services will not work.  Below we will look at a few simple and useful instructions.  They will help to quickly carry out transactions on the specified plastic number both between Sberbank customers and between different banks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kalininlive.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer money to a Sberbank card" class="if uuid-2373581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2373581.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to solve the problem </h2><p>  Today, there are various ways to transfer money to a Sberbank card.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  through mobile banking (USSD, SMS, through the program); </li><li>  using the Sberbank Online system; </li><li>  by transfer via mobile phone (money is debited from the SIM card); </li><li>  replenishment at an ATM or terminal; </li><li>  through the cash desk of a financial organization; </li><li>  using electronic payment systems; </li><li>  through banking of some financial companies (on the Internet); </li><li>  using the services of "Russian Post"; </li><li>  replenishment through intermediaries (usually used when withdrawing money from electronic wallets). </li></ul><p>  We will talk about all these situations below.  Transferring money to a Sberbank card with the right approach will not cause any significant trouble. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  ATM </h2><p>  Let's start with the simplest method.  This is the replenishment of the plastic balance through the Sberbank ATM. </p><p>  To translate ideas into reality you will need: </p><ol><li>  Find a suitable car and insert a card into it.  Indicate "PIN" to start work. </li><li>  Select in the menu "Card Transactions" - "Top up". </li><li>  Deposit funds into the bill acceptor. </li><li>  Confirm procedure. </li></ol><p>  It remains only to wait.  Typically, this technique does not provide any commission, and the money comes to the account very quickly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oceanbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM and account replenishment" class="if uuid-2373578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2373578.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment terminals </h2><p>  In the same way, you will have to act when topping up a Sberbank card account through the terminal.  In this way, it is allowed to transfer funds to any people. </p><p>  The transaction guide looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Get started with the terminal.  To do this, click on the screen. </li><li>  Select in the menu "Operations ..." - "Replenish". </li><li>  Indicate the number of plastic and data on who is replenishing. </li><li>  Deposit money into the receiver.  Usually banknotes are stuck in one piece. </li><li>  Check the details and click on "Next". </li><li>  Take a check about the transfer and wait for the result. </li></ol><p>  If you use the terminals of Sberbank, the percentage for transferring money to a card inside the company is not charged.  Otherwise, the bank may require from 2 to 5% commission. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Branch of a financial company </h2><p>  Transferring money to a Sberbank card without commission is possible.  Especially if you work with clients of Sberbank. </p><p>  Few people know, but to replenish plastic, you can contact any branch of the mentioned financial company.  To do this, you will have to take with you the details of the recipient, as well as a passport. </p><p>  Next, you need to contact the cashier or in a specially designated window in which they help transfer money to accounts tied to cards.  By writing a statement and transferring funds, a person will cope with the task. </p><p>  Important: this technique requires considerable expectation.  Money will be credited to the indicated account within 5 business days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank-gid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer from card to card" class="if uuid-2373575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2373575.jpg"></div><h2>  Other banks and their cash desks </h2><p>  Transferring money to a Sberbank card is possible through cooperation with other banks.  Usually you have to act in the same way as in the case of Sberbank. </p><p>  The difference is that when you contact a third-party financial institution or transfer money to cards of other banks, a commission is charged for the transaction.  Its size will vary depending on what financial companies the action takes place.  It is better to specify more detailed information in the bank personally. </p><h2>  Russian Post to help </h2><p>  Need to transfer money to a Sberbank card?  It is proposed to do this in any branch of the Russian Post.  You need to have money (cash) and an identity card with you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The algorithm of actions will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Come to any branch of the Russian Post. </li><li>  Contact the operator with the appropriate request. </li><li>  Fill out the form.  Usually it records the information about the recipient and the sender. </li><li>  Give a ‚Äústatement‚Äù to a mail officer and transfer the money. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Funds must be credited to the specified account within 7-10 days.  Weekends and holidays are not taken into account in this period. </p><h2>  WebMoney and Transactions </h2><p>  Modern users are actively mastering electronic wallets.  And therefore, it is worth paying attention to the transfer of funds to the card through the appropriate payment systems. </p><p>  For example, the WebMoney service is in demand.  You need to work with it like this: </p><ol><li>  Go to the electronic wallet. </li><li>  Go to the "Payment" block. </li><li>  Click on the line "Transfer to any card." </li><li>  Enter the card number and transfer amount. </li><li>  Indicate payment confirmation code.  He will come by SMS. </li><li>  Complete the procedure. </li></ol><p>  Such a reception allows you to withdraw money to the specified plastic in just a few minutes (the maximum expectation is up to 5 working days).  It is not necessary to work with Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbankami.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaphone and replenishment of Sber" class="if uuid-2373577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2373577.jpg"></div><p>  Important: a fee is charged for the procedure.  Usually it is 4.8-5% + 15 rubles. </p><h2>  "Yandex. Money" and transfers </h2><p>  According to the previously described algorithm, you can work with almost any payment system.  But what about using the Yandex Money service?  This wallet provides a slightly different instruction. </p><p>  It has the following form: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the system using login and password. </li><li>  Click on the "Remove" button.  It is located in the upper right corner of the wallet page, near the nickname. </li><li>  Click on the line "Card of any bank." </li><li>  Enter the details of the recipient.  As a rule, you only need the plastic number. </li><li>  Indicate the amount of replenishment, as well as a comment. </li><li>  Click on "Pay." </li></ol><p>  It is done.  Money comes very fast.  Reception provides a commission.  She reaches 3% + 45 rubles. </p><h2>  Sberbank Internet banking </h2><p>  The next trick is working with the Sberbank Online service.  You will have to connect it to your card first.  After that, you can actively use the services of the resource without a commission. </p><p>  To replenish someone else's bank plastic, you must: </p><ol><li>  Go to the page "Sberbank Online" and go through authorization there.  The user will have to confirm the entry. </li><li>  Visit the "Payments and Transfers" tab. </li><li>  Click on the inscription "Translate". </li><li>  Select the desired item.  For example, "To another client of Sberbank." </li><li>  Fill out the request form.  It provides for the indication of the account number of the recipient or the person‚Äôs bank card, as well as the size of the transaction. </li><li>  Mark the plastic from which you will be charged. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  Quick, easy, convenient.  Thus, you can transfer money to other banks.  But at the same time, a commission will be required for the transaction.  The citizen will see more accurate information when filling out the request form. </p><div class="photo" data-original="leadinlife.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS request to replenish your account" class="if uuid-2373580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2373580.jpg"></div><h2>  From a mobile phone </h2><p>  Next, we consider the transfer of money via phone to a Sberbank card.  This implies a situation in which funds will be debited from the SIM card of a mobile device. </p><p>  How to transfer money from MTS to a Sberbank card?  To do this, you need: </p><ol><li>  Log in on the MTS official page to "Easy Payment" and log in to the service. </li><li>  Click on "Transfers" - "To the card." </li><li>  Indicate the number of the mobile device, the amount of money and set the parameter "Pay by mobile". </li><li>  Print the details of the recipient, following the prompts on the screen. </li><li>  Complete the transaction.  To do this, click on the "Translate" button. </li></ol><p>  The commission in this case will be at least 25 rubles.  As a standard, 4% of the payment amount is charged. </p><p>  Megafon allows you to either use your Personal Account on the official website (the proposed instructions for MTS will help you deal with the process) or send an SMS request to number 3116. </p><p>  The message format will be as follows: card card_number month_end_operation_ year year_end_operation_plastic_payment_total. </p><p>  Beeline also has an SMS request.  It looks like this: payment_system_type plastic_number money.  Send a message to the number 7878. </p><p>  In the first case, the commission will amount to 7.35% + 95 rubles (for transactions up to 5,000) or 260 rubles (above the specified amount).  Beeline foresees a commission of 5.95% + an additional 10 rubles per operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topprocent.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Poison&quot; and account replenishment" class="if uuid-2373582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2373582.jpg"></div><h2>  Mobile banking </h2><p>  We examined the transfer of money from a phone to a Sberbank card.  You can use mobile banking to translate ideas into reality.  In this case, requests will be sent from the mobile phone, and money will be debited from the card. </p><p>  First, you need to activate the Mobile Bank service from Sberbank.  It is further proposed to act as follows: </p><ol><li>  Generate a message of the type: translation last_four_digits_of the recipient_plastic_amount.  Send it to number 900. </li><li>  Write an SMS of the format: translate 4_digit_cards of the sender_card (last if the person has several cards) 4_digiters_ of the recipient_ plastic_number of money.  As in the previous case, SMS is sent to 900. Funds will be credited to the beneficiary's account from the indicated card. </li><li>  Print a letter on the phone: transfer recipient's mobile_phone_number payment_size.  Send to the short number indicated earlier.  The money will be credited to the plastic, tied to the prescribed number. </li></ol><p>  Transferring money through 900 to a Sberbank card is quite easy.  The main thing is that the recipient should also be connected to the Mobile Bank service. </p><h2>  USSD requests </h2><p>  We examined almost all possible scenarios.  Here is a USSD request for replenishment of cards * 900 * 12 * phone_number * amount # - transfer to a Sbera card. </p><p>  You just need to dial it on the phone, and then ‚Äúring‚Äù.  In just a couple of minutes, an alert will come to the end of the processing operation. </p><h2>  Third-party bank services </h2><p>  Transferring money from 900 to a Sberbank card is a simple process.  But if desired, a person can fill out an application on the website of a third-party bank, and then replenish the account of Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.privatbankrf.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Online and transfers" class="if uuid-2373579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2373579.jpg"></div><p>  Usually required: </p><ol><li>  Open the Internet banking page. </li><li>  Indicate the details of the card with which money is debited. </li><li>  Write data about the recipient. </li><li>  Select the transfer amount and confirm the action. </li></ol><p>  The commission in this case is charged different.  Therefore, more accurate information will have to be clarified in each case independently. </p>
