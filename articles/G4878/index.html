    <h2>  Compact devices </h2><p>  If you select a simple model, it is more advisable to stay on a compact refrigerator.  The regulator must be of manual type.  When choosing a device, you should pay attention to the case material.  Modern cameras are made of polymer.  Devices with electronic controllers are very expensive.  For cars, such models are overkill.  The energy consumption indicator for such models is low. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we consider the Waeco car refrigerator, then its specified parameter is 10 kW.  The refrigerator weighs about 4.5 kg.  Its lower part should be lined.  Additionally, pay attention to the cover, which should be firmly fixed. </p>

    <h2>  Inexpensive models </h2><p>  Inexpensive <span>refrigeration units</span> are most often made with tonic upholstery.  At the same time, plastic is used not of the best quality.  Some models are made with low-quality regulators.  As a result, cooling capacity is greatly reduced.  The average volume of the chamber is 25 liters.  This is enough to store liter eggplants.  The flow rate in the devices is high, so such models are not economical. </p><h2>  12v models </h2><p>  12V car refrigerators are produced in various sizes.  Many models are equipped with manual temperature controls.  It is also worth noting that there are devices on the stands.  To recharge the refrigerator you will need a cigarette lighter.  The energy consumption indicator depends on the thickness of the protective layer.  As a rule, models are suitable for short-term storage of drinks, and they should not be taken on tourist trips.  However, it is worth noting reasonable prices for the goods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  15 V devices </h2><p>  15 V refrigeration units are found with and without shelves.  Some models are made with manual controls.  Most refrigerators are powered by a compressor.  It is also worth noting that they use plastic frames.  Covers are installed in different sizes.  If you select devices for tourist trips, then you need to give preference to models with low noise.  It is also important to note the seal that is under the cover.  Modern models are made with several locks.  Seals are made of foam.  The pads in the devices are double walled.  To reduce the noise level, a protective tape is used. </p><h2>  20 V refrigerators </h2><p>  20V car refrigerators consume a lot of energy.  The devices use capacitors that are recharged from the cigarette lighter of the car.  In this case, the device can be stored in the back seat.  Some refrigerators are made without regulators.  They do not have a sensor, they do not stand out with high cooling capacity. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that there are high-quality devices with a plug.  Models work silently and are very popular.  The chamber volume of such refrigerators is approximately 40 liters.  Energy consumption starts at 4 kW.  Cameras can be with shelves and without them.  There are also modifications with special departments for banks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
