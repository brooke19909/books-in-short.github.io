In cafes and restaurants, this payment system is installed quite often.  Let us further consider some of its features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="streetlevelpundit.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cafe deposit reviews" class="if uuid-2631420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2631420.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a deposit in a cafe </h2><p>  If we consider this concept, characterized by simple words, then we can say that it involves the preliminary deposit of a certain amount of money to the institution's account.  During a visit to the selected cafe, the client will be given not only a separate place that you can choose independently from among the available at a certain moment, but also full access to the menu from which you can order a variety of dishes and drinks within the amount paid.  If we consider the concept of a deposit in a cafe in simple words - this is some kind of system for paying a menu bill in a catering establishment. </p><p>  An example of a deposit is an order of a corporate party in an institution.  So, for example, if several work colleagues decided to have a feast in a cafe, then they can visit the institution in advance, agree on a future visit time with its administrator, and then make an advance payment in the desired or established amount.  During the agreed visit to the institution, they have the opportunity to order dishes and drinks from the menu within the prepaid amount.  This is what is called a deposit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Practice shows that this method of payment is very convenient for those who do not want to spend more funds than what is planned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.opposingviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposit in cafe payment methods" class="if uuid-2631422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2631422.jpg"></div><h2>  Is a deposit system profitable? </h2><p>  It should be noted that both the owners of public catering establishments and their visitors consider the deposit system to be very profitable. </p><p>  As for the owners of cafes, recently more and more establishments establish in their rules the mandatory deposit in the event of a table reservation.  This is due to the fact that the only way the owners of institutions can be sure that visitors intend to give a considerable amount of money for their vacation.  Practice shows that some institutions prefer to provide their guests with a small selection of deposit amounts: from 5 to 20 thousand rubles per table (as a rule) - thanks to this, the client has the right to choose his own deposit amount, based on his desires and material capabilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is a deposit in a cafe" class="if uuid-2631415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2631415.jpg"></div><h2>  Deposit and reservation: difference </h2><p>  Making a deposit in a cafe and booking a table in this institution: are these concepts equivalent?  Not really.  We will understand them in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It often happens that the guest of the institution who plans to visit him is worried about whether there will be an empty table by the time he arrives.  In order to avoid the situation of a vain visit, visitors can pre-book for themselves and their company tables for a certain number of people.  Practice shows that this service in most Russian institutions is paid - the cost of its provision will be included in the invoice amount.  When booking a table, you don’t need to deposit money into its balance - the client pays for everything that was ordered from the menu separately, only the amount that will be indicated on the invoice. </p><p>  If we talk about the deposit payment system, then it provides for an automatic reservation of the table, but with advance payment of food and drinks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abunawaf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposit in a cafe is in simple words" class="if uuid-2631417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2631417.jpg"></div><h2>  Refund of a deposit </h2><p>  Having examined in detail what a deposit in a cafe means, some fans of catering establishments are wondering whether the money paid into the institution’s account is refundable.  Answering it, it should be understood that each cafe sets its deposit rules individually.  In any case, representatives of his administration are involved in issues related to the reception and subsequent return of funds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In fact, there are two types of deposits: refundable and non-refundable.  In the event that the first system is installed in the institution, this means that, if necessary, the funds can be returned to the customer in full or in part, in the second case this will not happen, and moreover, the administration of the institution will not bear any responsibility for non-refund. </p><p>  In the event that the client makes a refundable deposit in the cafe, but subsequently it turns out that he is not able to be present at the agreed time, it is necessary to notify the administrator of the establishment in advance about these circumstances.  In this case, the employee must cancel the pre-established reservation and withdraw the deposit.  In order for the customer, who canceled his visit, to be able to collect the funds deposited, he should apply with a document confirming the deposit of money (as a rule, this is a check). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wisegeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is a table deposit in a cafe" class="if uuid-2631419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2631419.jpg"></div><h2>  Deposit pluses </h2><p>  All those lovers of catering establishments who know what table deposit in a cafe is, prefer to use just such a system of paying for leisure in an institution.  This is due to the fact that it has a lot of advantages over the usual booking and payment of the fact. </p><p>  Reviews of deposits in cafes often say that this system of depositing funds is quite convenient.  In the process of fun and relaxation, you don’t have to think about the amount that you have to pay at the end of the evening, as well as about the safety of cash or bank cards brought with you. </p><p>  When making a deposit, both the customer himself and the people who will be present at the institution at the agreed time have the opportunity to think through the desired dishes and drinks in advance.  Moreover, the payment system under consideration provides for the reservation of a table - this ensures the guaranteed availability of a place to rest. </p><p>  The deposit system in some cases allows you to ensure the safety of the budget.  Moreover, it guarantees full payment by the client of everything that was ordered by him. </p><h2>  Cons of deposit </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the deposit system has a lot of advantages, it also has negative features, which are mentioned in the reviews of cafe visitors, which they leave on various forums and social networks. </p><p>  The largest number of negative reviews receive non-refundable deposits.  It should be noted that far from all institutions just such a system is installed, but nevertheless, among the total number of them there are those that completely refuse to meet their clients. </p><p>  Many visitors to institutions in their comments note that a significant disadvantage of this system is that the difference between the amount deposited and used is not returned to guests. </p><p>  In some reviews, the negative point is the need for a regular calculation of the cost of food and drinks in order to meet the limits of the amount paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposit in a cafe" class="if uuid-2631410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2631410.jpg"></div><h2>  Cash deposit </h2><p>  Having dealt with in detail what the deposit in the cafe means, you should more clearly determine which ways you can pay the specified amount.  In practice, visitors to establishments often do this with cash.  The big minus is that to deposit money in this way you have to personally come to the institution. </p><p>  It should be noted that in case of using a refundable deposit, funds deposited can be returned in cash, personally to the customer.  To do this, he will need to provide the administration officer authorized to solve financial issues at the institution, a document confirming payment (check). </p><h2>  Cashless deposit </h2><p>  Today, most institutions establish the possibility of making a cashless deposit.  To conduct it, you should visit the cafe’s official website and, by going to the appropriate section, deposit funds following the instructions provided there.  As a rule, customers can use electronic payment or banking systems for this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kaplaninternational.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What does a deposit in a cafe mean" class="if uuid-2631418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2631418.jpg"></div><p>  If it is necessary to return the deposit, all the funds made by the customer will be returned to the bank account from which the payment was made. </p>
