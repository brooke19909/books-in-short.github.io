  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Structural Features of Metal Atoms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The table of chemical elements contains the names and characteristics of one hundred and five different substances.  The bulk of them are metals.  These chemical elements are quite widespread on our planet.  Metals can be found in various compounds in the atmosphere and in the bowels of the earth, in the composition of living organisms and plants, as well as in the waters of oceans, seas of lakes and rivers.  The properties of these chemical elements are very specific.  Their characteristics have pronounced differences from substances of other groups.  So, if an element belongs to the category of metal, then it must necessarily have a certain list of properties: </p><p>  - the presence of a dense crystalline structure; <br>  - pronounced brilliance; <br>  - ability to electrical conductivity; <br>  - high degree of thermal conductivity; <br>  - reduced ability to conduct electricity with an increase in thermal conditions; <br>  - easy return of electrons; <br>  - ductility, as well as malleability; <br>  - the ability to form various alloys. </p><p>  The structure of metals, which is defined by the modern <span>scientific worldview,</span> is a <span>crystal lattice.</span>  It is based on free electrons and ions with a positive charge.  The crystal itself is depicted in the form of a lattice having a spatial structure.  The nodes of this system are occupied by ions, and between them are electrons with a high ability to move.  <span>The structure of</span> metal <span>atoms</span> allows active particles to constantly move.  Electrons make transitions between atoms, and also revolve around their nuclei.  Knowing the structural features of metal atoms, the occurrence of an electric current in them can be easily explained.  It appears under the influence of a potential difference, when electrons that do not have bonds with ions begin an ordered motion in one direction. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The structural features of metal atoms also determine the high thermal conductivity of these elements.  Electrons that make continuous motion exchange energy with ions at the moment of collision with the latter.  Elements located in the nodes of the crystal lattice transmit vibrations to neighboring particles, those to the next and so on.  As a result of this process, the thermal regime of the metal is balanced.  As a result, the temperature of the entire mass becomes the same. </p><p>  The structural features of metal atoms are the existence of <span>covalent bonds</span> between them.  The pendant force is also present in the crystal lattice, which attracts electrons and ions.  This is the <span>metal bond</span> that exists between the particles of the element.  This type of compound is present even in the presence of a liquid state of the substance.  Based on this, we can conclude that not individual particles possess a metal bond.  It is owned by their units. </p><p>  From the point of view of chemistry, the structural features of metal atoms consist in the unimpeded transfer of valence electrons and the transition to ions.  As a result of this, the substance itself serves as an energy reducing agent.  The ability to give their electrons to various metals is manifested in varying degrees.  The easier this process is, the more active the element is considered.  Moreover, its interaction with other substances occurs as energetically as possible.  There are a number of tensions that have been experimentally compiled by Beketov, a Russian chemical scientist.  Metals in this list are in a certain sequence, which characterizes the decrease in their chemical ability to activity.  Based on a number of stresses, you can determine the properties of the element: </p><p>  - with a decrease in the <span>electrode potential of the</span> metal, its reduction function increases; <br>  - metals are able to displace from salt solutions those elements that are located after them in a series of stresses; <br>  - metals located in the activity list to the left of hydrogen can displace it from acid solutions. </p>
