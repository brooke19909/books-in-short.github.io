Numerous tourists from Russia come here on vacation, hoping to have a good and inexpensive vacation.  One of the most popular resorts in Turkey is Alanya.  The local infrastructure offers travelers a wide variety of leisure options.  In addition, in Alanya there are plenty of budget hotels and expensive top-class hotels.  If you are looking for something average in terms of service, then pay attention to the Sultan Sipahi Resort Hotel 4 * complex, which we will cover in detail in this article. </p><h2>  Holidays in Alanya </h2><p>  This popular Turkish resort is aimed at different categories of tourists.  Perhaps its only drawback is only the great distance from large airports, so travelers are forced to get to their hotels for several hours.  The high season here begins at the end of April and lasts until the end of November.  At the same time, in winter in Alanya, the temperature keeps above zero, but swimming in the sea and sunbathing is no longer possible.  The resort itself is divided into several zones, among which there are party areas, and remote places for a relaxing holiday. </p><p>  The popularity of the city brought its beaches, which are considered almost the cleanest in the country.  Most of them are marked with special Blue Flags.  There are many historical sights here.  Coming here, you should definitely visit the Red Tower, built in the XII century, or the Byzantine fortress Ich-Kale.  Alanya also has its own mosque and shipyard, built in 1228. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city has a huge number of shops, shopping centers, restaurants and cafes.  There is also a Turkish market.  If you want to save on the purchase of clothes, shoes or souvenirs, it is best to go to the suburbs.  In Alanya, there are many minibuses, and tourists can also order a taxi.  A contact dolphinarium is open for children near the resort, and 30 km from Alanya is a huge water park, which is considered one of the largest in Turkey. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The favorable location of the hotel <span>is</span> the key to a good rest.  Sultan Sipahi Resort 4 * hotel is built in the center of Alanya, on the Mediterranean coast.  Alanya‚Äôs most popular beach, Cleopatra, is just 50 meters away.  To get to it, tourists only need to cross the road, which is equipped with an underpass.  Near the hotel there is a dessert cafe and pizzeria.  A little further removed are the water park, sports hall and supermarket. </p><p>  The nearest airport is in the suburbs of Gazipasa, which is about 40 km from Alanya.  Get from there to the Sultan Sipahi Resort Hotel 4 * in Turkey in 1 hour.  However, more often tourists fly to Antalya airport, because flights there are much cheaper.  It is 125 km away, so the trip to the resort can take about three hours by bus.  By taxi or rented car, travel time will be reduced, but, in turn, the cost of the trip will increase significantly. </p><h2>  Important hotel and check-in information </h2><p>  It is difficult to call the Sultan Sipahi Resort Hotel 4 * (Alanya) hotel new, because it was built in 1996.  However, this does not affect the condition of the rooms and other public areas.  Complete renovation of the complex was completed in 2014.  The hotel has its own vast territory of 27,500 square meters.  m. It has a spacious swimming pool, sun terrace and several public buildings.  Guests can be accommodated in any of the three six-story buildings.  In total, the hotel has 215 rooms, so this place can not be called quiet and not crowded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  But, of course, it was not without criticism.  When choosing this hotel for your vacation, be sure to pay attention to the following disadvantages that can ruin your vacation experience: </p><ul><li>  old rooms that have not been renovated for a long time; </li><li>  almost all services at the hotel are provided for a fee, in addition, staff constantly begs for tips; </li><li>  huge lines in the restaurant, while food is not enough for all guests; </li><li>  the beach can hardly be called clean, the sand on it is strewn with numerous butts and plastic glasses; </li><li>  in the sea you can see fuel oil and oil stains. </li></ul><p>  Thus, Sultan Sipahi Resort Hotel 4 * <span>is</span> an inexpensive Turkish hotel that provides a standard set of entertainment and services.  It has many shortcomings, but is perfect for budget accommodation in the center of Alanya. </p>
