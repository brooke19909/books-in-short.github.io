    <p>  The Romanov clan originates in the 16th century, from Roman Yuryevich Zakharyin.  He had five children who gave birth to numerous offspring that have survived to this day.  But the fact is that most descendants no longer bear this surname, that is, they were born on the maternal side.  Representatives of the dynasty are considered only descendants of the Romanov clan on the male line, who bear the old name. </p><p>  Boys in the family were born less often, and many were childless.  Because of this, the royal family was almost interrupted.  The branch was revived by Paul I. All the living descendants of the Romanovs are the heirs of Emperor Pavel Petrovich, <span>son of Catherine II.</span> </p><h2>  Branching a Family Tree </h2>

He was married twice, but the marriages were childless.

Now live the direct descendants of the Romanov-Ilyinsky Dmitry Pavlovich and Mikhail Pavlovich.  Unfortunately, they are both childless, and with their passing away this line will be suppressed. </li><li>  Konstantinovichi - the line originates from Konstantin Nikolaevich Romanov.  The last direct descendant of the Romanovs in the male line died in 1992, and the branch was cut short. </li><li>  Nikolaevich - descended from Romanov Nikolai Nikolaevich.  To this day, a direct descendant of this branch, Dmitry Romanovich, lives and lives.  He has no heirs, so the line is fading. </li><li>  Mikhailovich - the heirs of Mikhail Nikolaevich Romanov.  It is to this branch that the remaining Romanov men live today.  This gives hope to the Romanov family for survival. </li></ul><h2>  Where are the descendants of the Romanovs today? </h2>

Yes, this great family has heirs along the male and female lines.  Some branches have already been broken, other lines will soon fade away, but the royal family still has hope for survival. </p><p>  But where do the descendants of the Romanovs live?  They are scattered around the planet.  Most of them do not know the Russian language and have never been to the homeland of their ancestors.  Someone's names are completely different.  Many became acquainted with Russia exclusively from books or from news reports on television channels.  And yet, some of them are in their historical homeland, they are engaged in charity work here and consider themselves Russian at heart. </p><p>  To the question whether the descendants of the Romanovs remained, one can answer that today only about thirty known offspring of the royal family live in the world.  Of these, only two can be considered purebred, because their parents married according to the laws of the dynasty.  It is these two who can consider themselves full representatives of the Imperial House.  In 1992, they were issued Russian passports in exchange for refugee passports, for which they had lived abroad until that time.  Funds received as sponsorship from Russia allow family members to pay visits to their homeland. </p><p>  It is not known how many people live in the world who have Romanov‚Äôs blood flowing in their veins, but they don‚Äôt belong to the genus, because they came from the female side or from extramarital affairs.  Nevertheless, genetically, they also belong to an ancient surname. </p><h2>  Head of the Imperial House </h2>

He was born in France on May 17, 1926. </p><p>  Since 1936 he <span>lived with his parents</span> in Italy, and later in Egypt.  In Alexandria, he worked at a Ford automobile plant: he worked as a mechanic, sold cars.  Upon returning to sunny Italy, he worked as a secretary in a ship company. </p><p>  He visited Russia for the first time in the distant 1953 as a tourist.  When he married in Denmark with his first wife Johanna von Kaufmann, he settled in Copenhagen and served in a bank there for more than 30 years. </p><p>  All the numerous members of the royal family call him the Head of the House, only the branch of the Kirillovich believes that he does not have legal rights to the throne due to the fact that his father was born in an unequal marriage (Kirillovich, the heirs of Alexander II - this is Princess Maria Vladimirovna, who herself claims for the title of the head of the Imperial House, and her son George Mikhailovich, claiming the title of crown prince). </p><p>  A long-standing hobby of Dmitry Romanovich are orders and medals of different countries.  He has a large collection of awards, about which he writes a book. </p><p>  The second time he was married in the Russian city of Kostroma with Dorrit Reventrow, a Danish translator, in July 1993.  He has no children, therefore, when another last direct descendant of the Romanovs leaves the world, the Nikolaevich branch is cut short. </p><h2>  Legitimate members of the house, fading branch of Alexandrovich </h2><p>  Today, such true representatives of the royal family are alive (on the male line from legal marriages, direct descendants of Paul I and Nicholas II, who bear the royal surname, the title of prince and belong to the line of the Alexandrovichs): </p><ul><li>  Romanov-Ilyinsky Dmitry Pavlovich, b. 1954  - The direct heir to Alexander the Second on the male line, lives in the United States, has 3 daughters, all are married and have changed their names. </li><li>  Romanov-Ilyinsky Mikhail Pavlovich, b. 1959  - The half-younger younger brother of Prince Dmitry Pavlovich, also lives in the United States, has a daughter. </li></ul><p>  If the direct descendants of the Romanovs do not become fathers of sons, then the line of the Alexandrovichs will be interrupted. </p><h2>  Direct descendants, princes and possible successors of the Romanov clan - the most prolific branch of the Mikhailovich </h2>

Until 1985, she was married to Prince Franz Wilhelm of Prussia, from whom in 1981 she gave birth to her only son George.  At birth, he was given the patronymic of Mikhailovich and the surname Romanov. </li><li>  Georgy Mikhailovich, b. 1981  - the son of Princess Romanova Maria Vladimirovna and Prince of Prussia, claims to be the crown prince, but most of the representatives of the Romanovs house rightly do not recognize his rights, since he is not a descendant in a direct male line, namely, the inheritance right is transferred through the male line.  His birth is a joyful event in the Prussian palace. </li><li>  Princess Elena Sergeevna Romanova (after her husband Nirot), born 1929, lives in France, one of the last representatives of the Romanovs house, belongs to the Alexandrovich line. </li><li>  <span>Georgy Aleksandrovich Yurievsky,</span> b. 1961  - The legitimate heir of Alexander the Second, now lives in Switzerland.  His grandfather George was the illegitimate son of the Emperor‚Äôs relationship with Princess Dolgorukova.  After the relationship was legalized, all the children of Dolgorukova were recognized as legitimate from Alexander II, but the surname was Yuryevsky.  Therefore, de jure George (Hans-Georg) does not belong to the house of the Romanovs, although de facto he is the last descendant of the Romanov dynasty on the male line of the Alexandrovichs. </li><li>  Princess Tatyana Mikhailovna, b. 1986  - belongs to the house of the Romanovs on the line of Mikhailovich, but as soon as she gets married and changes her surname, she loses all rights.  Lives in Paris. </li><li>  Princess Alexandra Rostislavovna, b. 1983  - also a hereditary descendant of a branch of the Mikhailovich, not married, lives in the United States. </li><li>  Princess Karline Nikolaevna, born 2000  - is the legal representative of the Imperial House on the line of Mikhailovich, is single, lives in the USA, </li><li>  Princess Chelly Nikolaevna, b. 2003  - A direct descendant of the royal family, single, US citizen. </li><li>  Princess Madison Danilovna, b. 2007  - along the line of Mikhailovich, he is a legal family member, lives in the USA. </li></ul><h2>  The union of the Romanov clan </h2>

    <p>  Born on August 17, 1917 in Finland, in exile with Sovereign Kirill Vladimirovich.  He was raised by a truly Russian man.  He was fluent in Russian, many European languages, knew the history of Russia perfectly, was a well-educated erudite person and felt true pride that belongs to Russia. </p><p>  At twenty, the last direct descendant of the Romanovs in the male line became the Head of the Dynasty.  It was enough for him to conclude an unequal marriage, and by the 21st century the legal members of the imperial family would no longer be left. </p><p>  But he met Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Mukhranska, daughter of the Head of the Georgian Royal House, who became his legal wife in 1948.  In this marriage, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna was born in Madrid. </p><p>  For several decades he was the Head of the Russian Imperial House and, by his own decree, announced the right of his daughter, who was legally married, to inherit the throne. </p><p>  In May 1992, he was buried in St. Petersburg in the presence of many family members. </p><h2>  Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna </h2>

    <p>  Dmitry Pavlovich, born in 1954, and Mikhail Pavlovich, born in 1960 </p><p>  Dmitry Pavlovich is married to Martha Merry MacDowell, b. 1952, has 3 daughters: Katrina, Victoria, Lela. </p><p>  Mikhail Pavlovich was married three times.  The first marriage is with Marches Mary Lowe, the second with Paula Gay Mair and the third with Lisa Mary Schisler.  In the third marriage, daughter Alexis was born. </p><p>  Currently, the descendants of the Romanov dynasty live in the United States, recognize the legality of the rights of members of the Imperial House to the Russian throne.  Princess Maria Vladimirovna recognized their right to be called princes.  Dmitry Romanovsky-Ilyinsky is recognized by her as the senior representative of the masculine gender of all the descendants of the Romanovs, regardless of what kind of marriages they entered into. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  About a hundred years in Russia there is no monarchy.  But to this day, someone breaks the spears, arguing about which of the living descendants of the imperial family has the legal right to the Russian throne.  Someone today resolutely demands the return of the monarchy.  And even if this question is not simple, since laws and decrees regarding succession issues are interpreted differently, disputes will continue.  But they can be described in one Russian proverb: the descendants of the Romanovs, whose photos are presented in the article, "share the skin of an unkilled bear." </p>
