It is not enough to have a Schengen visa to get there.  Only males are allowed into Saint Athos, and even then not all of them.  Pilgrims need a diamonitirion to sail to the monastic republic.  This document is colloquially called the "Athos visa."  But what does Uranopolis (Greece) have to do with it?  And despite the fact that it is in this city that this written permission is issued to visit the monastic republic.  And the ships go to Saint Athos precisely from the pier of Uranopolis.  Translated from classical Greek, its name means "heavenly city."  And he deserves to get to know him better, and not to perceive it as a transit point.  Although now the city is called the "Gateway to Heaven" (because of the "checkpoint" with Athos), but it is also a first-class sea resort.  And in this article we will talk about its attractions. </p>

    <h2>  History of the city.  Antiquity </h2><p>  Uranopolis (Greece) cannot boast as ancient an origin as Athens or Crete.  But we reliably know about who, how and why founded this city.  In three hundred and fifteen BC, the philosopher Alexarch, son of the king of Antipater and the younger brother of Cassander, set out to build an ideal policy in which representatives of various states, free and slaves, lived on equal terms.  To make his dream come true, he asked a small piece of land from his older brother, the ruler of Macedonia.  Cassander, accustomed to his brother's eccentricities, allocated him a plot of thirty stages in circumference.  The landfill for the "Heavenly City" was located in Halkidik, near Mount Athos, on the isthmus, where Xerxes once ordered to dig a canal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alexarchus ordered the inhabitants of Uranopolis to speak a special language, which he himself invented.  As a polyglot, he took roots from Eastern languages, and grammar and endings of words from Western languages.  The city minted its coin, which depicted Aphrodite Urania.  The attempt at linguistic syncretism, as well as the management of the city-state through the Council of Philosophers, failed.  Cassander <span>called his brother</span> crazy.  Alexarch, offended, moved his ideal city to Pamphylia (modern Turkey). </p>

    <h2>  Middle Ages and Modernity </h2><p>  After the Romans captured Halkidiki in one hundred and sixty-eighth year BC, times of economic decline remained for the remaining inhabitants of Uranopolis.  Christianity began to spread very early on these lands.  But the settlements were seriously damaged by the invasions of the Goths, Huns and other conquerors. </p><p>  The first hermits built their monasteries on Mount Athos in the ninth century to hide from the political and military squabbles of the lower world.  Gradually, the Orthodox monastic republic began to occupy most of Aion Oros - the peninsula on which Uranopolis (Greece) is located.  The modern resort lies a little away from the ancient city.  It formed around the Byzantine tower on the former lands of <span>Vatopedi Monastery</span> in the thirteenth century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Uranopolis (Greece): attractions </h2><p>  The proximity to Karey, the capital of the monastic republic on Mount Athos, is not the only tourist attraction of the city.  ‚ÄúVisiting card‚Äù, a certain symbol of Uranopolis is the watchtower Prosforiou, which was erected in 1344 on the site of the old construction of the monastery.  Inside is now the exposition of the Archaeological Museum. </p><p>  Near the border with Athos, you can see the ruins of the monastery city of Libra (Frankish Castle).  It was founded in the tenth century and was surrounded by a wall with gates and towers.  Despite such powerful fortifications, in 1198 the monastery fell under the onslaught of the troops of Vasileus Alexis III. </p><p>  Another attraction of Uranopolis is the Xerxes Canal.  It was dug in four hundred and eighty BC to shorten the way for ships sailing from Aion Oros Bay to the Aegean Sea (otherwise they would have been able to go around the peninsula).  This channel can be seen near Nea Roda.  This village is also famous for its excellent sandy beach.  The channel is currently down. </p>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  What does Uranopolis (Greece) look like?  Photos show the city on the isthmus of the peninsula.  Women ordered the path to Mount Athos.  From the west, the peninsula is washed by Ayon Oros Bay, and from the south and east by the Aegean Sea.  It is quite mountainous and wooded, and the Mediterranean climate makes it even more beautiful. </p><p>  One hundred thirty-two kilometers north-west of Uranopolis is the second largest city of Greece, Thessaloniki, but bucolics reign here.  Fans of quiet sandy beaches and comfortable hotels love to relax at the resort.  But they prefer to go to Amoliani.  This is the only inhabited island in Halkidiki.  It is connected with Uranopolis by ferry.  Amoliani is stunning with its miraculous beauty, and its coast is dotted with incomparable beaches.  Not far from it are six "Donkey" islands - Drenia.  To get to the beaches where you can feel like Robinson Crusoe is possible only by boat from Amoliani. </p>

    <h2>  Hotels in Uranopolis (Greece) </h2><p>  The resort is popular not only among pilgrims.  According to reviews, it is also loved by the people of Greece themselves, arriving on weekends to spend time on the clear sea away from the bustle of Thessaloniki.  Therefore, the housing offer here is truly huge.  Here you can easily choose five-star front-line hotels and budget hotels.  Reviews praise the chic complex ‚ÄúFeoxenia‚Äù (from four thousand rubles per room per night).  The most popular hotels in Uranopolis (Greece) are those whose balconies offer a bewitching view of the <span>monasteries of Athos</span> or the island of Amoliani.  The praise of tourists was awarded to "Macedonia", "Uranopolis Princess", "Arkhodariki", "Sun Set" and "Avra". </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The city of Uranopolis (Greece) is the proud owner of a sandy coast and a shallow, well-heated bay.  Maybe, in terms of linguistic syncretism and equalizing the rights of all people, the project of the philosopher Alexarch failed, but he chose the place for the future resort.  Reviews say that almost the entire coast in the city belongs to taverns.  They can order dishes, but also use the sunbed and shade from the umbrella. </p><p>  You can also find a free municipal beach.  It is also well-maintained, like those that belong to hotels and taverns, just more people there.  Well, if you want to soak up the sand away from the crowd, despite the high tourist season, reviews are advised to go to the Donkey Islands or Amoliani. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Uranopolis (Greece) is located too close to St. Athos, the monastic republic, and this leaves a certain imprint on the range of tourist services.  There are few nightclubs and discos.  But on the beaches there is the opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities: water skiing, catamarans, windsurfing, yachting, fishing.  Some hotels in the city have mini-water parks, available at an additional cost to all comers.  If the water slides of the hotels didn‚Äôt cause an adrenaline rush, you can try your luck at Waterland, which is located in Tagarades, near Thessaloniki.  Reviews are full of references to various delicacies served in the Greek taverns of Uranopolis. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  A foreign tourist, even a male, has little chance of visiting the Republic of Athos.  Of the one hundred and ten guests who can step on a holy mountain daily, 100 should be Greeks.  You need to order an ‚ÄúAthos visa‚Äù at the pilgrimage center in Thessaloniki.  But everyone, including women, can freely take a boat trip around the Aion-Oros peninsula, on the isthmus of which is Uranopolis (Greece).  Reviews say that during this tour you can see seven of the twenty monasteries located on Mount Athos.  Ancient Thessaloniki will take all day curious tourists.  This city has many historical and cultural attractions.  Not far from Thessaloniki is the <span>Petralona Cave,</span> where traces of the presence of Cro-Magnons were discovered.  You can also take a fascinating tour to the monasteries of Meteora, of which two are women. </p>
