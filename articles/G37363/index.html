How to make a festive decoration of the room with your own hands?  Masters use a variety of types of paper.  This is a thin cigarette, from which it is easy to make honeycomb balls, and a denser colored one - for making balls composed of many circles of the same size. </p><p>  You can hang ready-made crafts in the form of a garland for the New Year or for congratulations on a birthday, fixed at different levels above a window or under the ceiling.  It is interesting to make floral volumetric compositions from paper out of corrugated fan circles.  It‚Äôs easy to complete the circles by simply folding the sheet ‚Äúaccordion‚Äù, so even preschool children can create a beautiful volumetric flower.  They can be made ribbed or cut the edges in a semicircle or sharp corners, then the circle appears in a new look.  Various crafts can be varied using different colors, varying notches at the edges or adding contrasting cores. </p><p>  In this article, we will consider some of the simplest options for how to make a volume circle from paper.  A step-by-step description of the work will help to cope with the task much easier and make crafts faster and better.  Carefully consider the finished result of the work of the masters in the photographs presented. </p><h2>  Craft from many circles </h2><p>  From thick colored paper, cut a large number of identical circles.  You can use one color of the material or all elements are multicolored.  Then, each detail will be folded in half and smooth the fold well.  Leave one circle intact.  On it, as a basis, phased gluing of volumetric circle elements from paper will be performed.  How to make such a craft?  Very simple!  When assembling glue is applied only to one, the lower half of each circle.  The upper part remains free and gives the craft volume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volume circle made of paper" class="if uuid-3253062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253062.jpg"></div><p>  When gluing parts, the acute angle of the semicircle should touch the center point of the base.  The rest are alternately inserted inward with a shift by the same distance.  The middle is decorated with a button, beads or pebbles. </p><h2>  Corrugated volumetric circles </h2><p>  The video below in the article shows the manufacture of a volume circle from paper with your own hands.  If you want to make a flower from the resulting product, then in the center of the fan circle, stick a tight circle of cardboard and decorate it with pieces of corrugated paper as shown by the master in the video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="1zweVctPsK4" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zweVctPsK4&amp;t=1s" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/8/2/3/7/18237.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, the work is simple to carry out, besides it can be diversified by arranging the edges of folded "accordion" paper to your liking. </p><h2>  Garland Balls </h2><p>  Let's look at how to make a three-dimensional circle of paper for the New Year's garland.  It is advisable to choose thick paper as the material so that the edges of the circles do not curl and do not spoil the appearance of the craft.  Using a compass, draw a template on cardboard and, applying it to paper folded several times, circle its contours with a simple pencil.  Thus, you can cut many identical elements at once. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rdpnorthernalbania.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volume circles - garland" class="if uuid-3253051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253051.jpg"></div><p>  You can make a voluminous circle from circles of different colors, then the garland will turn motley and brighter.  Each element needs to be bent in half and smooth out the fold of paper with your fingers or a ruler.  Then one half is smeared with a glue stick and glued to half of the second element.  When many parts are pasted, connect the first part to the last, first inserting a thread or tape inside. </p><h2>  Production of balls honeycombs </h2><p>  This craft is best done from tissue paper, although some make honeycomb balls from double-sided colored paper.  Our sample shows the implementation of the first option, that is, from a large number of identical thin rectangles.  First you need to make a drawn template on a thick sheet of cardboard with two markers of different colors, placing the lines at an equal distance in turn.  For convenience, both the template and the first sheet are fixed to the base with masking tape, gluing it at the corners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gatheringbeauty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make honeycomb balls" class="if uuid-3253046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253046.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to connect a large number of rectangles, sticking sheets one on top of the other.  To do this, first PVA glue is smeared with thin strips along the red lines of the template, and on the next part, strips are drawn according to the blue markings.  The more elements, the more magnificent the volume circle will be.  Must be at least 20 pieces. </p><h2>  Last stage of work </h2><p>  When all the prepared paper has found its place in the stack, draw a suitable-sized semicircle, attach it to the edge of the blank and circle around the contours with a simple pencil.  Cut all the paper with scissors along the intended line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gatheringbeauty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="honeycomb balls" class="if uuid-3253047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3253047.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to draw the missing lines with glue and connect the first and last semicircle with each other.  To be able to hang the honeycomb balls on a thread, before assembling, insert the loop inward and fix it with glue.  Be sure to flush the side joint so that the ball holds a well round shape. </p><p>  The larger the size of the volume circle, the more you need to draw strips of glue.  A small ball can be made of thicker paper, drawing in turn only the center line of the semicircle with glue, and on the next part put 2 lines that are removed to the edges at an equal distance from the center. </p><p>  We introduced readers to several popular options for making volume circles from a sheet of paper.  As you can see, this is easy.  The main thing is to want to create a beautiful craft on your own.  Try it, you will surely succeed! </p>
