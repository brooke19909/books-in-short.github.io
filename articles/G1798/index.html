In other words, credit refinancing acts as a process of ‚Äútransferring‚Äù funds from one credit account to another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, if an individual wants to refinance loans of other banks with Tinkoff Bank, the debt will be transferred to the Platinum card. </p><h2>  What do individuals need to know? </h2><p>  Tinkoff banking institution does not charge interest for using a current account if funds are sent from another financial institution.  Thus, the institution does everything so that customers with the greatest comfort can repay the debts of other banks. </p><p>  If this financial institution offers a lower interest rate than it was before, then you can save significantly, especially given the annual return.  You can apply for refinancing at Tinkoff Bank online and at the following branches: </p><ul><li>  VTB Bank; </li><li>  Sberbank; </li><li>  Russian Agricultural Bank; </li><li>  Alfa Bank. </li></ul><p>  The main plus of credit refinancing of other banks at Tinkoff is a significant significant reduction in the amount of interest on outstanding debts.
