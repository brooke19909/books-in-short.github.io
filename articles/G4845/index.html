In addition, the climate is quite warm in summers and mild winters.  This is what irresistible Hungary entails.  Photos of its attractions, unfortunately, do not always convey their true beauty.  Seeing all this with my own eyes is, of course, much more interesting.  Therefore, this state has been and remains popular among tourists from all over the world.
