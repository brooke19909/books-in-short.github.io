Usually simple goes into English and vice versa (photo 1).  With a fairly dense knitting, it may seem that the fabric consists only of facial loops.  But in fact, it is worth stretching it a little to the sides, and the wrong loops will appear.  We will analyze in more detail how to perform the simplest gum, guided by the scheme (photo 2).  Type an odd number of loops on the knitting needles, taking into account the total number of edge loops.  Start the row with the wrong loop and end with it.  Edge knit only at the end of the row, and in the beginning just take off the knitting needle.  Alternate front loops with wrong ones.  The reverse side fits in the picture.  Other types of gum, knitting according to the description, will allow you to get slightly different in appearance ornaments.  Check out some of them, starting with the simplest. </p>

    <h2>  Cross "corrugation" </h2><p>  <span>Knitting gum</span> in this way gives a slightly different result.  Cross elastic, as a rule, is not used to design, for example, the bottom of the sleeves of blouses or jumpers.  Most often, scarves, hats or skirts are knitted with such an ornament.  Perform it even easier than regular gum.  To do this, knit an even number of rows with the <span>front surface</span> - two or four.  Then change the pattern to the wrong one.  Similarly, knit the same number of rows, getting an equal width of a piece of canvas.  On the finished sample, the front rows will be inside the “wave”, as if hiding under it.  You need to finish knitting after completing the next facial interval.  Do this with a hook so that there is no embossed hem.  This ornament is very simple in execution.  During operation, an additional circuit is not required.  The product looks quite original, in the manufacture of which a transverse elastic band is used, knitted in two colors, which alternate when changing the facial ornament to the wrong one and vice versa. <strong></strong></p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2></h2><h2>  English gum </h2><p>  This knitting is very popular, because in appearance it is much like neat elements on “purchased” knitwear.  The second distinctive feature of the ornament is the same appearance both on the front side of the product and on the wrong side.  How is knitting <span>English gum</span> knitting?  Take the principle of ordinary knitting as a basis.  When working, add extra yarn overlay, overlaying them on the back of the removed loops.  On the reverse side of the canvas, then this combination is knitted together with the front.  Wrong elements - the same as on the front side.  There are some options for performing English gum, in which the work is somewhat simplified.  For example, you can get the canvas on the front side is the same, but from the inside it will already be another knitting, without crochets.  Other loops fit in the pattern.  You can arrange the product with other ornaments, performing them according to descriptions or diagrams. </p>

    <h2>  Elastic band "Zigzag" </h2><p>  Try to make the fabric using a technology similar to knitting a simple elastic band (photo 3).  To do this, dial the number of loops multiple of two (excluding the edge).  In a similar way, other similar types of rubber bands are made with knitting needles.  Among them is a very original knitting “Zigzag” (photo 4).  The total number of loops should be divided by three.  A wave-like elastic is obtained by shifting the loops alternately left and right.  Relying on the proposed scheme, it is very easy to do the job (photo 5).  All loops on the reverse side of the fabric are knitted according to the scheme: over the wrong side - wrong side, over the front side - front.  In the event that the displacement is performed on the other hand, the pattern will be more clear, and the zigzags - not so elongated.  With this method, it is more advisable to knit in the first row the alternation of four to five loops.  To determine which pattern is more suitable for your product, you need to perform a small sample, and only then use it to calculate the required number of loops. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How to process the edge </h2><p>  If you are performing a product according to a finished pattern and in addition you have photos of models, you can not think about the problem of design at the end of knitting.  With improvisation, things are completely different.  Therefore, you need to know some secrets.  Let's talk about the main one - a combination of different bindings with each other.  When moving from one pattern, the density can change significantly.  For example, a canvas with a front smooth surface, “transformed” into a dense elastic band with loops removed, tapers off by almost a quarter in width.  There may be a reverse situation - to obtain a sample with multiple braids and weaves, you need a larger number of loops than with ordinary denticles.  Knitting English gum with knitting needles, as a rule, expands the fabric.  This means that to create a beautiful transition to the gum, you must definitely complete the sample.  One of the commonly used edge design options is a hollow <span>(double) elastic band.</span> </p><h2></h2><h2>  How does a hollow elastic band fit with knitting needles (photo 6)? </h2><p>  What is the main feature of the work?  If you look at it, it actually turns out not a completely bound gum, but two canvases with a common base and free sides from the inside of the work.  Dial the number of loops, a multiple of two, and perform the first row of the type of regular gum.  The second and subsequent fit as follows: knit the front, and remove the wrong side by stretching the thread in front of it.  Having reached the end, beautifully shape the edge.  Keep in mind that the hem at the beginning of the row does not knit.  Thanks to this, the edge is neat.  In fact, two canvases are knitted at the same time.  Using this property, you can design, for example, the bar on the blouse is very original.  Knit on the front side with yarn of one color, and on the inside of the other.  Then the hem will be hollow not only inside, but also from the edges.  A drawstring can be pulled into this makeshift belt.  Often the throats and edges of hoods are shaped like this, especially on children's products. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Features of the work in a circle </h2><p>  Double knitting with elastic needles will look different if, for example, the neck is trimmed.  In this case, it is important not to confuse the procedure.  To do this, mark with a pin or contrasting thread the joints of the rows.  When knitting the first circle, make all the loops face, and the rest, alternating, take off the knitting needle.  Having reached the mark, go to the second wall of the gum and do the wrong side.  When loops are removed, always let the thread inside the work.  Having knitted the desired distance (usually 1.5-2 cm), close all the loops in turn - the front, the wrong side, etc.  Using the properties of a hollow gum, you can not only make out the edge of the product, but also specifically make strips for processing pockets and other details.  For example, try to knit a narrow (4-5 cm), but long (10-12 cm) fabric using this technology.  You will get a great phone case.  As you can see, ordinary ornaments can be used in completely different ways, getting practical and original things! </p>
