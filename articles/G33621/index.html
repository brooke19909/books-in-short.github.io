In the code, the entire 25th chapter is devoted to him.  For its calculation, there are some basic points. </p><p>  First you need to know who pays income tax and who is a non-payer.  The payers include, without exception, all Russian companies, as well as foreign companies operating in our country, receiving income through representative offices, and precisely from sources in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Mostly foreign organizers of the Olympic Games, foreign marketing partners, companies that are broadcasting in their activities, and also enterprises that have received the status of companies participating in a project that is engaged in various kinds of development and research do not pay income tax. </p><p>  When it comes to taxation, we can talk about an individual.  If a person is engaged in any entrepreneurial activity, he is obliged to pay income tax on individuals.  All <span>private entrepreneurs,</span> without exception, must register with the <span>tax service</span> and pay the established amounts.  This tax is not tied to a fixed income, but applies only to directly received income.  The income tax, which is established for individuals, is paid not only by residents of the country, but also by citizens who are not them.  The main thing here is that they receive income in Russia.  If, for example, an entrepreneur is engaged in trade, then his obligations include <span>payment of VAT</span> and income tax. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is such a thing as an object of taxation.  In essence, <span>this is a tax</span> on the profit that a <span>private person</span> or an enterprise receives.  For Russian enterprises, the amount of income minus the amount of expenses incurred is taxed.  For foreign companies engaged in activities in Russia through representative offices, tax payments are also established after deducting the amount spent on expenses.  If the foreign company received income from sources in the Russian Federation, then the tax is calculated on this amount. </p><p>  Revenues can also be divided into those received from the sale of any goods and services, and non-operating income.  If the income is received in foreign currency, then the income tax is calculated after recalculating it into rubles.  The same can be said about income in arbitrary units. </p><p>  Revenues from sales can be obtained as a result of the <span>sale of goods,</span> services and works of own production.  Also from the sale of previously purchased goods or from property rights.  Total revenue is determined from the amounts received from the sale. </p><p>  Income received outside the sale can be received from equity participation in various profitable companies, and they can also be received from a negative or positive difference in the exchange rate.  In addition, profit can be obtained by paying the company fines from partners who do not comply with contractual clauses or from compensation for damage caused.  Profit can be obtained by leasing <span>land</span> or residential premises.  This may be interest on a loan or property received free of charge, as well as many other sources. </p><p>  As already mentioned, income tax is accrued taking into account the expenses incurred, which in turn are divided into groups.  These can be documented and justified costs.  Expenses that are deducted in the calculation of tax should be directed exclusively to activities aimed at increasing the income received. </p>
