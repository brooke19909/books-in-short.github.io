  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The person who influenced the course of history: examples. People who have changed the course of world history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are a great many people who have changed the world.  These are well-known doctors who came up with cures for diseases and learned to do complex operations;  politicians who started wars and conquered countries;  astronauts who first circled the earth in orbit and stepped on the moon and so on.  There are thousands of them, and it is impossible to tell about everyone.  This article lists only a small part of these geniuses, thanks to whom scientific discoveries, new reforms and trends in art appeared.  They are personalities who have changed the course of history. </p><h2>  Alexander Suvorov </h2><p>  The great commander who lived in the 18th century became a cult man.  He is a person who influenced the course of history with his mastery of strategy and the skillful planning of war tactics.  His name is inscribed in gold letters in the annals of Russian history, he is remembered as a tireless brilliant military commander. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547208.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  Alexander Suvorov devoted his whole life to battles and battles.  He is a member of the seven military, led 60 battles, not knowing the defeat.  His literary talent showed up in the book <span>‚ÄúThe Science of Victory,‚Äù</span> in which he teaches the younger generation the art of warfare, shares his experience and knowledge.  In this area, Suvorov was ahead of his era by many years in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  His merit in the first place is that he improved the tendencies of warfare, developed new methods of offensives and attacks.  All his science was based on three pillars: onslaught, speed and eye.  This principle developed the determination of soldiers, the development of initiative and a sense of mutual assistance in relation to their colleagues.  In battles, he always went ahead of the ordinary military, showing them an example of courage and heroism. </p><h2>  Catherine II </h2><p>  This is a woman phenomenon.  Like all other personalities that influenced the course of history, she was charismatic, strong and smart.  Born in Germany, but in 1744 she came to Russia as a bride for the nephew of the Empress - Grand Duke Peter the Third.  Her husband was uninteresting and lethargic, they almost did not communicate.  Catherine spent all her free time reading legal and economic works, she was captured by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Enlightenment.  Finding her like-minded people at the court, she easily overthrew her husband from the throne and became the full-fledged ruler of the Russian Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547210.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  The period of her reign is called the "golden" for the nobility.  The ruler reformed the Senate, took the church lands to the state treasury, which enriched the state and made life easier for ordinary peasants.  In this case, the influence of the individual on the course of history implies the adoption of a mass of new legislative acts.  Ekaterina has counted: provincial reform, the expansion of the rights and freedoms of the nobility, the creation of estates following the example of Western European society and the restoration of Russia's authority throughout the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Peter the Great </h2><p>  Another ruler of Russia, who lived a hundred years earlier than Catherine, also played a huge role in the development of the state.  He is not just a person who influenced the course of history.  Peter 1 became a national genius.  He was announced as an enlightener, "a beacon of the era", the savior of Russia, a man who opened his eyes to ordinary people on the European style of life and government.  Remember the phrase "window to Europe"?  So, it was Peter the Great who ‚Äúcut through‚Äù it to spite all envious people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547212.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  Tsar Peter became a great reformer, his changes in state principles at first frightened the nobility, and then aroused admiration.  This is the person who influenced the course of history by the fact that progressive discoveries and achievements of Western countries were introduced into ‚Äúhungry and unwashed‚Äù Russia, thanks to him.  Peter the Great managed to expand the economic and cultural borders of his empire, conquered new lands.  Russia was recognized as a great power and appreciated its role in the international arena. </p><h2>  Alexander the Second </h2><p>  After Peter the Great, he was the only king who began to carry out such large-scale reforms.  His innovations completely updated the look of Russia.  Like other famous personalities who changed the course of history, this ruler deserved respect and recognition.  The period of his reign dates back to the 19th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547213.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  The tsar‚Äôs main achievement was the <span>abolition of</span> <span>serfdom</span> in Russia, which impeded the country's economic and cultural development.  Of course, the predecessors of Alexander the Second, Catherine the Great and Nikolai the First, thought about eliminating a system very similar to slavery.  But none of them decided to turn the foundations of the state upside down. </p><p>  Such dramatic changes took place quite late, since a revolt of disaffected people was already brewing in the country.  In addition, in the 1880s, reforms stopped, which angered revolutionary youth.  The Tsar Reformer became the target of their terror, which led to the end of the transformation and completely influenced the development of Russia in the future. </p><h2>  Lenin </h2><p>  Vladimir Ilyich, a famous revolutionary, a person who influenced the course of history.  Lenin led a rebellion in Russia against the autocracy.  He led the revolutionaries to the barricades, as a result of which Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown and the Communists came to power, whose rule spanned a century and led to significant, dramatic changes in the lives of ordinary people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547214.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  Studying the works of Engels and Marx, Lenin advocated equality and strongly condemned capitalism.  The theory is good, but in reality it was hard to translate, since the representatives of the elite still lived in luxury, while ordinary workers and peasants worked hard around the clock.  But this was later, in the time of Lenin, at first glance, everything turned out the way he wanted it. </p><p>  Such important events as the First World War, the Civil War in Russia, the cruel and ridiculous execution of the entire royal family, the transfer of the capital from St. Petersburg to Moscow, the founding of the Red Army, the complete establishment of the Soviet power and the adoption of its first Constitution fall during the Lenin period. </p><h2>  Stalin </h2><p>  People who changed the course of history ... The name of Joseph Vissarionovich burns in bright red letters on their list.  He became a "terrorist" of his time.  The establishment of a camp network, the exile of millions of innocent people, the shooting of entire families for dissent, artificial hunger - all this radically changed the lives of people.  Some considered Stalin the devil, others God, since it was he who at that time decided the fate of every citizen of the Soviet Union.  Of course, he was neither one nor the other.  The frightened people himself put him on a pedestal.  The personality cult was created on the basis of universal fear and blood of the innocent victims of the era. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547215.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  The personality that influenced the course of history, Stalin, distinguished himself not only in mass terror.  Of course, his contribution to the history of Russia has a positive side.  It was during his reign that the state made a powerful economic breakthrough, scientific institutions and culture began to develop.  It was he who led the army, which defeated Hitler and saved all of Europe from fascism. </p><h2>  Nikita Khrushchev </h2><p>  This is a very controversial personality that influenced the course of history.  His versatile nature is well demonstrated by the tombstone erected to him, simultaneously made of white and black stone.  Khrushchev, on the one hand, was a man of Stalin, and on the other, a leader who tried to trample on the personality cult.  He began fundamental reforms that were supposed to completely change the bloody system, released millions of innocent prisoners from the camps, and pardoned hundreds of thousands of people sentenced to death.  This period was even called the "thaw," since the persecution and terror stopped. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547220.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  But Khrushchev did not know how to bring big things to the end, so his reforms can be called half-hearted.  The lack of education made him a narrow-minded person, but his excellent intuition, natural sanity, and political instinct helped him stay in the highest echelons of power for so long and find a way out in critical situations.  It was thanks to Khrushchev that he managed to avoid a nuclear war during the <span>Caribbean crisis,</span> and also turn the bloodiest page in the history of Russia. </p><h2>  Dmitry Mendeleev </h2><p>  Russia has given rise to many great universalists who have perfected various fields of science.  But Mendeleev is worth highlighting, since his contribution to its development is invaluable.  Chemistry, physics, geology, economics, sociology - all this managed to study Mendeleev and open new horizons in these industries.  He was also a renowned shipbuilder, balloonist and encyclopedist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547228.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  The person who influenced the course of history, Mendeleev, discovered a <span>periodic law that</span> allows us to predict the emergence of new chemical elements, the discovery of which occurs in our days.  His table is the basis of chemistry lessons at school and university.  Among his achievements is also a complete study of gas dynamics, experiments that helped to derive the equation of state of the gas. </p><p>  In addition, the scientist actively studied the properties of oil, developed a policy of injecting investments into the economy, and proposed optimizing the customs service.  His invaluable advice was used by many ministers of tsarist power. </p><h2>  Ivan Pavlov </h2><p>  Like all individuals who influenced the course of history, he was a very smart person, had a broad outlook and internal intuition.  Ivan Pavlov actively used animals in his experiments, trying to identify common features of the life of complex organisms, including humans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547233.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  Pavlov managed to prove the diverse activity of nerve endings in the cardiovascular system.  He showed how the <span>vagus nerve</span> can regulate blood pressure.  And he also became the discoverer of trophic nervous function, which consists in the influence of nerves on the process of regeneration and tissue formation. </p><p>  Later, he took up the physiology of the digestive tract, as a result of which he received the Nobel Prize in 1904.  His main achievement is considered to be the study of the brain, higher nervous activity, conditioned reflexes and the so-called human signaling system.  His works became the basis of many theories in medicine. </p><h2>  Mikhail Lomonosov </h2><p>  He lived and worked during the reign of Peter the Great.  Then an emphasis was placed on the development of education and enlightenment, and the first Academy of Sciences was created in Russia, in which Lomonosov spent many of his days.  He, a simple peasant, was able to rise to incredible heights, run up the social ladder and become a scientist, whose train of fame continues to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547237.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  He was interested in everything related to physics and chemistry.  He dreamed of freeing the latter from the influence of medicine and pharmaceuticals.  It was thanks to him that modern physical chemistry was born as a science and began to actively develop.  In addition, he was a well-known encyclopedist, studied history and wrote chronicles.  Peter the Great, he considered an ideal ruler, a key figure in the formation of the state.  In his scientific works, he described it as a model of the mind, which changed history and turned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa management system.  Through the efforts of Lomonosov in Russia, the first university was founded - Moscow.  From this time higher education began to develop. </p><h2>  Yuri Gagarin </h2><p>  People who influenced the course of history ... It is difficult to imagine their list without the name of Yuri Gagarin, the man who conquered space.  Starry space attracted people for many centuries, but only in the last century, humanity began to develop it.  At that time, the technical base for such flights was already well developed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547257.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  The space age was marked by competition between the Soviet Union and the United States.  The leaders of the giant countries tried to show their power and superiority, and space was one of the best options to demonstrate it.  In the middle of the 20th century, a rivalry began over who would send a person into orbit faster.  The USSR defeated this race.  We all know the famous date from school: on April 12, 1961, the first astronaut flew into orbit, where he spent 108 minutes.  This hero was called Yuri Gagarin.  The day after his journey into space, he woke up famous throughout the world.  Although, paradoxically, he never considered himself great.  Gagarin often said that in those one and a half hours he did not even have time to understand what was happening to him and what his feelings were. </p><h2>  Alexander Pushkin </h2><p>  It is called the "sun of Russian poetry."  It has long become a national symbol of Russia, its poems, poems and prose are highly valued and revered.  And not only in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but also throughout the world.  Almost every city in Russia has a street, square or square named after Alexander Pushkin.  Children study his work at school, devoting him not only study time, but also extracurricular in the form of thematic literary evenings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-547277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/547277.jpg?1568180954"></div><p>  This man created poetry so harmonious that it has no equal in the whole world.  It was with his work that the development of new literature and all its genres began - from poetry to theatrical plays.  Pushkin is read in one breath.  Accuracy, rhythm of lines is inherent in it, they are quickly remembered and easily recited.  If we take into account the enlightenment of this man, his strength of character and a deep inner core, then we can say that he is really a person who influenced the course of history.  He taught to speak the people in Russian in its modern interpretation. </p><h2>  Other historical figures </h2><p>  There are so many of them that it will not be possible to list all in one article.  Here are examples of a small part of Russian figures who have changed history.  And how many others are there?  This is Gogol, and Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy.  If we analyze foreign personalities, then one cannot fail to note the long-standing philosophers: Aristotle and Plato;  artists: Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, Monet;  geographers and discoverers of land: Magellan, Cook and Columbus;  scientists: Galileo and Newton;  politicians: Thatcher, Kennedy and Hitler;  inventors: Bella and Edison. </p><p>  All these people were able to completely turn the world upside down, create their own laws and scientific discoveries.  Some of them made the world a better place, and some almost destroyed it.  In any case, every person on planet Earth knows their names and understands that without these personalities our life would have been completely different.  Reading biographies of famous people, we often find idols for ourselves who want to take an example and be equal in all our deeds and actions. </p>
