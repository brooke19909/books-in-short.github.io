    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  The hero of this article was born in a family of a Pole of Jewish descent.  Education Yitzhak Stern received in Vienna.  Before the war, he worked in several companies, performing the duties of an accountant.  Yitzhak Stern, like other Jews in Krakow, was doomed to death after the occupation of Poland.  But it so happened that in his life appeared a cheerful and enterprising man named Oscar Schindler. </p><p>  Some historians today refute the legend of the "savior of the Jews."  What did Yitzhak Stern say about this man? </p><h2>  Meet Schindler </h2><p>  A Polish accountant of Jewish descent met a businessman in 1939.  Schindler was not a typical German.  From time to time, he visited the enterprise where Yitzhak Stern worked.  At the first meeting, he did not fail to indicate to the merchant his nationality.  In Poland, in those years, every Jew was obliged to do this by talking with a German.  Schindler's reaction was unexpected.  The man who became the prototype of the main character of Spielberg‚Äôs motion picture answered: ‚ÄúYou should not remind me that I am German.  I know it". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Plant </h2><p>  Even before the invaders organized Jewish ghettos in Krakow, they issued a number of decrees.  From now on, only personal belongings were not subject to confiscation.  Jews were deprived of money and real estate.  It was Stern Yitzchak who recommended Schindler to acquire one of the Polish-Jewish enterprises.  The German businessman became the owner of the enamelware factory.  Stern Yitzhak at this enterprise took the post of chief accountant. </p><p>  According to some historical data, this man never worked in a factory in Krakow.  He also did not take part in the compilation of the legendary list.  But the fact that Stern influenced the activities of Oscar Schindler, many historians still recognize. </p><p>  Stern knew exactly how to manage the enterprise.  The factory was once owned by his brother.  When the company passed into the ownership of Oscar Schindler, it was on the verge of bankruptcy.  The reason for this was mismanagement. </p><p>  Schindler and Stern spent a lot of time in conversations.  They discussed the affairs of the company, ways to avoid ruin.  The accountant advised Schindler to use Jewish labor.  After all, it is cheaper than Polish.  Such an offer was beneficial for both the merchant and the Jewish population of Krakow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Heroism </h2><p>  Schindler discussed not only business issues with Stern.  Sometimes they had long philosophical conversations.  During one of them, the accountant said the phrase, which later became famous: "Saving one life - you save the whole world."  This is a quote from the Talmud. </p><p>  Stern Yitzhak - who is it?  An accountant of a German company, who, taking advantage of his position, helped save Polish Jews?  Schindler in his memoirs noted the fearlessness of Stern, the willingness to help his brothers.  The German businessman assured that his transformation from an adventurer into a savior of a thousand human lives would not have been possible without this modest Jewish bookkeeper. </p>

    <h2>  Train to Brunlitz </h2><p>  In 1944, the Schindler plant was moved from Krakow.  Factory workers were transported to the city, which is part of modern Czech Republic.  Men and women were sent on different trains. </p><p>  The first arrived on time.  The second was late.  It turned out that the train with the women was mistakenly sent to a concentration camp.  Schindler personally went to Auschwitz.  Thanks to his incredible efforts, the women were brought to Brunlitz a few days later.  Only Stern's mother did not return. </p><p>  This incident was certainly not the only example of a heroic feat.  Schindler rescued Jews from trains going to death.  He finally made a list of salvation for many Jews. </p><h2>  Unknown facts </h2><p>  Several historical works have been published that rejected the good intentions of Oscar Schindler.  The authors of such books claim that he did not make any list (and there were nine).  Schindler allegedly only added several names to one of them.  Opponents of the Jewish salvation version claim that Stern never worked for a German businessman.  And so, the heroism of the accountant is doubtful. </p><p>  Schindler‚Äôs wife confirmed these assumptions.  But later, in an interview, she said that the factory in Czechoslovakia really did not bring any profit.  Emilia Schindler was engaged in monetary matters, and therefore had accurate information. </p><p>  One way or another, I want to believe in heroism and self-sacrifice.  Oscar Schindler and Yitzhak Stern, despite the conflicting claims of historians, will forever remain legends. </p>
