Romantic Venice, as a good bait, attracts not only lovers.  Travelers from all over the world fall in love with her the first time, captivating with an unforgettable atmosphere. </p><p>  The main pearl in the necklace of tourist destinations in Italy is surrounded by a crown of beautiful islands connected by a vaporetto - a water bus running on schedule.  Tiny and large, deserted and full of vacationers, private and public, they conceal many secrets, which sometimes tourists can not solve. </p><h2>  Islands of the venetian lagoon </h2><p>  When planning a trip to the charming city of bridges, located on the Adriatic coast, it is impossible to ignore the picturesque islands of Venice, protruding from the waters and swamps.  Acquaintance with them will allow you to better know the capital of the region of the same name, famous for elegant gondolas, magnificent cathedrals and magnificent palaces.  At the peak of the tourist season, one of the most unusual places on earth turns into a busy ant hill, and those who want to stay in silence should go to the islands located in the middle of the Venetian lagoon. </p><p>  The following land areas are the most popular among travelers: </p><ul><li>  Murano. </li><li>  Burano. </li><li>  Torcello. </li><li>  San Michele. </li><li>  Lido </li></ul><p>  However, there are islands covered in mysticism, on the territory of which tourists are unlikely to want to get: </p><ul><li>  Povela. </li><li>  Lazaretto Vecchio. </li></ul><h2>  The island of glassblowers and aristocrats </h2><p>  The most famous tourist attraction is Murano, inhabited since ancient times.  In the 13th century, all glassblowers were taken to the island of Venice, as their powerful furnaces threatened the city with fires.  In addition, in this way, secrets of glass production were kept secret.  The real masters of their craft at that time had a high status, and they were even allowed to marry aristocrats.  However, glassblowers could not leave the land, since such an action was regarded as treason and was punishable by death. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffingtonpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Murano Island" class="if uuid-2808006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2808006.jpg"></div><p>  Costly fragile glass items were shipped throughout Europe, and it was only in the 18th century that crystal from Bohemia appeared on the market, after which the Murano economy gradually fell into decay.  Later, one of the most picturesque islands of Italy, nicknamed "miniature Venice", turned into a favorite vacation spot of the Venetian aristocrats who built cozy villas here. </p><h2>  Murano glass - a symbol of high artistic skill </h2><p>  Tourists with great pleasure visit several glass-blowing factories, which host a real show.  Watching an elegant decanter grow out of nothing is a very bewitching sight.  Here everyone will be able to purchase Murano glass, which is a symbol of luxury and impeccable craftsmanship.  However, it is worth noting that this is an elite product, which not everyone can afford. </p><p>  The island near Venice consists of several land areas, between which bridges are laid and channels flow.  They are completely strewn with souvenir shops where you can buy cheap trinkets or quality products in a single copy.  In addition, in small squares (campi) of Murano, bizarre glass sculptures of gigantic sizes were installed, attracting the attention of guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Peaceful atmosphere of Mazzorbo </h2><p>  Having walked around a lot, tourists set off again.  During a boat trip you can get acquainted with a unique natural masterpiece - a lagoon born of the onset of land on the Adriatic waters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.campingserenissima.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mazzorbo Island" class="if uuid-2808014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2808014.jpg"></div><p>  Going to the famous Burano, vacationers often miss its nearest neighbor - the small island of Mazzorbo, on the banks of which customs was once located.  Previously, commercial life was boiling here, but after the canals began to swamp, local residents began to die from malaria.  Now a quiet corner, immersed in the greenery of lush gardens and vineyards, delights in a peaceful atmosphere. </p><p>  Life in Mazzorbo, whose name translates as "big city," flows slowly, and travelers, tired of the bustle of megacities, enjoy walking along quiet streets, enjoying the silence.  There are no architectural monuments, and the main attraction of the island of Venice is the old church of Santa Caterina, which appeared in the VIII century. </p><h2>  The world of colors and gentle sun </h2><p>  Mazzorbo is connected to Burano by a wooden bridge, and tourists passing through it find themselves in a completely different world, where there is no place for silence.  This is a fishing town, known for its colorful houses that look very exotic.  It was very easy for the islanders to go to sea to see their huts painted in the most incredible shades from the sea even on a foggy day.  To this day, local authorities observe the color scheme: traditionally each house has its own palette, and you can update the walls only with a strictly defined color. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burano Island" class="if uuid-2808041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2808041.jpg"></div><h2>  The main attractions of the island </h2><p>  On one of the main islands of Venice, reminiscent of a fairytale town, talented needlewomen weaved the famous Burana lace and even created a special knitting technique - on weight, without using any foundation. </p><p>  Now here is a museum of <span>Venetian lace,</span> which are completely competing with luxurious products from Bruges.  Tourists will be able to purchase real works of textile art, but you need to make sure that this is actually handmade, and not a serial production. </p><p>  An equally famous attraction of Burano is the church of San Martino, whose 52-meter campanile (bell tower) is slightly tilted.  The Venetian "Leaning Tower of Pisa" is the real pride of the locals. </p><p>  Burano is a favorite place of all creative people, and currently the same name is being awarded here, awarded to Italian painters for the best work.  And in a cozy tavern, where modern masters adore to gather, all the walls are painted with watercolors by famous artists. </p><h2>  How to get from the city on the water to Burano? </h2><p>  How to get from Venice to the <span>island of Burano, whose</span> colorful houses illuminate travelers with unusual brightness?  You need to use the services of a vaporetto at number 12, passing through Murano.  The boat stop is located on the Fondamenta Nove embankment, the pier - F.ta Nove A. Passenger transport runs every half hour, and the journey time is approximately 60 minutes.  The cost of a return ticket is 10 euros / 800 rubles. </p><h2>  Calm Torcello </h2><p>  The "Sleeping Beauty of the Lagoon" is called the cozy Torcello - a green island near Venice.  Most of the wonderful place is a nature reserve in which it is so nice to enjoy peaceful walks in silence.  On this territory, many centuries ago, Slavic tribes fleeing the Huns took refuge.  It was from here that the history of the magnificent city on the water, penetrated by numerous canals, began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.facarospauls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of Torcello, Venice" class="if uuid-2808053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2808053.jpg"></div><p>  The inhabitants of Torcello traded with Constantinople, but by the 12th century they had left the swampy island, which posed a danger to their living.  Here, malaria epidemics erupted that threatened the lives of all islanders.  The houses were dismantled for building material, and soon Torcello was empty.  Now on its territory live 60 families involved in fishing. </p><p>  From the former greatness of the Middle Ages, two modest palaces (palazzo) and two religious monuments - a cathedral with beautiful mosaics of the Byzantine period and a church - have been preserved in the town.  And on the way to them, tourists meet an amazing object, which is a huge stone chair.  It is believed that everyone who sits on the "throne of Attila" will certainly marry in a year.  Guests are required to stand on the snow-white Devil's bridge without a railing, making a wish. </p><h2>  Where time has stopped </h2><p>  The walled island of San Michele (Venice) is not the most popular place among tourists.  However, this is not surprising, because not everyone wants to wander through the huge necropolis, which occupies the entire territory of San Michele.  Napoleon himself ordered the construction of a gigantic cemetery here, divided into several parts.  They are intended for the burial of Jews, Catholics and Orthodox.  The last refuge of S. Diaghilev and I. Stravinsky was found here, and our compatriots must come here to bow to the great masters.  I. Brodsky was buried in the Protestant part, on the grave of which the words ‚Äúeverything does not end with death‚Äù are beaten out.  The brilliant poet was not Orthodox, and the Catholic clergy opposed his burial. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marbletowns.wordpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://marbletowns.wordpress.com/2012/09/04/taphophile-tragics-diaghilev-memorial-san-michele-venice/"><img itemprop="image" alt="The grave of Diaghilev at San Michele" class="if uuid-2808064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2808064.jpg"></div><p>  Do not be afraid of the sinister atmosphere on the island-cemetery in Venice.  It does not oppress, because the area is more like a green fit park.  Here tourists wander with interest, looking at tombstones and mausoleums, among which there are real works of art.  Due to the limited number of places, the body is exhumed, and then the bones are sent to the crypt cells.  This frees up space for new burials. </p><p>  Entrance to the cemetery on the island of the dead in Venice is free.  There is no accommodation and restaurants, so to stay for the night or have a meal, you will have to sail further to the vaporetto. </p><h2>  Poveglia - Plague Island </h2><p>  But the most mysterious land area, located near Lido, has long been a symbol of doom, cruelty and death.  Inspired by notoriety, it is uninhabited, and its rare visitors admit that they experienced fear and horror. </p><p>  In the 5th century, refugees from Padua moved to the plague island in Venice.  The sprawling local community, enjoying autonomy, even had its own government.  In the XIV century, the locals who fought with Genoa destroyed their favorite city so that it would not go to the enemy, but they themselves moved to another place.  But even after signing the peace treaty, they did not return. </p><p>  On an island with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãjust one square kilometer, infirmaries were built in which plague patients were brought from all over Italy.  Often, in order to minimize all risks and prevent infection of healthy residents, entire families were brought here to quarantine.  Not a single person returned from the island of death in Venice, and the bodies of those who died from diseases were burned in the same fire with the living.  According to the most conservative estimates, more than 160 thousand people died here.  The authorities forbade farming, since the ash from the burnt bodies mixed with the soil for a long time, becoming its integral part. </p><h2>  Cursed earth </h2><p>  The last century was marked by a terrible event - a psychiatric hospital was built at Poveglia, the doctors of which conducted various experiments using people as experimental material.  Sadists tortured patients by performing surgery without anesthesia.  The clinic often included completely healthy people who were objectionable to the political regime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Place of Dark Forces" class="if uuid-2808069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2808069.jpg"></div><p>  Now the island of death in Venice, nicknamed the "cursed land" and "gates to hell", is closed to the public and patrolled by the police.  True, there are always brave men who land on long-suffering land.  The blood freezes from their stories: here mobile phones are disconnected, and to daredevils all the time it seems as if someone is watching them.  Abandoned rooms, broken windows, broken beds - everything makes a depressing impression.  On a completely empty land, where there is not a soul, bells ringing a long time ago ring, and terrifying screams are heard.  In a panic, tourists rush to the boats and set sail, never returning to the place of dark forces, the atmosphere of which is saturated with fear and pain. </p><h2>  Plans not yet implemented </h2><p>  As it became known, the government is going to build a luxurious luxury hotel on the territory of the island, which attracts lovers of pan-abnormal phenomena, hoping that crowds of vacationers will leave millions of euros here.  Thus, it plans to breathe life into one of the most terrible corners of the planet.  The new project will help reduce Italy's public debt, and regular clients may become psychics and amateurs to tickle their nerves.  It is planned that in the near future an auction will be held to rent Povelia for 99 years. </p><h2>  Uninhabited island, served as quarantine from the plague </h2><p>  No less creepy island of Venice is Lazaretto-Vecchio, founded in the XIV century, when the plague came to Europe.  The place of medieval quarantine gave the name to the now existing word "infirmary".  Lazzaretto Vecchio, located a few kilometers from the most romantic city on earth, off the west coast of Lido, later turned into a military garrison, and then into a shelter for stray dogs.  Since the 60s of the last century, no one has been living here, and only archaeologists are engaged in excavations on the territory.  About one and a half thousand remains of people who died of the plague and were buried during the Middle Ages were found at the hospital cemetery. </p><p>  You can get to the island, but not all travelers have such a desire.  Most often, a picturesque corner is admired from the water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.veneziaunica.it" data-author=": Gian Mauro Lapenna, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lido Resort" class="if uuid-2808083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2808083.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular resort </h2><p>  The famous Lido island in Venice is a favorite holiday destination of the Venetians themselves.  In the last century, an aristocracy from Europe and Russia gathered on the archipelago.  With the beginning of the tourist season, the fashionable resort is being transformed: both cozy restaurants and casinos open their doors, and comfortable hotels amaze with their luxury at any time of the year.  This is where the famous Venice Film Festival takes place in September. </p><p>  Most often, tourists rush to Lido to sunbathe on the sandy beaches and swim in the waters of the Adriatic Sea.  Lido is a noisy and crowded place, the many-kilometer sandbank of which protects Venice from strong winds and waves.  Buses run on the island, which is very unusual, because land public transport is available only on the mainland. </p><p>  You should not limit your stay in marvelous Venice to just a few days, because during this time it is impossible to get acquainted with its islands, a visit to which will help to make a more complete impression of the unusual city on the water. </p>
