    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Sharming Inn <span>Hotel 4</span> was built 14 years ago, in 2000.  Not so long ago, in 2013, it was reconstructed.  The complex did not work for about two years, but last year it reopened to start hosting guests.  During the reconstruction, the rooms and apartments were improved, the lobby was updated.  Also, in addition to cosmetic repairs, they replaced the plumbing and put in new furniture.  And, of course, they updated the equipment in the kitchens and the fire safety system.  Thus, the living conditions were as close as possible to ideal.  The hotel itself consists of one three-story complex, as well as several bungalows.  The entire hotel occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3,900 sq.m.  This complex has original architecture and stylish design.  It‚Äôs not just pleasant to be in a beautifully designed area - you can have a great rest here, after spending several carefree hours on the picturesque terrace, enjoying peace and tranquility in the shade of the trees. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  If we talk about the main advantages of this complex, the first thing worth noting is its advantageous location.  And here we are not talking about the fact that it is literally 15 kilometers from the airport.  This, of course, is important, but there is something that attracts more attention.  The fact is that the Sharming Inn Hotel 4 is located in one of the best areas of the resort, on the picturesque cliff of Ras Um El Seyed.  Here tourists can see stunning coral reefs, a rich underwater world, and stunning landscapes.  No wonder the cliff became famous for its exceptional beauty.  This place is really perfect to spend a few days of relaxing in such a unique atmosphere.  Tourists can sunbathe on the terraces, swim in the pools, enjoy the sea or the landscapes of the beautiful gardens.  One thing is for sure - at Sharming Inn Hotel 4 you won‚Äôt be bored, everyone will find what to do. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Restaurants, night clubs, discos - all this at the resort is in its diversity.  However, if you do not want to go anywhere, but you still need to keep busy with something, then you should not worry about this.  Indeed, in the territory of Sharming Inn Hotel 4 (Egypt) there is a lot of entertainment that will appeal to everyone.  If you want to actively spend time, you can go to the tennis court, or play billiards.  Guests are even offered skiing!  And, of course, while staying at a seaside resort, one cannot help but devote at least a day to water sports, which include windsurfing, diving, snorkelling and snorkelling.  If you want vivid sensations and emotions, you can go to the water park.  In general, I must say, there are a variety of entertainment - from table tennis to karaoke bar. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Calm leisure </h2><p>  If the guests do not like active rest, then there is nothing to worry about, there will be a lesson in the hotel for lovers of peace and quiet.  For example, the Sharming Inn Hotel 4 has a library with a fairly large selection of various literature.  If you want to relax completely, you can enroll in a massage room and get real pleasure from the session.  There is also an outdoor pool on the territory of the complex, which operates year-round, and two terraces - one ordinary and the other for sunbathing.  And, of course, a picturesque cozy garden where you can simply retire with yourself.  It should also be noted that the hotel has its own private beach, which guests will definitely like - this is a closed zone, so there will not be many people in this zone, as is the case with public places. </p><h2>  Restaurants, bars and service </h2><p>  It is important for guests planning their holidays not only what entertainment the hotel complex can offer them.  Of great importance is also the direct service consisting in the provision of food.  You don‚Äôt have to worry about this, as the hotel has its own bar, two restaurants (√† la carte service and buffet).  Also, guests can be offered a diet menu (on individual request).  And, of course, a snack bar.  Also, if hotel guests wish, drinks and food can be delivered to their room.  The food is varied, which will definitely appeal to lovers of delicacies.  For example, in the ‚ÄúCaprice‚Äù restaurant you can taste the best Italian dishes, while in ‚ÄúTempura‚Äù hotel guests are treated to Asian dishes.  Another nice point that should be noted is that all the drinks in the bars are offered under the all-inclusive service, so you won‚Äôt have to pay extra for anything.  As a matter of fact, Egypt (Sharm el-Sheikh) has always been famous for its quality of service and service, so one should not be surprised at such a high level. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms and apartments </h2><p>  To make the rest really good, it is important that the rooms meet all the norms and standards.  You can‚Äôt worry about this.  All apartments are equipped with plasma satellite TV, air conditioning and a balcony.  They also include minibars and a fully equipped bathroom.  Modern new furniture, a safe, a telephone, a hairdryer, clean linens and towels - all this is offered to hotel guests.  And, of course, Internet access.  In general - nothing more, all that is needed for a healthy sleep and good rest.  By the way, if guests decide to come with their young child, then you should indicate this when booking - then the administration will prepare a crib, and absolutely free (if he is not 4 years old). </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation cost </h2><p>  What, in addition to good service, is Egypt still known?  Prices are what has not yet been said.  The hotel really has a very affordable pricing policy.  For example, seven nights in a double room fully equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay will cost about 19 thousand rubles.  For this price, guests will be offered double apartments, as well as a free breakfast.  Also included in this amount are taxes - standard, city, as well as a service charge.  Guests when booking can indicate their <span>personal preference</span> for beds (two single or one double).  They can also choose the desired view from the window - the pool or garden.  And in a triple room you can stay for an amount of 26 thousand rubles.  As you can see, prices are really eye-catching.  It is the combination of a pleasant price and a good level of service that attracts tourists. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  A stay at the hotel will definitely leave a good impression if tourists are well treated there.  They say that they are met by clothes.  So, at Sharming Inn Hotel 4, whose photo definitely makes you want to visit this beautiful place, all guests are very friendly and welcoming.  So the first impression in this case is not misleading.  In addition, I want to note another very pleasant moment.  High-class staff speaks six languages!  This is German, Italian, French, English, Arabic and, most importantly, Russian!  This nuance cannot but rejoice, especially those guests who experience some linguistic problems.  So if you have problems with orienteering around the city, you can just ask the administration or at the reception - they will not refuse help. </p>
