But at all times it was of no small importance in the history of the state.  Archaeological research claims that the first settlements on the territory of modern Delhi existed more than three thousand years ago.  Hindus say that it was at this place that most of the events described in the ancient poem "Mahabharata" took place.  Delhi's attractions such as delicate white-stone buildings, elegant hotels, chic exotic parks remind of a rich past.  The city in 1911 became the capital of British India.  Today, the entire metropolis is divided into two parts: the fashionable district of New Delhi and Old Delhi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of delhi" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/601421.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lakshmi Narayan </h2><p>  The temple, built of white and pink marble, is one of the most famous architectural monuments located in <span>New Delhi.</span>  The temple is called Lakshmi-Narayan, and it is dedicated to the <span>gods Krishna</span> and Lakshmi.  These deities are considered the most popular persons in the religion of the Hindus.  Therefore, many of Delhi's sights are named after these patrons of family happiness and love. </p><p>  The building was built at the beginning of the last century.  The richest people of India became its financiers, and Mahatma Gandhi was present at the ceremony of consecrating the religious building.  Those who study the classical <span>culture of India</span> see in Lakshmi-Narayan architecture a combination of styles prevailing in different eras.  Visitors are always in a festive mood when they contemplate this place.  This is achieved thanks to the sparkling gilding and bright colors that are present on the building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gurdwara bangla sahib" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/601423.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, you should pay attention to the building, located in the very center of the metropolis, on Connaught Place.  This is a temple of white marble.  It is the most visited Sikh Cathedral and is called Gurdwara Bangla Sahib. </p><p>  Guests of the city can easily recognize this object by the onion gilded dome, which is somewhat reminiscent of the golden vaults of Orthodox churches.  There is a pond in front of the gourdwar.  He is called Sarovar.  Locals believe in the sacred and healing power of its water.  The temple was built in 1783, when the throne was occupied by the Mongol emperor Shah Alam II.  The architect was Sardar Bhagel Singh, a Sikh general.  Everyone can get into the temple.  Only for this it is necessary to fulfill one condition: a visit is allowed only with a covered head and bare feet.  And before the entrance, guests can be offered prasadam.  This is such a ritual food made from butter, honey, grain and flour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map with landmarks of delhi" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/601422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gate to the fallen soldiers </h2><p>  The gates of India are a monument erected in honor of the fallen Indian soldiers who took part in the First World War and the Anglo-Afghan battles.  There is a monument in New Delhi.  The author of the project was Edwin Lachens.  The monument was opened in 1931.  The monument is made in the form of an arch, which is built of Bharatpur stone.  <span>Eternal flame</span> burns at the foot <span>.</span>  True, according to the plan, he was supposed to be in a hollow bowl mounted on top of the structure.  But this project remained only an idea.  To see other sights of Delhi, you need to drive a little further than the gate.  In the meantime, you can relax in the vast park, which is spread around this architectural masterpiece. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lal Kila </h2><p>  Lal Kila, or Red Fort, is considered the heart of Old Delhi.  This monument dates back to the XVII century and is considered the most beautiful and majestic attraction of the specified period.  The monument was created during the reign of Shah Jahan, who was also the Mongol emperor, like Shah Alam II.  The red fort is called because of the walls lined with sandstone of the corresponding color.  Delhi sights (photos and descriptions can be found in our article) are incredibly interesting.  So, in the Red Fort, its internal structures attract attention: the hall for public ceremonies - Divan-i-Am - and the hall for private imperial meetings - Divan-i-Khas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Delhi photo and description" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/601424.jpg" width="466"></div>
