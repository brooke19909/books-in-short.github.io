If such an embarrassment has occurred, and the money has already been paid, then there is nothing else left but to give the new thing in the studio.  But if you are at least a little friends with a needle and thread, then we suggest saving and altering clothes with your own hands.  In this article, we‚Äôll look at an example of how to make a shirt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cerealparty.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cut off the sleeve" class="if uuid-2673101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2673101.jpg"></div><h2>  What you need for work </h2><p>  Before starting sewing, you should prepare all the necessary tools and properly equip the workplace.  So, to suture the product, you will need: </p><ul><li>  small thickness needles for lightweight material; </li><li>  threads to match the clothes; </li><li>  pins for fixing fabric; </li><li>  centimeter tape for taking measurements; </li><li>  well sharpened scissors; </li><li>  a piece of chalk or soap to draw patterns on the fabric. </li></ul><p>  All work is preferably carried out on a flat and well-lit table.  This will avoid sewing errors.  Before sewing on a shirt one size smaller, it is imperative to try on a model with designated places for new seams.  This will avoid errors after trimming excess tissue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.bernina.com" data-author=": Herr Schneider, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cutting products" class="if uuid-2672988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44425/2672988.jpg"></div><h2>  How to Sew the Sleeves of a Men's and Women's Shirt </h2><p>  To reduce the width of the sleeve without a cuff by 3-5 mm, the product should initially be turned inside out and laid out so that the fabric is not deformed.  The desired distance is measured with a centimeter tape, and a line is drawn along the entire sleeve along which the seam will pass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Please note that if you need to remove only 3 mm from the sleeve of the shirt, it means that only 1.5 mm should be put aside from the existing seam.  This is explained simply - you will cut 1.5 mm on both sides of the sleeve, which in total will give the necessary 3 mm. </p><p>  After drawing the line and securing the fabric with pins, a seam is formed using a sewing machine or manually with a needle and thread. </p><p>  How to sew a shirt more than 5 mm?  To do this, it is necessary to spread the side seam near the armhole under the sleeve, cut off the excess fabric, and then carefully sew it. </p><h2>  How to shorten sleeves </h2><p>  Probably every second fashionista had a situation where the liked shirt model was wide for the future, but at the same time had long sleeves.  To fix such a defect, you can alter the cuff yourself.  To do this, flip both of them and cut the sleeve to the desired length.  The line of the side seam of the sleeve also changes without fail, as indicated in the article above. </p><p>  An important condition is that the sleeve width is equal to the length of the cuff.  Before you take off your shirt, you should carefully measure and carefully sew in the cuff, because the sleeves are an important element of the product, which is constantly in sight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gunook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuff Trim" class="if uuid-2672996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44425/2672996.jpg"></div><h2>  If the shirt is wide in the shoulders </h2><p>  In the case when the product turned out to be larger than necessary, it is quite possible to reduce it with the help of suturing the armhole, in the shoulders and side.  We offer step-by-step instructions on how to make a shirt smaller: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Initially, you should determine how many centimeters you need to reduce each item of clothing.  We recommend that you write down the dimensions, as they should be the same on both sides. </li><li>  Having turned the shirt inside out, be sure to outline with a shallow line the future place of the line, drawing it along the entire existing side seam and armhole.  All marked lines must be secured with pins. </li><li>  Spread the old broom and side stitches of the product, and then cut off the excess fabric. </li><li>  It is recommended to perform new seams using a sewing machine, if one is available.  And all the edges of the slices need to be overlaid manually or with the help of an overlock. </li></ol><p>  It is important that the lines on both sides are completely symmetrical.  If a new thing is sutured, then it is worth washing it before sewing. </p><h2>  How to sew a women's and men's shirt on the sides </h2><p>  Before you start sewing, you should measure your waist and chest circumferences in advance.  To stitch the shirt along the side seams, you need to prepare the product, laying it on the table. </p><p>  Turning the shirt inside out, you should outline new lines with a chalk or soap.  Pin the traced places with pins and sew.  And only after the lowercase seams are completed, trim the excess pieces of fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.listingmore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a shirt" class="if uuid-2673087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2673087.jpg"></div><h2>  Shorten the product </h2><p>  Reducing the length of the product is simple, even without a sewing machine.  To form a lowercase seam, use the thinnest needle possible. </p><p>  Consider the sequence of how to sew a shirt in length: </p><ol><li>  An important point at the beginning of the work is to determine how much fabric you need to trim. </li><li>  Be sure to mark the location of the future section with soap or crayon. </li><li>  From the drawn line at the bottom of the shirt should be set aside 1-1.5 cm to form a stitch. </li><li>  Cut off the excess fabric, and fix the line of the new seam with pins. </li><li>  After the seam is stitched on a typewriter or formed manually, the product must be carefully ironed. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="blog.bernina.com" data-author=": Herr Schneider, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collar reconstruction" class="if uuid-2672991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44425/2672991.jpg"></div><h2>  What about the collar? </h2><p>  Alas, it is almost impossible to correct this element of the product yourself.  Many tailors in the atelier can reduce its circumference, but most likely, a new vertical seam will appear behind the shirt on the collar. </p><p>  Stitching the buttons will also lead to the loss of a presentable appearance of the shirt.  The only correct solution to this problem would be a complete replacement of the entire collar design on both the men's and women's shirts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewaholic.net" data-author=": Sewaholic Patterns, "><img itemprop="image" alt="To sew a shirt collar" class="if uuid-2672931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44425/2672931.jpg"></div><p>  Knowing how to make a shirt for a woman‚Äôs and men's shirt, it‚Äôs quite possible to replenish the wardrobe with new stylish things.  Due to the maximum concentration of attention in the presence of elementary skills, you can quickly turn a shapeless product into a stylish addition to the basic wardrobe. </p>
