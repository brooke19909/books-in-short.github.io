If his ancestor A3 was intended primarily for calls, then this device is designed to work fully in all respects.  It is useful not only for ordinary conversations, but also for performing operations on the Internet. </p><p>  The body of the unit is completely metal.  This is the main distinguishing feature of the A5.  There are other features in its configuration, but they do not distinguish it among analogues as brightly as its external design. </p><h2>  Meet the body </h2><p>  By design, the Samsung Galaxy A5 phone, reviews of which are rather warm, is not fundamentally different from other representatives of the series.  When the manufacturer tried to create the highest quality case, the percentage of defects was very high.  It is logical that the level of assembly and the quality of materials do not cause complaints from users. </p><p>  The frame, made of metal, frames the gadget by analogy with the <span>Samsung</span> Alpha or Nout 4 <span>models</span> .  Its edges shine in the rays of light no worse than in these phones.  The back panel is made of the same material.  Despite this, it does not have a metallic color, but tone-on-tone matches the case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung a5 reviews" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730618.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It has several antenna holes.  But they are not striking due to the dense, uniform color.  Owners of the phone claim that thanks to this reception, designers managed to achieve a holistic, concise look of the gadget, which cannot but please people with good taste. </p><p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy A5</span> smartphone <span>,</span> the design <span>reviews</span> of which are full of customer admiration, is presented in different color variations.  First of all, white, black, blue, pink and golden units went on sale.  This gamma is no different from that of the A3 models.  There is a high probability that the manufacturer will expand it and complement it with fresh, creative shades.  Although this set is already in great demand among buyers. </p><h2>  Strength test </h2><p>  White models are cast with mother of pearl.  They are not matte and play beautifully with <span>sun glare.</span>  Some owners carry out checks for resistance to damage to the housing of the smartphone Samsung Galaxy A5.  The reviews of these people indicate that even if you specially scratch its surface, the scratches that appear will be barely noticeable and will not be evident. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy a5 reviews" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730613.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <p>  For some customers, it may initially seem that the frame of the phone is actually plastic, covered with a shine foil.  In the 3.5 mm jack, he also saw the same material.  But in fact, this is a real metal a few millimeters thick, like its back.  It is particularly durable and massive. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device tolerates falls without injuries.  If desired, any device can be bent, regardless of what material it is made of.  To do this with the Samsung A5 model, the reviews convince you, you will have to try a lot. </p><h2>  How is everything arranged? </h2><p>  The location of the controls is traditional.  The key for adjusting the volume is on the left side, and on the right is on / off.  On the same side - connectors for nano-SIM and memory cards.  The Samsung Galaxy A5 Duos model is designed for 2 memory cards.  The reviews of its owners confirm: both SIM cards cannot work simultaneously with the card reader, which causes a lot of complaints. </p><p>  At the ends there are 2 microphones, at the bottom there is a USB port and a 3.5 mm jack for headphones or a headset.  The <span>front camera</span> is located above the screen <span>,</span> as well as light and proximity sensors.  Under it - 2 touch and 1 mechanical buttons. </p><h2>  Display - "mirror of the soul" of the smartphone </h2><p>  If the A3 model was equipped with a 4.5-inch display with qHD resolution, then the Samsung A5 phone is equipped with a SuperAMOLED screen with a diagonal of 5 inches and the possibility of HD.  Users claim that these features of the gadget make the image more contrast compared to its predecessors.  And thanks to a number of special settings, you can set the desired gamma level and other display parameters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung a5" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730616.jpg" width="558"></div>

    <p>  When using the automatic backlight adjustment, it turns out to be insufficiently bright and even dim.  Thanks to working in this mode, less charge is used, which, therefore, lasts for more time. </p><h2>  How hardy is he? </h2><p>  The Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 2300 mAh is built into the body of the device.  She does not belong to the most powerful.  Video on the phone can play continuously for about 12.5 hours.  This is a higher rate than other Samsung models.  A5, whose characteristics do not differ too much from analogues, stands out against their background at least due to a more powerful battery. </p><p>  With a quiet mode of operation, the gadget can live without charging for about 2 days.  At the same time, you can talk for an hour, send two dozen SMS and listen to music for quite some time.  If the load is higher, the smartphone will last a day without recharge.  For comparison: C5 sits already at lunch.  The Samsung A5 phone is gaining 100% charge in less than 2 hours. </p><h2>  Memory Capacity, Chipset, and Performance </h2><p>  In most markets, you can find a model that supports LTE.  It has a maximum price and is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 chipset - MSM8916 with 4 cores and a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  He is one of the best phones among analogues at an average price with high performance.  RAM is measured in two gigabytes, and internal memory is 16 (about 12 of them are available).  Memory cards can expand this figure to 64, which is enough for most users of the Samsung A5 phone.  Owner reviews are filled with positive comments about this. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the A series gadgets is that it is impossible to use 2 SIM cards and MicroSD in them at the same time.  Therefore, the owner of the device has to decide what is more important for him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung a5 specifications" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During the synthetic tests, the chipset does not show the best results.  But this does not affect performance, and Samsung A5, the characteristics of which completely satisfy users, works quickly and efficiently.  Also, thanks to it, it is possible to achieve a longer charging time than previous models. </p><p>  The smartphone also offers standard communication options: USB, NFC, Ant +, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0 LE and a built-in LTE modem with support for LTE Advanced Cat.4. </p><h2>  What to take pictures of? </h2><p>  The front lens is not equipped with autofocus.  But it has a resolution of 5 megapixels and does not cause any complaints from users.  The main camera is 13 megapixels.  This "eye" was equipped with the best models of last year.  With it, you can create pictures of pretty good quality.  But in the dark, this camera, as on previous models, does not show high results. </p>

    <h2>  Software - Gadget Brain </h2><p>  The device is equipped with the latest version of Android 4.4.4 and TouchWiz shell.  The latter also belongs to the novelties of its series and is used on the top Samsung models.  Galaxy A5, reviews of which can give a complete picture of its features, is equipped with a built-in FM radio.  Many smartphone owners perceive it as a pleasant addition to the standard equipment.  Although most of them from the presence of the radio, as they say, are neither cold nor hot, because they prefer to listen to their own music downloaded to the memory card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy a5 duos reviews" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/732133.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <p>  If the A3 had only 1 GB of RAM, which significantly narrowed the range of possibilities, then on the Samsung A5 model (user reviews confirm this fact), this drawback was fixed.  From the App Store, you can safely download all sorts of useful applications to the unit.  These include, for example, S Health, the "child" mode and others that are not installed by default.  If in the previous trim levels some important icons were absent in the menu, then in A5 they are presented in full necessary volume. </p><h2>  Impressions </h2><p>  The call on this phone sounds loud and clear.  Speech is transmitted clearly, without disruption to the speakers.  The volume of the conversation is not satisfactory.  The microphones are conveniently located and guarantee that the person you are talking to will hear what you say even if you are walking in a noisy street. </p><p>  The radio part has a high level of sensitivity, no worse than that of the Galaxy C4 and C5, based on Qualcomm chipsets.  Attempts to measure the level of radio tact can hardly be called productive, because it does not work on marketing samples and prototypes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone samsung galaxy a5 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730615.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <p>  The cost of Galaxy A5 in Russia is about 420 US dollars, which is quite a lot for a device with such characteristics.  It is difficult to call a smartphone a leader in technical capabilities, but the manufacturer lures buyers, attracting them with something else.  He focuses on design, in particular on the metal casing. </p><p>  This model is suitable for people who do not like plastic and are willing to overpay for high-quality framing of the device, despite its outstanding specifications.  In addition to appearance, this gadget has no fundamental differences from its predecessors of the vulgar season.  And they, in turn, continue to enjoy consistently high demand among customers to this day. </p>
