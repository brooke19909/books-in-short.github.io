    <p>  Of course, if you buy one device, it will almost not affect the family budget, but when the goal is to create the most comfortable conditions throughout the house, the acquisition of a complex of such devices will result in a round sum. </p><h2>  Why do we need such sockets? </h2><p>  A little earlier, devices of this class, and a <span>smart socket</span> with remote control in particular, were developed for individual households - cottages and cottages.  The surrounding area was always troublesome to maintain and required daily attention and care: watering plants, lighting greenhouses, etc. Most busy people simply do not have the physical time to complete this routine. </p><p>  And imagine a situation when in a rainy and dank evening you need to open the garage door, while a strong wind does not even open the car door.  This is where a socket with a remote control is just useful, otherwise you run the risk of getting wet for half a minute. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scope of application </h2><p>  But residents of high-rise buildings, day after day rushing to work, also experience a large number of minor household inconveniences.  Waking up early in the morning from the annoying sound of the alarm, I don‚Äôt feel like getting up and going to the kitchen to turn on the kettle.  To help in this situation comes again smart socket with remote control.  Such an acquisition will allow you to turn on a coffee machine or a regular kettle without getting out from under a warm blanket.  And while preparing an invigorating drink, you can still soak for a few minutes in a comfortable bed. </p>

    <p>  In addition, portable sockets on the remote control can greatly save not only your time, but also money.  For example, if you program the start of the boiler operation one and a half to two hours before your morning wake up or return from work, then a comfortable shower is provided to you.  This also applies to the operation of air conditioners and split systems - half an hour before your arrival in the apartment there will be an ideal microclimate. </p><h2>  Device types </h2><p>  For a person who is little knowledgeable in this matter, the choice of such a device as a remote-controlled socket turns, if not into a lottery, then causes the majority some bewilderment at the sight of a rich assortment of models.  All devices of this kind can be divided into two types, depending on the installation - overhead and internal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Surface models </h2><p>  Remote-mounted overhead power sockets are, for the most part, adapter devices.  This type is most in demand among consumers, because it does not require any special skills for installation.  All you need to do is to buy your favorite model in the store, unpack it, plug it into a regular 220 V power outlet and configure the necessary parameters according to the operating instructions. </p>

    <p>  There will be no need to take any additional actions.  If the functionality of the device was needed in another room, then it is enough to simply transfer it geographically. </p><h2>  Internal Outlets </h2><p>  A remote-controlled internal outlet is a device that is mounted on a wall instead of the familiar outlets.  Such models are used, as a rule, during overhaul.  In this case, it is necessary to determine in advance where and for what purpose this device will be used.  In addition, it will be useful to correctly select the power of the outlet, otherwise it will not "pull" or it will be in vain to burn excess electricity. </p><h2>  Types of devices </h2><p>  All sockets of such a plan can be divided into several types, which differ from each other in the way they are controlled.  Which device to choose depends on you and your needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Types of smart sockets: </p><ul><li>  management via Internet channels (Wi-Fi, or mobile Internet); </li><li>  smart socket with remote SMS control (Megafon, MTS, Beeline, etc.); </li><li>  radio controlled models; </li></ul><p>  Those models that accept commands via Internet protocols can work from any corner of our planet where there is a World Wide Web.  Even if you are somewhere in sunny Cyprus, you can easily control the humidity level of your greenhouse in a cottage near Ryazan. </p>

    <p>  The remote control SMS-outlet allows you to turn on, for example, air conditioning or grill, standing in line at the supermarket.  When you come home with your purchases, your favorite microclimate and fried chicken will be waiting for you. </p><p>  A wireless remote control for an outlet on radio frequencies will help to cope with your equipment at a distance of no more than 30 meters.  At its core, these are ordinary remote controls that we use every day, sitting at the TV or under the air conditioning. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  In addition to types and types, smart devices can be divided into other distinctive design features that will also affect the choice of a particular model. </p><p>  Features of smart devices: </p><ul><li>  independent model (single); </li><li>  model with several separate control outputs; </li><li>  the main outlet with a child group (one unit controls the elements dependent on it); </li><li>  <span>smart extension cable (surge</span> protector on GSM protocols). </li></ul><p>  As for popularity, independent devices of a single type are most in demand among buyers.  The surge protector (socket with remote GSM-control) is less popular in everyday life, but is ideal if you have a large number of all kinds of home systems (acoustic, TV or computer).  When a person gets used to all the comfort that a smart device provides him with, then modern life is no longer possible without this miracle of technology.  And after some couple of months, consumers are already in full swing at groups of dependent outlets. </p><h2>  RC sockets </h2><p>  The radio socket with remote control (Expert Light, Redmond, etc.) consists of a main unit and a remote control.  In the box (sensible brand) you will always find detailed instructions for the operation of the model, which indicates the basic functionality of the device. </p>

    <p>  Connecting the device and subsequent operation does not require any specific skills.  At its core, a socket with remote control at radio frequencies is a kind of adapter that is taken into a 220 V socket familiar to all of us. After that, the necessary household device is connected to the power supply. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The external part of the outlet is always equipped with a sensor indicator, which shows the connection with the remote control.  In addition, most models have physical functionality on the case in case the remote control breaks down or the battery runs out.  Almost all devices of this plan have an operating frequency of 433-315 MHz.  For more detailed information you need to refer either to the manual, or to the data on the box. </p><p>  Despite the fact that most of these devices are born at the factories of the Celestial Empire, the workmanship (not cheap models) is always up to the mark: good plastic, well-placed ‚Äúfilling‚Äù and the presence of a fuse. </p><p>  Depending on the model you like, the device is able to recognize remote control commands at a distance of 30 to 40 meters.  Some premium devices still operate on 100-meter bands. </p><h2>  GSM devices </h2><p>  A device of this kind is a smart socket with remote SMS control.  Reviews about them are very diverse: someone believes that this is too troublesome, but for someone, on the contrary, is an ideal option.  For the normal functioning of such a device, any mobile gadget that supports the operation of SIM cards is required, as well as the transmission of SMS messages. </p>

    <p>  The essence of such a device is that the receiver, that is, the socket itself, has a similar SIM card slot, as if it were a phone.  On one side of the outlet is a <span>plug,</span> and on the other, an interface for connecting household appliances.  Depending on the selected model, the device may be equipped with an indicator that displays the received signal, power diodes, power supply to the dependent device, etc. </p><p>  The outlet can be controlled from virtually any distance.  The only requirement is the presence in the premises of the network of the selected telecom operator.  Some premium models have advanced functionality, where, for example, the owner can be notified of a power outage at home via SMS.  There are other interesting ‚Äútricks‚Äù that manufacturers are trying in every possible way to implement.  As a rule, for additional features to be fully available, you need to download a special application on your mobile gadget. </p><h2>  Wi-Fi devices </h2><p>  Sockets that work via wireless Wi-Fi protocols are also in enviable demand among our compatriots.  Such devices have many additional functionalities: motion indicator, timer, built-in camera, temperature sensors, etc. </p><p>  In addition, some manufacturers provide the opportunity for their consumers to use several types of interaction with the outlet as a control, such as SMS or Internet alerts.  That is, if there is no Wi-Fi network, then you can send SMSk to the device, and the socket will begin to fulfill the tasks assigned to it. </p><p>  Smart sockets of such a plan have a power button, LED status indicators, grounding and a spare battery (optional) to inform their owner about a power outage. </p>

    <p>  The device operates on standard Wi-Fi protocols at 802.11 b / g / n at a frequency of 2.4 Hz.  The connection is no different from the standard one - a router and an IP address.  Any device can act as a control panel: smartphone, tablet, laptop or personal computer.  All you need is to download the necessary software from the official website of the model developer and configure the device.  All control, as a rule, is intuitive and does not require <span>seven spans in the forehead.</span> </p><p>  Using smart sockets on Wi-Fi protocols can solve not only many domestic problems without personal participation, but also provide consumers with the proper comfort, for which it was actually purchased.  What additional features of the device depend on the distinctive characteristics of each particular model.  For example, if the outlet is equipped with a built-in surveillance camera and a noise sensor, then you can always monitor what is happening in the children's room. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The brands that manufacture smart sockets offer their customers increasingly modern and technically savvy models.  Naturally, each manufacturer has its own distinctive lines and series.  When choosing, you need to focus specifically on your needs and needs. </p><p>  The first thing to decide is where and for what purpose a smart socket will be placed.  If you need a device that will turn off and turn on the kettle with an alarm on a schedule, then it is not necessary to buy an expensive device with many bells and whistles.  Or, conversely, do not save on a group of outlets, putting one on some speaker system that is paired with a personal computer or a cinema hall. </p><p>  The second thing you need to pay attention to before buying is the power of the device.  In no case should you think that a model with a lower output power indicator can easily cope with a heating boiler or boiler.  Buying devices with an indicator of less than 2 kW is generally not worth it.  You just ruin not only the outlet, but also the equipment with which it works. </p><p>  Well, in third place we have a synergy of the device with other household appliances.  Be sure to pay attention to this point, because not all modern sockets are equipped with a special interface for some specific devices or sensors. </p>
