    <p>  Over the past three years, the most popular tourist city is Vinnitsa.  The Roshen fountain, located on the promenade of the same name, is the main tourist attraction in Ukraine, which thousands of tourists from all over the world come to see.  There are only a few such large-scale projects in the world.  Vinnytsia dancing fountain "Roshen" many compare with similar in the United Arab Emirates (Dubai).  However, Dubai's Roshen design is inferior in size.  In addition, with the advent of frost, the musical fountain "falls into hibernation", and in the spring it again begins to delight people.  In the summer season, Roshen works day and night.  But it is in the evening that the musical and light show with special effects begins, which lasts 15 minutes.  In the afternoon, the fountain is also magnificent: it rises majestically against the backdrop of sparkling river water in the sunlight.  Experts say that there are no similar analogues in any European country.  Vinnitsa fountain is included in the TOP-10 of the most spectacular places in the world. </p><h2>  Water light show </h2><p>  Vinnytsia, Roshen fountain are the real pride of Ukraine.  A water show is worth the time and money spent on the journey.  Every year, the singing fountains are improved.  Now Roshen is equipped with a modern laser system that allows you to demonstrate 3D animation on a large screen.  The screen is formed by splashes and water dust.  In the evening, viewers feel like fabulous heroes in the virtual world of music, water and light. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="musical fountain in Vinnitsa" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/458349.jpg" width="350"></div>  Every day, the Vinnitsa Fountain "Roshen" offers guests a new bewitching music, to which water jets "perform" a figured dance.  Such a fancy dance is accompanied by high-quality lighting, which consists of 560 water lamps.  Most of them are immersed in water.  They change their colors depending on the show program.  This backlight with a laser provides an incredibly colorful and spectacular show.  The fountain has a floating base.  And he dances under both classical and contemporary <span>musical works.</span>  Roshen sprays water upward, to the sides, spirally, with a curtain.  The creators of the fountain constantly come up with new special effects in order to expand the repertoire of a unique <span>hydraulic engineering structure.</span>

    <p>  Roshen Fountain is open from April to the end of October.  Every day, locals and tourists alike can enjoy a light 15-minute show accompanied by classical and (or) synchronized music and lasers.  During the day, the fountain delights people with ‚Äúdancing‚Äù to classical musical compositions, and at night all this is complemented by a laser, projector and multimedia.  Embankment p.  The Southern Bug is well lit in the evening and night hours.  On the dam there are places for spectators and playgrounds.  But when the evening laser show begins, the designated viewing area is sorely lacking: the embankment is simply crowded with people. </p><h2>  How to get there? <strong><br></strong> </h2>

    <p>  Vinnitsa Fountain regularly runs public transport.  First, tourists need to come to the city of Vinnitsa itself.  From there, the fountain can be reached in five ways. </p><ol><li>  Trams Nos. 1, 4, 6 to the stop.  "Kotsyubinsky Museum". </li><li>  Trolleybuses No. 5, 6, 11 to the stop.  "Kotsyubinsky Museum". </li><li>  From the Central Bus Station can be reached on foot (5 minutes). </li><li>  From the Western bus station you can take tram number 4, which goes to the stop.  "Kotsyubinsky Museum". </li><li>  From the Eastern bus station there are trolleybuses No. 1, 2, 10, 12 to the stop.  "Nansen Street." </li></ol><h2>  Future plans </h2><p>  Roshen embankment is a popular holiday destination for both Ukrainians themselves and visiting tourists.  The founder of the grand fountain Petro Poroshenko promises that his brainchild will be constantly improved and transformed.  Improvement of the embankment and adjacent territories does not stop.  In 2011, beautiful flowerbeds were created here, flowers and trees were planted.  With the advent of spring, singing fountains are especially attractive.  The photo taken during this period reflects all the beauty of the Roshen embankment.  In spring, trees and flowers begin to bloom here: the territory takes on a beautiful look and is enveloped in pleasant floral aromas.  Among this beauty, the Vinnitsa fountain rises majestically. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dancing fountains" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/458340.jpg" width="400"></div>  Now the city leadership is directing maximum efforts for the arrangement of Festivalny Island.  It is planned to turn it into a modern leisure park.  In the future, designers want to combine Kemp Island and the Roshen Fountain into a single complex.  Specialists have already begun to work, which means that this idea should soon be realized.  The new complex should be a worthy decoration not only of Vinnitsa, but of the whole Ukraine, which will attract even more tourists to the country.
