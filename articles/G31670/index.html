Chillon Castle History</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Two and a half kilometers from the small town of <span>Montreux (Switzerland),</span> on the shores of Lake Geneva, a magnificent building rises.  This is <span>Chillon Castle.</span>  You can see a photo of him in this article.  This is not a single structure, but the whole complex, which consists of 25 buildings erected at different times. </p><p>  This is the most famous and most visited attraction of a cozy and quiet Switzerland.  As early as the beginning of the nineteenth century (1816), the great J. Byron described him in the poem "Prisoner of Chillon".  After its publication, the castle became extremely popular.  And today thousands of tourists from all over the world come here. </p><h2>  Chillon Castle History </h2><p>  The first documented mention of this amazing building dates back to 1160.  However, many historians have a different opinion on this.  They are sure that the <span>fortification,</span> which was erected to protect strategically important territories, was built no later than the 9th century. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chillon castle" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1048974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In fairness, it should be said that such allegations are based only on information that was obtained by studying the finds found on this earth - Roman coins and statues.  There is currently no documentary evidence of the existence of the Chillon Castle in the 9th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that the location of the castle made it possible to completely control the road connecting the southern and northern parts of the Old World.  It is likely that outposts and fortresses could have been created here even earlier than historians believe.  Today, behind the castle, you can see the most strategically important road.  True, now this is no longer a trail, but a motorway on pylons (fifty meters high), which has a magnificent asphalt surface.  Today it connects two European countries: Italy and Switzerland. </p><h2>  Castle extension </h2><p>  But back to the story.  In the XII century, the castle, built at the Chillon rock, became the property of the genus of Savoy.  Since the beginning of the XIII century, it becomes the official residence of the Dukes.  By order of Pierre II, the reconstruction and expansion of the Chillon Castle began in 1253.  Work continued for fifteen years (up to 1268 g).  It was at this time that the palace acquired the look that its visitors today admire. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chillon castle photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1048975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All the main buildings, as well as annexes are made in the Gothic and Romanesque styles.  In the castle appeared splendidly decorated rooms intended for the rest of the dukes, and exquisite dining rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Secrets of the palace dungeons </h2><p>  At the same time, terrible dungeons appeared in it, which even today horrify visitors to the Chillon Castle.  They were turned into a huge prison in which prisoners were kept in appalling conditions. </p><p>  Tourists admire <span>Lake Geneva</span> and Chillon Castle.  <span>The sights of Switzerland are</span> really magnificent.  Nevertheless, one should know that in this place a huge number of innocent people died. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of chillon castle" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1048973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Chillon Castle was chosen by the Inquisitors.  In his gloomy dungeons, slaves tortured day and night.  Right in his courtyards, women were burned, whom the Holy Inquisition accused of witchcraft. </p><p>  As you know, in 1348 a plague epidemic swept across Europe.  Inquisitors and dukes (owners of the castle) accused the Jews of this tragedy, who began to burn thousands in bonfires that burned even at night. </p><p>  The environs of Chillon Castle were announced by the cries of dying Christians.  The thing is that they were accused of poisoning the water in all nearby wells.  Historians believe that this execution was indicative of Germany, which then began the mass extermination of Jews.  Some historians believe that, perhaps, it was precisely from those ancient times that anti-Semitic sentiments strengthened in the minds of Germans. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Geneva and Chillon Castle Attractions" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1048978.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Over time, the castle lost its strategic importance, but its prison remained active for a long time.  In her dungeons were the most dangerous criminals.  Such were considered all those who were opposed to the regime of the Dukes of Savoy. </p><h2>  Mysterious Prisoner </h2><p>  For more than four years, Francois Bonivard was kept in the dungeon.  Throughout this time, he was chained to a pillar with rusty chains.  Bonivar was a man who wanted to rid his long-suffering land of the dukes-tyrants.  The story of this prisoner of Chillon Castle inspired <span>George Byron</span> to write an immortal poem. </p><p>  As for the future fate of Bonivar, it can be called amazing.  He was not only not executed, but also released, however, this happened after the capture of Chillon Castle by Bernese Protestants.  Four terrible years of imprisonment remained in the past.  Bonivar after that lived happily ever after, wrote the story of Geneva, and was even married four times. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chillon castle address" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1048977.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Castle description </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, today the main attraction of Switzerland is Chillon Castle.  The culture, art, architecture of the country are intertwined in this beautiful complex.  Judging by the preserved documents, in the nineteenth century more than one hundred thousand travelers came here to see the mysterious castle. </p><h2>  What can be seen in the castle? </h2><p>  Noble visitors have also been here, including from Russia.  This amazing sight of Switzerland from a height resembles a fabulous ship.  A magnificent architectural ensemble, ancient legends associated with its dungeons and, of course, magnificent nature cannot but surprise even sophisticated guests from all over the world.  Visitors to the castle can get acquainted not only with its dramatic history and unique architectural monuments, but also see the sites of an ancient man discovered during archaeological excavations.  Historians believe that they belong to the Bronze Age. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chillon castle opening hours" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1048972.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Castle tour </h2><p>  An excursion to the Chillon Castle is a return to a distant history, since, in addition to the fortification itself, you can see the ruins of the outpost that defended the Roman Empire.  During excavations in the vicinity of the castle, interesting artifacts were discovered - statues of the gods whom the Romans worshiped, and the capitoline she-wolf.  Tourists have the opportunity to get acquainted with these finds in the castle tower, where the museum is equipped. </p><p>  Walking on a boat on Lake Geneva, you can see the walls with loopholes and massive towers.  I must say that from these loopholes they shot quite rarely, much more often from them dumped the corpses of prisoners of the dungeon.  It is not surprising that the plague epidemic did not leave Chillon Castle for a long time: the water of Lake Geneva at the castle was a breeding ground for infections. </p><h2>  Chapel </h2><p>  This is one of the most beautiful rooms of the castle.  Its ceiling and walls still preserve a unique painting made by the greatest artists of the XIV century.  This is the only building that did not suffer during the capture of the castle by supporters of Bonivar's political views. </p><p>  To explore the entire complex completely, a tourist may not have enough one day.  Countless dining rooms, richly decorated chambers of the dukes, four huge halls, from which an amazing view of Lake Geneva opens up ... Everything requires a detailed examination. </p><p>  The traditional interest of tourists is the count's bedroom and the "children's bed" located in it.  Do not think that guests are interested in a baby crib.  The fact is that in those ancient times, representatives of the upper class did not sleep lying down.  They fell asleep almost in a sitting position, since it was believed that only corpses could lie. </p><p>  Local guides argue that the bulk of tourists, in spite of the unusual beauty of the halls and fireplace rooms, are in a hurry to quickly end up in the dungeons of the castle.  According to reviews, many impressionable people believe that over the centuries they hear the heartbreaking cries of people dying in terrible agony.  On an excursion you can approach the loopholes.  Now they are closed with bars for security reasons.  However, it offers stunning views of Lake Geneva. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chillon castle culture art architecture" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1048976.jpg" width="600"></div>
