    <h2>  Norilsk: general information about the city </h2><p>  The city is located in the <span>Krasnoyarsk Territory,</span> is the administrative center of the district.  Interestingly, it ranks second in terms of the number of people living on its territory (Krasnoyarsk is in the first place). </p><p>  The city is located in a rather severe <span>climatic zone.</span>  Norilsk received the status of the northernmost city, in which a population of more than 150 thousand people lives. </p><p>  However, his records do not end there.  The city of Norilsk is among the settlements with the worst environmental conditions.  This happened due to the fact that the main activities of the city are <span>mining</span> and metal production.  This area has won a leadership position since there are no industrial zones of this magnitude anywhere else in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An interesting fact is that the entrance to the city is closed to foreign citizens.  To visit Norilsk, foreign tourists must go through the procedure for obtaining a special permit.  Such measures have been in force since 2001.  Prior to this, since 1991, foreign citizens have been able to freely visit Norilsk. </p>

    <h2>  What areas are included in the city? </h2><p>  Previously, Norilsk was not such a large settlement.  After the accession of neighboring cities to it, it became much larger.  Norilsk consists of several areas: </p><ul><li>  Central. </li><li>  Talnakh. </li><li>  Kayerkan. </li><li>  Snezhnogorsk. </li><li>  Oganer. </li></ul><p>  All of them are noticeably different from each other.  Some areas, such as Central, were built earlier, Leningrad architects were invited to design them.  Others relate to a later period of time.  Basically, they are built up with houses created according to standard designs. </p><h2>  Norilsk: population and its characteristics </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worthwhile to dwell in more detail on the issue concerning the inhabitants of the city.  To begin with, it should be noted that a strong increase in the population of Norilsk occurred after 2 more settlements were added to it, which are called Talnakh and Kayerkan.  They are currently areas of the city.  In this regard, the population of Norilsk has increased markedly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to 2015, the number of local residents is 176,251 people.  Recently, there has been a tendency for many people to leave Norilsk.  The population has greatly decreased.  A particularly serious decline was seen in 2014.  In the previous year, 2013, the number of inhabitants was 177,738 people, in 2014 - already 176,559. In 2015, the decline in numbers continued. </p><p>  If we look at the <span>rating of Russian cities</span> by the number of inhabitants, then Norilsk takes 105th place, which is a fairly high indicator.  In total, the list contains about 1114 cities.  So, we got acquainted in detail with the data on the number of the population of the city, and now it‚Äôs worth moving on to considering its national composition. </p>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Many are interested in what kind of natural zone is Norilsk?  On the map, it is located almost on the Taimyr Peninsula, where the forest-tundra dominates.  This type of landscape is characterized by some features.

    <h2>  Timezone </h2><p>  We became acquainted in detail with the nature and climate in which Norilsk is located.  Time here also deserves a separate consideration.  The village lies in a time zone called ‚ÄúKrasnoyarsk time‚Äù.  The difference with Moscow is 4 hours.  Thus, when in Moscow 12:00, in Norilsk it is already 16:00.  In Russia, this time zone is designated as MSK + 4.  According to worldwide designations, the city is located in the UTC + 7 zone.  In addition to the Krasnoyarsk Territory, where Norilsk is located, this time is set in the territory of another 5 regions of Russia.  Accordingly, we met with the time zone in which Norilsk lies.  Time is not translated here, as in other regions of the country. </p><h2>  Sights and culture of Norilsk </h2><p>  It is worth telling about the objects of historical heritage that exist in this wonderful city.

In short, the cultural life here is well developed and represented in various directions.  It is definitely worth visiting the listed institutions, coming to Norilsk.

    <h2>  Architectural sights of Norilsk and their features </h2><p>  Interestingly, some areas of Norilsk are surprisingly reminiscent of St. Petersburg.  Many will ask themselves: why do two cities have such a similarity?  This is primarily due to the fact that many Leningrad architects were invited to Norilsk, who designed various buildings.  Once here, you should definitely see the houses located on Leninsky Prospekt and Guards Square. </p><p>  After some time, the architecture of the city changed slightly, since in the 1960s, typical buildings gained popularity here, as in many other settlements of Russia. </p><p>  The construction and architecture of Norilsk has a lot of features.  They are mainly associated with the fact that when building buildings on permafrost soils, specific factors must be taken into account.  Here, architects managed to gain a unique experience in construction in harsh environmental conditions.  In the future, this knowledge was actively used in other cities with a similar climate. </p>

    <h2>  Industry and Economics of Norilsk </h2><p>  As you know, the city is a real center of metallurgy.  The region produces a large number of non-ferrous metals such as copper, cobalt, nickel, as well as precious metals: gold, silver, platinum, palladium.  In addition, sulfur, metallic selenium, sulfuric acid, etc. are produced here. Of particular interest is the fact that about 96% of nickel produced in Russia is produced in Norilsk.  Thus, we can say that the city is a major producer and supplier of many materials, not only in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, but throughout the country.  According to some reports, the income of the Krasnoyarsk Territory consists of almost 60% of the revenues that Norilsk provides.  Russia includes many similar regions, but this city is considered the largest industrial center of this type. </p>

    <h2>  Communication in the city </h2><p>  It is worth talking separately about such a thing as communication.  Norilsk phones consist of 6 digits.  Cellular communication came here quite late in comparison with other Russian cities.  This happened at the end of 2001.  Now there are already 4 mobile operators.  Of particular interest is the fact that Norilsk is not connected to other cities with cable channels.  Communication with them is via satellite channels. </p><p>  You need to know the important Norilsk phones, where you can contact in case of emergency: </p><ol><li>  Fire Department - (101) 01. </li><li>  Police - (102) 02. </li><li>  Ambulance - (103) 03. </li><li>  Help Norilsk Airport - 006. </li><li>  Information about the weather - 007. </li><li>  The duty unit of the traffic police - 43-54-59, 43-54-58. </li><li>  The duty unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs department is 47-24-01. </li></ol><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Be sure to discuss the transport component of the city.  As you know, air communication with other settlements is carried out, since there is an airport near the city.  Norilsk has 1 air port, which is called Alykel.  It is located 52 kilometers from the city. </p><p>  Also, the city is connected by a transport network with Dudinka.  Moving between them is carried out using buses.  In summer, it is also possible to travel along river routes through Dudinka to Krasnoyarsk.  In winter, there is a transport connection with Arkhangelsk also through the specified settlement.  However, the easiest way to get to the city is the airport.  Norilsk is considered a rather inaccessible city. </p><p>  The transport network in the city itself is well developed - you can move around Norilsk with the help of buses and minibus. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  It is no secret that because of the large number of harmful industries in the city, the environment has deteriorated greatly.  Various studies have been carried out, which showed that Norilsk is the village with the most polluted ecology in Russia.  Here, many harmful substances are released into the air, such as chlorine, sulfuric acid, hydrogen fluoride, selenium dioxide and many others.  Currently, statistical data on various types of pollution are continuously collected here, as well as their analysis.  The nature around the city is badly damaged, many ecologists say that the region has a very high risk of environmental disaster. </p>
