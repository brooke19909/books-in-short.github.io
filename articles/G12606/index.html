A true masterpiece of architectural art is a stone castle located at the confluence of the waterways of the Neman and Vilia.  A settlement was formed around it, which gave rise to modern Kaunas.  The architectural landmark, which is 800 years old, gives the colorful city, the second largest in Lithuania, an indescribable charm. </p><h2>  Defensive structure erected to repel the attacks of the crusaders </h2><p>  Archaeological excavations have shown that even before the construction of the castle in this area was a wooden settlement.  The place for the fortress, which became the largest defensive structure, was not chosen by chance.  The fact is that the lands of Kaunas (Lithuania) were dangerously close to the lands of the Teutonic Order, and the belligerent crusader neighbors repeatedly tried to seize the nearby territory.  And to protect against them, a defensive structure, Kauno pilis, was built of stone and brick.  The Teutonic knights could not get to the bastion, which was considered the key to the Principality of Lithuania, unnoticed, and those on duty at the top saw everything that was happening for several kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaunas castle opening hours" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2088958.jpg"></div>

The current Pope, who dreamed of imposing Catholicism in the country, wanted either to end Lithuania forever, or to convert it all the same to Christianity.  However, pagans Lithuanians were in no hurry to accept the new faith. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaunas Lithuania" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2088960.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After accurate information appeared about the powerful fort, built to repel the attacks of the crusaders, a military campaign of knights, who came from all over Europe, to the city began.  The invaders, who dreamed of conquering an <span>impregnable fortress,</span> built tall wooden towers that helped them overcome the powerful walls that collapsed after undermining. </p><h2>  Confrontation to the Teutons </h2><p>  25 days opposed the Teutonic knights of Kaunas (Lithuania), but as soon as the last wall fell, the crusaders entered the city.  Many residents fled to a defensive structure that could not resist the onslaught.  The knights who broke into the set fire to the castle, killed and burned more than a thousand Lithuanians.  And only 36 valiant warriors who survived surrendered to the mercy of the victors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the crusaders left, the castle was again carefully restored, but several times the participants of military campaigns besieged the fortress, bringing death and destruction.  And all the time, the inhabitants, who did not even think about moving the bastion to another place, rebuilt it again, making it more powerful. </p><p>  High (above 10 meters) and double fortified walls with loopholes surrounded the most recognizable monument of the city.  Four towers appeared, in which not only the garrison lived, but also the ammunition depots.  And around them, semicircular bastions were built for additional fortification. </p><h2>  Resurrected from the ashes castle </h2><p>  Kaunas Castle, which had serious damage, successfully survived many sieges.  It lost its strategic importance after the Battle of Grunwald took place in the 15th century, which changed history.  The tipping battle brought defeat to the Teutons, and a new state appeared in the international arena - Polish-Lithuanian.  Grand Duke Vytautas rebuilt the fortress, having slightly modernized it.  However, two centuries later, the waters of a powerful river eroded the land on which the historical monument stood, and its northern part collapsed. </p><p>  Despite this, Russian and Swedish soldiers often used the fort as a defensive structure, and the last time this happened at the beginning of the XVII century, during the Northern War. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaunas castle Lithuania" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2088959.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For a long time, the dilapidated Kaunas Castle remained abandoned, and only with the 30s of the last century does its revival begin.  The former defensive fortress is transferred to the local museum, and a wonderful green park with many well-groomed walking paths is laid next to it, which makes it so pleasant to stroll in a hot summer. </p><h2>  City Business Card </h2><p>  Now part of the building has remained from the important strategic object of medieval Lithuania: a powerful round tower, which was covered with a thick layer of earth, and fortress walls.  The amazing beauty of the most ancient architectural ensemble of the state is complemented by magnificent landscapes that add mystery to the structure.  In Kaunas Castle (Lithuania), various exhibitions are currently being held, visitors of which get acquainted with modern sculpture and painting.  You can also visit concerts of ancient music, costume shows, immersing in the atmosphere of the Middle Ages.  Children‚Äôs festivals, informative and fun, will appeal to kids, while Christmas and Halloween events will appeal to more adult audiences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaunas castle how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2088956.jpg"></div>
