It can be a small rural landscape, a grandfather's hut with a woman from fairy tales for a table theater or a modern city block.  For flat paintings, such crafts are more convenient to do from plain colored paper.  For a theater or a three-dimensional street layout, it is best to use double-sided thick A4 paper in bright colors. </p><h2>  Material for work </h2><p>  To work in the origami technique, a sheet of paper must have a square shape.  This is easily achieved by bending the rectangle with one of the diagonal angles.  The excess strip is cut off with scissors.  Paper houses can have a different shape and method of folding paper, it is easiest to carry out such work according to the drawings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami paper house" class="if uuid-3214557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3214557.jpg"></div><p>  In this article, we will look at how you can make an origami paper house in three different patterns.  They are all designed for school-age children who already know how to follow the sequence and act carefully. </p><p>  In order for the house to acquire the outlines of the present, they use markers, colored pencils or paste windows and doors cut separately by glue stick. </p><h2>  First option </h2><p>  Before starting work on origami from colored paper, the child needs to explain the sequence of actions with a square sheet.  The surface of the table should be flat and solid.  Bends need to be ironed only after making sure that the sides or corners are connected correctly.  If once a child makes a mistake and makes an uneven bend, then this error can be easily corrected.  However, if this is repeated often, it is best to change the workpiece, otherwise the work will be sloppy and wrinkled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami house" class="if uuid-3214556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3214556.jpg"></div><p>  You need to act in the sequence indicated by numbers.  There are schemes without numbers, in which case you need to perform work in a direction from top to bottom and from left to right.  The last, usually larger picture is the result that should be the result. </p><p>  The arrows indicate the direction of the folds, and the dashed lines indicate where the fold should be made.  Paper origami hard spots are circled.  This is an enlarged image of small elements.  Thus, the method of bending the sheet in one place or another is more clearly visible. </p><h2>  Skyscraper </h2><p>  The following craft is a high-rise city house.  This is a narrow building with a pointed roof that looks like a skyscraper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flashpedia.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami skyscraper" class="if uuid-3214554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3214554.jpg"></div><p>  The first thing to do is fold the square along the diagonals.  This will help determine the center of the workpiece and will make it easier and more even to fold the paper along the folds made. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An arrow resembling a lightning indicates that you need to make two alternate bends, and then create a crease in the selected place.  An arrow with a loop in the figure instructs the master to turn the workpiece to the opposite side. </p><p>  Many windows are cut out of colored paper in a contrasting color according to the pattern.  To make elements faster, you need to fold the sheet several times, and then cut many parts along the contours at once.  To make the origami paper house stand upright, it can be glued to a cardboard base.  Be sure to make this option out of thicker paper with a density of 100 or 160 g / m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  Simple craft </h2><p>  The next option for making a paper house is the simplest.  Even a senior preschooler under the guidance of parents or a kindergarten teacher will cope with it.  To make it easier to assemble such a low structure, after smooth bends under No. 1-4, it will be necessary to fold the workpiece in half for convenience, and then connect the angles indicated in the figure by the dotted line on the diagonal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme of origami house" class="if uuid-3214559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3214559.jpg"></div><p>  To get the trapezoid of the roof, hold the lower part of the work with your hands, and open the upper one in opposite directions and lower it down.  If the folds are smoothed carefully, then the detail will appear clearly.  Therefore, try to accompany each folding with a smoothing of the bend with the nail plate.  Even experienced craftsmen use a ruler or scissors to make a flat fold of paper, especially thick. </p><p>  Now you know how to make an origami paper house for children.  Good luck </p>
