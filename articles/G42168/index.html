On the one hand, the equipment is distinguished by high-quality technical characteristics, which makes it possible to attribute it to the premium class, on the other hand, it has a very high cost.  The products are manufactured by the Swedish company of the same name.  In addition to Asko, washing machine manufacturers are no longer registered in Scandinavia. </p><p>  However, the products are not very popular among Russians, despite improved operational solutions.  For the price of one copy, an economical buyer prefers to purchase two, or even three budget models, if the former fails.  Nevertheless, supporters of high-quality technology claim that the products deserve attention and leave positive feedback about it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kitchenthings.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Machine &quot;Asko&quot;: reviews" class="if uuid-3198353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3198353.jpg"></div><h2>  A few words about the manufacturer </h2><p>  The Asko washing machine has reviews not only from experts studying the internal contents of the appliance, but also from consumers who have the opportunity to purchase premium products.  The Swedish company engaged in the production of washing machines under the Asko brand is older than even such a renowned company as Indesit.  At the origins of its creation is a farmer who possessed design abilities, and subsequently his livestock raising activities were transformed into industrial production. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the international market, Asko washing machines are popular and regularly win international awards.  Practical use has proved that the actual <span>service life of washing machines</span> is estimated at several tens of years.  Many models became the first in the nomination ‚ÄúCorrelation of ergonomics, quality and economy‚Äù. </p><p>  Basically, all products are manufactured in factories located in Sweden.  However, devices under this brand are also collected in Slovenia. </p><h2>  Technical device of the machine </h2><p>  Asko washing machines have received only positive reviews from experts.  Employees of service centers confirm that the high cost of products is justified and associated with the high quality of equipment, its durability, and the use of innovative technologies in production. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.winningappliances.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Asko&quot;: reviews of specialists" class="if uuid-3198355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3198355.jpg"></div><h2>  Lack of rubber seal </h2><p>  It is known that professional class cars do not have a rubber seal located between the door and the hatch.  A similar idea was used in the manufacture of equipment and for home use by Asko engineers.  Experts note that this part is constantly cracking, due to the presence of water and dirt, a musty odor appears, passing on to clothes.  Asko washing machines lack this disadvantage.  Without a sealant, the equipment has become more hygienic and reliable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Depreciation Features </h2><p>  The noise during operation and vibration of any Asko washing machine are almost reduced to zero.  The reviews of the happy owners of the equipment confirm that even on an imperfectly flat surface the equipment stands like a glove, does not make loud noises when washing or spinning, and does not vibrate at maximum speed. </p><p>  The engineers of the company were able to achieve such characteristics by using steel shock absorbers.  It is known that in standard washing machines used by housewives at home, two shock absorbers are used.  In this case, four are used.  They take the brunt of the laundry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gozzoelettrodomestici.it" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.gozzoelettrodomestici.it/sito/negozio/lavatrici/asko-w-2086-c-w-lavatrice-carica-frontale-8-kg/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about the car &amp; quot; Asko W2086 &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-3198374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3198374.jpg"></div><h2>  Drum design </h2><p>  The Asko washing machine has also gained positive reviews due to the special design of the drum.  The presence inside the blades helps to move the laundry to the center.  There are also small holes that are designed to remove dirt.  As a result, the mechanical effect on the laundry is reduced, which prevents its damage.  Drums are made only of durable stainless steel.  Regardless of the model of the washing machine, they have a design that allows you to remove small debris during washing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kitchenthings.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washing machines Asko" class="if uuid-3198356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3198356.jpg"></div><p>  Customer reviews using the equipment of this company confirm that the laundry is perfectly washed, while the fibers are not damaged. </p><h2>  Availability of electronic sensors </h2><p>  A real find for many is the Asko washing machine.  Customer reviews show that it is sometimes difficult to navigate the selection of the optimal program for the type of soiling and weight of the laundry.  In this case, the hostess does not need to choose the necessary washing mode herself.  The equipment collects information automatically thanks to the presence of electronic sensors and independently selects the cycle time and the required volume of water.  According to experts, such a technology helps to significantly save on the consumption of electricity and water resources.  In addition, the quality of washing clothes is improved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.appliancesonline.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washing machine &quot;Asko&quot;: reviews" class="if uuid-3198354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46966/3198354.jpg"></div><h2>  Overview of the W6984 ‚Äã‚ÄãEmbedded Model </h2><p>  Asko W6984 ‚Äã‚ÄãW washing machine reviews have accumulated only positive.
