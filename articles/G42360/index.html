    <h2>  History </h2><p>  In the XIV-XVI centuries, at the place where the Sokolniki park (Moscow) is now located, there was a dense forest, in which Ivan the Terrible and then Alexei Mikhailovich liked to hunt.  They hunted mainly with the help of falcons.  Hence the name of the park.  And only in the 30s of the last century the Falcon grove received the status of a city park.  We can say that it was from this moment that the cultural life of Sokolnikov began.  The area began to be ennobled: well-groomed alleys appeared, and the Krug concert hall was built in the central part of the park.  A dance veranda, a library, attractions, the Sokolniki restaurant, a concert stage and much more were opened.  This place has become one of the most beloved among Muscovites. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But during the Great Patriotic War, all these institutions were closed.  Instead, military enterprises began their work.  Rifle and tank divisions were formed here.  But as soon as German troops ceased to threaten Moscow, all institutions were reopened.  And at the end of the 50s, an exhibition hall was built, since then all kinds of interesting exhibitions and other cultural events have been constantly held here. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sokolniki park address" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/665008.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Park today </h2><p>  In recent years, Sokolniki Park (how to get to this wonderful place, you will learn below) has changed very much.  Constantly taking measures to improve not only the appearance of the park, but also the quality of rest.  The full reconstruction of Sokolnikov is planned to be completed by 2016. </p><p>  Guests are greeted by the main avenue.  It is divided into zones for pedestrians, cyclists and skaters, so it will be very comfortable to move around.  This wide avenue leads to the fountain and the great circle, from where, in fact, your study of Sokolnikov will begin.  Despite the fact that the territory of the park is huge, you won‚Äôt get lost: there are signs everywhere, so you will always find a way back.  In order to enjoy even a small part of the entertainment that the park offers, the day is definitely not enough for you.  But this is wonderful: there will be a reason to return here again and again.  In summer, many cozy cafes are open here, recreation areas are equipped where you can lie on the grass and even fry the barbecue on your own.  You will get the impression that you are not in a huge metropolis, but at a forest edge.  Near the ponds there are recreation areas that will remind you of a vacation in the distant southern countries: deckchairs, palm trees, <span>white sand</span> will set you up for a romantic mood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Once you have time to visit all the attractions, exhibitions and just walk along the alleys, how the summer ends.  But do not be discouraged: <span>in winter, entertainment</span> in Sokolniki Park is no less, and maybe vice versa.  In the cold season, ice rinks are being poured into Sokolniki and snow slides are being built.  You can go skiing, admire the ice sculptures and buy many pleasant trinkets at winter fairs.  You should definitely come here for Shrovetide festivities: you‚Äôll get impressions for a whole year.  In this park not only young people and couples with young children like to spend free time, but also elderly people.  And not by chance: there is entertainment for everyone for any generation.  And if you come to the capital, then you should definitely visit the Sokolniki park.  Every Muscovite can tell you his address. </p>
