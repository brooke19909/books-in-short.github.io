    <p>  The palace of Ducale, like Pilott, belonged to the Farnese family.  The Duke of Ottavio built it in the second half of the 16th century.  Part of it was badly damaged in World War II.  However, Bossi‚Äôs murals and stucco, depicting more than 200 species of birds, and other rooms with murals are still preserved: Alchina Hall, Hall of Kisses, Hall of the Golden Age. </p><h2>  The green corners of Parma </h2><p>  There are many objects that may surprise the tourist of Parma.  Sightseeing is difficult to see in one day, because in the arsenal of the city there are also beautiful parks.  The Ducal Park at the palace of the same name was designed by various architects, sometimes in Italian, then in French, or even in the English style.  Twenty hectares of the garden are decorated with fountains, mythological sculptures and antique vases. </p>

    <p>  Another park is located near the popular attractions of Parma - the citadel.  Only a few walls and the main gate remain from the building itself.  They say that it was this fort that became the prototype for the fortress in Stendhal‚Äôs work ‚ÄúParma Monastery‚Äù.  The park has the appearance of a pentagonal star, repeating the shape of the former fortification, there is a lot of greenery and cozy enough for a walk. </p><p>  The famous university owns a botanical garden, founded in 1770.  Most of its plants are rare, many of them grow only within Italy.  His collection is constantly updated with new specimens of an unusual and unique flora. </p>
