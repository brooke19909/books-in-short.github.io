    <p>  To play the Thousand, you need a deck that consists of 24 cards.  Only nine are involved in the “Marriage” and cards by value above it, the rest are simply put aside. </p><h2>  Which two card combination is called a “margin”? </h2><p>  The more points a participant can score in one round, the higher his chance of winning.  In order for the score to be as large as possible, it is necessary to try to put together a combination of “marriage” cards.  This is the name of the combination when a player holds a queen and a king of the same suit.  With their help, the participant can assign a trump card or kill him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The price of the marriage depends on the suit.  Worms are the most valuable - you can get as many as one hundred points for them.  80 points are awarded for bubi, 60 are added for clubs, and only 40 points for spades.  All other cards have a much lower value, so to win, you just need to know which combination of the two cards is called “margin” and how to declare it. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Before proceeding to the study of the rules, it would be nice to know the history of this game.  It appeared already in 1916, but then it was called "Rocking Chair".  The rules of the game were almost identical to the modern One Thousand.  The only difference between them is the combination of which two cards is called “margin”.  At that time, the combination of an ace and a king of the same suit was considered the main one.  Gambling got its modern interpretation thanks to the sailors, who spent most of their time sitting at the card table to ease their sea journey. </p><h2>  The basic rules of playing cards "Maryage" </h2><p>  The participant on whom the distribution of cards will be at the beginning is determined by lot.  Next, the participant will be dealt cards, sitting on the left hand of the dealer.  After mixing the playing deck, the player sitting on the right hand is obliged to move the cards.  After this, the dealer has the right to take the last card.  However, if there is a nine, the deck should be re-moved.  If the nine falls out three times in a row, the shifter receives a penalty of 120 points.  When the jack falls, it is placed in the middle of the deck, after which the cards no longer move. </p><p>  Dealing should be done on one card, starting to the left of the dealer.  Also, three cards must be put in the draw.  If during the deal one of the cards was revealed for any reason, the dealer will receive 120 penalty points, and the deal will be transferred to the next participant. </p><p>  After distribution, bargaining for the buy begins.  If a participant, having looked at the cards, understands that he cannot score 100 points, then he can “save”.  Bets begin with the participant sitting on the right hand of the distributor.  Bidding is clockwise.  The betting step cannot be more than five points.  Bets start at one hundred.  Participants who do not have a “marriage” combination on their hands are prohibited from betting more than 120 points. </p>

    <p>  After the buyback was taken by the participant, the person who bought it must give two unnecessary cards to the rivals.  If the participant collected a margin during the game, he must declare it, otherwise the combination will not count.  However, this combination can be announced only on condition that he managed to get the first bribe.  But it is worth remembering that the opponent can catch the move. </p>
