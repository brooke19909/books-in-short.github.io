    <h2>  History of creation and development, address </h2><p>  The zoo in Kiev was officially formed and began operating on March 21, 1909.  It was then that he was given the territory for location in the botanical garden, which belonged to the University of St. Vladimir, and was allowed to raise funds for the maintenance of pets.  After considering the application, M. M. Chikhachev, holding the post of vice-governor, in May 1909 agreed to establish at the entrance to the Zoo in Kiev, the photo of which is presented in the article, "a box for collecting money."  Thanks to this funding, in the same year, the number of pets was already 115 species.  At first, the zoo in Kiev was kept at the expense of the charity of philanthropists and private individuals.  The collection was composed mainly of wild animals, which their owners refused.  Such patrons were businessman <span>A. Tereshchenko,</span> architect V. Gorodetsky, Countess M. Brockaya, artist S. Svyatoslavsky, custodian of Askania-Nova F. Falts-Fein, Tsar Nicholas II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Expansion </h2><p>  In 1910, the territory of the <span>zoological garden</span> almost doubled, which was facilitated by the University board.  From that moment, the institution already owned one and a half hectares.  The city authorities helped the zoo and twice a year allocated subsidies in the amount of 1,000 and 1,500 tsar rubles.  In May 1912, the administration provided a new place for the establishment of the institution, which was most suitable for him.  Its area was 23.2 hectares.  It was located in the suburbs of Shulyavka, near the building of the Polytechnic Institute.  The relief of this area was not suitable for the construction of a residential building, but was suitable for the formation of the territory of the zoo.  The ravines were convenient for justifying the rates for birds, in the upper part they equipped squads, cages and aviaries.  The housewarming took place in 1913, but further development of the zoological park temporarily stopped.  This was due to the beginning of the First World War, and after the Civil War.  After going through significant difficulties, enthusiasts were able to save the animals and the arrangement of the institution until the end of hostilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in Kiev" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/461585.jpg" width="600"></div>  In 1919, the Zoo in Kiev became the property of the newly created state.  He was given official status.  Venanti Burdzinsky was appointed the head of the Kiev Zoological Park.  In the period of the 20s of the last century, the institution began to develop rapidly.  The collection was replenished with new species of animals, the construction of the elephant elephant, premises for monkeys began, the old enclosures expanded, the water supply system improved, and <span>scientific work</span> was actively conducted <span>.</span>  In the mid-30s, the zoo in Kiev secured the entire territory, which was fenced.  A veterinary hospital began to operate, in which several laboratories and departments were equipped, a pharmacy for animals, an indicative forge, and a procedure chamber were opened. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in Kiev official site" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/461239.jpg" width="550"></div>  The Patriotic War made its own negative adjustments: the park was destroyed, almost all animals were taken to Germany.  In 1943, after the <span>liberation of Kiev,</span> it was quickly restored by the forces of the collective.  April 10, 1944, the activities of the institution resumed again.  In 1966, a long reconstruction of the zoological park began.  A central entrance, ticket offices, a boiler room, and a tour desk were built.  In the winter of 1970, the construction of a new bird pavilion, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was 2400 m¬≤, was completed.  In the early 70s, the opening of the aquaterrarium took place, in 1976 a complex for primates was built, and eight years later the "Island of Animals" was opened.  In 1983, the zoo in Kiev became part of a network of territories and objects of the nature reserve fund.  The active formation of an exposition of exotic and rare animals began, and scientific and practical activities were carried out to study the species and study the methods of their breeding.
