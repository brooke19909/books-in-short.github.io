    <p>  Every day animators work with all the guests, organizing entertainment programs and evening shows, and in the evening there is live music.  The hotel provides a shuttle service to the Old Town and the Naama Bay.  It‚Äôs free for the dolphin show, and there‚Äôs a discount on entry fees. </p><h2>  Renaissance Golden View Beach Resort 5 *: location reviews </h2><p>  The total hotel rating for all reviews (about 1300) is 7.8 on a ten-point scale.  From their experience, many tourists are convinced that, preferring the All Inclusive system, you need to choose the hotel very meticulously, because in it, most likely, you will spend most of the time.  In terms of location, this complex is only pleasing to everyone.  The place is cozy, away from the hustle and bustle, has a large landscaped area and you can enjoy walking and enjoying nature.  Cleanliness reigns everywhere, the pools are crystal clear. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the Renaissance Golden View Beach Resort 5 * is located on a hill, the whole territory is replete with winding paths and stairs, descents and ascents.  The buildings and reception area are located in different buildings.  According to our compatriots, for people with disabilities and problems with the musculoskeletal system, this can become a problem. </p><h2>  Rooms and service </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews left by tourists who have already visited the Renaissance Golden View Beach Resort 5 * hotel, everyone was satisfied with the rooms.  They are such as stated in the photo and in the advertisement: spacious, furnished, not old furniture, all communications and plumbing are in perfect order. </p><p>  The staff is generally friendly and answers all questions.  Cleaning is done daily, however, not always with high quality and sometimes not at all quickly.  Some vacationers note the rudeness of the staff and his desire to constantly evade work. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In this matter, the opinions of vacationers from different countries, including Russia, were divided.  Tourists note the average quality of alcoholic beverages and the limited "all inclusive" time.  In general, restaurants, bars, as well as drinks and food in them, visitors rate the solid four.  This, in principle, does not correspond to the declared level of the hotel.  To some, the food seemed rather monotonous, but nevertheless tasty and of high quality. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Clear water and a wonderful reef with colorful fish were remembered by many guests and it is not surprising that this is what Egypt is famous for.  5 * Renaissance Golden View Beach Resort, however, according to them, was cunning when he announced the open beach.  Sunset at sea is possible only from the pontoon.  From the shore it is very shallow, the water level reaches the knees, and then the coral reef begins, and all the rescuers stop.  But the sea most often pleases with calm and the absence of strong drafts and wind is noted. </p>

    <p>  Opinion was also divided on the organization of the work of animators.  Some noted the absolute primitiveness and boredom in games and entertainment, while others, on the contrary, thank the company of lovely girls for their quality work and memorable leisure time at sea.  Many appreciated the lesson in aerobics (regular and water) and yoga. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that the Renaissance Sharm el Sheikh Golden View Beach Resort hotel reviews are mostly positive, but with an indication of some shortcomings in organizational matters.  It is hoped that the administration of the complex will take all the wishes into account and take note of the comments to make this place even more pleasant and interesting. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  The hotel is located in a quiet area.  Tourists who have been there recommend to get out of it and be sure to visit two restaurants.  The first - Italian - "La Luna", luxurious, expensive and sophisticated.  It is located in another five-star hotel, on the second floor, and the windows overlook the coast, which allows you to enjoy the pleasant breeze and starry sky over Egypt.  Dishes of Italian cuisine are prepared from high-quality and freshest products, tables need to be reserved in advance. </p><p>  The second restaurant is Souk, it is a whole gastronomic complex, one of a kind in this resort.  The design and menu harmoniously combine the elegance and sophistication of Southern Europe and the sophistication of the mysterious East. </p><p>  Tired of leisure, you can always get to the heart of the Old Town, which is located only three kilometers from the hotel.  It is like immersion in a completely different, unfamiliar world.  <span>Oriental bazaars</span> and souvenir shops with handmade products, the smell of oriental spices and sweets, the culture of Ancient Egypt, museums and architectural monuments.  And, of course, traditional cuisine.  The streets are filled with the aromas of delicious street food, you just can not help but try it.  Tempting cafes and bars will surely treat their visitors with delicious coffee, kebabs, ice cream and fruit, grilled meat and various sweets. </p>
