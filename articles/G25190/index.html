It is hard to believe that this extensive network of stores is only 12 years old. </p><p>  The first store in the ‚Äúat home‚Äù format was opened in the small Ural town of Kopeisk, Chelyabinsk Region.  Customers liked its distinctive feature: they sold good wines.  Surprisingly, prices did not ‚Äúbite‚Äù. </p><p>  First-class alcoholic beverages are the main focus of the network.  The brand‚Äôs idea is to increase the culture of drinking.  After all, to learn to understand a lot about wines and become a connoisseur of affordable and possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="56nv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The logo of the company &quot;Red and White&quot;" class="if uuid-2240833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2240833.jpg"></div><p>  Red and White seeks to change people's attitudes toward alcohol.  Some strong alcoholic drinks and dessert wines are delivered from abroad to Russia for the first time. </p><p>  Red and White stores are located in 54 regions of Russia.  50,000 employees work for buyers.  Wine, food, animal feed and affordable prices are not all the offers on the web. </p><p>  The company has developed a bonus scale for a discount card. </p><h2>  Discount for regular customers </h2><p>  The discount card "Red and White" will be offered to the visitor when buying in a network store.  It is only necessary that the purchase amount exceeds five hundred rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the back of the card is a barcode.  Use his number to activate the discount card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Barcode on a discount card" class="if uuid-2240844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2240844.jpg"></div><p>  Here's how the bonuses on the Red and White discount card are calculated: </p><ul><li>  the amount of purchases of five hundred rubles and above - 1% discount; </li><li>  purchase of more than three thousand rubles - 2% discount; </li><li>  if the store spent eight thousand rubles - a 4% discount; </li><li>  bought for eighteen thousand rubles - a discount of 6%; </li><li>  when the total cost of goods purchased in the network reaches thirty-six thousand rubles, you get 8% bonuses; </li><li>  the final discount on the discount card "Red and White" - 10%;  Available starting from sixty thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  The discount in the stores "Red and White" is cumulative.  The amount of discount is determined by the total amount of purchases in stores in the network. </p><h2>  Card Activation Using the Internet </h2><p>  After receiving the card, go through the registration on the site "Red and White".  After activation, discounts accumulate on the card. </p><p>  Step-by-step registration of the Red and White discount card: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the company website. </li><li>  In the "Discount Card" section, find the "Activate" item. </li><li>  Fill in the proposed information table. </li><li>  Click on ‚ÄúActivate‚Äù. </li></ol><p>  Two days after registering the Red and White discount card, discounts are available. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Discount card &quot;Red and White&quot;" class="if uuid-2240839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2240839.jpg"></div><p>  The second option to activate the card is using a mobile application. </p><p>  Until January 15, 2018, a New Year campaign is held on the official website of the company. </p><p>  Buyers are invited to install a mobile application.  It is available for download from the App Store and Google Play.  If you enter the specified five-digit promotional code, you will immediately receive a 10% discount.  No need to wait until the sum of all purchases reaches sixty thousand. </p><h2>  How many bonuses have accumulated? </h2><p>  To check the cumulative discount, ask a question to the cashier at the next purchase. </p><p>  If you have Internet access, you can easily keep abreast of accumulated bonuses: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the official website of the network. </li><li>  Go to the "Discount Card". </li><li>  Find the discount card on the site by barcode number. </li></ol><p>  A registration table will open with information about the accumulated discounts. </p><h2>  What if force majeure? </h2><p>  If the discount card is lost, broken or damaged - a nuisance. </p><p>  Recovery is not provided, you will have to purchase a new card.  Bonuses will be lost, because on cards with different numbers, discounts cannot be added. </p><p>  But it is not all that bad!  Link the card number to your personal account in the mobile application - all bonuses will be saved.  At the same time, it becomes possible to use the electronic discount card ‚ÄúRed and White‚Äù. </p><p>  Only one card number can be assigned to one mobile phone number. </p><p>  You will first of all learn from SMS messages about new products, regular interesting promotions of Krasnoye and Beloye company, and changes in the offer of discounts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasnoeibeloe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="We attach the card to the mobile application" class="if uuid-2240867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2240867.jpg"></div><h2>  In the capital and the suburbs </h2><p>  You will find Krasnoye and Beloe stores in Moscow in shopping supermarkets, as well as in the ‚Äúat home‚Äù format. </p><p>  On the official website of the network posted a catalog of goods.  The trading network offers 1300 items.  The site is updated weekly with information about promotions for buyers. </p><p>  It is easy to choose the nearest outlet: there are more than seventy stores in Krasnoye and Beloe in Moscow.  In the cities of the Moscow Region there are two hundred twenty-five points of sale for the company. </p><p>  It offers customers an online store.  Here, ready-made gift baskets are formed from wine and products, and you can pick up products and wine yourself. </p><p>  The company has developed a service for customers that no supermarket or liquor store will offer - compiling and maintaining a private collection.  Sommelier will pick up wines for an official banquet and a family holiday. </p><p>  Indicate in the order when the celebration is planned and what is the delivery address.  The order will be ready by the desired date and will arrive on time. </p><p>  The popularity of the network is constantly growing, this is confirmed by the opening of franchises of new stores "Red and White". </p>
