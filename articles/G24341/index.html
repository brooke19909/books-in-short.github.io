  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bead applications: types of work, description, instructions for implementation, interesting ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In modern life, every person wants to be individual.  Someone expresses this with their make-up or hairdo, and someone stands out with clothes.  Clothing can be of bright color, interesting cut or decorated with applique.  And it, in turn, can be made of fabric, stone, sequins and, of course, beads.  It is about the application of beads that will be discussed below. </p><h2>  What is a bead? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.banarasbead.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beadwork" class="if uuid-3172820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3172820.jpg"></div><p>  Beads are small decorative elements (beads) with a hole in the center through which a thread or wire is threaded.  They differ in type and place of production.  Czech beads are considered the best.  It is most often used for making appliqu√©s for children. </p><p>  Kinds: </p><ul><li>  Transparent. </li><li>  Opal. </li><li>  Opaque. </li><li>  Brocade. </li><li>  Chameleon. </li><li>  Multi-colored. </li><li>  Striped. </li></ul><h2>  What is applique? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded applications" class="if uuid-3172831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3172831.jpg"></div><p>  The concept itself means cutting and connecting certain elements to the base.  It can be paper, leather, fabric, beads, felt, stones or beads.  The basis can be paper, cardboard or fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The application is distinguished from other types of creativity by the variety of execution methods, the ability to bring any fantasy to life. It happens: </p><ul><li>  Flat / surround. </li><li>  Single or multicolor. </li><li>  Thematic (decorative meaning or performed in a certain storyline). </li></ul><p>  The most popular in our time is the application on clothes made from beads.  It can be purchased ready-made in the store, and sew on your favorite thing or do it yourself.  This will make it unique and inimitable, and a child can easily distinguish his clothes from someone else's. </p><p>  In the process of creating a picture of beads, a person is completely immersed in the creative process and rests mentally and physically.  DIY bead application is a kind of relaxation method. </p><h2>  T-shirt embroidery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beadwork" class="if uuid-3172837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3172837.jpg"></div><p>  This thing is in the wardrobe of every person of any age, and to make it unique is very easy.  To achieve an excellent result, you must consider the color scheme.  If a t-shirt is plain, you need to choose a winning color (black and gold, orange and cherry, yellow and purple) and think about the future ornament.  It can be something elementary (heart, circle, flower outline) or drawing.  The choice depends on the level of preparation of the person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The drawing you like must be drawn (translated) onto the fabric and stitched with beads.  This can be done on the shirt itself, or on a separate piece of fabric, which is then sewn to the clothes. </p><p>  Beadwork - the application can be placed on any part - the collar, sleeves, chest.  The finish will make the T-shirt unique, because the second one will definitely not be like that.  Bead application for children is also possible. </p><h2>  Collar embroidery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="alexnld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery on the collar" class="if uuid-3172845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3172845.jpg"></div><p>  In such a difficult way you can give things a new look, from everyday to make a festive.  The collar on any product (sweater, turtleneck, dress) can be decorated with bead appliqu√© or embroidered with separate beads. </p><p>  You can decorate jerseys or things from dense fabrics with beads; it will look advantageous everywhere.  When drawing, you need to monitor the strength of the thread tension so that there is no sagging or crumpling.  To avoid this, it is necessary after each completed element from the wrong side to fix the beads with a knot. </p><h2>  How to make an application from beads </h2><div class="photo" data-original="laceco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded applique on clothes" class="if uuid-3172855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3172855.jpg"></div><p>  To complete the application you will need paper, pencil, beads, needle, thread, scissors and non-woven.  First you need to select the desired picture, draw (translate) it on paper.  After that, select the required beads (color).  When buying, you need to pay attention to the manufacturer and cost, cheaper may be of different sizes.  When performing the application, the beads will have to be sorted, and this will significantly slow down the work. </p><p>  From a non-woven fabric we cut out a piece of the required size and use an iron to glue it to the wrong side of the product.  This will make the application more durable and wear-resistant. </p><p>  When the preparatory phase is over, it is worth starting the application itself.  We transfer the drawing to a fabric or product and proceed to embroidery. </p><p>  Thread the thread into a special needle with a blunt end, on one side we knot.  During operation, it is very important to do all the nodules from the inside out.  We string the necessary beads onto the needle, and sew it to the fabric.  Thus, we make several repetitions and fix the picture from the inside. </p><h2>  How to sew beads </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beadwork applique" class="if uuid-3172865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/3172865.jpg"></div><p>  There are several options for seams for the application of beads.  In some works, it is necessary to sew one bead, for this there are several ways.  The first is to make a simple stitch, the second is to put sequins under the bead (it will give volume), the third is to use smaller beads.  Single embroidery elements must be secured with a knot. </p><p>  A number of beads can be sewn with different types of seams, the choice depends on the amount of beads used and the complexity of the chosen ornament. </p><p>  Seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù - the needle goes to the front part, a bead is strung, the needle goes to the wrong side.  Punctures need to be done close to each other.  Repeat as many times as needed. </p><p>  The seam is ‚Äúlowercase‚Äù - it is performed as the previous one, but in the end it is necessary to repeat it in the opposite direction along the already attached beads (through their center). </p><p>  The stitch is ‚Äústalked‚Äù - the needle goes to the front part, two beads are strung, the needle goes to the wrong side near the second.  Then she goes between them and throws through the second, the first is strung, and the needle goes inside out.  Thus, each application element will be stitched twice.  The finished product will be very dense. </p><p>  The seam is ‚Äúarched‚Äù - according to the style of execution, it completely repeats the ‚Äústitched seam‚Äù, it differs only in the number of beads used at a time.  On the thread you need to string from 4 to 6 beads and can be fixed on different sections of embroidery.  This method will make the finished application more airy. </p><p>  The ‚Äúfasten‚Äù seam is one of the easiest ways to embroider, suitable for making curls, snails and for quickly filling the canvas.  You need to take a thread of the required length, string beads on it, and fasten the edge.  Place this thread on the product, take another needle with thread and sew the bead line.  You need to make small stitches between the beads at equal intervals. </p><p>  The seam is ‚Äúmonastic‚Äù - similar to semicircular embroidery.  The needle goes to the front side, a bead is strung and diagonally goes to the wrong side, then the needle goes down (vertically) and faces the face.  Repeat as many times as necessary. </p><p>  To perform a volumetric pattern, beads can be sewn in several rows. </p><p>  The needle for work should be with a narrow eye and a blunt end.  This will make it easy to string beads of any size and not prick your fingers. </p><p>  Threads should be chosen in the tone of the thing on which the application will be located.  For stretching products, you can use a gum thread, this will allow the bead pattern to stretch along with the canvas. </p><h2>  How to care for a beaded applique </h2><p>  For a decorated product to last longer, you must adhere to such recommendations: </p><ol><li>  It‚Äôs better to wash it manually. </li><li>  When washing, use warm water. </li><li>  Do not use aggressive agents. </li><li>  Thing is not worth pushing. </li><li>  Do not overdry the product. </li><li>  Ironing is necessary from the inside. </li></ol>
