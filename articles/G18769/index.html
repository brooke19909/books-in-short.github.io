Moreover, it is considered the best in comparison with the rest, because in Hungary there are more than enough similar places. </p><p>  The resort received its high status deservedly and among the people acquired the nickname "Mecca for bathers and a paradise for patients with rheumatism."  The locals call him ‚Äúhot gold‚Äù not only because of the healing effect, but also because there is no end to the tourists all year round.  In addition, the town itself is endowed with a special old European atmosphere, which can be felt in restaurants, pubs and coffee houses. </p><h2>  About the resort </h2><p>  Hajduszoboszlo (Hungary) is located in the west of the country twenty kilometers from the city of Debrecen, the second largest after Budapest.  The fame of this resort has long crossed the borders of the state and spread throughout the world.  The Hajduszoboszlo Thermal Resort in Hungary is located in the town of Nadalfeld or in the Great Hungarian Plain.  In fact, these are real endless steppes creeping in a picturesque canvas.  Due to this arrangement, the city always has a warm climate in the summer months, but in the winter there is a ‚Äúsevere‚Äù cold.  Of course, the cold days of the year cannot be compared with Siberian ones, because the average temperature in winter drops to plus three degrees Celsius.  In the summer, the thermometer rises to +25 degrees. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.4435369" data-lng="21.396551600000066" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/5/9/5/10595.png"></div><p>  Since the climate is dry, rains are rare here, but the summer heat is well tolerated due to the proximity of a large natural reservoir and thermal pools.  The latter are in great demand among patients with rheumatism, arthrosis, psoriasis, eczema, neuralgia, chondrosis and even infertility.  Many athletes who have suffered professional injuries come here to ‚Äúlick‚Äù their wounds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The waters of the Hajduszoboszlo resort in Hungary are endowed with an excellent and unique composition.  According to scientists, not one thermal spring in the world repeats the water formula of another.  The air in this place is filled with iodine and salt vapor, and the conditions created by the state for recreation in recent years attract more and more tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hajduszoboszlo.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquapalas Games" class="if uuid-2919272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2919272.jpg"></div><p>  A great advantage of relaxing in the thermal resort of Hajduszoboszlo in Hungary is its location relative to the city itself and all the necessary civilized infrastructure.  The city hydrotherapy complex has spread its borders right in the central part of Hajduszoboszlo.  Its area is 25 hectares and it accommodates three indoor pools filled with medicinal water with different temperature conditions.  There are a lot of children's, sports and other pools, coupled with rooms where a variety of medical procedures are carried out. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Hungarian resort of Hajduszoboszlo was founded before the XVII century, but it, like the other cities of the country at that time, was destroyed by the Turks.  The city was restored by Prince Transylvanian by the name of Bachkai.  He gave all the territories of the modern resort to the haiduk, who mercilessly fought against the establishment of the Turkish yoke and saved the country from the establishment of Habsburg rule in Hungary.  The name of the city, by the way, also retained a particle of haiduk - ‚Äúhaidu‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As soon as the residents returned to the walls of the newly rebuilt city, the measured life of the Hajduszoboszlo resort in Hungary began to boil with renewed vigor.  However, in 1925 the most important event for the entire period of the city‚Äôs existence happened.  During the study of the outskirts on the presence of natural gas reserves underground, geologists did not stumble on gas deposits.  After making a shallow digging, streams of water with a strange odor poured onto the surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dodotravel.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Healing water pool" class="if uuid-2919279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2919279.jpg"></div><p>  As it turned out, this water was endowed with unique properties and composition.  Among the resorts of Hungary with thermal springs, Hajduszoboszlo took a special place, especially after a lot of advertising around the world.  Since then, this year has been considered the birth date of the resort area.  Although all the beneficial properties of water were not immediately apparent.  Gradually, women washing clothes in this water and taking baths in it began to notice that their back problems had disappeared.  Then the scientists conducted a series of studies, the results of which confirmed the healing properties of the sources. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Since this is a world-class resort, there are no problems with the place of residence for tourists.  According to reviews, the Hajduszoboszlo resort in Hungary has twelve hotels, most of which are located next to the bathing complex.

There are 15 different slides for adults, a separate area for children and a water castle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he34JeZO-Bg"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark in Hajduszoboszlo" class="if uuid-2919273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65421/2919273.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, like in any other resort, they hold their holiday parties here.
