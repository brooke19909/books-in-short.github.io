    <h2>  Disassembling the phone </h2><p>  Sometimes a question arises from a Philips W536 user how to disassemble a phone.  In order to do this, you need to have special screwdrivers for working with mobile devices and a small shovel that a bank card can replace.  We remove the back cover and get the battery, memory card and SIM card.  On the phone case you will see five bolts that must be carefully unscrewed.  Why neat?  Because a mobile phone is a very delicate device, and it is necessary to handle it with repair very carefully.  After you unscrew the bolts, you need to slip a card or a shovel into the slot formed at the bottom of the phone.  Moving the card gently around the entire perimeter of the phone, you need to raise the central part of the phone.  As you lift you will hear faint clicks.  Do everything very slowly, because if you are careless, there is a danger of breaking the loop of volume control or some other wiring at the top of the phone.  After you picked up the free part of the phone, the motherboard of the phone will open for you.  It is fastened to five more bolts: three bolts at the bottom and two at the top.  We unscrew all the bolts.  After that, carefully remove the holders with the fingernail from the loops that go to the screen and other sensors, and raise the motherboard.  That's all.  The phone is completely disassembled. </p><h2>  Possible problems </h2><p>  Sometimes a phone user may find that the Philips W536 does not turn on.  What can be done in this case?  The most basic solution is to remove the battery from the phone.  Wait a few seconds.  Replace it.  Connect the phone to the charger and charge the phone until the indicator shows full charge.  Next, you need to disconnect the phone from the network and turn it on. </p>

The speed of the smartphone pleasantly surprises anyone who picks it up.  The quality of photos and video sets it apart from smartphones of this class.  The Philips W536, the reviews we reviewed for you, is a real gift.  Buying such a phone, we acquire not only a means of communication, but become the owners of a multifunctional device for entertainment and work.  In other words, if you need a reliable electronic assistant, you can find it in the form of this smartphone. </p>
