Previously under the Nokia brand, now as an independent line.  The first ‚ÄúLumiya‚Äù from ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù just appeared 5 years ago.  Then the Windows Phone operating system became something outlandish, and many bought devices for it.  Later, disgruntled users began to appear complaining of lags and flaws. </p><p>  The next series of ‚ÄúLumia‚Äù was released in 2012 and by the end of this year announced two more models that work with Windows 8. </p><h2>  New generation </h2><p>  Smartphones running the 10th Windows have recently appeared.  The first were Microsoft Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL.  We went on sale at the end of November last year.  Phones turned out to be very powerful and expensive.  Within a couple of weeks, a more budgetary model for the ‚Äúten‚Äù was released - Microsoft Lumia 550. </p><p>  In March 2016, the average Lumia 650 smartphone appeared. Owner reviews turned out to be quite controversial.  Therefore, we will try to deal with this device and understand how the promise of the developers and the expectations of the fans have come true. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 650 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399212.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Take a look in the box </h2><p>  Phone for sale in a cute compact flat box.  When you take it in your hands, it seems that there is nothing else besides the phone.  In fact, the way it is.  In addition to the device, there are a bunch of brochures in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand a small charge for Microsoft Lumia 650. Reviews about the configuration are often negative.  The fact is that charging does not have a detachable USB cable, and besides, it is a bit weak.  The lack of a headset is also upsetting.  If we recall the early models of Lumiya, the company packed a bunch of cords, ‚Äútulips‚Äù for the TV, high-quality headphones, covers, wipes, etc. into the box. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nice and neat </h2><p>  The Lumia 650 smartphone turned out to be light, thin, cute and neat. Reviews are often left by girls or husbands who bought this device for their wives.  Of course, this model cannot be called absolutely feminine, but something subtle is still present in it. </p><p>  The case turned out to be 6.9 mm thick, which was a pleasant surprise.  Although, apparently, a weak battery suffered from this.  The very shape of the phone turned out to be square, with smoothly rounded corners.  The case is decorated with an aluminum edging.  We were able to carefully select the headphone and charging jacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microsoft lumia 650 reviews" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1399328.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, at first glance it may seem that in the hands of a top flagship, the appearance turned out to be so high-quality.  Probably the worst was to be expected from Microsoft.  At first glance, everything seems to be simple, but you will recognize the brand in detail: an unusual corporate form of the device, high-quality side buttons, well, the case itself without backlashes and gaps. </p><p>  A protective glass cover from <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3 is installed on the front. The brand logo, front camera, <span>light sensor</span> and earpiece are located above the screen, as usual.  The mirror image of the latter is found under the screen - this is an external speaker. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The left side of the smartphone remained free, but on the right, above, there was a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù of volume, below - a lock (on) button.  The bottom end is occupied by the charging connector, and at the top there is a place for headphones. </p><p>  The back of the device looks even more accurate.  A metal Windows logo was placed on the lid, above which is a slightly convex main camera.  The case is not monolithic, so you can remove the cover and battery.  The back panel is made of soft-touch plastic with a velvety effect.  Having removed the battery, we find two slots: for nanosimki and memory cards.  By the way, there is an opportunity to buy a Lumia 650 Dual.  Owner reviews are no different from opinions about a model with one SIM card.  Anyway, these are two identical phones in all respects and in appearance.  The difference is only in the word <em>dual</em> , well, and the number of SIM cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 650 dual reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399214.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Dissatisfied </h2><p>  At first glance, Microsoft managed to create the perfect look of two brothers - Lumia 650 and Lumia 650 Dual Sim.  Reviews often go against the result.  The thing is that the factory assembly, as practice shows, is not always reliable.  Therefore, often buyers go shopping, try phones on display windows.  They choose the one they like, as is the case with the Lumiya 650, but the box contains an unsuccessful assembly, in which the cover is loose, the battery seems to drop out.  Some owners even complained that at the slightest blow on the screen appeared "web". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Perhaps, it‚Äôs impossible to fight with the factory assembly.  Someone gets a completely strong, one-piece device, someone gets a slovenly and weak phone.  In the reviews most often smartphones are of the best build, so you should be careful when buying. </p><h2>  Easy to use </h2><p>  Regarding ergonomics about the Microsoft Lumia 650 Dual, the reviews are always positive.  In addition to being lightweight, the smartphone fits comfortably in your jeans pocket due to its thickness of 6.9 millimeters, as well as a medium-sized screen. </p><p>  It‚Äôs convenient to operate the device with even one hand.  By the way, this is facilitated not only by the compact size, but also by the author‚Äôs one-handed mode from Microsoft.  To turn it on, you need to hold the Start button for a long time. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, the back panel is matte, but the phone can still slip out, because with its small size it only comes into contact with places with smooth edges.  It is better for him to immediately get a bumper or case. </p><h2>  Nice picture </h2><p>  Regarding the display of the Lumia 650, the reviews are different.  Someone is completely satisfied with the screen, someone, comparing with the flagships, would like to see a better image.  In fact, the smartphone has a 5-inch display, an OLED screen and a good resolution for a budget device - HD. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 650 dual sim reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399216.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Basically, tests and user reviews talk about picture quality.  The display has rich colors, vivid images and high contrast.  Pleased with the absolute absence of distortion at any angle.  The brightness is high, so reading on the beach will be comfortable.  By the way, in the reviews there was also a lack of a screen - the appearance of the so-called strobe effect.  If you set the minimum brightness of the display, then you can detect unpleasant flicker on it. </p><p>  As in any smartphone, the user can access the screen color correction.  You can change the saturation and color temperature. </p><p>  An interesting feature is that double tap locking is available, but unlocking is not.  It is difficult to understand whether this is a flaw or a necessary measure.  But it is worth recalling that all previous models had this feature. </p><h2>  Tiled Paradise </h2><p>  There are always positive reviews about the interface of Microsoft Lumia 650 Dual Sim.  The thing is that most owners bought this smartphone because of Windows 10 Mobile.  By the way, if the user needs to switch from Android to the new OS, you just need to log into your Google account.  All the necessary information will "migrate" to a "fresh" smartphone. </p><p>  Well, the advantage of the phone‚Äôs interface is, of course, in tiles.  According to reviews, they can be any number on the home screen.  You can make them ‚Äúalive‚Äù, change the size, color, transparency.  Delete them and add.  Tiles can be widgets or shortcuts.  Those transitioning from iOS or Android usually quickly get used to the new design.  Yes, and it‚Äôs hard to argue that clicking on large tiles is easier than clicking on small icons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microsoft lumia 650 dual reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1399307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A standard smartphone curtain is also present here.  It does not lag behind the style of the entire interface and is made in a tiled style.  In the menu alphabetically, you can find all the necessary programs. </p><h2>  Softs </h2><p>  But you cannot name a ‚Äúclean‚Äù operating system.  Microsoft, as usual, added a bunch of various software to the phone.  It is doubtful that the owners will use at least half of them.  Although the basic programs will not be redundant.  In principle, in addition to standard Microsoft software, everything else is easy to remove. </p><h2>  Problem shopping </h2><p>  But the most furious about Microsoft Lumia 650 Black reviews are addressed to the company store.  He, as always, is ambiguous.  It seems to just find popular programs like VKontakte, Viber, Facebook, Twitter, TwitchTV and so on.  But for some reason, problems arose with Periscope, which is not there at all, and Instagram‚Äôs ‚Äúofficial‚Äù was also not found.  An unpleasant surprise was the absence of YouTube, or rather its inferior presence.  When downloading on the desktop, there is only a video hosting shortcut that directs the user to the mobile version of the site in a regular browser. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microsoft lumia 650 dual sim reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399217.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What toys will not be? </h2><p>  The average in performance was a Microsoft Lumia 650 smartphone. Customer reviews on this topic are expected.  Those who carefully studied this apparatus were not surprised and took it for work. </p><p>  The smartphone has a mediocre Snapdragon 212 processor. This model is weak, and therefore you can‚Äôt rely on the support of cool toys.  In addition, the graphics are not responsible for the most powerful Adreno 304. Also, do not forget that the device has only 1 GB of RAM.  Built-in memory - 16 GB. </p><p>  Regarding games, in principle, a stable FPS can be achieved, but subject to low quality settings.  The same Asphalt 8 runs smoothly at low detail.  You can run World of Tanks Blitz, but you can hardly enjoy such graphics.  But, for example, <span>GT Racing 2:</span> The Real Car Experience will do great on a smartphone with good graphics and low resource costs. </p><h2>  Multitasking </h2><p>  Despite the fact that at first glance the processor and graphics adapter do not seem powerful, the phone copes with any tasks perfectly.  The video in VK and YouTube shows smoothly, you can easily use instant messengers, mail and calls.  Problems can occur only with a heavy load of the device.  Therefore, you should periodically clear the history of visits to applications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone microsoft lumia 650 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399218.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Quality tradition </h2><p>  But what is not satisfactory is the Lumia 650 camera. There are positive reviews.  The line of these smartphones has always been famous for high-quality lenses, so even budget models got a good camera.  In the "Lumia 650" it is 8 megapixels, aperture 2.2.  There is also a smart autofocus and a powerful LED flash. </p><p>  As with most phones, this one has an automatic shooting mode and the ability to manually configure.  In this case, you can set the desired white balance, choose ISO, shutter speed, focus, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microsoft lumia 650 black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399215.jpg"></div>
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Automatic mode shows itself at five with a plus.  Autofocus is fast, <span>white balance</span> is rarely mistaken, accurate indicators and metering.  It is possible to carry out serial shooting.  But then how lucky, if you overload the smartphone, it can "brake" for a few seconds, and then forcefully complete the process in the application. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Battery is not the strongest side of the phone.  Its capacity is 2000 mAh, which is not enough for a 5-inch screen.  In fact, on average, it lasts about 12 hours.  Although, again, it all depends on the assembly.  Some phones were able to last with continuous video playback and maximum brightness as much as 8 hours.  But continuous games lasted only 3 hours. </p><p>  In general, with active use (the Internet, instant messengers, office programs, music and photography), the device normally lives a working day. </p><h2>  Reliable assistant </h2><p>  In addition, the smartphone supports 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC.  Its navigation is quite accurate in the presence of GLONASS.  There are also built-in cards with the ability to work offline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 650" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1399219.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the phone turned out to be ‚Äúadult‚Äù and reliable.  Reviews characterize it as multitasking, stable and of high quality.  The price of a single-label device is an average of 12 thousand rubles, a two-symbol one is more expensive by 1000 rubles. </p><p>  With all its severity in black, the phone looks completely different in white.  Therefore, it can be safely called universal.  Of course, the operating system remains a huge plus.  <span>Windows 10 Mobile</span> is a stable, high-quality and beautiful OS. </p>
