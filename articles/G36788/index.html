But most of them provide 60 days for interest-free use of the loan.  However, there are products on the market with more interesting terms of service.  One of them is a ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù credit card.  Alfa-Bank offers interesting conditions for customers. </p><h2>  Grace period </h2><p>  Credit cards provide a period of time during which the client can use borrowed funds without paying interest if certain conditions are met.  The main one is to close the debt before the end of the grace period.  Otherwise, the bank will deduct interest. </p><p>  It is also important to pay attention to which operations the grace period applies to.  Usually we are talking only about cashless payment for goods.  In case of withdrawal of cash from the card, the grace period is reset. </p>

    <h2>  Terms of use </h2><p>  The calculation algorithm is also of great importance.  A grace period of up to 120 days does not mean at all that the client can use the entire amount today, but return the debt in three months.  The exact period depends on the date on which interest calculation begins.  The grace period does not cancel the borrower's obligation to make a monthly payment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail how the Alfa-Bank card ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù differs from other similar products on the market. </p><p>  The grace period applies to all types of operations, including cash withdrawals from ATMs.  A three-month deferment in interest payment is given only on traditional credit institution cards.  This condition does not apply to co-branding and cards that support contactless payment technology.  For such payment instruments, the grace period will be 60 days. </p><p>  The card provides for a <span>mandatory payment</span> of 5% of the debt, but not less than 320 rubles.  You need to transfer money to the account every month during the payment period.  It starts from the date of conclusion of the contract and lasts 20 days. </p>

    <h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank card with a grace period of 100 days is issued to customers over 21 years old.  A potential borrower must have a monthly income of 9 thousand rubles.  and work at the last place of work for at least 3 months.  He must also have a local registration. </p><p>  The interest rate is calculated separately for each client and depends on the documents of the borrower and credit history.  The presence of a certificate of employment, a passport for a car, a passport with a note on a recent trip abroad, the VHI policy significantly reduces the percentage.  An application for a credit card is issued if there are at least two documents, one of which must be a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Scheme of work </h2><p>  To better understand how Alfa-Bank‚Äôs ‚Äú100 days without interest‚Äù credit card works, let‚Äôs take a closer look at the following scheme. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Suppose a contract with a client was concluded on November 22.  Monthly, the 22nd date will be the reporting date.  After 6 days, i.e. November 28, the customer paid for purchases in the store with this card.  The grace period starts at 29 and will last 100 days, that is, until March 9. </p><p>  In a month - December 22 - the client will receive an SMS notification in which the amount spent will be indicated.  The next 20 days are allocated in order to make a mandatory payment (until January 11).  Suppose the funds were credited to the account on December 28, but they only covered part of the amount owed to Alfa-Bank CJSC.  Visa card with a grace period of 100 days continues to operate on preferential terms.  If the client manages to pay off all debts before March 9, then one grace period will end and another will begin.  If the entire amount of the debt is not paid on time, then interest will begin to accrue. </p>
