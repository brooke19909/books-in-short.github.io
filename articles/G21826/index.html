Compared to neighboring Calangute, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe same name is more respectable and calm, with many good restaurants, hotels, shops - more expensive than other Goa resorts.  The waves are higher and the slopes to the water are steeper, but this did not affect the reputation of the most beautiful beach in the region.  Just pay attention to this if you want to come here with your children. </p><h2>  The best time to relax </h2><p>  Tourists recommend coming here from November to March.  During these months, the weather is most comfortable and pleases with light coolness, and the tropical climate is less prone to surprises.  The temperature of air and water is almost the same - about 30 ¬∞ C.  In addition, try to plan your trip for December, as this month hosts many interesting festivals.  But be prepared for high prices.  Hotels in North Goa (Candolim) always increase the cost of living during peak season, so book in advance to receive discounts. </p><p>  Those who prefer relaxation at affordable prices are advised to come here in February or March.  The beaches will be freed from tourists, it will stop raining, the weather will be calm, and the cost of rooms will delight in democracy. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to Candolim beach, which is always clean and well maintained.  Shack staff periodically drives away stray merchants.  If you order a couple of items from the menu, then umbrellas and deck chairs will be provided for free.  In other places, you will have to pay extra 50 rupees - about 45 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Well-off and demanding tourists are not in vain for their vacation, they mainly choose the northern part of Goa - Candolim.

Goa is a great place for entertainment and water sports.  To make sure of this, it is enough to get to Sinquerim.

Candolim fans will tell you about the spirit of freedom and incredible energy that reigns here, about the opportunity to hang out, and then find time for meditation and finding yourself.  But opponents of the northern part (of which there are also many) will unanimously talk about complete unsanitary conditions, licentious dispositions and poverty.  By the way, both speak the truth.  One thing is certain: Goa is a truly unique place, and in order to form your own opinion about it, you need to come here at least once. </p>
