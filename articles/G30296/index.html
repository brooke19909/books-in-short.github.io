It was founded in the mid-18th century, and since then has experienced many events.  The city became a settlement in 1787.  Throughout history, Chelyabinsk has withstood many attacks and difficulties.  For example, he survived the siege of the Pugachevites, but in the end he was still captured. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chelyabinsk time zone" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/206698.jpg" width="474"></div>  Previously, the city was called a fortress, each wall of which consisted of 60 fathoms.  Often tourists are interested in the time zone of Chelyabinsk.  This is due to the fact that during the flight, people get confused, and therefore in this way they want to provide themselves with the necessary information and the right time.

    <p>  History of the city </p><p>  Returning to history, it must be said that Chelyabinsk was a small town until the 19th century, and after the Samaro-Zlotoustovskie railways and the <span>Trans-Siberian Railway</span> were built <span>, the</span> city ​​began to develop at a faster pace.  For a while, Chelyabinsk took first place in the country in bread trade.  After 1897, the population began to grow rapidly, the territory increased, and the level of development increased.  Nowadays, people tend to look at the great city.  Often you can find useful information through travel guides.  For example, search for “time zone, Chelyabinsk,” and find the necessary data on this issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="time zone chelyabinsk moscow" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/206700.jpg" width="256"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Relatively recent facts </p><p>  In the early 90s, the city was experiencing great difficulties, but by 2000, the full reconstruction of Chelyabinsk had begun.  Roads were built, new transport interchanges, the wages of the population increased.  The standard of living has accordingly improved.  Today in the city there is something to see.  But arriving there, you need to know the time zone of Chelyabinsk (of course, for the convenience of your stay).  Interesting places to visit are Cathedral Square (or Yaroslavsky Square), South and Kazarmennaya Square;  Church of the <span>Holy Trinity, St. Simeon</span> Cathedral, temples of the icon of the Mother of God and St. Basil the Great. </p><p>  Region weather conditions </p><p>  The climate in the city is temperate, belongs to the continental.  The city is divided into seven districts and has an official emblem.  Now they can be found in triplicate.  The first of them existed in Soviet times, the second in the 90s, and the third is effective today.  The time zone of Chelyabinsk refers to Yekaterinburg time and is called MSK + 2. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="time zone g Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/206699.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Local contingent </p><p>  The population living in the city consists of Armenians, Tatars, Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Belarusians, Kazakhs and representatives of other nationalities.  There are also people who refuse to indicate their nationality.  In terms of population, Chelyabinsk ranks ninth in Russia.  Before visiting the city, it is recommended to learn the traditions of the people, customs, habits, culture, as well as the time zone of Chelyabinsk.  This will greatly simplify the stay of any tourist, as some countries do not have this or that behavior in society. </p><p>  Conclusion </p><p>  According to the latest data, they want to withdraw the city from the Urals Federal District, which will shift the time zone.  <span>Chelyabinsk, Moscow</span> will now be closer to each other by one hour (the authors of the initiative believe that this will positively affect relations between cities). </p>
