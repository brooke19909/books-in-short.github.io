    <p>  No matter how <span>regrettable it</span> may sound, today many people are completely wrong or at best vaguely imagine what a <span>black hole is.</span>  And there are quite a few such objects in the Universe.  And they are so powerful and global that our planet and even our whole life are nothing compared to them. </p><p>  Scientific theories predict the mass of hypothetical objects that exist in the universe.  And not one of them makes such a terrible impression as a black hole.  Assumptions about their education, nature and existence were generally made a very long time ago.  Before <span>Einstein's theory of relativity</span> was published <span>.</span> </p><p>  But quite recently, quite convincing evidence has been received that black holes still exist in the Universe.  Indeed, according to the theory of relativity, such formations are quite possible, but for many years even the very prediction of the possibility of the formation of such objects has been refuted. </p><p>  According to studies, black holes are characterized by such enormous gravity that they absorb absolutely everything that falls within their limits.  But there is a more specific definition of what a black hole is.  At its core, it is an object that does not release light and bends space and time. </p><p>  Very interesting is the fact that even in the vicinity of these formations time flows more slowly.  A close study of these objects is, unfortunately, impossible.  There are only a lot of assumptions and a number of practical developments.  Therefore, all objects that fit this description are called black holes, while leaving a huge number of issues unresolved. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that any black hole has its own event horizon - that border, after crossing which it will not be possible to get out.  Moreover, the object as it approaches the hole begins to move much slower. </p><p>  Of particular interest is the discussion of how black holes form.  Today it is assumed that there are three main ways of their formation: </p><ol><li>  As a result of the formation of the universe.  This kind of black hole appeared immediately after the Big Bang. </li><li>  A dying star.  After the star loses its own energy, <span>thermonuclear reactions</span> cease <span>,</span> as a result of which it begins to gradually shrink.  The type of object depends on the degree of such compression: <span>white dwarfs,</span> neutron stars, and black holes themselves. </li><li>  By experiment.  For example, in a collider it is possible to create some kind of quantum black hole. </li></ol><p>  There are also many versions of <span>what a</span> black hole is and what it is.  So, many scientists are of the opinion that such objects throw away all the matter absorbed by them elsewhere.  Following this statement, there must be ‚Äúwhite‚Äù holes acting on the opposite principle. </p><p>  Simply put, if everything gets into a black hole, but nothing gets out, then it‚Äôs impossible to get into a white hole.  The main argument of scientists is the powerful and sharp bursts of energy recorded in space. </p><p>  <span>String theory</span> remains very popular <span>, the</span> supporters of which have created their own model of a black hole in which information is not destroyed.  This makes it possible to answer a number of questions related to the singularity - a point in space characterized by infinite density and pressure. </p><p>  But many are skeptical that the fact of a singularity will make it possible to accurately study what a black hole is, since physicists with infinite numbers cannot work.  Therefore, although they recognize the presence of such a point directly in this object, its properties are described very superficially. </p><p>  Nevertheless, one should pay tribute to such an intriguing formation in the Universe.  Indeed, until today, a black hole is one of the most mysterious and interesting objects.  Scientists only established precisely that their occurrence occurs as a result of extremely strong compression of a particular mass, after which gravity increases so powerfully that neither light, nor any other radiation, nor body, nor signals are released.  Therefore, there is still much to learn. </p>
