Seven Wonders of the World Ancient World</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the ancient world is interesting and beautiful.  It attracts many of our contemporaries.  Even after many years, people are interested in the lifestyle of their ancestors.  And, of course, the most famous monuments of the ancient world, the Seven Wonders of the World, arouse curiosity. </p><h2>  The wealth of antiquity </h2><p>  It is impossible to tell about the ancient world with a few words.  This is a huge layer of time that begins in those distant times, when a person just appeared, and goes right up to the Middle Ages.  During this time, people managed to create a lot.  It was then that inventions appeared, which are still considered the most ingenious. </p><p>  Much of what was created before our era and in the first centuries after the birth of Christ, is useful to this day.  Any lawyer can talk about the enormous importance of Roman law, and philologists will talk about the role played by the ancient languages, which are now considered dead. </p><p>  It was then that world religions began.  Then they worshiped Zeus and Artemis, then Jesus was born.  The wonders of the ancient world are countless.  But among them there are seven main ones. </p>

    <h2>  Seven Wonders of the World </h2><p>  The history of the ancient world will be incomplete if you do not talk about the Seven Wonders of the World.  Their list has changed over the centuries.  But the number remained unchanged.  There were always seven of them.  The world of <span>ancient people</span> was built around religious beliefs.  Therefore, this number was not chosen by chance.  Seven is the number of the <span>god Apollo.</span>  He was considered the most beautiful of all the gods.  He was a patron of the arts.  And his number was a symbol of completeness and perfection. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The very first list of the Seven Wonders of the World was created in the III century before the birth of Jesus.  It included the most significant architectural monuments that were only created at that time by people.  Many miracles of that time did not reach ours. </p><h2>  Giza Pyramids </h2><p>  The Great Pyramids - this is an important part, without which the history of the ancient world can not do.  The most famous of them was the <span>Pyramid of Cheops.</span>  She is recognized as the largest.  Therefore, it is difficult to imagine those hellish torments that the slaves experienced during the construction of this miracle of the world.  During the construction of the pyramid, a solution was used, which is still stronger and stronger. </p><p>  No one can say for sure why these grandiose structures were erected.  Previously, it was believed that these were the tombs of the rulers of Egypt - the pharaohs, as well as their spouse.  But the researchers could not find the remains of the bodies of these important Egyptians.  Until now, this miracle of the world gives rise to many questions and puzzles.  And the silent Sphinx continues to guard them. </p><h2>  <span>Hanging Gardens of</span> Babylon </h2>

    <p>  Hanging Gardens of Babylon - this is the wonder of the world of the ancient world, which did not survive to our times.  Gardens were once the grandest construction of Babylon.  Now, not far from Baghdad, you can find what is left of them.  But some scholars would argue that those ruins are not a reminder of the second most important wonder of the world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Hanging Gardens of Babylon is one of the most romantic gifts not only in the history of the ancient world, but in general in human history.  The Babylonian ruler noticed that his beloved wife Amitis was bored with her native land.  In dusty Babylon there were not those beautiful gardens that they used to enjoy as a child.  And then, so that his wife would not yearn, <span>Nebuchadnezzar II</span> ordered the erection of this building. </p><p>  Some believe that this is only a beautiful legend.  In the writings of Herodotus there was not a word about the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.  But they are described in detail in Beros.  The history of the ancient world holds many mysteries.  And this is one of them. </p><h2>  Zeus statue in Olympia </h2><p>  The names of the gods of the ancient world remained famous after many centuries.  Even now, people can talk about the powerful god Zeus.  And before our era, a new wonder of the world was created, dedicated to this patron of the ancient Greeks. </p><p>  The appearance of the statue and the temple in which it was located is closely related to the Olympic Games.  When they gained fame and began to attract a variety of people, it was decided to build a temple dedicated to the father of all gods. </p>

    <p>  The statue of Zeus from Olympia did not survive to our times.  Her adversity began when the throne was taken by a Christian who was hostile to paganism.  For a long time it was believed that the statue did not survive the looting of the temple.  Centuries later, the remains of the temple and statues were found.  Thanks to these findings, scientists were able to see for themselves and show others this wonder of the world of the ancient world. </p><h2>  Temple of Artemis at Ephesus </h2><p>  Artemis is one of the most famous goddesses of antiquity.  She helped women in labor to endure pain, was the patroness of hunters.  And the inhabitants of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ephesus</span> considered her their protector.  In honor of their goddess, the townspeople decided to erect a temple, which will not be equal.  They wanted not only to glorify their city, but also to earn the favor of Artemis. </p><p>  The temple was built for a very long time.  The first architect, Harsifron, did not have time to see his brainchild.  His work was continued by his son, and after him by other architects.  In the center of the temple was a statue of Artemis.  But only that which took so long to be built was destroyed in a short period of time.  Herostratus, who madly wanted to become famous, but did not know how to do this, set fire to the temple.  If now this miracle of architecture was intact, then it would surpass everything that was only built by mankind. </p><h2>  Halicarnassus Mausoleum </h2>

    <p>  Halicarnassus Mausoleum is one of the most luxurious tombs that has only been invented by man.  The mausoleum was named after the formidable and cruel ruler of the Mausoleum, who was able to ensure that his lands became rich and powerful. </p><p>  The mausoleum was erected for a long time.  It began to be built during the life of Mavsol, but when the ruler died, his tomb was not yet ready.  After the death of the Mausoleum, the mausoleum was supplemented with statues of gods who guarded the body of the king and did not allow him to be disturbed.  In addition to the gods, in the tomb one could see statues of Mausolus himself and his beautiful wife Artemissia. </p><p>  The mausoleum has added to the list of miracles that have not survived to this day.  He survived many wars.  But over time, it was dismantled in order to build Christian temples. </p><h2>  The Colossus of Rhodes </h2><p>  Rhodes is one of the richest cities that went down in history as the birthplace of the sixth wonder of the world.  The colossus was the largest building.  He was a tall, strong youth holding a torch over his head.  It is in his image and likeness that a <span>Statue of Liberty</span> will be created after centuries <span>.</span> </p>

    <p>  The Colossus of Rhodes is also on the list of wonders of the world that our generation will not see.  The young man's legs could not bear his weight.  But because of the earthquake, the statue fell into the water.  She lay on the coast for about ten centuries.  And only then it was decided to melt the Colossus. </p><h2>  Alexandrian lighthouse </h2>

    <p>  Seven wonders of the world of the ancient world amazed their contemporaries.  And people of our time are surprised when they learn about those magnificent offspring of the human mind.  The Alexandria Lighthouse occupies a worthy place in the list. </p><p>  It was built in a city named after Alexander the Great.  For centuries, this lighthouse has illuminated the path of many travelers and merchants.  But this grandiose structure could not survive to our century.  He was destroyed by nature itself.  The lighthouse did not survive the strong tremors.  Only at the end of the last century, scientists were able to show how that wonder of the world looked. </p><p>  The seven wonders of the world of the ancient world - this is what will always attract the attention of people.  Until now, these creations of man are surrounded by riddles.  And it is unlikely that someday all the questions will be answered. </p>
