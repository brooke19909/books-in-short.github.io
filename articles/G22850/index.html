You can make any figures from this building material with your own hands, which can turn into animals, people, other heroes.  Such garden accessories perfectly emphasize the individuality of each site, give it its own unique shade and style.  Also important is the fact <span>that such</span> things are made with your own hands, therefore, in them there is always a piece of the soul of the person who made them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Foam Crafts" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/23418.jpg" width="423"></div>

    <p>  In order to understand how to make crafts from polyurethane foam to decorate the site, "Samodelkin in the country" will come to the rescue.  Each figure has its own instruction, as well as a list of those materials that may be needed.  And there is nothing wise there - most often such sculptures are made from improvised means that can be found in every home.  The main thing is to have imagination and <span>abstract thinking,</span> and then any crafts can have a unique and very attractive appearance. </p><p>  In order for the crafts made from polyurethane foam to turn out not only beautiful, but also serve a very long period, it is advisable to use high-quality building material.  Also, do not save on foam - the denser the sculpture, the longer it will be able to maintain its properties, therefore, it will also be able to "live" in the garden, taking into account all atmospheric phenomena, for a very long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samodelkin in the country" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/23419.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, garden sculptures made of polyurethane foam have their own base on which they rest.  The frame of the craft can be made of thick wire, metal or wood.  Partially, the base of the craft made of polyurethane foam should repeat its future forms, however, it is worthwhile to assume that the final size will be significantly increased.  Such an invention of art acquires its perfect <span>appearance</span> only after the foam completely hardens and settles.  Therefore, ‚Äúblowing‚Äù the frame of the sculpture with foam, it must be remembered that as a result, it will slightly change its shape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Garden sculptures" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/23421.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  After the crafts from the foam cure, they need to be painted.  Most often, <span>oil paints</span> are used to give sculptures a colorful appearance <span>,</span> but they can be replaced with acrylic or some other.  The main thing is that the paint can withstand moisture and wind and does not deteriorate from other external irritants.  With high-quality painting, the <span>mounting foam is</span> covered with an additional protective shell, so it retains its qualities for a longer period. </p><p>  Sculptures that are made for the <span>garden with their own hands</span> can have the most unexpected forms.  It can be antique columns, pseudo-statues of gods and mythical heroes, however these things are difficult to make.  Simple and accessible for everyone crafts from polyurethane foam - ladybugs, gnomes, chests and flowers.  Also, the garden can be decorated with artificial mushrooms of various sizes.  An alternation of garden sculptures will also be an original solution: in the summer, flowers and fruits made from polyurethane foam can be located on the plot, mushrooms and yellow leaves in the autumn, snowflakes in the winter, and small birds in the spring. </p>
