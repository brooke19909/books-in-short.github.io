All this is clearly expressed by the <span>Slavic patterns that</span> were used for various purposes and according to them, separate schemes and compositions were created.  It was believed that each pattern has a special and individual magical power that can protect, strengthen, or even make richer anyone who wears a robe with it. </p><p>  <strong>Mysterious Slavic patterns and their meanings</strong> </p><p>  As everyone knows, art and religion are opposite poles, which, however, are not able to exist without each other.  It is funny that the religion of our ancestors had very interesting origins: they include Slavic patterns and other symbolism, which later became churchly.  Even ancient Russian temples and divine fortresses were completely decorated with special ornaments.  So let's talk and reveal mysterious letters, signs, and find out what the Slavic pattern is and where it is used ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic patterns" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/151695.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Architecture and Ancient Belief</strong> </p><p>  For us, ordinary tourists and eternal passers-by, numerous Slavic temples seem simply beautiful and interestingly designed, but in fact they can also be dangerous for people with an unclean soul.  The fact is that thanks to their ancient alphabet at first glance, cute and harmless patterns, the Slavs could cast a kind of spell that could torment and heal the unclean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you look closely, you will notice that all Slavic patterns have their own meaning, for example, above almost all the entrances to the temple, there is a small ‚Äúpicture‚Äù above the left side, which is a guard of peace.  The Slavs believed that it was thanks to this pattern that at the entrance to the temple people were seized with calm and harmony, which gave strength to any lost soul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic pattern" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/151696.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Often, each temple seemed to be surrounded by Slavic patterns that symbolized restraint.  But this is not the only interpretation, since there is an opinion that this belt symbolized Majesty, since often it had a chic and voluminous relief, it can be compared with the royal belt or crown ... </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that you can not give a name to everyone and everyone, since Slavic patterns have millions of varieties.  Each ornament changed from year to year, and each spiritual representative had the right to change all meanings or add new ones.  It is also important that each pattern was trimmed by hand, but only faithful and adult craftsmen took part in the work, who gave their lives to art and faith. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic patterns patterns" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/151697.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Clothing: how it was picked up and decorated ...</strong> </p><p>  The most interesting thing was the production of shirts and sundresses, the decoration of which served as Slavic patterns.  Schemes were selected directly for the person who later wore the thing.  As a rule, such ornaments were created with the aim of making the character of their owner stronger and more resilient.  For example, if a boy was born weak, then he needed a pattern that gives strength, and if the girl was untidy, then, accordingly, the pattern should give her purity and accuracy. ... The most important thing was that the picture was chosen after 5-6 years, this complex matter belonged to my grandmother, and until the age of five, the child wore clothes with a protective Slavic pattern. </p>
