Now the prospect of a company to achieve world fame is practically zero, especially considering the fact that brand promotion is by no means the cheapest pleasure.  Before the world was filled with brands that managed to fill all the niches in the economy, the famous IPhone logo appeared, which is a bitten apple. </p>

    <p>  If you recall the beginning of the career path of <span>Steve Jobs,</span> you can only admire his tenacity on the way to his goal - to conquer the whole world with his creation.  The iPhone logo has left the world of specialists and has become widely known among ordinary users of modern technology.  Its creation can be called a legend of our time. </p><h2>  Bitten apple - iPhone logo </h2><p>  It is no coincidence that this Apple symbol has become one of the most famous in the world.  There are actually many reasons why this happened.  The first reason, of course, is the promotion of the company, the second is the recognition of the logo.  The indirect reason why the iPhone logo could achieve such fame is one old, but inferior to any criticism, theory that the logo should not just be well remembered visually, it must be easy to recreate it graphically, that is, depict on anything by any means without any effort and time.  The following car logos can be summed up under this theory: Volkswagen, Opel, Mersedes and the like.  Therefore, a bitten apple has become a good example, reflecting the effect of such a method. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The logo itself appeared a little earlier than the company.  This happened because the creators initially wanted to beat the world famous legend about the Newtonian apple, supposedly leading the scientist to the brilliant discovery of the law of universal gravitation.  The idea, of course, was original, but the proposed logo was too cumbersome and difficult to understand. </p><h2>  1976 - appearance </h2><p>  The iPhone logo in the form of a <span>bitten apple</span> was designed specifically for the company by the representative of the advertising agency Regis McKenna.  As the legend goes (numerous speculations are born here), Rob Yanov, the art director of this agency, bought apples in a supermarket and began to do something like an experiment: he cut apples and arranged them in orderly rows, in general, he carried out various ‚Äúapple operations‚Äù .  As a result, completely unexpectedly, he settled on a bitten apple.  Who bit him and why? </p>

    <p>  There are two theories about this.  According to the first, the bite makes the apple ‚Äúreal‚Äù and does not give it the outline of other fruits.  The second seems more logical - it is based on the fact that the English words ‚Äúbyte‚Äù and ‚Äúbite‚Äù are similar in sound, which creates a kind of pun intended (‚Äúbyte‚Äù - ‚Äúbite‚Äù). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A certain preacher saw in the bitten apple the seduction of Adam through Eve.  This funny man even wrote a whole treatise in which the diabolical origin of the "unclean" Apple is laid out on the shelves. </p><p>  Rumor has it that Jobs, tired of waiting for Rob to develop a logo, just bit an apple and said that if he does not come up with anything worthwhile in the near future, they will take an apple with a bite as a logo.  However, this version is more like groundless rumor; Rob himself has never mentioned such a story. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Noteworthy is the fact that the first apple was rainbow.  So another theory emerged, according to which a bitten apple carried a deep meaning.  Allegedly this was an allusion to the case of the suicide <span>of Alan Turing,</span> a scientist who has made a powerful breakthrough in the field of computer science and informatics.  According to the stories about him, he was gay, and he ate the apple, having previously crammed it with poison to leave the mortal world, in which he was subjected to incessant humiliation. </p>

    <p>  As a matter of fact, it was Turing who contributed to the quick solution of the Enigma encryption machine, which the Germans used during the Second World War.  But at the end of the war, when everyone around him found out about Alan‚Äôs non-traditional sexual orientation, the technician faced a dilemma - forced chemical castration or almost life-long imprisonment.  Wanting to fully engage in science, the brave scientist decided on the first option, but he could not stand the effect of the operation performed on him - his appearance changed completely, he did not recognize himself in the mirror.  In general, this transformation influenced Alan‚Äôs decision to take his own life.  However, his mother insisted on what happened, saying that in no way her son had suicidal tendencies, his experiments with various poisons were to blame. </p><h2>  To smithereens </h2><p>  In fact, the theory of the "homo-apple" does not hold water.  The thing is that the rainbow became officially recognized as the logo of sexual minorities much later.  Officially, they began to use the rainbow only in 1979, three years after the appearance of the apple logo. </p><p>  Jobs insisted on a rainbow-apple logo, according to Rob's recollections, as he understood it to be a symbol of understanding and tolerance.  It is known that Jobs was a hippie in his youth, and therefore chose a logo to match thinking. </p><p>  There is another version: the ‚Äúcolor kaleidoscope‚Äù of the apple was used to show the fact that Apple is capable of working with color.  It was new in the years being described. </p><p>  The most plausible version seems to be that the company abandoned its rainbow color in 1998, due to the fact that this symbol firmly moved into the ranks of sex minorities.  And the company did not want to get involved in the propaganda of any views, they only wanted to release gadgets useful to any society. </p><h2>  Tricky Steve </h2><p>  Thanks to the use of the color logo, which was rare in those years, the public noticed the desire to break ahead and gave the newly-made company a chance to exist.  By the way, it was thanks to the zeal of Steve Jobs, who got into confidence in the Regis McKenna agency, that the brand developed.  For the logo and its promotion, poor, for all consonant Rob never received a single cent. </p><h2>  The bottom line is in the details. </h2><p>  It was the attention to design details that attracted new customers.  For example, given the latest developments in the technical breakthrough of modern mobile devices, it can be noted that the iPhone 5S logo is made in the form of a luminous apple thanks to the airbrush technique. </p>

    <p>  Undoubtedly, not so much technical characteristics as the aesthetics of fashionable devices attract modern youth who are addicted to everything bright and brilliant.  The iPhone 6 logo was also distinguished for its wisdom - it is made of liquid metal.  This approach, however, speaks of the practicality of these devices, because it will be more difficult to scratch the logo and make it look unsightly. </p><p>  The design is so advanced that now they even produce numerous cases for the iPhone with a logo.  Although, if you quickly glance at the shelves with accessories for phones, you can immediately determine the sales leader.  It was Apple that managed to introduce the apparent superiority of this brand over others so much into the minds of people that competition in the market is practically zero - yes, Chinese cheap phones are becoming popular, but so far no one has surpassed iPhone.  For better or worse, progress is underway, and who knows what logo the urban tabloids will cover tomorrow. </p>
