    <p>  Reviewers report: in general, I liked everything at the hotel.  But still, according to many, the local service leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  Transfer </h2><p>  Mostly, the authors of the reviews report, the hotel is greeted at the railway station on time and delivered to the hotel, as well as taken to the airport.  Cost of service: 350 rubles.  But there are times when a pre-ordered car does not arrive, and hotel guests are brought to the station or airport by taxi. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This service has also been criticized by many.  Some vacationers who came to have lunch (breakfast or dinner) at their appointed time, found out that there was almost no food left: either there was a lack of soup, then a side dish, then sausages, then salad or juice.  Some have seen pancakes and fish only on other people's plates.  Vacationers had the feeling that they had to eat up what was left.  When asked by the administration, advice was received to come early to the dining room to catch the food. </p><p>  There is always a queue in the dining room, swearing is constantly heard due to lack of dishes.  Food, except soup for lunch, is served cold, as guests say.  It would be possible to install a microwave in the dining room if employees did not want to heat food.  Pastries and bread here can offer not the first freshness.  Seats for guests are sorely lacking.  There are few waitresses and they can‚Äôt cope with their duties, so vacationers have to clean up from the tables on their own. </p><p>  Meals, other vacationers object, quite decent is provided.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served on a schedule, people living on different floors have lunch at different times, although, indeed, many vacationers always try to come first for breakfast and lunch, so there are small traffic jams in the dining room and there are not enough tables, but soon the problem is resolved.  The choice and quality of food, as other guests say, is on top at the hotel. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The rooms, the guests share, are ‚Äújust super‚Äù: with a view of the pool, the prices are reasonable, with 100% prepayment they make a 10% discount.  Many liked the rooms: new, with a balcony, TV, air conditioning, shower, toilet. </p><p>  But, unfortunately, there are also disadvantages.  For example, ceramic tiles are laid on the floor in the rooms, which makes it bare and not very comfortable to walk barefoot.  The mattresses in the rooms are very leaky, it feels like you have to sleep on bare springs.  Ironing board, iron and kettle - one per floor, no glasses in the room.  Bed linen can be replaced once every 10 days, and you have to go to the reception for toilet paper. </p><p>  The rooms on the 7th floor do not have balconies.  In addition, the water does not reach the riser in them, so vacationers often have problems with washing themselves.  Problems arise with the flushing of the toilet.  Living in these rooms share their disappointment: after all, they paid the same amount as the rest of the guests, and you have to live in less comfortable conditions. </p><p>  For 7 days, towels can never be changed in the rooms. </p><p>  Hotel guests complain that there are a lot of children on the floor who tend to make noise.  A big inconvenience in the rooms, whose windows face the courtyard, sounds of music and show programs coming from the territory are presented.  Cheerful vacationers may not let you fall asleep until morning.  At the same time, double-glazed windows do not save. </p><p>  Wi-Fi, according to the guests of the "Sea Paradise", the hotel does not. </p><h2>  Pool </h2><p>  Pools, as reported by guests of the boarding house "Sea Paradise", are clean.  In a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe boarding house, two pools are placed, one of which is slightly heated.  Near the pools there are always not enough sun loungers. </p>

    <h2>  Animation </h2><p>  As a huge plus for the hotel, vacationers celebrate animation: for adults every evening there are entertainment programs, for children - in the morning.  Animators, according to the authors of the reviews, are great fellows, entertain guests morning to night, giving the sea the most positive impressions. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  The hotel team, without exception, the authors of the reviews called upscale.  The girls at the reception will solve any problems.  The staff is very polite, considerate, friendly. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  Contrary to advertising, the authors of the reviews say that the hotel may not have free parking for cars.  The administration explains this by the fact that at this time they did not expect such an influx of vacationers - motorists. </p><h2>  Impressions of children </h2><p>  Children here really like animation, swimming pools and a trampoline.  Chlorine in the water of the basin, compared with Turkey and Egypt, is not so much. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The nearest beach is nearby.  To him it is necessary to go past the malls where they sell fruit, alcohol and souvenirs.  Vacationers will be able to appreciate the benefits of the hotel‚Äôs proximity to the beach after they see the lines of people lining up waiting for buses to leave for their hotels. </p><p>  An insignificant minus of the beach in Vityazevo, according to the authors of the reviews, is the very green sea, especially during the calm.  I have to go to a nearby beach (pebble). </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Many vacationers admit that they do not understand people who, having been at the Morskoy Paradise Hotel, may be dissatisfied with something.  They believe that for such little money is a good option. </p>
