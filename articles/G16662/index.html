    <p>  Sergey Matveev is more a singer, performer than an author.  He perfectly conveys the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeach song.  That is why his "emotional chanson" is so popular with people.  Indeed, in the life of everyone there were situations about which the performer sings.  Therefore, he has enough fans.  They not only buy his albums, but also constantly fill the halls at concerts. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Singer Sergei Matveev was born in the Bryansk region.  His childhood passed there.  It was there that he became interested in music.  This love was forever.  For many years, Sergey‚Äôs life, his work and activities were directly related to music.  However, he began to deal with it independently and professionally only in 2004.  At this time, he conceived, performed and recorded the first compositions. </p><h2>  First albums </h2><p>  A year after the start of his creative career, Sergey Matveev released his first album.  It is called "Handshake across the ocean."  The singer recorded it in collaboration with Ilya Itskov, who lives and works in New York. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ‚ÄúFictional Story‚Äù is the artist‚Äôs next album.  It comes out in 2006.  However, there are songs not only of Sergey, but also of Alexander Barykin.  Their creative union was quite long.  They not only recorded together, but also traveled through the cities on tour.  Perhaps because of this, Sergey Matveev was widely known among the public. </p>

    <p>  In 2007, the next album, entitled "Truce with the Soul."  Many of the compositions that went into it and became quite popular were written by the poet Igor Ilyin from Rostov-on-Don.  And the song "Zarekus" instantly fell in love with the audience.  She sounded on radio stations constantly.  Therefore, the performer in 2009 releases another album, which he calls "Zarekus". </p><h2>  Your team </h2><p>  Matveev Sergey in 2010 was invited to television.  On the channel "A-Minor" he successfully performed.  At this moment, the singer decided to create his own team.  He speaks with him now.  In 2011, the singer met with the composer and poet Valentin Firsov.  In tandem, they released the album "Night Mirage" with the title track of the same name.  After 2 years, Sergey Matveev will present his next album ‚ÄúWhere Love Lives‚Äù.  This time, the presentation of new songs was held in the concert hall "Friendship". </p><p>  One of the last in 2015 was the album ‚ÄúLike this!‚Äù.  It contains compositions that personify Sergey Matveev as a person.  He is confident in himself, knows a lot about life and the value of his actions, he is tired of separation, requires reciprocity and is ready for change.  That is what he sings about in his songs today. </p>
