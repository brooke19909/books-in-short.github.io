This is very convenient, because the road to work takes about the same amount, and sometimes less time, if traffic jams and distances between different ends of Moscow are taken into account.  The village of Volodarsky Leninsky district is located 43 km from the capital, if you go along the highway.  In a picturesque suburb there is a developed infrastructure, a river and the possibility of living both in an apartment building and in your own cottage on the ground. </p><h2>  The history of the village of Volodarsky </h2><p>  The first mention of a place on <span>the Pakhra River</span> can be seen in the letters of the mid-15th century.  Since then, the village of the Volodarsky Moscow Region has changed a lot of names: the village of Lodygino in 1451, later - Bogorodskoye (under the name of the wooden church built), at the end of the 17th century - Kazan (again in honor of the new white-stone church), since 1930 - the village of Stalin and only in 1956 it became the village of Volodarsky. </p>

    <p>  The famous cloth factory was originally called Yusupovskaya and was the main operating enterprise of the village.  From the end of the XIX century to 1929, it was renamed the factory to them.  Volodarsky, from which the name of the village came.  V. Volodarsky is the pseudonym of the revolutionary Moses Goldstein, whose car was blown up due to unknown circumstances.  The village of Volodarsky in the Moscow region is still called in his honor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  According to road manuals, from Moscow to the village of Volodarsky can be reached along the Kashirsky highway, covering a distance of about 43 km.

    <p>  You can get to the village of Volodarsky both by car and by public transport.  Numerous buses and taxis regularly fly from morning to late evening from the capital to the village and back.  Most of them depart from the Vykhino and Domodedovo metro stations.  Transport from the village goes not only in the direction of the capital, but also in Domodedovo and Zhukovsky. </p><p>  Now the reconstruction of the first four km of the Kashirskoye highway is nearing completion.  Transport interchanges are being built on the segments Moscow - the village of Volodarsky, Domodedovo - the village of Volodarsky.  Further restoration work is planned for the rest of the highway.  Volodarskoe highway passing through the village is in satisfactory condition. </p><h2>  Infrastructure of the village </h2><p>  Last year, the village celebrated its 565th anniversary.  For five and a half centuries in the village of Volodarsky much has changed in a positive direction: all the necessary infrastructure for life and recreation has been created.  Of course, the jobs are mainly concentrated in Moscow, but if you wish, here you can find a job or do business. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Security of residents is provided by the police stronghold.  A fire service arrives quickly on call.  There is an emergency department at the local hospital. </p><p>  For children there are kindergartens and a comprehensive school (11 classes).  For the additional development of children, a children's art school, various clubs: martial arts, developing "Sema", and aircraft models successfully operate.  There is a dance studio and clubs for little craftsmen, a library, a museum.  On a large playground there are rides, there is a field for mini-football. </p><p>  It is pleasant to walk along the well-groomed green boulevards and squares of the village, and in the evening sit in the Dastarkhan cafe that everyone loves.  For festive events, the inhabitants of the village gather in the center of culture and leisure "Lodygino". </p><p>  For comfortable living, multi-storey houses have been built, there are also houses on the ground.  The village is frustrated with new cottage housing complexes, the cost of which is relatively low.  There are many country houses that become busy from spring to autumn. </p><h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  Near the shore of Pakhra stands a beautiful light building of the Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker with a bell tower and two aisles, at which the Sunday School operates.  Residents love this sacred place very much and regularly come to the temple for services. </p><p>  Many churches in Tsarist Russia were blown up in the village during the Soviet years, as in many other places in our country.  In place of the destroyed Kazan Church now stands the Poklonnaya Cross. </p><p>  The building of the former cloth factory is more than 200 years old - now it is a non-functioning old abandoned red brick building with a white-stone storage room.  In the 90s, problems began at the factory that the management could not cope with, and in 2005 the enterprise ceased to operate. </p><h2>  Ecological situation in the village of Volodarsky </h2><p>  The neighborhood of the village with the Kazan forest park zone and the Pakhra river makes this place not only picturesque, but also environmentally friendly.  Favorably affected by the distance from industrial centers, the absence in the village of working factories and plants.  It is not surprising that the beautiful nature of the village of Volodarsky (pictured below) began to attract citizens both for hunting and fishing, and for permanent residence. </p>
