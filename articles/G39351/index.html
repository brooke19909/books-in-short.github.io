Fresh flowers will fade, and the taste of sweets and the efforts of a loved one will undoubtedly remain in memory.  It is interesting to make this magnificent multi-petal flower from paper of the same color, and to make it in layers, changing shades.  Well-opened peonies and dense buds look beautiful.  Candies are selected round or conical, it is desirable that the candy wrapper has a long tail.  For him, it is more convenient to attach sweets to the core.  Be sure to attach a few green leaves at the bottom of the flower to make it look real. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider in detail how to make peonies from corrugated paper with sweets, how to strengthen sweets so as not to lose them along the way to the birthday.  Imagine pictures explaining what shape the petals are cut out for the inside and for the extreme large parts.  We will help you choose a suitable core, teach you how to make it, explain what glue is better to use. </p><p>  Bouquets of sweets with peonies from corrugated paper look very impressive.  Such a gift will definitely please, because a piece of the master‚Äôs soul is enclosed in it.  Only a loving person is able to spend so much effort, labor and time on work, and not go and buy a ready-made bouquet and a box of chocolates.  Carefully study the manufacturing method - and you can make such a bouquet yourself, delighting loved ones and loved ones. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  Before you begin work on creating peonies from corrugated paper with sweets, you need to prepare everything you need so that you don‚Äôt leave your business halfway and rush to the store for missing materials.  First of all, pick up gift candies that will be conveniently wrapped in corrugated paper.  The flower is located on the stem, the function of which is performed by a strong wire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful paper peonies" class="if uuid-3134999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3134999.jpg"></div><p>  In working with it, pliers will be needed.  The rest of the material is sold in the stationery department.  This is corrugated paper of the required colors.  Peonies are white or all shades of red.  You can buy 3 or 4 rolls of paper of the same color with a difference of several tones to make a more spectacular flower.  To cut the leaves and design the stem, you need a little green paper.  Perfectly connect the small parts to each other with hot glue, so prepare a glue gun and buy a rod with glue.  When all the materials are purchased, you can begin work on the manufacture of peonies from corrugated paper with sweets. </p><h2>  How to spin a candy </h2><p>  The photo below shows what shape and size you need to cut the petal.  The candy is laid on corrugated paper, which is tightly wrapped around sweets.  If there is a candy wrapper with a tail on the candy, then it is also taken into circulation.  At the same time, a rod of wire is attached from below.  To prevent it from slipping out of the bundle, twist the loop at its end with pliers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to collect a bud" class="if uuid-3135003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3135003.jpg"></div><p>  If you add just a few of these petals, you get a closed peony made of corrugated paper with sweets.  It remains to add the leaves and wrap the wire with a thin strip of green paper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The appearance of the peony </h2><p>  To make a large and lush flower, you need to cut a huge number of petals, all of which are of different shapes.  How many blanks to make - your decision, it all depends on what size you need to get a flower.  In a real flower, when the bud opens, the petal bends in the opposite direction and shallow tears appear on the outer edge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.weddingomania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what a peony looks like" class="if uuid-3135006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3135006.jpg"></div><p>  Pestle and stamens covered with pollen peek out from the center of the bud.  In our craft, they will be curled from yellow corrugated paper.  How to do this, we will consider in more detail below.  The inner petals look like stripes with a rounded edge, the rest resemble a drop shape with a grooved edge. </p><p>  The closer the petal is to the outer edge of the flower, the larger its size.  Be sure to extend the opposite edge to allow attachment to the shaft. </p><h2>  We draw a pattern of petals </h2><p>  Petals for peonies from corrugated paper with sweets (see the photo below in the article) are painted first on cardboard, making a template.  Then fold the paper several times and outline the template with a simple pencil along the contours.  Then cut out different parts, several of the same. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shougongke.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="petal cutting" class="if uuid-3135016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3135016.jpg"></div><p>  The lower even edge of each petal should freely wrap around the stem so that it holds firmly on the stem. </p><h2>  Making the middle </h2><p>  First, we‚Äôll cut out the core, that is, stamens with yellow paper pestles.  A strip of 20 cm long and 6.5 cm wide is cut and its lower edge is cut with "noodles". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="make the middle of the flower" class="if uuid-3135049" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3135049.jpg"></div><p>  For cutting, it is recommended to fold the strip in several layers to make fewer incisions.  Then rotate the workpiece around a flat part.  "Noodles" will look after such a procedure in different directions, which will add naturalness to the craft.  Then the workpiece is glued to the bud with candy. </p><h2>  Flower assembly </h2><p>  In a real peony, the flower has a rounded shape, so the petals also need to be slightly twisted.  This is easy to do by stretching each part along the side surface of a simple pencil of cylindrical shape.  Additionally, you can apply the carved edge of the petal by pressing the same pencil or do it by hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make corrugated paper peony" class="if uuid-3135054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3135054.jpg"></div><p>  With a hot glue, a drop is placed on the even edge of the element and the prepared petal is immediately placed on the twisted lower part of the bud.  Each next part is attached with a slight shift to the side.  Gluing is carried out until the flower acquires the required size. </p><p>  The closer to the outer edge, the larger the petals you need to choose.  At the end, the stem is formed.  Cut a strip of 1 cm wide from green paper. The length depends on the height of the flower.  Attach the edge from the bottom of the wire with hot-melt adhesive, and then spiral-wrap the entire rod to the top.  At the end, reinforce the edge in the same way as the bottom.  When the stem is decorated, stick the leaflets of elongated shape, placing them in a circle, as in the photo above in the article.  Everything, the flower is ready!  For a bouquet you need to make from 5 to 7 pieces so that it looks spectacular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adsperfect.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a bouquet of paper peonies" class="if uuid-3135036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3135036.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, peonies made of corrugated paper with sweets are easy to make, it is enough to know what shape the petals are cut out and how to attach them to a stem made of wire.  Be sure to try to make such a gift for your loved ones, please with an unusual bouquet with a surprise inside!  Good luck </p>
