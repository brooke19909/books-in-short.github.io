    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  An amazing creation of nature - Skadar Lake (Montenegro).  The location on 40 thousand hectares of the territory of the conservation zone created in Montenegro in 1983 is quite justified.  Most of this unique national park is represented by Skadar Lake itself (approximately 391 sq. Km), which is home to more than 40 species of fish.  Among other things, the park is one of the largest bird sanctuaries in Europe, where more than 270 species of birds live.  Some of the birds (for example, the Dalmatian pelican and black ibis) are not found anywhere else in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among fish, the most numerous aquatic inhabitants are cyprinids.  It is curious that even some species of marine inhabitants get here through the Boyane River from the sea, although this lake can not be called brackish. </p><p>  The most significant settlements located on the shore of the lake are Virpazar and Rijeka Crnoevich.  The second was once the capital of Montenegro, although today almost nothing reminds of its former significance in the life of the state, but only the name that came from the name of the very first leader of Montenegro - Ivan Tsrnoevich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Skadar Lake Montenegro photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2018782.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Skadar Lake (Montenegro): photo, description </h2><p>  Although the lake is located in the mountains, however, it lies only 5 meters above sea level.  The surrounding hills, low, but quite picturesque, covered with various greens.  The shores in some parts of the lake are very boggy and almost completely covered with vegetation, and therefore it is difficult to reach them. </p><p>  The length of the reservoir is 43 kilometers, width - 25, area - 370 square meters.  km, and the average depth is 7 meters.  The dimensions of the reservoir at different times of the year may vary.  The part of the lake located in the Albanian territory is called Shkoder. </p><p>  It feeds on a natural body of water by underground springs and six rivers, the largest of which is Moraca, which is connected via the Buna to the Adriatic Sea.  The water on Lake Skadarsky is flowing, so in a year it manages to be completely renewed twice twice.  The water temperature in the summer is heated to + 27 ¬∞ C.  The coastline in Montenegro is 110 kilometers long, of which only 5 kilometers are reserved for tourism development. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  During periods of rains, the lake acquires a beautiful blue color and spreads quite strongly, and in the summer it is silvery and sparkles on sunny days.  Thanks to the springs, the water in the lake is very clean.  The most famous of the underground sources is Radus, which is very deep (about 90 meters, which is below the sea level).  He beats not far from the village of Seoka (the southern shore of the lake).  Such places attract fishermen who are aware of the possibility of a large catch in them.  Very popular among lovers of fishing Skadar Lake (Montenegro). </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Small islands (about 50 in total) can be observed along the western shores of the lake.  On some of them you can watch tiny secluded monasteries.  Across the coast are scattered many preserved ancient architectural monuments. </p><p>  At the spring of Radus on a stone island there is a Turkish fortress called Grmozur, which was turned into a prison by King Nicholas I.  History says that for obvious reasons, those who could swim were not detained here.  The same rule applied to the guards.  If the prisoner escaped, the jailer spent the rest of his life for him. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You should definitely see Skadar Lake (Montenegro).  Getting to it yourself is not so difficult. </p><p>  There is a lake on the border of the municipalities of Cetinje, Bar and Podgorica, whose airport is 15 kilometers from the lake.  About the same distance from the lake is the sea, however, the road to it lies through the Sozin tunnel.  In addition to the old, ancient roads, with the help of which the lake was connected with many areas of Montenegro, there is also a main road for cars and a railway running from Podgorica to Bar.  The main stations on it are Virpazar and Vranjina.  The railway line runs almost next to the lake. </p><p>  The southern part of the lake, where many picturesque villages are located, can be reached from Bar and Ulcinj.  In order to get to the northern part of the lake, you should use the road Podgorica - Cetinje. </p><p>  You can get to Virpazar by train from Sutomore, Bar or Podgorica.  Regular buses go from Petrovac.  If you go to the lake, using the services of a taxi from Budva, the trip will cost about 25-30 euros (the cost depends on the season).  One of the most acceptable and convenient solutions for traveling is to rent a car.  Therefore, many travelers come to the Skadar Lake of Montenegro on their own, by car of their own. </p>
