This article will describe in detail which apartments you can find here, if you wish, what is the infrastructure and whether the developer is reliable.  After that, each potential shareholder will be able to decide whether to buy housing in this residential complex or not. </p><h2>  About the residential complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="citydevelopers.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Vatutinki in New Moscow" class="if uuid-2944792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2944792.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about New Vatutinki often come completely opposite, so you have to carefully understand all the advantages and disadvantages of this residential complex. </p><p>  Currently, it is divided into two microdistricts and one village.  It is worth noting that most of the apartments are currently sold out.  For example, in the Central microdistrict, eight apartments are available worth from 4.6 million rubles, in the South - seven apartments from 5.1 million rubles.  In the village of Synergy there are land plots with communications. </p><p>  The construction of the Central microdistrict began at the very end of 2011, and the Southern one in the summer of 2012.  Currently, all houses in the Southern microdistrict have already been built, and in the Central they will be built before 2022.  The complex is surrounded by forest, the Desna River flows nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The <span>residential complex itself</span> is located within the borders of the Russian capital.  It is located 25 kilometers from the Moscow ring road along the Kiev highway and 14 kilometers from Kaluga. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="flatory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD New Vatutinki" class="if uuid-2944793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2944793.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of New Vatutinki you can often find the definition of "unique."  This is how they characterize this residential complex, which over the past six years has grown literally in the very center of New Moscow.  The main thing that attracts many residents here is a developed infrastructure. </p><p>  For a comfortable and fulfilling life, there is everything you need.  This is a communal and social infrastructure, affordable housing, transport links and even jobs.  About twelve thousand people have already purchased apartments in this microdistrict. </p><p>  At their services today in the residential complex "New Vatutinki" - modern schools and kindergartens, shops, clinics.  In the immediate vicinity are large shopping centers, in particular MEGA Teply Stan, about fifteen kilometers to OBI and IKEA, about twenty kilometers to Metro.  The Vnukovo OutletVillage complex with the latest fitness center, restaurants and SPA salons is eighteen kilometers away. </p><p>  Now in the microdistrict there are already three whole kindergartens, which can accommodate almost seven hundred children.  Two of them are in the Central microdistrict and one more in the Southern microdistrict.  Two more gardens are currently under construction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Gardens meet all modern requirements.  They have spacious bedrooms and games rooms, studios for creative work, computer classes, swimming pools, assembly halls, medical and treatment rooms, safe and convenient playgrounds, from which your child is guaranteed to be delighted. </p><p>  Now in the residential complex "New Vatutinki" there are already two secondary schools for more than a thousand students.  It is noteworthy that one of them is already among the hundreds of the best secondary schools in the capital, being the leader in the technical equipment of schools. </p><p>  Their concept is thought out so that each child has a full opportunity to realize himself not only during the educational process, but also receives free additional education, studying with leading teachers of metropolitan universities and institutes.  Students of these schools have access to an assembly hall, an amphitheater, a coworking center, indoor greenhouses, sports grounds and choreography halls with a ballet machine, transforming classes, machine tool rooms and robotics rooms, even their own weather station for observing the surrounding climate. </p><p>  Since 2016, a clinic for adults and children has been operating in the New Vatutinok territory in New Moscow.  At the moment, preparations are underway for the construction of a multidisciplinary medical-rehabilitation and medical center. </p><p>  Local residents also have their own relatively small shopping center with a pharmacy, chain supermarkets, cafes, a fitness center, and the My Documents service center will open in the near future.  There are also Sberbank and Russian Post branches in the microdistrict. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.metrium.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD New Vatutinki" class="if uuid-2944796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2944796.jpg"></div><p>  This residential complex has one indisputable advantage, which few developers can boast of.  Metro in "New Vatutinki" will appear directly on the territory of the Central microdistrict.  True, these are long-term plans.  By 2025, the red branch of the metro should be extended.  From the current Salaryevo station, Filatov Lug, Prokshino, Olkhovaya, Stolbovo and Novye Vatutinki stations will be built.  The metro will then be within walking distance for all residents. </p><p>  Currently, after a large-scale reconstruction of the Kaluga highway, thanks to tunnels, new interchanges and an increased number of lanes, residents have the opportunity to get to the Teply Stan station in about a quarter of an hour. </p><p>  There is also a bus service on the territory of the residential complex.  Route 891 Mosgortransa runs from Novovatutinsky Prospekt to the Teply Stan metro station.  Route 117 connects Novovatutinsky Prospekt with another metro station - Admiral Ushakov Boulevard.  There is also bus number 876, which runs from house number 9 on Novovatutinsky Prospekt to the Salaryevo Metro Station. </p><p>  Where is the developer of "New Vatutinok" registered?  Address: Moscow city, Desenovskoye settlement, Futbolnaya street, house 17, third floor.  It is here that the developer company is registered, which we will talk about in more detail. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.51424249999999" data-lng="37.371684800000025" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/2/1/7/11217.png"></div><p>  If you get by personal transport, then leave the Moscow Ring Road along the Kaluga Highway, after 14 kilometers, turn right at the sign for the New Vatutinki residential quarter in New Moscow. </p><h2>  Engineering Communication </h2><p>  All <span>utilities</span> in the area have already been commissioned.  In total, about thirty thousand people will be able to accommodate here, which is comparable to the population of a small city.  Therefore, initially communications were made modern and reliable with the necessary margin of safety. </p><p>  For example, water supply comes to the Southern and Central microdistricts in Novy Vatutinki from its own water intake unit.  Residents are provided with heat due to the powerful gas boiler complex.  Specialists control that modern equipment runs smoothly day and night. </p><p>  All local communications are independent, are on the balance sheet and in the management of the developer.  At the same time, public services and the operation of residential buildings are carried out at Moscow facilities and tariffs. </p><p>  It is important that many communal problems can be solved using a mobile application, that is, remotely.  For example, residents can take readings of meters, pay utilities and telecommunications services, send applications to the dispatch service. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.realty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Central microdistrict" class="if uuid-2944797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2944797.jpg"></div><p>  Construction work in this residential complex is conducted by the company "Investtrust".

Among the company's projects are residential neighborhoods with multi-story and low-rise buildings, as well as individual housing projects with a full range of transport and the necessary social infrastructure. </p><p>  The main advantage of the developer "New Vatutinok" is the innovative approach of the company, which consists in the integrated development of territories, the application of advanced technologies in practice. </p><p>  "New Vatutinki" today remains the most large-scale project of "Investtrast".  In parallel, several more concepts for the development of the territory of New Moscow are being developed. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Currently, apartments in seven different layouts are available in the Tsentralny microdistrict in Novy Vatutinki.

The cost of one-room apartments is from four to five million rubles.  Two-room apartments cost from 5.6 million to 7.2 million, and three-room apartments - from 7.3 million to 8.5 million rubles. </p><h2>  Full escort </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD New Vatutinki in Moscow" class="if uuid-2944794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2944794.jpg"></div><p>  If you need to buy an apartment in this residential complex, be prepared that throughout the process - from the very first viewing to obtaining a certificate of registration of ownership - you will be accompanied by professionals who will ensure the financial and legal security of the transaction, you will not worry about anything and to worry. </p><p>  Apartment displays are held daily.

Many people like clean air, developed infrastructure, location within walking distance of all the necessary infrastructure facilities.  In particular, pharmacies, clinics, shops, there is a convenient transport interchange.  The locals are looking forward to the subway appearing in their microdistrict to make it easy to get anywhere in the capital. </p><p>  Some residents admit that the first positive opinion about the residential complex has not changed after moving to this neighborhood in New Moscow.  The developer is responsible and reliable, no problems with him arise at all stages of construction and commissioning of the house.  Having settled themselves, some begin to think about buying apartments for parents and other relatives. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  At the same time, it is worth recognizing that there are a fairly large number of negative reviews dedicated to this residential complex. </p><p>  Especially a lot of complaints from new settlers relates to the repair and quality of work performed.  Even in new houses, after not very heavy rains, interpanel seams begin to flow, wallpaper in the room departs from the builder, and cracks appear on the ceilings.  All this indicates the lack of professionalism of builders and finishers who performed these works.  At the same time, the construction company is reluctant to troubleshoot, although it should do this promptly within the warranty period.  This problem is faced by many residents.  It can be said that these difficulties are typical. </p><p>  Some residents claim that the apartments are rented in violation of all conceivable standards.  The walls flow heavily after rains, and transport accessibility in the neighborhood is disgusting, since buses do not follow the schedule, it is almost impossible to leave in the evening, most drivers leave the route ahead of schedule. </p><p>  Complaints about equipment that builders install during repairs in apartments.  The electric bell is unstable, the switches just hang out, the euro plugs do not fit into sockets, the toilet is leaking, and the linoleum in the kitchen has to be replaced, it is of such poor quality: strong dents immediately remain on tables and chairs.  It is very difficult to get the developer to eliminate the deficiencies.  Residents have to contact him for months without results. </p>
