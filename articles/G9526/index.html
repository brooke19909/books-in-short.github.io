    <h2>  early years </h2><p>  Mikhail Lomonosov was born in the <span>Arkhangelsk region.</span>  He was the son of wealthy Pomors.  He helped his father, went with him to go fishing in the White Sea. </p><p>  Lomonosov Sr. was married several times.  The last of his wives could not find a common language with his stepson.  Mikhail‚Äôs life became unbearable every day in his native house.  After another quarrel with his stepmother, he decided to flee to Moscow.  He went there, as you know, on foot. </p>

    <h2>  Study </h2><p>  Lomonosov with difficulty managed to become a student of the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy.  Commoners in this institution were not trained.  Michael managed to forge a document.  He impersonated the son of a Kholmogory nobleman.  Ahead were difficult years of study. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1734, the future scientist left for Kiev.  Here for several months he studied at the Kiev-Mohyla Academy.  In 1735, Lomonosov went to Petersburg, where he was enrolled in a university at the Academy of Sciences.  Soon Lomonosov, as one of the best students, was sent abroad. </p><h2>  Germany </h2><p>  In Europe, Mikhail Lomonosov spent five years.  Of these, he spent three years studying at the University of Marburg.  He lived in other German cities, spent some time in Holland. </p><h2>  Petersburg </h2><p>  In 1740, Lomonosov returned to his homeland.  After 5 years, he was awarded the title of professor of chemistry.  Lomonosov devoted his whole life to science, in addition, he found time for literature.  And it is impossible to tell about all his achievements in one article. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  Lomonosov died at the age of 55 from pneumonia.  Shortly before this, Catherine II visited him.  The day after the funeral, according to the empress, the library and documents of the scientist were transported to the Orlov‚Äôs palace, and there they disappeared without a trace. </p><p>  An outstanding Russian scholar and writer was buried on April 8, 1865.  The grave of Lomonosov is located at the Lazarevsky cemetery.  It is worth telling about this ancient necropolis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lazarevskoe cemetery </h2><p>  The grave of Lomonosov is located in St. Petersburg.  The scientist was buried in a cemetery, founded simultaneously with the Alexander Nevsky Monastery.  The cemetery, where the grave of Lomonosov is located, served in the eighteenth century as the burial place of the most respected representatives of St. Petersburg society.  The burial was originally carried out next to a small wooden church, which was built in 1713. </p><h2>  Necropolis museum </h2><p>  The grave of Lomonosov, whose photo is presented in this article, is located in a cemetery intended for the burial of prominent personalities.  For burial in the early 18th century, the personal permission of the king was required.  Moreover, the sites that were near the Lazarevskaya tomb were considered the most honorable.  The <span>sister of Peter 1</span> Natalia is also buried here. </p><p>  The grave of Lomonosov in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra is one of the <span>sights of St. Petersburg.</span>  The necropolis has a rather interesting history.  In the first years after the foundation, it was filled with exceptionally highly artistic monuments and tombstones. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, several plaster sculptures were made, which today are stored in the most famous state museums of the city.  After the revolution, the cemetery was closed.  He was taken under state protection, and later turned into a reserve. </p><p>  In the early twenties, the Presidium of the Lensoviet proposed to convert the cemeteries into a museum.  But for many years the necropolis was closed to visitors.  In 1934, the first excursion was conducted at the cemetery.  True, the visitors to the necropolis, in which the graves of famous people are located, were not ordinary people, but a group of writers.  Soviet writers and poets <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="42" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">subsequently</span> spoke for a long time about the great cultural and historical significance of the ancient cemetery.  After some time, it was opened for visiting. </p><p>  The museum-necropolis contains the most interesting monuments from both historical and artistic points of view.  True, some in the thirties were destroyed.  For example, the tombstone of the <span>prince of Oldenburg.</span>  During the Second World War, the museum was interrupted.  After the end of the siege of Leningrad, restoration work began.  In 1952, the Lazarevsky tomb was opened for visiting. </p>

    <h2>  Tomb of Lomonosov in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra </h2><p>  The tombstone is a stele of marble, made according to the design of the masters F. Medico and J. Shtelin.  The monument, which can be seen today at the old cemetery, appeared in the 60s of the 18th century.  Established by <span>Count Vorontsov,</span> who was the patron and friend of Mikhail Lomonosov.  On the monument you can see the inscription, which indicates the involvement of this person in the construction of the tomb.  On the one hand, the inscription is made in Russian, on the other - in Latin. </p><p>  Field Marshal Sheremetev, playwright Fonvizin, 19th-century statesman Muravyov and other famous personalities are buried in this ancient cemetery. </p>
