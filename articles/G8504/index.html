But it turns out to be quite difficult to acquire.  On the forums, user complaints about insurers appear daily.  The latter refuse to sell the policy, citing the lack of forms, and offer to issue any other service.  But the inspectors say that there are no problems with the documents, the reluctance to conclude contracts is illegal.  So, how and where can I get CTP without additional insurance? </p><h2>  Situation </h2><p>  Since 2003, driving without compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is prohibited in Russia.  The penalty for breaking the rules is 800 rubles.  For a long time there were no problems with car insurance.  On a call, the agent was ready to come to any place in the city.  But a year ago, the situation has changed.  Companies began to refuse to issue CTP, citing the lack of blanks or long waiting lines.  Although the problems were still earlier.  FAS, Rospotrebnadzor, RSA and other regional governments have begun checking the activities of organizations, but there is no result.  <span>MTPL insurance without life insurance</span> or other services is practically not issued.  Drivers have to either overpay a few thousand rubles for the policy, or write a statement about the refusal of the service and wait another 30 days for an answer.  Most choose the first option.  In those <span>insurance companies (IC)</span> that draw up documents without additional services, queues of several dozen people a day.  And you can buy a "clean" policy only at the office, and not through an agent.  But experts say that there are other ways out of the situation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Depending on the region and the IC, the ‚Äúclean‚Äù OSAGO will cost 4-6 thousand rubles.  Plus additional services.  It should be remembered that for the inhabitants of rural areas and many small cities, increased coefficients are used.  Therefore, the cost of the policy can reach up to 10 thousand rubles.  This situation does not suit all drivers.  It turns out that driving without OSAGO insurance is fraught with a fine.  But the policy itself increased in price by 2-3 times.  What to do in this case? </p><h2>  Renew policy in advance </h2><p>  Experts advise car owners to contact insurance companies (IC) no later than 2-3 months before the expiration of the previous contract.  According to <span>Art.</span>  <span>445 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, the</span> organization is obliged to draw up a document within 30 days after receiving the application.  The changes that have come into force prohibit companies from refusing to provide services without real good reason.  If this happens, it is necessary to write a statement to the main office of the company with a request to issue CTP without additional insurance.  If after 3-5 days there is no answer, you can go to court.  But this is an extreme measure. </p>

    <p>  The letter that will arrive by mail will most likely have a refusal for some made-up reason, as well as an offer to drop into the office and find out all the nuances on the spot.  Employees of the branch for a "clean" CTP will advise you to apply in a month.  However, your application should already be recorded in the database.  To confirm your words, grab a notification from the mail and the response of the UK from the main office.  Further actions depend on how events develop.  Perhaps employees will be asked to undergo inspection before issuing a policy.  By law, they really have the right to do so.  The client will be assigned the time and place of the meeting.  It is very important that these actions are recorded on paper in the form of an official invitation letter.  Next, you need to arrive at the appointed time and place.  Most likely, the client will immediately receive CTP insurance without additional services.  The tariff is calculated individually for each vehicle, but in general, 3-4 thousand rubles.  You can keep fit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Driver tips </h2><p>  For those who do not want to spend months on paperwork, ‚Äúfriends in misfortune‚Äù offer to use a more extreme option.  During the visit to the office of the IC "turn on the fool."  On the proposal to issue an additional 2-3 more policies to agree.  Each contract is concluded and signed separately.  And you need to pay after the paperwork.  Therefore, when an employee of the company transfers a payment order, sign only papers for ‚Äúauto-citizen‚Äù.  You can refuse life insurance.  Since the document has been written out, the <span>payment order has been</span> confirmed and paid, the company employees are not entitled to refuse to issue compulsory motor liability insurance without additional insurance.  This will be a gross violation of the law.  But just in case, this whole process is worth recording on audio or video. </p>

    <h2>  More about calculations </h2><p>  Even if you managed to get CTP insurance without additional insurance, agents can increase the tariff due to the coefficients.  All these numbers cannot be verified.  But one of them can still be calculated.  This is an indicator of ‚Äúbonus malus" for a trouble-free ride.  If a client constantly draws up a policy in the same insurance company and does not apply for compensation, then in theory a discount should be accrued to him.  In practice, not all companies use this coefficient or set it equal to ‚Äú1‚Äù.  The correctness of the calculation can be checked via the Internet.  To do this, on the KASKOmeter website, you need to find out the KBM class, and then calculate the bonus-malus coefficient. </p><h2>  Transit insurance </h2><p>  Situations in life are different.  Very often, drivers buy cars in other areas, and then transport them to their hometown.  But if you buy a vehicle that has been deregistered, then 10 days are left to complete the formalities <span>(passing the TO</span> and receiving the policy).  Firstly, a short time.  Secondly, a person may not want to change SK.  You can, of course, at your own peril and risk, slowly get to your hometown.  But you need to be prepared to pay a fine.  Without OSAGO insurance, it was dangerous to drive earlier also because state registration numbers were removed from the car.  Their restoration cost much more than a policy.  Changes in the legislation that came into force last year abolished this punishment and increased the fine from 500 to 800 rubles. </p><p>  Especially for such cases, temporary insurance for <span>compulsory motor third-party liability</span> insurance has been developed <span>without inspection.</span>  It is valid for 20 days, and costs about 500-1000 rubles.  This time is enough to get to your hometown and do the paperwork of normal documents. </p>

    <h2>  Riding without CTP insurance </h2><p>  According to statistics, in Russia every fifth driver does not draw up a ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù or forgets to extend its validity.  As a result, law-abiding citizens suffer.  If compensation problems arise, they have to wait several months.  But lawyers suggest how you can speed up the process of receiving payments if the culprit of an accident without compulsory motor third-party liability insurance. </p><p>  First you need to make sure that the absence of the policy is recorded in the certificate from the scene.  You should also clarify the address of registration and residence of the culprit of the accident.  You can get information from the traffic police who draw up certificates.  Without this data, sending a subpoena will be very difficult.  An independent examination report will also be required.  It is desirable that the culprit of the accident be present during this process. </p><p>  Then, a pre-trial claim is drawn up, in which the route is indicated, the circumstances of the accident, the total amount of damage caused is indicated.  In addition to estimates, this figure can include the costs of evacuating and storing a car, conducting an examination, and moral damage. </p>

Otherwise, he will also have to pay the state fee and the services of a lawyer.  MTPL insurance without life insurance will cost less than legal costs.  So it is better to spend time on the policy than to compensate for all costs due to accidents.

    <h2>  DSAGO as a way out </h2><p>  Voluntary motor third party liability insurance can really help a person out of an accident.  But before acquiring a policy, it is worth soberly assessing the likelihood of a particular situation. </p><p>  The real average CTP payment is 15 thousand rubles.  Serious accidents are rare.  Experienced drivers should be enough.  Experts recommend purchasing DSAGO only for beginners.  As additional services to the policy, it is proposed: </p><ul><li>  payment of compensation excluding depreciation; </li><li>  the services of an emergency commissioner (in practice, he rarely visits the scene of an accident); </li><li>  free car evacuation, if ordered through the UK; </li><li>  legal support (valid only in theory). </li></ul><p>  These additional services are in fact rarely needed.  The cost of the policy varies between 0.2-0.3% of the amount of coverage.  It is calculated in the same way as OSAGO. </p><p>  No client will like it when they impose services that are not of interest to him.  But SK has its own rating of popular products.  And if any of them in this region becomes unprofitable, then agents, abusing the trust of customers, try to impose it.  Although it is prohibited by law, and a person has the right to refuse to issue extended insurance if he does not need it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fine without OSAGO insurance" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/771255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How else can you buy a ‚Äúclean‚Äù CTP? </h2><p>  In order not to listen to fictitious excuses of agents about the absence of forms or data in the database, you can ask to write an official refusal to complete the service.  No one will provide this paper, of course.  But the insurer may have a desire to get rid of you as soon as possible.  Perhaps then he will agree to take out CTP insurance without additional insurance. </p><p>  It is also worth using audio and video during a conversation with company employees.  So you can collect evidence, which will then be used in court. </p><p>  None of the options presented can guarantee 100% of the result.  If the IC does not want to cooperate with you in principle, then you will have to contact the police, RSA or the Antimonopoly Committee. </p><h2>  Claims </h2><p>  In the most extreme case, you will have to resolve all issues through the court.  By the way, clients often win such things.  Art.  445 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation provides that the UK is obliged to conclude an agreement with the client if there is a license and forms.  And any deviations for fictitious reasons will be strictly punished (Article 15 of the Code of Administrative Offenses).  In addition, the insurer may be forced to enter into a contract in a judicial proceeding.  Another thing is that not everyone will want to spend time and money on litigation.  According to new legislative norms, a fine of 50 thousand rubles may be imposed on the UK if the refusal to conclude an agreement or the imposition of additional services is proved.  The second is easier than the first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riding without OSAGO insurance" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/771252.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  The problem is that ‚Äúcitizenship‚Äù is necessary for drivers only to comply with legislative standards.  But CTP insurance without additional insurance brings companies only losses.  It is on this basis that conflicts arise. </p><p>  To avoid a lawsuit, calmly explain your position to the manager and make it clear that you are ready to go to the end.  In this case, it is worth worrying about collecting evidence in advance.  Perhaps you will come across a sane agent or director of a branch who agrees to issue a ‚Äúclean‚Äù CTP without additional ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù and rescheduling of meetings. </p><h2>  In the dry residue </h2><p>  It is better to search for a company for registration of compulsory motor liability insurance several months before the expiration of the previous policy.  It will take at least 3 months to sit in the queues and wait for forms, inspection, etc. </p><p>  Do not go in cycles in one company.  Call more organizations and find out the current insurance conditions.  If the agents claim that you need MOT - agree.  Spending money on a state inspection does not make sense.  Such a conclusion to the insurance will not be accepted. </p><p>  In decent organizations, admission is by appointment.  Therefore, before the day, ‚ÄúX‚Äù should call the selected company.  Make sure that the price of the policy has not changed and sign up for a convenient time in 3-4 offices.  Even if two of them "break", it will be possible to pass the inspection in the third. </p><p>  First of all, you should contact the UK in which the previous contract was drawn up.  There is a small chance that you will be saved from waiting in line. </p><p>  If compulsory motor third-party liability insurance without additional insurance became a matter of principle, then all meetings and conversations with company employees should be recorded on a phone or voice recorder.  In the future, these notes will help in court.  Employees of the company are not entitled to take the footage.  And if they start threatening to call the police, then they should get ahead of them and call 112 on their own. Upon the arrival of the police, the branch will be stopped. </p>
