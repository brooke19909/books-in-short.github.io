    <h2>  Vietnam Attractions: Phan Thiet </h2><p>  Rest in this hospitable country will be unforgettable for you.  For our compatriots, everything here seems original and exotic.  Phan Thiet (Vietnam), a photo of which you can see not only in our article, but also in the brochures of travel agencies, is rich in its history.  She left her mark on the architecture of these places.  In the mid-nineteenth century, there was a massive resettlement of Catholics, as evidenced by numerous architectural monuments.  Near the Catholic churches of extraordinary beauty, pagodas and Buddha statues rise here (one is located near the town of Phan Thiet). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Vacation in Vietnam is not only swimming in the sea.  This is a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the cultural heritage of this wonderful country.  A fascinating excursion to the largest Buddha statue is something for which many tourists make a trip to Vietnam.  Phan Thiet, or rather its inhabitants, are also proud of the <span>Chama towers.</span> </p><p>  And lovers of beautiful nature will certainly be interested in pink and white dunes.  However, nothing can compare with the impression that the Red Canyon makes on all visitors.  Its walls are a mixture of red clay and sandstone, and this local landmark was formed due to washing out of the soil.  This process continues to this day, and after a while the canyon will disappear, so tourists who want to enjoy this natural wonder should hurry up with a trip to Vietnam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vietnam attractions phantiet" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/457418.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another attraction of these places is the Lost, or Lost Sea.  This lake is located in the depths of the forest on the border of the provinces of Dongnai and Binh Thuan.  Local residents called it that because of the size that initially made people think that they really had a sea in front of them, which took about 1000 hectares from the forest.  In the rainy season, it tripled.  To the east of the pond rises Mount Katong. </p><h2>  Poshanu Towers </h2><p>  This is the legacy of the Champa people.  Once they were part of an ancient temple complex.  Fairies, daughters of the goddess Po Nagar, are worshiped here.  Now three towers are most preserved.  Their age is estimated at thirteen centuries.  Champa is distinguished by a special architectural style - fake doors, rounded columns resembling Khmer temple buildings.  Each year, in the first lunar month, the towers hold the Roch Mbang and Rigi Nuta festivals. </p><h2>  Ke Ga Lighthouse </h2><p>  It is located four kilometers from Phan Thiet.  This is one of the most famous places in the small province of Binh Thuan.  In 1897, the lighthouse was built by an architect from France, Senavat.  The height of the structure is 64 meters.  It was recognized as the most beautiful lighthouse in Southeast Asia.  An octagonal tower is crowned with a lantern capable of illuminating twenty-two <span>nautical miles.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Mui Ne fishing village </h2><p>  So called their village local fishermen.  In the storm season, they found refuge here.  Translated "mui" means an island or a cape, "not" - a shelter.  Transparent blue waters, bright sun, snow-white sand created a magnificent landscape that is pleasing to the eyes of guests from abroad.  In addition to fascinating excursions, tourists can observe the hard daily work of fishermen and take part in fishing. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Forests in these places are ancient.  Here you can see countless different orchids that get along well with trees, which are also very diverse - sandalwood, thuja, cypress, etc. The depths of the sea hide a variety of fish;  many birds nest on its shores, and whoever is not here ‚Äî from simple pheasants to majestic peacocks. </p><h2>  Town Fantie </h2><p>  The picturesque area near the calm Phan Thiet river was inhabited many centuries ago, but until the twentieth century it remained a quiet unknown fishing town, or rather, even a village.  In antiquity, he was part of the kingdom of Champs.  Despite its rather modest size, the settlement played a significant role in the history of the country and presented several outstanding figures of history and culture to the Vietnamese people.  There are many resorts and exotic places in Vietnam.  One of them is Phan Thiet resort (Vietnam).  Citizens (population of approximately 200 thousand people) are very hospitable and welcoming.  Those who are not involved in the tourism business, earn fisheries or agriculture, as well as their distant ancestors.  The main nationalities living in this territory are Vieta, Tyma, Hoa.  Everyone who comes to this pretty town is pleasantly surprised that most of the locals speak good English and Russian.  This greatly facilitates communication.  I must say that the development of tourism has significantly improved the welfare of the population. </p>

    <h2>  Economics, transport </h2><p>  Perhaps the most significant drawback of this resort is the lack of an international airport.  But this is not so scary.  Arriving in Vietnam, you will get to Ho Chi Minh City, from which it is very easy to get to Phan Thiet.  It offers trains, buses, taxis (the cost of the latter, by the way, is quite affordable).  In the city, tourists prefer to travel by taxi or rented car, which will cost eight dollars a day.  A similar service is provided by all hotels in the city. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Hotels in Vietnam (Phan Thiet in this sense is no exception) - buildings of modern construction with an original design, well equipped in technical terms.  A variety of hotels are presented to the attention of tourists - these can be modest 3 * rooms or excellent 4 * and 5 * apartments.  All of them have a set of necessary services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels vietnam phantiet" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/457422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you are planning to go to Vietnam, tours (Phan Thiet is necessarily on the list of the most popular) should be agreed in advance with a tour operator.  Which one do you want?  If you are planning a vacation with children, make sure that they have their own room.  In addition, it is necessary to discuss other services provided by the hotel - Internet, cable TV, air conditioning and others. </p><p>  Another important issue is nutrition.  In Vietnam, it is single or double.  A buffet is offered by all hotels in Vietnam.  The fancy of many tourists is striking in a varied menu.  Trying all the offered treats for breakfast or dinner is almost impossible.  It offers a variety of seafood, meat.  Various vegetables and fruits are abundant.  Sweet tooth will enjoy a large selection of ice cream and drinks.  The hotels are dominated by European cuisine, and lovers to try something exotic should go to the nearest cafe or restaurant. </p><p>  Today we bring to your attention several hotels.  They are most popular among tourists coming to Vietnam.  Rest (Phan Thiet guarantees this) will be held at the highest level if you settle in the Swiss Village Resort 5 * hotel.  It stands on a magnificent snow-white beach, in the middle of a coconut grove.  The complex was built at the expense of a Vietnamese architect who lived in Switzerland for nineteen sixty-six.  A few years ago he returned to his homeland. </p><p>  The concept of the architectural style of the hotel is based on Asian cultures embodied in buildings with round roofs and rounded columns.  The exquisitely decorated rooms are furnished to Swiss standards.  The hotel has two restaurants, four bars, a beauty salon, a business center, a gift shop, a library, and a fitness center.  Each room is equipped with a radio, telephone, paid minibar, air conditioning, hairdryer.  It is possible to connect a modem and fax.  For children, a playroom, a mini club, a swimming pool, babysitting services, an equipped playground are organized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels vietnam phantiet" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/457424.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Vietnam, Phan Thiet: Shopping </h2><p>  Those who are used to European shopping will probably be surprised to find themselves in a Vietnamese shop.  There are no world famous brands, but there are a lot of exotic, for which many come here.  Stop by the oldest Fantien market - Central.  But be careful - it is very easy to get lost here.  In small shops, pavilions, tents, you can buy shoes and clothes, jewelry with mother of pearl, silver, <span>ornamental stones.</span>  Near the hotels there are usually small shops and shops with gifts and souvenirs.  Not sure what to bring to your family and friends?  Pay attention to Vietnamese woven hats and natural silk. </p>
