Go to the Moscow planetarium.  A unique institution will allow you to learn a lot.  Not a single child will remain indifferent.  The institution of a modern level is equipped with the latest equipment, which allows you to immerse yourself in the world of space. </p><h2>  The history of the planetarium </h2><p>  The history of the Moscow planetarium dates back many decades.  The decision to build it was made in 1927.  At that time, similar institutions already existed in the world.  Ten of them were in Germany, and two outside it - in Rome and Vienna.  Significant funds were allocated for the construction of a planetarium in Moscow.  The first stone was laid in September 1928.  And in May of next year, the auditorium was already ready.  A few months later all the equipment was installed.  Closed views took place during the first months.  During construction, scientific and methodological work was actively conducted.  Specialists carefully selected material and topics for presentation.  The topics that were most interesting for the mass audience and special programs for schoolchildren were chosen. </p><p>  The grand opening of the planetarium took place on November 5, 1929.  This day is considered to be the institution‚Äôs birthday.  The planetarium began its activities with just three topics.  Soon the number of lectures grew to 40. In the institution, guests were told about the structure of the Universe, about the development and origin of the Solar System, about the Moon, comets and meteorites.  Soon there was a technical need to supplement the equipment of the institution with new devices and devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nevsedoma.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow planetarium address" class="if uuid-2873164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2873164.jpg"></div><p>  By 1934, stars flickered on the planetarium dome, aurora fluttered, clouds flew, comets flew, and even the dawn blushed, after which the bright sun rose.  Until the end of the 1950s, nothing like this could be seen in any institution in the world. </p><p>  In 1934, the first astronomical circle began to operate on the basis of the planetarium.  In the prewar years, the institution literally became a theater, since it was used to stage plays in which professional actors took part.  The performances "Copernicus", "Galileo", "Giordano Bruno" were staged in the domed room.  During the war, the planetarium did not stop its activities.  In addition to conducting regular lectures, workers provided assistance to the army in the form of field exercises for the military. </p><p>  Since 1947, the institution has been fully operational.  It already has an astronomical platform, a lobby, a star room and an observatory.  The planetarium is becoming a center of popularization of the natural sciences.  Subsequently, classes were held in its walls with future astronauts on astronavigation.  At this time, the popularity of the institution is growing with incredible strength.  Up to a million guests visited it annually. </p><p>  Later, the general problem of stagnation touched this unique place.  In 1994, the institution was closed for major repairs.  And only after many years it was again open to visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to the Moscow planetarium </h2><p>  Currently, the institution is actively working and is open to visitors.
