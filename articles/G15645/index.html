    <h2>  Types of Deposits </h2><p>  Uralsib Bank in Moscow has only nineteen loan programs to offer customers only loans.  Among them, one consumer, three mortgage, four car loans, eleven types of credit cards. </p><p>  All existing deposits at Uralsib Bank (in Moscow and any other city) are necessarily insured <span>by the deposit insurance system.</span>  As you can see, this is pretty safe. </p><p>  Forty-nine branches and two hundred and fifty-two Uralsib ATMs in Moscow expect customers. </p><h2>  Bets </h2><p>  The key deposit rate is 9%, although this depends on the type of product chosen by the client.  Most likely, in the near future, the rate will decrease, experts say, in order to gradually approach the threshold of inflation. </p><p>  Now, while the gap is very large, almost 5%, which brings a big load to the business, it is difficult for it to develop.  It should be noted that this also greatly affects the cost of loans.  It is gratifying that the mortgage rate (extremely high) gradually began to decline in this bank, not too noticeably, but the process has begun. </p>
