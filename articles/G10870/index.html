What is the city interesting for?  In our article you will find a description and photos of the sights of Borisoglebsk. </p><h2>  City and its features </h2><p>  The Caucasus, Shanghai, Vorovo, the Valley of the Paupers - these are such outlandish place names found in the urban environment of modern Borisoglebsk.  Once they were separate villages, now they are informal areas within the city. </p><p>  Borisoglebsk was founded at the end of the XVII century and surprisingly preserved the old layout of 1806.  Thanks to this, the city entered the list of historical settlements of Russia.  About a hundred architectural and cultural monuments have been preserved here.  Initially, the settlement served as a fortress, defending the borders of the country from periodic Tatar raids. </p><p>  In 1703, a wooden church of Saints Boris and Gleb was erected in the fortress, by the name of which the city received its modern and beautiful name.  In Soviet times, they decided to change this “obscure” name to something more progressive and consistent with the spirit of the times.  After lengthy discussions we settled on one of the options - Kolkhozgrad.  The new name for the city was approved by both local activists and the trade union congress.  Fortunately, the Kremlin did not support this initiative, and the city remained Borisoglebsky. </p><p>  What are the main attractions of Borisoglebsk, Voronezh region?  We will talk about this later. </p><h2>  The main attractions of Borisoglebsk </h2><p>  What interesting can this city offer a tourist?  Borisoglebsk has three main attractions: architecture, museums and local beer.  The last brew here since 1878! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You need to come to Borisoglebsk in order to slowly walk along the quiet, cozy streets, admire the beauty and grace of ancient merchant houses, to feel the atmosphere of a county town, which has not changed its appearance since the beginning of the 19th century. </p><p>  All travelers are greeted by a chic train station.  Its central building is a valuable architectural monument, which traces the features of classicism, renaissance and traditional Russian style.  In Borisoglebsk there are three museums (a lot for such a small city): art, local history and art gallery. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the usual magnets and the famous beer, from Borisoglebsk you can bring skillful woodwork, clay, as well as light and very warm <span>goat</span> shawls <span>.</span>  The city has a number of hotels, guest houses, cafes, restaurants and eateries.  Therefore, visitors will definitely not stay here without an overnight stay and a delicious lunch. </p><h2>  Church of Saints Boris and Gleb </h2><p>  This is perhaps the main attraction of Borisoglebsk and the oldest building in the city.  The temple was built in 1703 from wood.  But in 1784 he burned to the ground, after which he was replaced by a stone church.  The shrine was built slowly and in stages: at first the cathedral part of the temple grew, then the refectory and three-tier bell tower.  At the very end, the church was crowned with a beautiful octagonal dome. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Brewery </h2><p>  The plant for the production of the popular hop drink originated in Borisoglebsk in 1878.  It was founded by a German named Leimer.  Although before that, locals actively brewed beer here. </p><p>  From afar, the massive and gloomy factory building resembles either a prison or a Gothic castle.  Unfortunately, it’s difficult to get inside it for excursion purposes.  But the products of the plant can be found in any store or bar in the city.  Today Borisoglebsky <span>brewery</span> produces ten beers. </p>

    <h2>  Tellerman Forest </h2><p>  Outside of Borisoglebsk there are also enough sights.  In particular, you can visit the Tellerman Forest, which adjoins the city from the west.  From the Turkic language its name translates as “endless forest”.  Indeed, its area is huge and amounts to almost 40,000 hectares.  The length of the forest is about 60 kilometers. </p><p>  This is one of the oldest forests in Russia.  The very first written mention of it dates back to 1571.  There are many long-lived trees in the Tellerman Forest.  Among them is the oldest oak of the Voronezh region, whose age, according to botanists, exceeds 350 years. </p>
