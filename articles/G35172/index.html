In this case, the smartphone market has become a testing ground for the company, where constant testing of new devices was carried out.  What is this manifested in?  At first, the Chinese manufacturer supplied not very expensive devices to mobile phone stores.  Nevertheless, at certain points, sequences of inexpensive models were, so to speak, diluted with top-end smartphones with the corresponding cost.  But such moves were quite justified. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2>

    <p>  In the Russian Federation, Lenovo has already managed to establish itself quite well as a reliable supplier of mobile equipment, tablet computers and laptops.  And every year the position of the Chinese manufacturer only strengthens.  There are probably practical reasons for this.  However, our current goal is not to characterize the company, but to figure out what its brainchild is called Lenovo Vibe X2, the price of which is currently about 15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  History </h2>

    <p>  I remember that the real shift of the company was the sale of the flagship under the name K900.  This applies to sales in the Russian Federation.  In connection with this, a completely logical question may arise: ‚ÄúWhy then?‚Äù  The answer is very, very simple, if you think for a moment.  The thing is that at that time the corresponding model had truly top-end characteristics, which attracted a considerable audience, according to experts, on the side of the Chinese manufacturer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the device did not have a completely unique, but attractive design, which many future buyers of the device appreciated.  Recall that the main parameter that influenced this was the phone‚Äôs body, made thin, high quality and made of metal.  Not the last role was played by the price of the device.  Thus, the Chinese company managed to achieve significant success in terms of market promotion, having been heard by many new people. </p><p>  After K900, several more good devices from the manufacturer entered the smartphone market.  But the real leader among them was the model under the name Vibe X. Actually, the dominance of this unit over other products of the line laid the foundation for the modification of the old (or the development of a new) device.  Perhaps Vibe X can be called a good example of the way in which the Chinese manufacturer is able to work, and what it can offer from smartphones to potential buyers. </p><p>  It was in such an environment, with such preliminary positioning, the Lenovo Vibe X2 was developed, the price of which falls in the range from 13 to 15 thousand rubles at the moment.  In general terms, this is nothing more than a middle-class smartphone.  Its parameters (and it means hardware stuffing - from the processor to the camera) are not fantastic, but quite impressive, especially considering the cost of the device.  The device has a universal design.  Why did the Chinese decide to do so?  Probably, universality should have helped to avoid a large number of negative reviews.  After all, you will never guess who will like something.  And universality - it is also universal in Africa. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A few words about the cost of Lenovo Vibe <span>X2 LTE.</span>  In the article, you may notice references to the fact that the price of a smartphone is not that big.  This refers to the current position of the device in the smartphone market.  At the very beginning of sales, the cost of the device did not match its <span>technical proposals</span> for buyers.  However, now we can say that everything has settled down, and the device is put up for sale at an adequate price.  In general, the basis for positioning Lenovo Vibe X2 LTE is just the same ‚Äúprice / quality‚Äù ratio. </p><h2>  Brief technical specifications.  Software </h2>

    <p>  First of all, we note the operating system.  On board the Lenovo Vibe X2 Gold, we have the Android family of OS installed.  More specifically, this is version 4.4 of KitKat.  But some companies do not stop using ordinary operating systems.  This was the case with HTC.  The Chinese company decided to keep up with the Thais and developed a custom shell called Vibe UI, which was implanted in the phone Lenovo Vibe X2 Gold. </p><h2>  cellular </h2>

    <p>  The device works in GSM networks, HSDPA + is supported.  But what was especially pleasing (but for such a price it is understandable) is the ability to transfer data in fourth-generation networks, which is provided through the use of a hardware LTE module.  Thus, the owner of the phone will be able to surf the Internet at an increased speed, quickly open web pages and download videos, as well as other media files. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  In this case, as a chipset, we have a MediaTek device, this is the MT6595m model.  The processor works with eight cores, the maximum clock frequency can reach two gigahertz.  Very, very good for such a device for the appropriate cost.  The graphics subsystem is PowerVR G600.  Two gigabytes of RAM are built into the smartphone, which is more than enough for 90 percent of games and applications.  There is an opportunity to successfully use the phone in multifunctional mode and open several programs at the same time.  At the same time, the operating system runs smoothly and clearly, without any hint of failures. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  For storing user data (i.e. text documents, music, photos, video clips and movies, as well as games and applications), the phone has 32 gigabytes of long-term memory.  However, one of the drawbacks, even with such a volume, is the lack of a slot in which to install a memory card.  It is simply absent.  Apparently, the Chinese manufacturer decided that for the average user 32 gigabytes is enough for a lifetime.  Bad, yes, but what can I do?  Well, in the meantime, we move on. </p><h2>  Wireless Modules </h2>

    <p>  The Lenovo Vibe X2 phone, an overview of which is presented in this article, works with wireless Wi-Fi modules (in networks of the b, g, n band), as well as Bluetooth (version 4.1).  At the same time, there is a port for synchronization with a personal computer or laptop.  The same jack is used to charge the device.  We are talking, of course, about the MicroUSB standard port.  You can connect a wired stereo headset to your smartphone (and you need to use FM radio).  You can use it in case of playing multimedia data. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Phone Lenovo Vibe X2, the review of which rapidly flew around the international network, is equipped with a screen whose diagonal is 5 inches.  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using IPS technology, which means that the load on the eyes of the owner of the phone during its operation will be reduced to a minimum value.  Very well the technology is noticeable when the backlight is the least active.  Well, or when reading e-books at night from the device‚Äôs screen.  The picture is displayed in Full HD resolution.  The density of dots is 441 pixels per inch.  There is a function to automatically adjust the backlight level through the use of an appropriate sensor. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Smartphone <span>Lenovo Vibe X2, reviews</span> of which we give at the end of this article, has two cameras.  The main one has a resolution of 13 megapixels, and thanks to this it gives stunning pictures of objects.  Is there anything else to say about video recording with her help?  Is that the resolution will be 1080 pixels.  The front camera is perfect for fans of selfies.  This is a 5 megapixel device.  The main camera is equipped with an automatic focus function on the subject, as well as a flash of the LED type. </p><h2>  Satellites </h2><p>  Navigation in space is carried out due to GPS technology, there is also a <span>GLONASS</span> module <span>.</span>  <span>This</span> allows you to accurately obtain data on location on a satellite map.  Thus, the Lenovo Vibe X2 smartphone, reviews of which give a positive assessment to the device, can also be used as a navigator when traveling by car. </p><h2>  Sensors </h2><p>  In addition, I would like to note the presence of an accelerometer, which is useful in some games.  There is a necessary set of sensors.  It includes a proximity sensor that turns the screen backlight on and off during a telephone conversation, as well as <span>a light sensor that</span> adjusts the brightness level of the display depending on external light manifestations. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  A lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 2,300 mAh is built into the device as a battery.  Not so much, but quite a lot.  Although energy will be spent, as they say, from the heart.  And there is no doubt about it.  Especially taking into account the specific features of the operating system of the Android family.  In conclusion, we note that the dimensions of the phone in three-dimensional space have the following parameters: 140.2 in height, 68.6 in width, and 7.3 mm in thickness.  At the same time, the mass of the device is record lowered to only 120 grams. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  Among the advantages of the device is the good quality of cellular communications, as well as other wireless modules.  Wi-Fi receives the signal freely, without effort.  Cellular network does not disappear.  And what else can you expect from a smartphone for 15 thousand rubles, which is equipped with LTE technology?  Good speaker volume.  There is stock.  The interlocutor's speech from that end of the wire comes in qualitatively, cleanly and distinctly.  In general, the expected plus sign.  The same goes for vibrating alert.  It will be difficult not to notice him. </p><p>  Among the expected logical shortcomings, we primarily have the battery life.  Yes, in principle, 2,300 mAh is not so little.  But obviously not for those who buy a smartphone in the hope of using it (with such and such characteristics!) To its fullest, non-stop, all day.  In this case, the only solution will be to purchase an additional external battery, say, at 10,000 A. It will allow you to fully charge the phone at least twice.  And this is in the absence of an electrical network.  The second disadvantage is the lack of a slot for a memory card.  Although we hope that the built-in 32 gigabytes to the owners of the phone is still enough. </p>
