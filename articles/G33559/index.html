Everyone is looking forward to their release, hoping for innovative and truly original solutions.  In the summer of 2017, a fairly popular company from the Middle Kingdom released a new smartphone - Meizu Pro 7 Plus.  An overview of this particular device will be presented in this article.  Did he interest buyers?  Definitely yes!  First of all, many paid attention to the additional screen, which is located on the rear panel.  The developers also used paired cameras, which have recently been popular.  It was on these elements that emphasis was placed in this new product.  But what about the other characteristics?  Are they interesting for the modern user?  Let's get it together. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 plus reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2101048.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  First impression </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine a buyer who, when buying a new gadget, will pay attention only to its technical characteristics.  The first thing that attracts attention is design.  Of course, appearance plays an important role in shaping public opinion.  How did customers accept the new product from the Chinese manufacturer Meizu Pro 7 Plus (Black, Gold, etc.)? </p><p>  A bit strange, but some users compared the look of the smartphone with a refrigerator.  Surprisingly, the design of the gadget with a silver case is really similar to this household appliance.  It is striking if you look at the rear panel, which is made of brushed metal and complemented by a small screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But such a similarity can be avoided if you pick up a gadget with a black body.  He definitely looks pretty solid.  The matte surface not only looks spectacular, but also is practical.  Many users in the comments stated that the black version is the most organic. </p><p>  As soon as the phone went on sale, buyers immediately noticed that the manufacturer began to use premium design solutions.  The Chinese flagship clearly shows features that allow the device to gain a foothold in the premium segment.  Accordingly, this could not but affect the cost of the smartphone.  The price of the Pro 7 Plus started at 30 thousand rubles.  Considering that the manufacturer has launched two modifications on the market, the difference between them varies between 4-5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Take a look in the box </h2><p>  Studying the reviews on <span>the Meizu</span> Pro 7 Plus <span>phone</span> , you can see that most of them talk about bundling.  As for the packaging, it undoubtedly emphasizes the status of the gadget.  The case itself is made of solid black plastic.  Inside it are cardboard boxes.  In one of them, the device itself is packed, and in the other - accessories.  The latter are neatly fixed in certain places.  The kit has a clip for removing the SIM card tray, a USB Type-C cord, a power supply and a plastic overlay.  Of course, the manufacturer provided all the necessary documentation in the kit.  But what is really not enough, according to buyers, is the headphones. </p><p>  There is also a VIP card in the box.  A unique number is printed on it, however, for what it is intended, it is not known for certain, therefore the advantages of this element cannot be estimated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 plus customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2101049.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Many buyers consider the convenience of operation the main criterion when choosing a smartphone.  Especially you need to pay attention to this if the gadget is equipped with a large screen, as is the case with Meizu Pro 7 Plus.  Feedback on ergonomics is mostly positive, despite the impressive dimensions of the phone.  Of course, to control you will need to use two hands, but this can not be attributed to the shortcomings.  The gadget lies comfortably in the palm of your hand, thanks to its non-slip body and rounded side edges.  Users pay attention to the fact that to access the curtain there is no need to reach the very top, just swipe across the screen anywhere. </p><p>  The reviews say almost nothing about the connectors, as their location is standard.  For music lovers, the device has a mini-jack port.  But the speaker was disappointed.  For some reason, the developers installed only one, although it was possible for 30 thousand to be generous and stereo.  Also, for some, its location was inconvenient.  During the game, the speaker is constantly closed by the palm of your hand. </p><p>  Speaking of ergonomics, one cannot fail to note the function button displayed under the screen.  It is universal, as it performs several appointments at once, for example, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  Thanks to this key, the smartphone is quite convenient to use. </p><h2>  Fingerprint scanner in Meizu Pro 7 Plus: customer reviews </h2><p>  By and large, users have no comments on the scanner.  However, some drew attention to the fact that he would have to get used to it.  As for the speed of reading the print, everything is fine here.  But about the convenience of work, reviews can be found ambiguous.  The thing is that a lot depends on the duration of the touch.  For example, to unlock the device, you need to press the main button and hold your finger for just a few seconds.  However, if you do not remove it in time, a voice assistant will open.  It is such moments that cause certain inconvenience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone reviews meizu pro 7 plus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2101050.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Characteristics of the main screen and reviews about it </h2><p>  The Meizu Pro 7 Plus boasts a quality screen.  Reviews about him in most cases are positive.  Its diagonal reaches 5.7 ∫.  Made using Super AMOLED technology.  It provides high-quality image, wide viewing angles and real color reproduction.  By default, the neutral temperature of the shades is selected with a slight bias to the warm color scheme.  As for brightness, then in some reviews there were comments.  Many considered the upper threshold insufficiently high, and the minimum indicator could be made lower. </p><p>  It is important that the manufacturer has provided screen settings.  If desired, the user can choose the color saturation to your taste.  There are four settings options in the menu.  There is a night mode in the smartphone.  His work is limited to a time period.  The user selects the schedule individually.  Thanks to this mode, you can interact with the phone for a long time without feeling tired in the eyes. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, respect is also worthy of permission.  On the screen, the picture is displayed in the format 2560 √ó 1440 px.  The density is high, is 518 ppi.  This cannot be clearly considered an advantage, since a capacious display affects autonomy and performance. </p><h2>  A few words about the second screen </h2><p>  The second screen has become a "chip" Meizu Pro 7 Plus.  Reviews about him, unfortunately, are mixed.  The reason for this is unstable operation.  There are several comments on the sensor - it does not always respond to touch.  For example, to start the camera, sometimes it may be necessary to make two instead of one vertical swipe. </p><p>  What about the features of this display?  Its diagonal is 1.9 ∫.  Resolution - 536 √ó 240 px.  Screen Type - AMOLED. </p><p>  The display can show the weather forecast, pedometer data, battery status, alarm and new notifications.  If a special program is installed on the gadget, then through an additional screen the ability to control music is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 plus review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2101051.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Flagship at work </h2><p>  In the model range, the manufacturer introduced all versions of the gadget.  The first, tentatively called "younger", runs on a MediaTek Helio P25 processor.  It is based on 8 computing elements that accelerate to 2500 MHz.  Paired with it is the Mali T880 MP2 graphics accelerator.  As for memory, RAM is 4 GB, and ROM is 64 GB. </p><p>  The "older" version differs not only in the amount of built-in storage, which is equal to 128 GB, but also in "RAM".  Here, the developers installed as much as 6 GB.  Naturally, the platform in this modification will be much more powerful.  The main MediaTek Helio X30 chipset allows the gadget to cope with any task.  For the processing of work processes, 10 computing modules are responsible.  During high load, the clock frequency increases to a maximum of 2500 MHz.  To work with graphics, the PowerVR 7400XT MP4 graphics card is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 plus 64gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2101052.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What's on board? </h2><p>  Under the control of the seventh "Android" Meizu Pro 7 Plus is running.  W3bsit3-dns.com - a resource where you can find answers to all your questions.  Provides detailed information about this version of the operating system.  What is worth talking about is the proprietary interface.  A Flyme 6.0 shell is installed on top of the system.  In reviews, many users praise her, highlighting the originality and ease of management. </p><p>  If the buyer purchased a smartphone with Chinese firmware, then most likely there will be problems with installing services from Google.  We must be prepared for the fact that the factory equipment will not even have pre-installed applications.  To solve the problem, you will need to find the Google Play APK file, install it on your phone, after which any application will be downloaded to the device. </p><h2>  Audiophile Reviews </h2><p>  All phones of this company have good speakers.  With the playback of music there will be no problems with the Meizu Pro 7 Plus, the reviews are confirmation of this.  To ensure professional sound, the manufacturer installed the Cirrus Logic CS43130.  The audio chip is equipped with a built-in amplifier, thanks to which any tracks are perfectly reproduced through the headphones.  The sound is not just great, it's juicy and powerful.  Detailing at the highest level.  Sounds of both the first and second plan are clearly reproduced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 plus specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2101053.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Meizu Pro 7 Plus: battery life characteristics </h2><p>  Paying attention to the technical equipment of this model, many buyers understand that the gadget must have a fairly capacious battery.  However, not only she is responsible for a long period of autonomy.  Also, a lot depends on system optimization.  In this regard, the manufacturer exceeded all expectations.  Although the device has a battery of only 3500 mAh, the results will surprise any user.  For example, during a game of tanks in 10 minutes, only 10% of the charge was consumed.  In order to obtain such results, it is necessary to reduce the brightness to 60%.  Excellent autonomy is provided by an energy-efficient platform.  The user can count in normal operation for at least one day.  Customers really liked the ability to quickly charge mCharge 4.0.  With it, you can restore the battery life in just 60 minutes. </p><h2>  What about the cameras? </h2><p>  Optics in Meizu Pro 7 Plus (64Gb / 128 Gb) is quite consistent with the class of flagships.  The main camera is represented by Sony IMX386 paired modules.  The flash is also double.  There is an auto focus function.  It works very quickly.  You can record video in 4K format.  Each of the modules has a resolution of 12 megapixels.  Photos are obtained, although imperfect, but the quality of the users have no comments. </p><p>  The selfie camera is equipped with a 16 megapixel sensor.  If you take into account that the device is equipped with an additional screen, then, in principle, the need for the front matrix disappears, since it will be convenient for the owners to take pictures with the main camera.  But the manufacturer did not give up on the ‚Äúfront camera‚Äù and did not even save on its characteristics, so both photos and videos are of decent quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu pro 7 plus black" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2101054.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  The review of Meizu Pro 7 Plus (64Gb / 128 Gb) has come to an end.  Summing up, I would like to highlight the main advantages and disadvantages.  To do this, you need to refer to the reviews of the owners.  They say that the indisputable advantages are: </p><ul><li>  The original appearance of the smartphone. </li><li>  High-quality main screen. </li><li>  Powerful hardware platform. </li><li>  Convenient corporate interface. </li><li>  High resolution cameras. </li><li>  The presence of the option of fast charging the battery </li><li>  Additional screen. </li></ul><p>  By and large, the device has no bright minuses.  The only thing to complain about is the lack of optical stabilization and stereo speakers. </p>
