Prices, installation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concept of dividing air conditioners into several units has long and successfully been used by major manufacturers involved in the development of HVAC equipment.  Recently, segmentation of this niche has been observed.  If before the classic monoblock model was the main competitor of split systems, today there is a struggle for a buyer within a segment.  The rivalry on the market is between devices involving the creation of holes in the wall, and the technology that the channel split system in the standard version represents.  Such units do not have many design differences, but they have a serious impact on technical and operational capabilities. </p><h2>  Features of duct air conditioning </h2>

    <p>  First of all, it should be emphasized the main difference between such plants from the traditional monoblock form factor.  It is expressed in the fact that the design forms several components.  Typically, a channel split system involves the interaction between the evaporative and compressor modules.  At the same time, the implementation of multi-constructions is allowed, in which there can be several indoor units. </p><p>  Actually, the classic split system has the same characteristics.  But, unlike her, the installation of channel equipment is not done through the wall, but in the shaft of the duct.  For example, <span>the Mitsubishi</span> channel <span>split system</span> in some versions involves laying an air passage through its own air duct, while also using third-party climate equipment.  That is, the technique can be supplemented with the help of a communication shaft by conventional split-systems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Installation of ducted air conditioners </h2>

    <p>  The evaporator, as a rule, is represented by a cassette unit, which is mounted in a hidden manner.  This is another feature that distinguishes channel installations from conventional split systems.  This decision is due to the fact that the duct itself involves the provision of space in the above-ceiling niche, and its operation is accompanied by noise.  For this reason, it is advisable to use hidden cassette units.  Also, the channel split system provides a track device that provides the connection between the evaporator and the compressor-condenser.  Typically, such mines are formed by copper pipes, through which refrigerant passes during the operation of the equipment.  It is noteworthy that such channels operate parallel to the ventilation passages through which the internal module is also supplied with air flows. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2>

    <p>  The internal segment of the structure is provided by street air, after which these flows are distributed throughout the room with the help of a fan integrated in the unit.  It should be noted that before the release of air masses, they are processed in the evaporation module.  In the modern version, the channel-type split system can both heat and cool the air in accordance with the specified microclimate values.  In this part, the principle of operation of such installations is similar to traditional air conditioners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should also be noted the features possessed by installations operating on water heat supply.  In the usual configuration, it is assumed to use electric heaters for heating, but in this case, a water base is used to regulate the temperature regime.  Regardless of the technical implementation, a channel-type split system provides efficient filtering.  Since the design involves working with air masses in large volumes, cleaning is carried out in several stages. </p><h2>  Installation Rules </h2>

    <p>  The external unit can be installed in a hinged position using brackets, or with support for a special stand.  Next, the most crucial part is performed - laying the power cable and the route for supplying freon.  Along with this, air ducts are installed, on the basis of which the split system will work.  The instruction recommends that you provide proper heat and moisture insulation of these channels in advance, since condensate in the places of laying negatively affects the materials used. </p><p>  It is equally important to initially calculate the duct branching grid itself.  If you plan a simple system that includes two units, then installation will not cause special difficulties.  For example, the route will assume only one direction, and the installation performer will only need to choose the most rational path.  In turn, the channel multi-split system requires preliminary preparation of the installation diagram.  In this configuration, several modules can be used, which complicates the laying of routes and air ducts. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of ducted air conditioners </h2><p>  Among the undoubted advantages of such models, it is worth noting the high performance and rational consumption of energy resources.  The ability to install several evaporative units with one central compressor is much more cost-effective than installing the same number of monoblock air conditioners.  If we talk about the shortcomings, the channel split system is very demanding on the design and installation.  The installation process is quite complicated and, as a rule, it is performed by specialists.  There is also a drawback in the form of noisy work, although in recent models there is a minimization of this factor. </p><h2>  Channel Systems Manufacturers </h2>

    <p>  The complexity of the channel installations led to a certain specificity of the segment of similar technology.  Nevertheless, the choice is quite diverse both in the public sector and at a high level.  Leading positions are held by companies such as Daikin, Toshiba and Fujitsu.  The first-class products also include the Mitsubishi channel split system, presented by the Mr.  Slim  As for the entry-level equipment, it is represented by the brands Electrolux, Ballu, Midea and others. </p><h2>  Price issue </h2><p>  Large-scale projects involving the equipping of private houses, offices and industrial buildings with climatic equipment, of course, require serious financial investments.  Nevertheless, the conversion of the initial costs into performance indicators justifies all the costs that the split system requires.  The price of the equipment itself varies on average from 40 to 60 thousand rubles.  The exact amount depends on the number of indoor units, the technological level of technology, power and functional content. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Channel installations for conditioning for a reason are considered by specialists as semi-professional.  The ability to provide optimal microclimate indicators for large areas is most valued in such equipment.  For apartments and small private houses, such a split system is rarely used.  The price is 40-60 thousand rubles.  also does not contribute to the widespread dissemination of such technology among ordinary consumers.  But in providing buildings, office premises, enterprises, shopping malls and public institutions, channel air conditioning manifests itself in the best way.  Firstly, such systems provide high performance indicators, and secondly, they are distinguished by their availability in maintenance and maintenance. </p>
