Every year, large fashion designers organize shows of their collections.  This year 2011 has acquired a new trend, which was not observed in the last spring-summer season.  If last year boyish outfits were popular, today femininity has returned to fashion.  In this regard, knitted dresses will be especially relevant.  And that is why those outfits that you tied up a couple of years ago, but fell into the closet for the sole reason that it was not fashionable, can take on a new life.  Models of various knitted dresses will hang in stores.  But what if you try to knit a beautiful knitted <span>dress with your own hands?</span>  Think hard?

The models are different, as well as the technique of their execution.  In this article, I will reveal the little secret of how to quickly and easily crochet a dress. </p><p>  Our grandmothers and great-grandmothers were also able to crochet.  At the same time, everything turned out so cool for them that they looked in their outfits no worse than modern fashionistas.  Today, of course, not everyone uses a hook, I would even say that such skilled craftsmen can be counted on the fingers.  Although, in fact, <span>crocheting a</span> dress will not be difficult if you learn such basic things as a hook, types of patterns and patterns.  <span>Crocheting dresses for dresses</span> can always be found on the Internet, by the way, there is also a lot of information on how to learn to knit.  So, if you wish, you can master all the equipment very quickly.  Crocheting a dress is not so difficult.
