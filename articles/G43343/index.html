Its area is 65.4 km <sup>2</sup> , and its length is only 22 km.  Nevertheless, it is one of the largest resorts in this part of the peninsula. </p><h2>  Where is Evpatoria </h2><p>  Evpatoria is 65 kilometers from Simferopol, you can get to it by train, train, bus or car.  Buses are easy to find - they stand across the road from the station, depart every 20 minutes and go to the Evpatoria bus station, which is also located near the railway.  After 21.00 it is best to order a taxi, since minibuses no longer run.  The city is located in the steppe of the Crimean peninsula on the shores of the Gulf of Kalamitsky, in this area there are no mountains and hills.  Height above sea level - about 10 meters.  In the place where Evpatoria is located, the best sandy beaches of Crimea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is Evpatoria" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1399732.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City climate </h2><p>  It has a unique climate: coastal-steppe, moderately dry, warm, without sharp changes in temperature and pressure.  The air, filled with the aroma of steppe grasses, is constantly changing, thanks to the monsoons and good purging of the flat terrain.  On three sides, the city of Yevpatoriya is washed by reservoirs: the Black Sea from the south, <span>Lake Sasyk-Sivash</span> from the east and <span>Lake Moinaki</span> with a series of estuaries - from the west.  There are more sunny days in this town than in other resorts of the peninsula.  The sea is clean, warms up quickly, the difference in depth is smooth.  The climate in the place where Yevpatoria is located is compared with the best resorts in Italy and France. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Evpatoria" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1399724.jpg"></div>

This is a unique building, built in 1953 by the architect A.N.  Dushkina.  Previously, when the Moscow-Yevpatoriya train left here, music always played.  In 2003, in honor of the 2500th anniversary celebrated by the city of Yevpatoriya, a sculptural composition ‚ÄúBirth of Kerkinitida‚Äù was established near the station (Kerkinitida is the Greek name for the city).  The author portrayed her as a little girl blowing a horn in a sea shell lying on the backs of dolphins.  Frunze street begins from the station, along which the famous single-track trams run.  It leads to the park of the same name, from which you can get to the beach. </p><h2>  Walk around the city </h2><p>  From the park to them.  Frunze road leads to the promenade to them.  Gorky, where vacationers like to walk.  She goes along the seashore along the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãYevpatoria to the street.  Duvanovskaya, which is one of the main city attractions.  Going a little further, you can go to Theater Square, where various city holidays and concerts are often held.  Many streets of Yevpatoriya with their names alone can tell about the composition of its urban population: Karaites lived on Karaite, gypsies in Gypsy Slobodka.  It is easy to guess what was on the Police or Birzhevoy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Evpatoria" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1399728.jpg"></div>

After walking along it from the square, you can again go to the embankment to them.  Gorky or go west along the passage A. Akhmatova, who lived in the house of the merchant Paschalidi.  If you turn south here, then along Pionerskaya Street you can get to the school of young sailors.  Nearby will be the building of the Selvinsky Gymnasium and the Golden Key Children's Theater - a unique project where children play all roles in the performances, they also create sets, sew costumes and engage in various sections. </p><p>  If you walk past the post office building, you can get to the Tereshkova embankment.  Here begins the route ‚ÄúSmall Jerusalem‚Äù and there are many architectural monuments: the Khan‚Äôs mosque Khan-Jami, the largest cathedral in Crimea - Nikolaev, the Greek Cathedral of St.  Elijah, two synagogues and more.  A little further, next to the bakery, you can see the restored part of the fortress gates of the medieval city of Gozlev, and on the opposite side of the street - Tekie dervishes. </p><h2>  Moinaki Lake </h2><p>  Walking along the narrow streets of the Old Town, you can catch one of the famous Yevpatoriya trams and get to the healing lake Moinaki.  Recently, due to human intervention, the ecosystem of this formerly famous mud lake has been disrupted.  The place where Evpatoria is located has always been famous for the healing properties of its brine and mud.  But, starting from the nineties, they began to gradually disappear, as a result of which Evpatoria could lose the glory of a balneological resort.  The mud baths, for which it was once impossible to get into treatment, were neglected for a long time.  In 2015, it was decided to restore the dilapidated building of the recreation complex and the adjacent territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="streets of Yevpatoriya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/1400023.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are many museums, historical monuments and places of military glory in Yevpatoria.  Let it not be difficult to go around the entire resort in a few days, there is always something new and exciting here that you could not imagine before.  Even the locals know far from everything about their homeland and each time they discover their beloved city again and again for themselves from a new, previously unknown side. </p>
