The beach here has a length of 14 kilometers, however, despite this, there are also a lot of hotels, ranging from budget to luxury and expensive suites.  Of course, we simply cannot describe all the hotels in Zakynthos.  Therefore, we will tell you only about a few, the most popular.  Let's look at those places where tourists come most willingly.  It will be useful to say that the hotels of Zakynthos 1 beach line are in great demand.  Here the window offers a beautiful view, and the beach is not far away.

As a tourist, you have a great opportunity to watch these amazing creatures and find turtle masonry on the shore.

Zakynthos.  And a little about prices </h2><p>  As a rule, most tourists come directly from the capital of Greece - Athens.  You will be expected to take about 6 hours by bus, although you need to take a ferry for some time.  In total, you will have to pay about 20-25 euros for the road, which, in principle, is not much, but it is only one way.  You will arrive at the central bus station, which is located in Zakynthos.  From here you will begin your independent journey through the city.  In principle, no one forbids you to go around the coastline of the island, which lasts only 120 kilometers.  As for the cost of food, they are average for this region and are unlikely to cause you problems.  Nevertheless, if you are planning a budget vacation in Zakynthos, then it is easier to buy products on the market and cook on your own, rather than buy the exact same dish in a restaurant or cafe.  If you live in a 5 * hotel, then you do not need to buy anything, everything will be offered. </p><h2>  Relax at the 3-star Anemomilos Studios </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece vacation zakynthos" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/481647.jpg" width="380"></div></h2><p>  This hotel is located in close proximity to the sea, in the city of Vasilikos.  Walking walk literally 2 minutes.  The territory is very pleasant and cozy.  Around the hotel there is a lot of greenery and there is a small pool with umbrellas and sunbeds.  In the immediate vicinity there is a bar and restaurant.  Every day, a maid will visit your room to change bed linen, as it should be for hotels of this rank.  In principle, there is everything that an ordinary person needs for a good and good rest.  If you want to cook for yourself, then for this the room has a kitchen with all necessary equipment.  In addition, there is air conditioning, TV and telephone.  This hotel has 4 types of rooms.  Starting from small Studios with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã19 square meters and ending with Superior - 55 square meters each.  meters.  For this simple reason, everyone will find a place here, regardless of the thickness of the wallet. </p><h2>  What should be a good hotel in Zakynthos </h2><p>  An unequivocal answer cannot be given to this question.  Each tourist comes to the island with his goals: someone for outdoor activities, and someone for a relaxing holiday.  The same applies to hotels, because they are so different - hotels on the island.  Zakynthos (Greece) is worried about its tourists, so there is a very rich selection.  Some are more suitable for lovers of the sea, the second for people who like extreme sports, and still others for travelers.  Nevertheless, there are several basic criteria that any hotel on the island must meet.  Firstly, it is a clean and clean area, and secondly, polite staff, it is good if there are people among the staff who speak your native language.  Do not forget that the room must have air conditioning or a minimum fan.  This is due to the fact that it can be very hot, and the presence of such equipment will greatly simplify your life.  Again, it is far from always foreseen to stay with children, and if there is a nanny, you need to carefully watch how this person is managing your child. </p><h2>  A few important points </h2><p>  If you come for a long time, then do not be lazy and find where the map of Greece with islands is for sale.  This way you can travel on your own.  Greece is good because transport is very inexpensive here, so for tourists it is a real paradise.  Between the islands of the Ionian archipelago, you will travel on a special boat with other tourists and return back to your hotel in the same way.  Do not forget to bring a camera with you and keep it charged all the time, because no one knows when you will see a 150-kilogram Carriage-Carriage.
