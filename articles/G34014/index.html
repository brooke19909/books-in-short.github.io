It is located at the junction of climatic zones, historical civilizations and national cultures.  It is about the peoples and traditions of the region that will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Demographic information </h2><p>  About 5 million 300 thousand people live in the Krasnodar Territory.  Almost all the peoples of Russia live here: Tatars, Chuvashs, Bashkirs, etc. Of these, 5 million 200 thousand people are citizens of the Russian Federation.  They live like foreigners - 12.6 thousand.  With dual citizenship - 2.9 thousand.  Persons without any citizenship - 11.5 thousand people. </p><p>  The number of inhabitants is constantly growing.  The influx of migrants contributes to this.  Housing in the region is in great demand.  People move here for permanent residence.  This is due to the mild climate of the region. </p><p>  There are 26 cities, 13 large settlements and 1725 other small rural settlements in the region.  The ratio of urban to <span>rural residents is</span> approximately 52 to 48 percent.  Almost 34% of the urban population lives in four large cities: Sochi, <span>Krasnodar, Novorossiysk</span> and Armavir. </p><h2>  Alloy of different nations <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peoples living in the Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1430898.jpg" width="537"></div></h2><p>  The peoples living in the Krasnodar Territory are about 150 nationalities.  The main ethnic groups inhabiting the Kuban: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Russians - 86.5%. </li><li>  Armenians - 5.4%. </li><li>  Ukrainians - 1.6%. </li><li>  Tatars - 0.5%. </li><li>  Others - 6%. </li></ul><p>  The main part of the population, as can be seen from the list, is made up of Russians.  Smaller ethnic groups live compactly in small areas.  These are, for example, Greeks, Tatars, Armenians.  In the Krasnodar Territory, they mainly live on the coast and adjacent territories. </p><h2>  Kuban Cossacks <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="traditions of the peoples of the Krasnodar Territory" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1430287.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The historical class of Cossacks today is preparing for the army of future conscripts, military-patriotic education of youth, the protection of important facilities in the region, the maintenance of public order.  Without them, all the peoples of the Krasnodar Territory no longer imagine life.  their role is huge in maintaining order in the region. </p><h2>  The uniqueness of the land of the Kuban </h2><p>  The traditions of the peoples of the Krasnodar Territory are very peculiar.  Everyone who considers himself a Cossack must follow the long traditions and instructions of experienced people who are faithful to the work of their ancestors.  Of course, it is difficult to list all the cultural features of the Kuban.  There are a lot of traditions and customs.  And they all differ in rationality and beauty.  But we will try to tell about the most interesting. </p><h2>  Construction and home improvement <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peoples living in the Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1431346.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  For the Cossacks, the construction of a home is one of the most important events in life.  Each family was helped to build a house by almost the whole world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This, according to the Kuban Cossacks, binds the people together, and therefore makes them stronger.  According to this principle, tourist houses were built. </p><p>  Before construction began, scraps of dog, sheep, chicken feathers, etc., were thrown around the perimeter of the future housing area.  This was done so that livestock was found in the house. </p><p>  Then poles were dug into the ground, they were intertwined with a vine among themselves.  When the frame was ready, they called all friends and neighbors so that they would be the first to make the "hut" at home. </p><p>  They covered the walls with clay mixed with straw.  A cross was driven into the corner of the ‚Äúfront‚Äù to bless the house and its inhabitants.  Smeared housing in 3 layers, the last of which was mixed with manure. </p><p>  Such houses were considered the warmest and ‚Äúkindest‚Äù not only in terms of building quality, but also due to the positive energy of people who helped build.  After the construction was completed, the hosts arranged gatherings with refreshments.  It was a kind of gratitude for the help, in return for the modern cash payment. </p>

    <p>  The interior decoration was almost the same for all residents of the Kuban.  The house had two rooms.  There was a stove in the little one.  Wooden benches almost the entire length of the room and a huge table.  This spoke of the large families and hospitality.  In the large room were chests, a chest of drawers and other furniture.  As a rule, it was made to order.  The main place in the house was the red corner - a table or shelf, lined with icons and decorated with towels and paper flowers.  Candles, prayer books, Easter dishes, memorial books were stored here. </p><p>  Towels are a traditional Kuban decoration of housing.  A flap of fabric tied with lace, with a cross-stitch or satin stitch pattern. </p><p>  The traditions of the peoples of the Krasnodar Territory go deep into antiquity.  They honor their ancestors and try to instill culture and traditions in their children.  A very popular part of the Kuban interior is photographs on the walls.  It was considered <span>a heirloom.</span>  The photo depicted important events in the life of the family. </p><h2>  Cossack clothes </h2><p>  Men's wardrobe consisted of a military and casual suit.  Military uniform - a dark Circassian woman, the same cloth of trousers, a cap, a beshmet, a hat, a winter cloak and boots. </p><p>  Women's clothing consisted mainly of a cotton or wool skirt assembly at the waist for puffiness and a blouse with long sleeves and buttons trimmed with lace manually.  The importance of clothing in the Cossacks was of great importance.  It was believed that the more beautiful the clothes, the clearer they indicate status in society. </p>
