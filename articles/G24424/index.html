It was opened in September last year in the city of the same name in the Experimental Field microdistrict. </p><h2>  Importance to the public </h2><p>  Anyone who was worried about the question of where the Kotelniki metro exits could now use the passage in Vykhino-Zhulebina, as well as in Gorodok B of the Lyubertsy district. </p><p>  The development of this paragraph was a very important step for the infrastructure of the region as a whole.  High-tech <span>transport hub</span> are Kotelniki.  The metro, the opening of which enriched the city with a second station, which operates directly outside Moscow (there is also the Mayakinino), greatly facilitated the lives of people.  Many from the suburbs need to get to the center.  In addition, when we find out where the Kotelniki metro exits will be, we see that there is a connection with the capital and the outskirts.  Similar functions are performed by Novokosino.  But the main highlight is that once you get on the transport that supplies the Kotelniki metro station, you can find yourself in one of three whole cities. </p>

    <h2>  Project </h2><p>  In May 2012, a resolution of the metropolitan government was signed by the head of the city.  In accordance with it, they planned the construction and launch of the Kotelniki metro station.  How quickly this plan is being implemented was controlled by M. Khusnullin, deputy mayor who is involved in urban planning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Beginning in October of the same 2012, the issue of the project, according to which the Kotelniki metro station was to be commissioned in the future, was taken up by one of the SK MOST divisions.  They began work on the construction of part of the line.  Its development was supposed to be a fragment, stretching from Zhulebino to the very points where the exits of the Kotelniki metro would be.  It was planned to lay tracks 900 meters long. The station was built in an open type.  The complex itself was supposed to occupy 374 m. We decided to arrange the turn-around deadlocks for 246 m. ‚Äã‚ÄãThe tunnels on both sides were held with the assistance of a special complex that examined the proper operation of the project. </p><p>  Knowing about such large-scale works, people were eager to visit Kotelniki.  The metro, which opened in September 2015, gathered a large number of passengers. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  At this station point there are columns with two spans.  It is not laid down deeply.  It goes into the earth‚Äôs depths by only 15 m. It is similar to ‚ÄúZhulebino‚Äù, but it is decorated in a completely different way. </p><p>  The eyes of passengers are encouraged by the bright colors of the local design, the elements of the composition have rounded shapes.  The ceiling is straightforward and even.  Under your feet you will see red granite.  In 2010-2013, the plan for the developers was matured, according to which Zhubelino was then built.  They wanted to make walls of green and blue tones and another form of columns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now the decoration of the station includes elements of marble and granite.  Here prevail calm soft and bright colors.  Stainless steel is also used, from which the original inserts were made. </p><p>  Here you can get into one of the underground vestibules that the Kotelniki metro has.  Exits from the subway are just in each of these rooms. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  The path that lies to the north-west is located at Zhulebino district number 6. You can also get to City B from here.  Passing east, you can find yourself on the highway Novoryazansky.  In the future there will be TPU, to which access will also be opened. </p><p>  In the construction we used several interesting innovations, which in the future can be used in other points of the Moscow metro.  Once in the lobby, you can go to one of the vending machines and buy the products that you like.  Basically it is aromatic coffee, hearty snacks, delicious ice cream. </p><p>  The most interesting novelty is the device with which you can wrap the umbrella in polyethylene.  Having passed through the entrance turnstile, you can read data from your bank card. </p><p>  The authorities plan to build a connection between the local point and the Novoryazanskoye highway, where buses stopping for long-distance directions can stop.  In addition, the project has parking for cars of intercepting type.  On both sides, free ground will be left for this, in which two extra entrances could be built. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting details </h2><p>  Also, two automatic devices were installed here, with the help of which everyone can recharge their mobile device, if it is discharged at the most inopportune moment for this.  However, people took this innovation not very gratefully, so after the acts of vandalism in November last year, the device had to be dismantled.  But it was very convenient to use four machine sockets, different ports and cable connections. </p><p>  From the very beginning, there were two types of signs: the new and the old.  However, the initial plan is fundamentally different from what is in this place today.  So there are only old signs. </p><h2>  Reason for the delay </h2><p>  At first they wanted to launch this item in 2013, but there were some problems.  This was due to landowners who are nearby.  Also that they decided to finish in the fall of 2014.  However, the disagreements did not exhaust themselves, so I had to delay. </p>

After the bickering between the businessman and the state authorities, they still managed to gain the opportunity to deploy work here.
