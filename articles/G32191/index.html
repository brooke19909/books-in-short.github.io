The local population calls it the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady, it is the main temple for all Catholics of the Principality.  This <span>cathedral,</span> built at the end of the 19th century on the site of the ancient church of St. Nicholas, continues to practice the traditions and beliefs of old Christians. </p><h2>  History and traditions </h2><p>  In Monaco, the Cathedral of St. Nicholas was erected in 1875 on the same spot where the ancient church, which was destroyed in the 13th century, once stood.  For the construction of the building, a special white stone was used - limestone, imported to the country from France, located in the neighborhood.  This limestone has special properties: usually the blocks are grayish in color, but whiten under the influence of moisture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Catholic Cathedral in Monaco" class="if uuid-2542419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2542419.jpg"></div><p>  The tradition of the locals to come here to pray when it rains is associated with this unusual quality.  The walls of the cathedral at this time become snow-white, and parishioners believe that water falling from heaven is washing away sins from their souls just as it washes the walls of the temple.  Life as if begins with a clean slate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="walkandalie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The white walls of the Cathedral in Monaco" class="if uuid-2542415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2542415.jpg"></div><p>  In 1960, 3 bells were placed in the Cathedral of St. Nicholas, each of which received a name: they are called Nicole, Devota and the Immaculate Virgin Mary.  Bishop Gilles Bart blessed the bells.  In 1997, another 1 bell was added to the top of the building, which also received a name - it was named Benedict. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  External and internal decoration </h2><p>  Cathedral of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker was built in the Neo-Romanesque style, very popular in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  This style is characterized by individual features of Gothic, Art Nouveau and Renaissance.  It differs from the Romanesque style in the simpler design of arches, window and doorways.  Outside the temple is decorated with graceful Corinthian columns, winged lions, stone slabs depicting biblical subjects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rvch.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior of St. Nicholas Cathedral" class="if uuid-2542441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2542441.jpg"></div><p>  The interior is no less surprising: the high walls are decorated with images of angels, prophets and Mary with the newborn Jesus in her arms.  In the center is the iconostasis and the episcopal throne carved from white Carrara marble, and on both sides of it there are lodges intended for the monarch and his family.  The central mosaic depicts the Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus, St. Peter, the prophet Isaiah, the archangels Gabriel and Michael, as well as another 26 faces of other saints located one step lower. </p><p>  Window openings are decorated with elaborate stained-glass windows with exquisite images of Mary and Jesus.  Stained-glass windows are inserted in the windows, showing plots from the life of Christ and the Mother of God.  From the old church of the 13th century, instead of which the temple was erected, four altars were preserved, three of which were made under the direction of Francois Brea ‚Äî the famous painter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some walls of the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Monaco are decorated with precious <span>Carrara marble,</span> hung with paintings by artists, many of which are rare and extremely expensive.  Experts in the field of art do not need explanation, but for everyone else there is a special plate next to each canvas and sculpture, on which the author, the time of creation and a brief history of the work are indicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paintings in St. Nicholas Cathedral, Monaco" class="if uuid-2542424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2542424.jpg"></div><p>  In 1987, the restoration of the choirs was carried out here.  For this, parts of the old altar made of Carrara marble and decorated with unique ancient mosaics were used. </p><p>  Representatives of the Grimaldi dynasty are buried on the territory of St. Nicholas Cathedral in Monaco.  These sovereign princes ruled Monaco for over seven hundred years.  The thirteenth prince of this dynasty, Rainier III, deceased in 2005, is also buried here.  Princess Grace Kelly found peace in the walls of the Cathedral. </p><h2>  Large organ </h2><p>  A large organ is the real pride of the temple.  12 years after the construction of the building, the first tool was installed in 1887, but in 1922 it was completely replaced with a new one.  In 1968, the organ was improved, and in 2009, a complete reconstruction and restoration was carried out.  Connoisseurs of organ music coming to the annual festival are very fond of the amazing sounds of this instrument. </p><h2>  Where is St. Nicholas Cathedral </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.730679" data-lng="7.421402199999989" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/3/6/2/4362.png"></div><p>  The magnificent building is located at the following address: Monaco, rue Colonel Bellando de Castro, 4. Entrance for visitors is completely free, but the doors are not always open.  Solemn Catholic services are held here exclusively on the days of major Christian holidays, as well as on Prince‚Äôs Day, which coincides with the Day of Monaco on November 19. </p>
