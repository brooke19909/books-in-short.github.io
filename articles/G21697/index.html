The same day is a day of remembrance of the victims, the cause of which was the infamous seizure of the school.  Beslan, this small Ossetian city, has become a symbol of the most terrible and inhuman actions of political fanatics.  In the article we recall the main events of this tragic day. </p><h2>  School takeover <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beslan school capture" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/325325.jpg" width="410"></div></h2><p>  Beslan, like all other Russian cities, was preparing to open a new school year on September 1, 2004.  At the local school number 1, a ceremonial line traditionally took place.  The event was attended by schoolchildren of all ages, as well as their parents and teachers.  The celebration was interrupted by an unexpected machine gun burst.  A group of three dozen people approached the school building and announced the seizure of the school.  Beslan, who quickly spread the news, was dumbfounded.  Having caused panic, terrorists with threats drove more than a thousand people to school, after which they quickly closed all the entrances and exits of the building in order to cut off escape routes.  Only a few escaped captivity </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beslan city school seizure" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/325326.jpg" width="500"></div>  dozens of high school students (from 50 to 150) who managed to take advantage of the turmoil and escape from the school yard.  During the hostage-taking, two civilians and one terrorist were killed.  Having driven people into the main premises of the school, the militants took away all their video and photo equipment, as well as mobile phones, after which they barricaded the exits from the building with tables.  For greater reliability, explosives were deployed throughout the school, through which the invaders subsequently threatened negotiators.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beslan captivity </h2><p>  After that, the hardest and most terrible hours and days of captivity in the school of the town of Beslan began for the hostages.  The capture of the school accounts of eyewitnesses illuminate in the blackest colors.  Terrorists from the very beginning shot several strong adult men and high school students who could be a danger to them.  Already on the first day, two dozen people were killed: for refusing to kneel before the terrorists, for talking, for not following orders, and so on.  In addition, the survivors subsequently spoke of the many tortures, rapes and bullying that accompanied the seizure of the school.  Beslan instantly became the center of attention of the entire Russian and world community.  Already at 16.00 at school the first explosion thundered, which claimed the lives of several hostages. </p><h2>  Second day of captivity </h2><p>  Only on the afternoon of September 2, the former <span>president of Ingushetia,</span> Ruslan Aushev, was allowed to enter the school.  He became the only negotiator with whom </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beslan school grabbing stories" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/325324.jpg" width="390"></div>  the terrorists agreed to have a conversation.  Of course, at the same time, the federal forces of the FSB and the Ministry of Emergencies were also sent to the city of Beslan.  The seizure of the school, according to militants, was carried out with the aim of forcing the Russian government to recognize the independence of Chechnya.  Aushev managed to persuade the terrorists to release 24 people - mothers with babies.  However, the militants did not wait for the fulfillment of their conditions.  After leaving the school of the former president, the invaders, who had not fed or watered people for more than a day, were completely brutalized, tightening their attitude.  On the morning of September 3, exhausted people, losing consciousness and suffering from hallucinations, simply stopped responding to the demands of the terrorists.  The latter responded with new executions.  On the same day, two more explosions thundered in the gym premises, which claimed the lives of some hostages.

    <h2>  School assault </h2><p>  Explosions and new killings became the last line of patience for security officials.  On the afternoon of September 3, the storming of the school began.  Terrorists showed fierce resistance, not disdaining to use hostages as human shields.  As a result of the assault, all the militants were killed, except for one, which was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.  In addition, only 334 people died, including 186 children. </p>
