    <h2>  Hasbro - not simple children's toys </h2><p>  Hasbro is a world-renowned toy manufacturer who is constantly expanding its collection of offers, replenishing it with innovative developments and ideas. </p><p>  This brand has existed for many decades and is currently one of the leaders in the global market for children's products.  Following the wishes of customers, Hasbro is constantly improving.  One of the most striking new products released into serial production is the Play-Doh brand.  These are sets of plasticine created using unique technologies.  Its soft texture, variety of colors and beautiful presentation are the factors that made Play-Doh creativity kits very popular among children.  They stimulate not only the introduction of kids of different ages to manual work, but they are also wonderful, and most importantly - safe material that is interesting to work with. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another, but no less interesting direction of the manufacturer is the DohVinci series.  The creativity kit for this brand will captivate the child for a long time, leaving not only a memory of the game, but also a souvenir dear to the heart. </p><h2>  What is DohVinci? </h2><p>  Children love needlework, but over time, the usual modeling, drawing and mosaic become boring, do not deliver as much pleasure as before.  Yes, and a rather meager selection of material colors greatly limits imagination.  Hasbro DohVinci creativity kit is able to radically change the attitude of children and their parents to needlework.  What is it that hides a colorful box in itself - another boring game, or something amazing? </p>

    <h2>  Boys also love to create! </h2><p>  Often, boys are protected from a variety of creative activities, considering them the lot of girls.  But this is the wrong tactic - boys no less than their girlfriends like to craft something with their own hands.  Of course, they are unlikely to like a frankly girlish-filled set, but DohVinci also presents the Design Studio series.  This is a wonderful collection of fantastic accessories that will decorate a little man‚Äôs room - a real alchemical flask, a mixer for mixing plasticine of different colors and decorative plates on which the boys are happy to apply magnificent patterns.  The resulting products can also be a wonderful and original gift to a classmate or mother for the holiday. </p><h2>  How to encourage a child to be creative? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the rapid development and popularization of the Internet, a variety of interactive games did not pass by children even of a very young age.  But if a mother can still interest a baby with joint gatherings for drawing or modeling, then introducing a school-age child to needlework becomes a real problem.  It is necessary to offer him something really amazing and exciting, and most importantly - unusual, then he will suddenly forget about everything in the world.  Numerous reviews by parents and needleworkers themselves say that DohVinci is a set for creativity that can make children forget about computer games, cartoons and even time. </p>

    <p>  But creativity with the help of soft plasticine DohVinci is not limited to creating one set.  In stores additional cartridges with a mass of different colors are sold, the number of its shades is simply huge, in addition, it can be with glitter.  It is simple to find application for such a material, because it can be used to decorate any workpiece (caskets, frames for photographs or embroidery, beautiful pictures).  A great example of the design of the work can be a set for the work of DohVinci "Photo Frame Flower Tower.  This is a wonderful triptych frame for photographs of a child, which will help to adequately frame shots with events or people that are significant to him. </p><h2>  We create together! </h2><p>  Any yoke will become even more interesting and exciting if the child is passionate about it with parents or friends.  A fun and relaxed pastime is the key to harmonious and comprehensive development.  It is very important to allow children not only to study or play sports, but also to let them realize their creative potential. </p>
