Moniatis ‚Äù, we offer you the generalized comments of our compatriots who have already been here.  Looking ahead a bit, we note that in general, most of the guests were satisfied with this hotel.  There are also not quite positive reviews, which, most likely, are a consequence of the fact that when planning a trip, tourists did not familiarize themselves with the features of this hotel, as a result of which their expectations were not fully justified.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  As for the hotel rooms, in general, travelers were satisfied with them.  So, according to them, the situation here is quite simple, but at the same time comfortable.  Furniture and appliances are in good condition, there is everything that is necessary for life.  Experienced travelers recommend, if possible, asking the administrator to put you in their rooms with mountain views.  According to them, in this case you can admire the magnificent landscape, which in its beauty can even compete with the sea.  No complaints were noticed about the cleaning, as well as changing clothes and towels.  The maids carry out their duties regularly and efficiently.  Due to the fact that the hotel has only 30 rooms, and it is located in a quiet place surrounded by beautiful nature, our compatriots thought it was very cozy and conducive to a calm and peaceful rest. </p>

    <p>  Some negative tourist reviews related to the location of M. Moniatis Hotel.  However, those who previously carefully read the hotel description and reviews about it were satisfied.  So, experienced travelers recommend this hotel mainly to those who arrive in Cyprus by their own car or plan to rent it here.  After all, "M.  Moniatis ‚Äùis located at a sufficient distance from the sea.  So, a walk to the nearest beach will take about half an hour.  You can get to the beach or to the nearest settlements by bus.  However, according to experienced travelers, it is much easier to do this by car.  By the way, renting a <span>car in Cyprus for a</span> long period will cost quite inexpensively (an average of 20-30 euros per day).  In addition, having a car at your disposal, you can save a lot on the cost of excursions, having traveled independently all the interesting places and attractions of Cyprus in a schedule convenient for you.  By the way, if you are traveling by car, then you will not have to go to the beach closest to the hotel.  You can choose a beach to your taste, especially since in Cyprus there is plenty to choose from. </p><p>  As a rule, the issue of food in hotels is the subject of heated debate among tourists.  An exception was not M. Moniatis Hotel.  There are various reviews of nutrition in it.  So, someone thought that the food is too monotonous.  However, many travelers claim that counting on a wide selection of dishes in a small three-star hotel of economy class in principle does not make sense.  According to them, the food here was tasty and of high quality.  In addition, experienced travelers note the fact that there are several supermarkets near the hotel (one of them is open around the clock) with a large selection of products, a bakery where delicious pastries are prepared, as well as cafes and restaurants.  Therefore, if you want to diversify your menu, then there will be no problems with this. </p><p>  The tourists and the hotel staff also had positive impressions.  So, all the employees of M.  Moniatis ‚Äùare friendly, welcoming and always happy to help guests.  However, our compatriots note the fact that the staff of M. Moniatis Hotel does not speak Russian.  But many employees here speak excellent English, so remembering the basic principles of this language, you can easily explain. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that, according to tourists from Russia, who happened to stay at M.  Moniatis ‚Äù, this hotel fully justifies its price and category, is a good place for a relaxing, peaceful vacation surrounded by beautiful nature.  Especially people who come to Cyprus with their own car or plan to rent a car already on the island will like it here.  Also, our compatriots note that if the purpose of your vacation is exclusively a beach holiday without sightseeing trips, then it is better to find a hotel located closer to the sea. </p>
