    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Today, looking at the beauties of Tsaritsyno‚Äôs lands, hardly anyone can assume that in ancient times these places were discreetly called the Black Mud due to the healing springs and mud located there.  Pagans lived here - Vyatichi.  In the XVIII century, Tsar Peter the Great gave land to Prince Dmitry Kantemir.  The prince was from Moldova, a manor was built for him, and the Moldovans who settled around her planted gardens.  The first Tsaritsyno greenhouse arose precisely then. </p><p>  The last owner of the possessions of the Kantemirov clan was Prince Semyon.  It was from him that Catherine the Second acquired them, which was once helped by the healing mud of the local places.  The estate was renamed Tsaritsyno, to match its new owner.  The empress had huge plans for ownership - the construction of the Romanov residence. </p><p>  The most talented and eminent architects of that time, Vasily Bazhenov and Matvey Kazakov, were engaged in this project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greenhouse in tsaritsyno" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14919/1750074.jpg" width="374"></div>  The project was striking in its scale and grandeur.  But later Catherine lost interest in the estate, and besides, such a large-scale construction required considerable expenses.  It was possible to fully realize the architectural ideas of the great masters only by 2007.  And today anyone can enjoy the beauty of the museum-reserve.

And there are many reasons for this.  The estate was erected on the site of the ancient burial Vyatichi.  Confirmation of this was the mound, on the site of which the Kashirskoye highway now lies. </p><p>  Many people believe that these places are cursed, and more than once.  The first curse is attributed to the first wife of Tsar Basil - Solomonia.  She was exiled to the monastery and killed with her son on the orders of the second wife of the king.  The second time, the estate was cursed by Princess Maria, the daughter of <span>Dmitry Cantemir,</span> who was deeply unhappy living here.  Vasily Bazhenov, who designed the main buildings in Tsaritsyno, with the help of a local sorcerer, cast a spell on the estate, taking offense at the queen because she commissioned another architect to complete the construction. </p><p>  Since then, the estate was haunted by misfortunes.  Numerous fires prevented the organization of hospitals, schools, and museums there at different times.  Of course, there is no reliable confirmation of these legends.  However, some researchers in the history of the village are firmly convinced that the reason that the estate was empty for such a long time was precisely evil rock. </p><h2>  Arrangement of greenhouses </h2><p>  The first greenhouse Tsaritsyno <strong> </strong>  It was arranged in the middle of the eighteenth century by order of Prince Cantemir.  Empress Catherine the Great, having become the owner of the estate, ordered to expand the greenhouses.  Four gardeners left to care for the plants.  Initially, the greenhouses were wooden, and only in 1785 a stone complex was built. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in the Tsaritsyno greenhouses not only plants were grown, but also taught gardening of serfs.  The maintenance of greenhouses was a very lucrative affair; exotic fruits were grown there, which were served at the table of the nobility.  In addition, an extensive apple orchard grew in the estate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The Tsaritsyno greenhouse was constantly developing and expanding.  By 1804, two new buildings appeared, the collection of exotic plants was constantly replenished.  Thus, at the beginning of the 19th century the greenhouse in Tsaritsyno was considered one of the most extensive and richest in the world.  In the middle of the XIX century, greenhouses were leased, and the resulting crop filled the shelves of Moscow markets. </p><h2>  Manor decline </h2><p>  By 1820, the greenhouse <strong> </strong>  totaled eight cases.  The name of the greenhouses in Tsaritsyno was due to the plants growing there.  The Tsaritsyno complex included: </p><ul><li>  grape greenhouse; </li><li>  orange greenhouse; </li><li>  orangery greenhouse; </li><li>  peach greenhouse; </li><li>  pineapple greenhouse. </li></ul><p>  During the reign of Tsar Nicholas I, it was planned to demolish the dilapidated Tsaritsyno greenhouses and move the land to another place.  It was decided to move the greenhouses to Neskuchny Garden.  But the idea did not work out.  There was not enough space in that garden; moreover, the demolition of Tsaritsyn‚Äôs lands would lead to a significant increase in prices in Moscow markets.  The orangery greenhouse was abandoned, and most of the plants from it were transported to St. Petersburg. </p><p>  In 1858, on the initiative of Prince Trubetskoy, in whose department at that time greenhouses were located, an audit of the Tsaritsyno lands was carried out and it was concluded that the economy was unprofitable.  Greenhouses were fully leased.  Tenants often took turns; over time, greenhouses fell into decay. </p><h2>  The revival of the complex </h2><p>  By the end of the twentieth century, Tsaritsyno lost its former gloss and wealth, turning into a holiday village.  The revival of the complex began in 2007.  To restore the original appearance of the Tsaritsyno estate, it was necessary to study many historical documents and drawings. </p>

    <p>  It is important to note that the exposition of exotic plants was recreated according to the registry records that were kept under Catherine II.  Greenhouses were opened in 2011. </p><h2>  Museum of Tsaritsyno.  Greenhouses and palaces </h2><p>  The Museum-Reserve was reopened to visitors on Moscow City Day on September 2, 2007.  Tsaritsyno is located in the southeast of the capital, you can get there either by personal transport or by metro.  The nearest metro stations are Orekhovo and Tsaritsyno, the complex is a ten minute walk from them. </p><p>  The territory of the reserve is more than 400 hectares.  It has an extensive park with ponds, greenhouses and a palace ensemble.  The architectural palace ensemble included the restored buildings of the eighteenth century: three palaces, a bread house, a temple, as well as bridges and gates. </p><p>  Each of these buildings is a unique monument of architecture of the eighteenth century.  The entire ensemble is made in the style of pseudo-Gothic with elements of baroque and classicism.  Pavilions of Milovida and Nerastankino, the arbor of the Temple of Ceres and the ruin tower are located in the park. </p><h2>  Tsaritsyno today </h2><p>  Today, the museum-reserve is open for visitors to every visitor who wants to plunge into the Catherine era, get acquainted with exotic plants and enjoy the local landscapes.  The Tsaritsyno greenhouse conquers with an abundance of fresh greenery at any time of the year.  An innovation in the museum was a light singing fountain.  There was much debate about whether the fountain would fit into the landscape.  The decision was made in favor of its installation, and now visitors can also enjoy a great show. </p>
