    <h2>  Where is the gorge located? </h2><p>  <span>Guam Gorge</span> is located in the Krasnodar Territory.  The distance to it from Krasnodar itself is about 150 kilometers, from Gelendzhik - 250 kilometers.  The closest more or less large settlement is the city of Apsheronsk (50 kilometers).  The Caucasus Mountains are generally very majestic and beautiful.  But the Guam Gorge, which is a kind of vestibule to <span>the Lago-Naki plateau, is</span> especially stunning with its grandeur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather Guam Gorge" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/593984.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The gorge can be called an open-air botanical garden.  Many thermophilic plants of the most diverse species grow on its slopes.  It stretches for almost three kilometers: from the village of Mezmay to the village of Guamka.  The depth of the gorge is about 500 meters.  Outwardly, it looks like a deep crack in the ground.  Scientists believe that there was once a sea on this site, and after it there were limestone deposits that prevented the flow of mountain rivers from the Lago-Naki plateau.  Centuries passed, and the water gradually washed the gorge.  The Kurdzhips river rushes along its bottom swiftly, with a roar.  The gorge is also beautiful because the water washed all kinds of layers of rocks that have different colors.  In some places, waterfalls formed.  In winter, they freeze, forming an ice sheet on the walls of the gorge.  Rich vegetation is what the Guam Gorge can boast of.  Recreation facilities (Aquarius is one of the most popular) located near the gorge, also have landscaped courtyards with flower beds, trees and shrubs.  Therefore, urban residents who are not used to such lush greenery feel especially good here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Guam gorge.

    <p>  A similar source is a rarity.  The temperature of the water leaving the well reaches 85 degrees.  In the pool, it is much colder - 37 degrees.  It is advisable not to be in it for more than 10 minutes without a break.  Those who are not swimming for the first time, the duration of stay in the water can be increased.  The pool water is rich in various minerals: calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, fluoride ion.  Due to this composition, water has a therapeutic effect.  Sources are indicated for people with diseases of the nervous system and musculoskeletal system.  Water restrictions apply to people with heart and kidney disease. </p><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  You do not have to rely on a particularly economical vacation for those who came to the Guam Gorge.  Prices here are not lower than in other areas of the Krasnodar Territory.  As for the recreation center "Aquarius", the cost of a double house per day is 6 thousand rubles.  With the increase in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe house, the price rises.  So, a house for 9 people costs 12 thousand.  Do not forget about the two-story hotel in the recreation center.  Those who prefer rooms will have to pay 3,500 rubles for a double comfortable room.  Rest at the base without accommodation (including swimming at the source) will cost 500 rubles.  You can rent a gazebo with barbecue for 1000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guam gorge prices" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/593979.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  Why is it worth going to the Guam Gorge? </h2><p>  Firstly, the Guam Gorge (photos prove this) - the place is very picturesque.  There will be no shortage of entertainment here.  It is especially good to relax for those who like mountain landscapes and who like to walk along the slopes and breathe fresh air.  Secondly, according to tourists, in this place there is almost always excellent weather.  Guam Gorge is characterized by a favorable climate.  Mountains form a rather enclosed space with its own microclimate.  It's pretty wet here.  In summer it is not too hot, especially good in the gorge.  However, experienced travelers warn that you should avoid walking along the gorge in the rain.  Of course, nothing bad will happen, and you can always take refuge under the stone of the protruding rock.  But the fact is that even the slightest rain turns into a downpour: streams of rain flow down rocks and stones, so there is a lot of water here. </p><p>  Numerous positive reviews from tourists are attracting more and more people to the Guam Gorge.  Recreation facilities (Aquarius and others) are welcoming guests, the staff is very welcoming and friendly.  Among the shortcomings, tourists note quite high prices.  Also, not everything in the recreation center "Aquarius" is in proper form (the reviews mention broken bolts).  But in general, the impressions of vacationers are very good. </p>
