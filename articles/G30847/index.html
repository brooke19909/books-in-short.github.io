Therefore, as a given, there is a need for new scientists, a rethinking of events and approaches that are diametrically different from previous ones. </p><h2>  New historians </h2><p>  Any historical investigation can become a product of propaganda in the hands of the authorities, therefore, in order to more or less objectively shed light on events, it is necessary to meticulously verify the political truth in the archives of different countries. </p><p>  Getting acquainted with the primary sources, it is necessary not only to give out facts, but also to carefully analyze each document and take into account all the realities of that time.  Everyone who is interested in history, trying to understand the past and its influence on the course of events in the future, turn to various monographs and articles.  The works of the ‚Äúnew historians‚Äù are especially in demand. In their works they rely on archival sources and provide the most informative material.  One of these historiographers in modern Russia is Yuri Nikolaevich Zhukov, whose books give an ambiguous picture of the history of the Soviet era. </p>

    <h2>  Series "Stalinist" </h2><p>  A special place in the historical works of the doctor of historical sciences is occupied by the personality of the great leader - V. I. Stalin.  This man firmly entered the history of the XX century, which caused the emergence of many different theories and rumors in all levels of power.  The number of books and monographs devoted to Stalin is enormous, but, oddly enough, they give him a negative characterization and show him as a cruel and unprincipled leader. </p><p>  Zhukov Yuri Nikolaevich - a scientist and publicist who managed to objectively approach the coverage of the personality of a symbol of an entire era.  He characterizes him as a ruler, who took into account the national interests of the new country and developed a whole course of its development.  The political confrontation in the state apparatus between the ruling regime and the opposition has become the main object of research by the historian. </p><p>  Zhukov Yuri Nikolaevich in his works on the events of the 20-50s used a number of classified archival documents, presented an absolutely non-standard version of events in the Soviet Union.  In the books ‚ÄúAnother Stalin‚Äù and ‚ÄúBe proud, not repent‚Äù, the readers revealed a completely different side of the bloody and gloomy period.  Great emphasis is placed on the root causes of the brutal terror that took place in the 30s.  The author was able to expose most of the state apparatus and the "need" for repression by Stalin. </p>

    <h2>  Jewish question </h2><p>  The burning topic of Jewry also did not pass over the scientific activity of the author.  Soviet and Russian historian Zhukov Yuri Nikolaevich speaks of Jews in the light of the struggle for power that took place after the death of Lenin.  He claims that the Stalinist repressions stopped at a time when there were no more Jews left in the NKVD.  L. Trotsky and his close associates were the main rivals of Stalin.  Yuri Nikolayevich Zhukov unequivocally claims that the coming to power of the Jewish proteges of Rothschild would lead to the destruction of the Soviet Union in its infancy, and history itself would take a completely different path. </p><p>  As we see, Zhukov Yu.N.  - The personality is ambiguous.  Most Russians do not support his views on the historical events of the Great Terror.  But his opinion has a right to exist. </p>
