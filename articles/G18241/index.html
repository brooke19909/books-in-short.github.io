If you refuse to answer questions, you will not be anything for it. </p><p>  5) <span>Do not worry</span> if you are suddenly refused a survey, it happens.  A letter comes with a request to fill out a questionnaire and answer certain questions.  You follow the link, you see the first question, for example: ‚ÄúName your laptop model‚Äù, there are Asus and Aser options, you answer Asus, and they write that you are not suitable for participation in the survey.  There is nothing wrong with that, the next poll will come, which you can pass. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most important and convenient thing in such a job is that you do not need to go anywhere, spend money and time on travel, etc., but simply have a computer and Internet access.

Such firms are only intermediaries who cooperate with large enterprises, for whom it is very important to find out the opinion of people about certain goods or services.  As a result, these polling organizations provide customer firms with results, and in return receive a lot of money. </p>

    <h2>  Basic rules for working with questionnaires </h2><p>  How to make money on the Internet by answering questions without investment?  What are the basic rules you need to follow in order to get real money: </p><p>  1) After registering on the site, you will need to answer a few questions about yourself (fill out your profile, account).  They must be answered truthfully and carefully read.  Basically, such sites ask you to fill out information about age, gender, hobbies, types of activity, level of salary, knowledge.  The more truthful the answers to the questions are, the easier it will be for you to work and the more you will be able to earn this type of activity. </p><p>  2) You do not need only to think that making money on the Internet by answering questions is easy and simple, that you can give answers without reading any questions at all.  To answer the questions of the questionnaire, you need to have enough time left, make an effort and be patient, then the result will soon please you.  All your submitted answers to questionnaire questions are checked by administrators, and money is credited only after acceptance.  Therefore, if they have suspicions that you answered "by typing" without reading the questions, then no one will pay you money. </p><h2>  Top rated resources with paid questionnaires </h2><p>  To know how to make money on the Internet, answering questions, reviews from users of different sites need to be reviewed. </p>
