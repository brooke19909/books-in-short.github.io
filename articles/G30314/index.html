Let's consider each of them in more detail. </p><p>  The Crito-Mycenaean period is associated with the appearance of the first state formations on the islands of the Aegean Sea.  Chronologically, it covers 3000-1000 years.  BC  e.  At this stage, the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations appear. </p><p>  The period of the Dark Ages is called "Homeric".  This stage is characterized by the final decline of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, as well as the formation of the first pre-cities structures.  Sources hardly mention this period.  In addition, the time of the Dark Ages is characterized by the decline of culture, the economy and the loss of writing. </p><p>  The archaic period is the time of the formation of the main policies and the expansion of the Hellenic world.  In the VIII century.  BC  e.  Great Greek colonization begins.  During this period, the Greeks settled along the shores of the Mediterranean and Black Seas.

    <p>  The classical period is the heyday of the Greek policies, their economy and culture.  In the V-IV centuries.  BC  e.  the concept of "democracy" appears.  In the classical period, the most significant military events in the history of Hellas occur - the Greco-Persian and Peloponnesian wars. </p><p>  The Hellenistic period is characterized by the close interaction of Greek and Eastern cultures.  At this time, there was a flourishing of art in the state of <span>Alexander the Great.</span>  The Hellenistic period in the history of Greece lasted until the establishment of Roman rule in the Mediterranean. </p><h2>  The most famous cities of Hellas </h2><p>  It is worth noting that in Greece during the period of antiquity there was no single state.  Hellas is a country that consisted of many policies.  In antiquity, the city-state was called a polis.  Its territory included an urban center and a choir (agricultural settlement).  The political management of the policy was in the hands of the People's Assembly and the Council.  All city-states were different both in terms of population and size of territory. </p><p>  The most famous policies of ancient Greece are Athens and Sparta (Lacedaemon). </p><ul><li>  Athens is the cradle of Greek democracy.  Famous philosophers and speakers, heroes of Hellas, as well as famous cultural figures lived in this policy. </li><li>  Sparta is a vivid example of an aristocratic state.  The main occupation of the population of the policy was war.  It was here that the foundations of discipline and military tactics were laid, which were later used by Alexander the Great. </li></ul>
