  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ambassador City Tower Wing (Pattaya, Thailand): description, photo, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is a certain category of tourists who are looking for a vacation not hotels, but huge hotel complexes.  And they are often right.  Why?  Such complexes usually consist of several hotels of different statuses.  That is, in one territory there are three-, four- and five-star hotels.  Thus, a budget tourist has every right to use the entire infrastructure of a luxury hotel.  And only his room and food in a three-star restaurant.  And so the pools, services, animation - as in the "five".  Convenient, isn't it? </p><p>  In this article we will talk about just such a hotel complex Ambassador City Jomtien (Thailand).  Tower Wing is a four star hotel located in the most impressive building.  But what other hotels are in the complex?  What are the numbers in this very "Tower"?  How is it fed?  What services can be used by the inhabitant of the high-rise ‚Äúfour‚Äù throughout the territory?  We built our story on the description of the tourists of this hotel and the entire resort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.a-hotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Tower Wing Hotel" class="if uuid-3225169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225169.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattaya and the nuances of relaxation in the most scandalous resort in Thailand </h2><p>  A budget tourist who can‚Äôt afford to sail or fly to the islands, chooses for recreation the northern coast of the Gulf of Thailand.  Pattaya can be reached by bus or train from Bangkok in just two hours.  But this resort arose from a small fishing village where American soldiers rested during the Vietnam War.  Ladies of easy virtue from all over Thailand came to the guys who missed women with money.  Yes, so they stayed there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now overgrown, sparkling with the lights of night bars and cabarets, Pattaya has the glory of the capital of the sex industry.  But this does not mean that a decent tourist is ordered to enter there.  For respectable (and often family) vacationers, hotels have been built on the outskirts of the city.  There the sea is cleaner and the beaches are more beautiful.  And the urban jungle is replaced by lush tropical vegetation.  The Ambassador City Hotel Jomtien Tower Wing is right in the midst of such a bucolic.  Want an adventure?  Ten minutes by taxi - and you are already on Walking Street, at the epicenter of Pattaya's nightlife.  And on the coast of Jomtien is quiet, grace and everything is adapted to a relaxing beach holiday. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The huge complex "Ambassador" is located on the southern outskirts of Pattaya.  Jomtien Beach is so clean that tourists come here from the city to relax.  The complex is located on the first line from the sea.  And almost all the buildings are close to the beach.  The inhabitants of Ambassador City Tower Wing can only go a minute to the coast. </p><p>  This is the largest resort in Southeast Asia located near the Sukhumvit road connecting Jomtien with Pattaya.  Some tourists consider this location to be excellent, especially if the windows face the opposite side of the road.  After all, traffic on Sukhumvit Road is quite busy.  But on the outside of the hotel, tourists will find many infrastructure objects. </p><p>  The southern outskirts of Pattaya is not a wilderness at all.  Across the street from the entrance to the hotel there is a grocery and clothing market, near many inexpensive shops and massage parlors.  There are scooter rental offices, and excursion bureaus, currency exchange, ATMs, and a pharmacy.  Also within walking distance, tourists will find a large selection of cafes, restaurants and eateries.  Pattaya U-Tapao Airport is 30 kilometers away and Walking Street is 15 kilometers away. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.8399846" data-lng="100.90974269999992" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/6/3/8/17638.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The Ambassador is essentially a small town.  In the gigantic territory, in addition to the Ambassador City Jomtien Tower Wing 4 *, there are: "Garden Wing 2 *", "Inn Wing 3 *" and "Ocean Wing 4 + *".  This complex was built more than one day.  The oldest building was erected in 1988.  The last renovation took place in 2015.  Buildings on the territory of the complex have different number of storeys.  The lowest is Inn Wing (4 levels).  Of particular note is the latest building - that is, the hotel we are describing, also called the Marina Tower, which consists of 42 floors. </p><p>  In the hotel we are describing, the ‚ÄúTower Wing‚Äù has several elevators, so the guests do not feel any inconvenience. As for the territory between the buildings, tourists say in reviews about its cleanliness and arrangement. There are several pools, the most extensive (80 x 80 meters) ) is located just next to the Tower Wing. Only one tank is reserved for guests of the Ocean building. The remaining pools are available for all guests. The complex has an arcade of shops, many restaurants. Tourists say that among the lush green  monitor laziness is inhabited by monitor lizards, who are not dangerous, and people feed them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Jomtien Tower Wing (" class="if uuid-3225077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225077.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The stardom of the individual parts of the complex, by and large, means little - tourists assure.  Ambassador City Marina Tower Wing 4 *, for example, appears on the sites of travel agencies as a "troika", but this 42-story building houses truly luxurious suites.  Although most of the rooms there - from 5 to 23 levels - without a balcony.  They belong to the category of ‚Äústandard‚Äù. </p><p>  But on the upper floors are superior rooms.  These are one-room "deluxe suites" (with a jacuzzi), "superior" and consisting of a bedroom and a living room "mini-suites", "superior suites", "executive suites."  Several of the top floors are occupied by luxurious rooms, which not every five-star hotel can boast of.  Here you need to highlight the "Chinese" and "European" suites, consisting of several rooms, with panoramic windows and spacious balconies. </p><p>  Those who rested at the hotel in the winter of 2019 claim that a new hotel began to be built next to the complex.  And this is only at hand for the guests of the buildings of lower price categories.  So that construction does not interfere, they are lodged (for the same price) in the buildings "Marina" and "Ocean". </p><div class="photo" data-original="planetofhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Marina Tower Wing -, pool" class="if uuid-3225157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225157.jpg"></div><h2>  Room filling </h2><p>  Of course, some tourists made new acquaintances among the inhabitants of other wings and looked - for comparison - their rooms.  They claim that surcharges are made solely for proximity to the beach, sea views and a balcony.  Otherwise, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room, and its comfort, and content are the same.  The exception is suites.  They consist of several rooms, and they have such additional amenities as a hot tub, bathrobes.  And upon arrival, such guests are presented with a bouquet of flowers. </p><p>  What is present in the standard room (without a balcony)?  The bedroom has air conditioning with a personal remote control, there is a TV with satellite channels (3 of them are Russian-speaking), a minibar in which two free bottles of drinking water are put daily.  Bathrooms include hair dryers and replenished toiletries. </p><p>  Superior rooms have a set for self-preparation of hot drinks.  Tea and coffee bags are also replenished daily.  These rooms have not only a shower, but also a bath.  Nevertheless, tourists are urged not to skimp and reserve rooms with a balcony: it is difficult to dry clothes in a very humid climate in the bathroom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kayak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Tower Wing - rooms" class="if uuid-3225164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225164.jpg"></div><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  Guests often conduct a comparative analysis of the rooms in different buildings of the hotel complex.  This happens especially often with the start of construction of a neighboring hotel, due to which tourists who booked rooms in the Inn and Garden Wing buildings were settled in Ambassador City Marina Tower Wing.  The very view of this 42-story building is impressive.  Of course, most of the rooms in this building do not have balconies.  But if you go to Thailand not for luxury, but over the sea, the beach and excursions, then you will not lose out by booking the ‚Äústandard‚Äù at the Marina Tower. </p><p>  According to tourists in the reviews, they clean the rooms "excellent".  And the zeal of the maids does not depend on the tip.  For the left butts they will only wind you from towels of swans and other figures.  The rooms, even the ‚Äústandards‚Äù, are spacious and bright.  The air conditioner successfully leaves equatorial heat outside the windows, does not rattle and does not blow directly onto the bed.  No animals were noticed in the room.  Tourists are reporting new bedding and fluffy towels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.a-hotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Tower Wing (Pattaya, Thailand)" class="if uuid-3225166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225166.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Unlike Egypt and Turkey, in Thailand few hotels operate on an all-inclusive basis.  So in the Ambassador City Tower Wing hotel guests are offered only breakfast.  But during the day you can eat without leaving the hotel.  Firstly, upon arrival you can upgrade your breakfast to half or full board.  In the first option, it is allowed to replace dinner with lunch.  Secondly, you can pay a la carte restaurants in the complex. </p><p>  Guests of other buildings are fed breakfast in separate rooms, and the residents of Ambassador City Tower Wing are ordered entry there.  But you can visit other restaurants and bars.  Upon check-in, guests are given a map of the complex, where catering establishments and their specialization are indicated.  It: </p><ul><li>  "Gong" (Chinese cuisine). </li><li>  "Pasta" (Italian). </li><li>  "Tokugawa" (Japanese). </li><li>  "Atrium Cafe" (pan-European). </li><li>  Espresso (cafeteria serving light snacks and desserts). </li></ul><p>  These institutions are located in the Ambassador City Marina Tower Wing building.  And on the territory of the huge complex there are four additional restaurants and several bars. </p><h2>  Breakfast Reviews </h2><p>  On the territory of the Ambassador City complex there are hotels of different statuses.  Therefore, guests should go to breakfast only in the restaurant of their hotel.  There are tourists who in the past had a rest at Inn Wing 3 *, and then decided to increase the star rating of their hotel and came to Ambassador City Jomtien Tower Wing 4 *.  Reviews from such travelers about breakfast are always enthusiastic. </p><p>  Buffet-style tables always have two kinds of soup, lots of vegetables and fruits (papaya, watermelon, pineapple - are required, plus something else), pancakes and pancakes, delicious pastries.  And in the "troika" they were content with the so-called "American breakfast", consisting of vegetable and sausage slices, eggs, jam, toast, sausages, bacon and cereal.  This whole set is also present at the Tower Wing morning meals, but it is simply lost in the rich variety of dishes.  Family tourists say they always managed to feed their children.  Both vegetarians and those who cannot live without meat were satisfied. </p><h2>  Reviews of restaurants and cafes in the hotel </h2><p>  If you upgrade your breakfast to half or full board, you will be fed at the Atrium Cafe.  Lunches and dinners there are on the menu.  The visitor is invited to choose one of three options for dishes.  Atrium dinners play live music.  Guests can enjoy Thai and European cuisines.  Tourists urge at least once to boo and visit specialized a la carte restaurants.  In terms of ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù and decoration, the Chinese ‚ÄúGong‚Äù gained many flattering reviews.  The magnificent hall conveys all the grandeur and brilliance of the Celestial Empire.  There are also VIP rooms.  In addition, you can taste the Peking duck, soup from the swallow‚Äôs nest, and shark fin. </p><p>  Ambassador City Jomtien Marina Tower Wing has a restaurant called Pasta.  There you can taste not only spaghetti and pizza, but also delicious Italian desserts, as well as seafood dishes.  The restaurant reviews feature a rich wine list.  Fans of Japanese cuisine should visit the Tokugawa.  The interiors of this restaurant will take you to the atmosphere of the Land of the Rising Sun during the reign of the dynasty of the same name. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Tower Wing - Restaurant" class="if uuid-3225171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225171.jpg"></div><h2>  Where tourists ate outside the hotel complex </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Ambassador City is located outside the city, there is no shortage of catering establishments in the area called Jomtien.  Many tourists claim that the grocery market is located right at the gates of Ambassador City Tower Wing.  They say that the seller bought there at your request and cook it - fry it on the grill or stew it in sauce. </p><p>  Tourists urge to discard all sorts of stereotypes about "dirty Asia" and eat in Thai cafes.  Despite the more than democratic atmosphere, the food there is very tasty, and no one has yet been poisoned.  The portions there are simply huge, and the dishes are mere pennies.  Sandwiches, burgers and more can be bought at the Seven-Ileven store across the street from the complex.  Tourists reveal a life hack: you can warm up your bought food on the spot in special stoves.  And under the machines with draft drinks are containers with crushed ice. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The coast in Pattaya itself is very dirty.  Therefore, tourists living in city hotels every day travel either to the islands or to the outskirts, such as Jomtien Beach.  Behind them, in the hope of selling something, merchants of all sorts of things rush in, from panamos to Chinese cell phones.  So Jomtien Beach can not be called deserted.  But the complex "Ambassador" has a reserved stretch of coast, with its sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><p>  Another thing is that the guests of the Ambassador City Jomtien Tower Wing should share all this beach ammunition with the guests of Ocean Wing, Inn Wing and Garden Wing.  So you need to take care of the occupation of the sunbed in advance, since there is clearly not enough of them for everyone.  But many rested on sun loungers by the coastal pool - after all, it‚Äôs only a dozen meters further from the sea, but peace and relaxation are provided to you.  Beach towels are provided free of charge with cards.  They are issued at special racks both on the coast and at each pool. </p><h2>  What tourists say about the beach </h2><p>  Reviews about Jomtien are very controversial.  On the one hand, it is many times cleaner than the beach in Pattaya itself.  Ambassador City Jomtien Tower Wing is located on the first line from the sea.  Many of its guests can enjoy the view of the water surface, and getting to the coast is a matter of one or two minutes.  Cleaner than Jomtien only on the islands, but far to get there.  Alternatively, you can go to the Military Beach, half an hour drive from the Ambassador complex.  The sand is white there, safe entry into the sea.  But on Jomtien the same thing, just more people. </p><p>  Those tourists who have been to Samui and other islands claim that there are no burning plankton, jellyfish and sea urchins on the coast of Pattaya.  But the sea during the unrest raises turbidity, which dissipates only a few days after the storm.  Therefore, swimming in the rainy season is not very pleasant there.  Entering shallow water, without stones and corals.  But those who came to Thailand to observe the life of the motley inhabitants of the reefs have nothing to do in Jomtien. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  Tourists urge to first understand the map of the complex, where there are artificial ponds for swimming, and then climb into them.  The fact is that many confuse them with reservoirs for flora and fauna.  On the territory of the complex there are a lot of decorative reservoirs with goldfish, and in one of them, the largest, there are lizards who are unlikely to like the society of a floundering person. </p><p>  The largest swimming pool is located at Ambassador City Tower Wing Hotel.  Its dimensions are impressive: 80 x 80 meters, a real lagoon!  Near the beach there is another pool (25 x 50 m).  Next to it there is also a sun terrace, with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Both pools have a children's section.  During the day, relaxing relaxing music sounds in the swimming areas.  The complex has another small swimming pool (20 x 25 meters), but it is reserved only for the inhabitants of the Ocean building. </p><h2>  Free services at Ambassador City Tower Wing (Thailand, Pattaya) </h2><p>  For guests of the whole complex there is a fitness room with brand-new gym equipment.  Guests can park their vehicles in a guarded parking lot.  The hotel also has a 24-hour front desk.  Its staff speak English and professionally answer all questions.  If you rent a room, but do not rush to leave the hotel, you can put luggage in the left-luggage office at the reception without any extra charges. </p><p> Tourists with small children claim that at their request they put a crib in the room, and the restaurant has high chairs for feeding the child.  There is a mini club in the Marina Tower Wing building.  And on the territory of the complex there is a shaded playground with a soft coating. </p><h2>  Paid services </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are much more such services at the Ambassador City Jomtien Tower Wing 4 * hotel (Thailand).  And this is very disappointing to tourists who believe that Wi-Fi in a hotel with four stars should be free.  But at the Ambassador, and in all its components, it costs 120 rubles a day, 200 for three days and 300 for a week.  There were no complaints about the speed of the traffic, but you can enter the network only in the lobby or by the pool. </p><p>  Paid services also include equipment for sports games - tennis and table tennis, squash, bowling, badminton, basketball.  The complex has a laundry, dry cleaning, ironing service.  For a child, you can hire both a baby sitter and a professional nanny. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Ambassador City Jomtien Tower Wing (Thailand) is positioning itself as a hotel for a relaxing family holiday, which is why a lot of attention is paid to children's entertainment.  A child from three to 12 years old can be assigned to the care of the animators in the mini-club, which works in Marina Wing.  But adults should have fun themselves. </p><p>  Of course, all conditions are created for this, but the equipment for sports games is paid.  Except for gym equipment in the fitness room.  You can also play beach volleyball for free.  There are animators for adults, but their activity is limited to conducting aerobics classes.  You can go shopping - the complex has an arcade of shops and even a market.  The prices there, tourists say, are cheaper than in Pattaya. </p><h2>  General reviews of Ambassador City Jomtien Tower Wing </h2><p>  Regarding the view from the window, many tourists complained that they had access to a multi-tiered parking lot or, even worse, to technical buildings with huge noisy turntables.  Therefore, you should pre-book a room on the side of the building that overlooks the sea or on the upper floors.  There is no balcony in the ‚Äústandards‚Äù, which creates difficulties for drying clothes.  If you book a budget room, then grab a twine that can be pulled over the latches between the two windows. </p><p>  Another issue of the room is poor ventilation.  It is worth turning on the air conditioning, as condensation appears on things.  But no one complains about the quality of cleaning in the rooms of Ambassador City Tower Wing.  In the reviews, tourists say that the maids put not only cosmetics and two glass bottles of drinking water, but also a shower cap, and a toothbrush, and a shaving machine, and tea and coffee bags.  Towels - new, fluffy - is enough.  They, like bed linen, are changed every day. </p><p>  Upon check-in, a deposit of $ 100 (6550 rubles) is charged.  Tourists mention that next to the Ambassador there is a Mimosa park with children's entertainment.  The audience in the hotel complex is international.  The Ocean wing is dominated by tourists from Western Europe, America and Australia.  And at the Ambassador City Tower Wing Hotel, Chinese, Russians and Kazakhs relax.  Therefore, among the reviews you can find a complaint about the neglect of some nationalities.  But this is not so.  Tour operators from Russia book the cheapest rooms without balconies and overlooking the technical facilities.  Therefore, tourists and complex, seeing that citizens of other countries enjoy their holidays in good rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="planetofhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ambassador City Tower Wing Reviews" class="if uuid-3225200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3225200.jpg"></div><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  As you can see, anyone who thinks cheap to live in a complex where hotels with 3, 4 and 5 stars are located on the same territory can sometimes make mistakes.  Of course, as a bonus, you can swim in a luxurious swimming pool, take a walk in a huge well-kept park.  But the pluses end there.  Indeed, the absence of balconies and constant noise outside the window create not the best conditions for relaxation. </p><p>  Dining at breakfast restaurants is also very dependent on the status of your hotel.  In the ‚Äútroika‚Äù you will be served only toasts with boiled eggs and several types of fruits, while in a four-star hotel, such as the Marina City Tower Wing, you can fully eat, and do not feel hunger until the evening. </p>
