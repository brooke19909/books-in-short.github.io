Sometimes they express their rejection of music: one it seems too loud, the other, on the contrary, too quiet and sleepy.  Some are not happy with the kitchen: the dishes here, as guests assure, are served out of order.  Salad can be brought after it is served hot, and you have to wait about forty minutes.  Meals brought to guests may be leeward. </p><p>  Some customers find the local menu too authoring.  In their opinion, the dishes here, although very beautiful, are too original.  Not even adults can taste everything from the author‚Äôs cuisine, and it‚Äôs even harder for children to choose.

Some guests also criticized the service that they thought was too slow. </p><p>  But still, most of the visitors who left their reviews believe that ‚ÄúNemo‚Äù is a wonderful place where you will not stay hungry, where you can relax, drink wine, sing songs and freely dance.  Club confidently recommend to friends. </p>
