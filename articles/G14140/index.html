Rest here will cost a little more than in Turkey, Greece or Bulgaria, but there will be much more impressions from it.  In resort towns along the coast, both luxury hotels and small hotels for budget accommodation have been built.  One of the latest is the Best San Diego 3 * hotel.  Photos, a detailed description of rooms and infrastructure, as well as reviews of tourists can be seen in our article. </p><h2>  Holidays in Salou, Spain </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth noting that Salou is often called the most Russian resort in Spain, because it is here that tourists from the CIS countries often come.  This small town is located on the northeast coast of the country near the Costa Dorada.  The high season begins here in late April-mid-May and lasts until late autumn.  The resort is ideal for couples with young children, but young people will not be bored here.  Salou is also considered the center of gastronomic tourism, because there are a huge number of restaurants and bars offering guests dishes of Mediterranean and Spanish cuisine. </p><p>  All the beaches of the city are distinguished by their cleanliness.  The advantage is that there are no jellyfish at all in the sea, and the entrance to the water is sandy and gentle, therefore suitable for children.  At the same time, you will not find large shopping centers in Salou, however, souvenirs can always be bought in small shops located along the coast.  This is a very compact resort - all the attractions are concentrated along the promenade of King Jaime.  There are illuminated singing fountains, a monarch statue covered in gilding, as well as Catalan luxury villas.  A large amusement park is open for children, and young people can relax in the many nightclubs that can be found on the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  Hotel Best San Diego 3 * in Salou is the place for an inexpensive but comfortable stay.  It is suitable for those who like to live in the busy center of the resort or simply do not want to spend a lot of time on daily walks to shops, the beach or bars.  The complex was built in 1974, but has since been seriously repaired several times.  The last update was completed in 2016, so do not worry that you will come across a room with old furniture or fixtures. </p><p>  The hotel grounds are also ennobled.  It has a huge garden, private pool and sunbathing area.  In total, the complex offers 252 rooms.  All of them are located in a large six-story residential building.  Both in internal and external design shades of white prevail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amoma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Territory" class="if uuid-2281587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2281587.jpg"></div><p>  The Best San Diego 3 * complex (Spain, Salou) accepts tourists all year round.  Qualified staff works here, who speaks not only Spanish and English, but also Ukrainian, Russian and Polish.  Therefore, the settlement and resolution of any contentious issues will not cause you any problems.  Registration of guests starts at noon local time and is carried out throughout the day, until midnight.  Guests under 12 years old are free of charge.  However, you cannot come with animals here.  You will need to leave your rooms after the holidays early in the morning - until 10:00. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  More about hotel location </h2><p>  We have already noted above that the Best San Diego 3 * hotel has a favorable location.  Now let's talk about it in more detail.  The hotel is conveniently located between the beach area and the town center.  The coast is just 200 meters away.  Therefore, tourists can get there in about 5-10 minutes.  The central part is approximately the same.  There is a bus stop 150 meters from the hotel, from where you can leave for other major cities in Spain, including Barcelona.  A supermarket, pharmacy and ATM are 200-250 meters away.  If you want to visit a restaurant or a night club, then you have to walk about 200 meters. </p><p>  The airport of the city of Regon is 15 km away from Salou, but Russian tourists do not often fly here.  The most popular is Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãsince flights to this city are much cheaper and fly more often.  However, its airport is removed at a considerable distance - about 100 km.  Therefore, tourists should prepare for a long transfer, which can last several hours.  You can issue it with a ticket.  The hotel provides comfortable buses with comfortable seats and air conditioning for its guests.  However, you can get to the hotel yourself by public transport or taxi. </p><h2>  What rooms are in the hotel Best San Diego 3 *? </h2><p>  Since this hotel is considered a budget option for recreation, the rooms here do not differ in exquisite decoration and luxurious design.  There is no particular choice of categories either - all apartments in the hotel are standard.  They are designed for two adult guests, to which two more guests can additionally be accommodated.  In turn, they will be placed on the sofa, and not on the bed.  No extra beds are available.  Each room has a bedroom with a separate living area, a small bathroom and an open balcony.  It has a dining set.  The windows, as a rule, overlook the pool and neighboring buildings, but from a distance you can see a strip of coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room appearance" class="if uuid-2281585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2281585.jpg"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãall rooms at the Best San Diego 3 * hotel is quite small and is only 19 m <sup>2</sup> .  However, they are clean and freshly repaired.  Maids clean them daily, bed linen and towels in the bathroom change several times a week.  The rooms feature tiled floors or parquet floors. </p><h2>  Apartment equipment </h2><p>  Since the Best San Diego 3 * hotel (Costa Daurada, Salou) is considered an inexpensive place to relax, you should not count on a large number of amenities in the rooms.
