Moreover, navigators appear in a variety of versions.  This can be an additional module as part of the parking radar, and an auxiliary function of the multimedia system.  But the most accurate and easy-to-use devices are available in a separate form factor.  These devices include the portable model Prology iMAP-5600.  Reviews of this navigator note many advantages, the main of which is the mechanics of interaction with cartographic materials.  But the device also has weaknesses that are important to consider. </p>

    <h2>  Model Overview </h2><p>  The model represents the middle segment of automotive navigation devices, offering the corresponding capabilities.  The developers provided the device with new software from the Navitel company, which operates using the MStar processor.  This combination determined the speed of the equipment.  In addition, the car GPS navigator from the manufacturer Prology is characterized by efficient operation in terms of signal reception.  According to the owners, under normal conditions, he is able to simultaneously track signals from 16 satellites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By design, the model still remains close to the budget class.  The creators adhered to the concept of minimalism, as a result of which the case turned out to be small but functional.  On its surfaces are the necessary controls, connectors and mounting grooves.  The advantages of an optimized design and fillings organically fit into the cost of the Prology iMAP-5600.  The price of the device in the domestic market is 4.5-5 thousand rubles.  This is not enough when you consider the quality of the model - especially against the backdrop of competitive offers. </p><h2>  General characteristics of the device </h2>

The matrix type is LCD, so the quality of the picture allows you to view the image in detail even on a modest screen.  This contributes to the optimal resolution at 480x272.  But the most attractive for a modern motorist in this screen is the touch control principle.  The creators did not completely abandon the hardware buttons, but the main menu toolkit was transferred directly to the sensitive display.  This is a good navigator from the point of view of automobile ergonomics, since the driver does not have to grope the side keys each time to execute operational commands.  Also, the navigator allows you to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image, control the backlight, etc. </p><h2>  Power supply </h2><p>  The device is connected through a separate power supply via a 12 V adapter. Power is supplied by a polymer lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 950 mA / h.  In practice, it was noted that the connection to the car cigarette lighter replenishes the charge in 3-4 hours. But using the complete interface, you can charge using a computer, including a laptop.  In this case, energy will be filled in 6-8 hours. As for the battery life, it is very modest with the Prology iMAP-5600.  Reviews say that the device‚Äôs battery maintains its working capacity for 3 hours on average.  On the one hand, this interval does not matter much, since the navigator can be powered continuously during operation of the machine.  But on the other hand, the frequent use of an on-board power supply source becomes a load for the battery, which does not affect its durability in the best way. </p><h2>  Software </h2>

    <p>  The software and content for the navigator are supplied by Navitel.  Already in the factory version, the model is equipped with the latest version of the cartographic material.  In the future, you can use the software releases for Prology iMAP-5600.  The Navigator 5 update, for example, is available for free and in the modern nm3 format.  The advantages of this release include the lack of need for indexing maps.  The user also does not need routing.  All auxiliary operations are performed automatically.  For example, inside the country, a route is laid out in a couple of seconds, while the system takes into account the indications of the Navitel.Traffic service and selects the most convenient directions. </p><p>  There were also software add-ons that improved the sensitivity setting when moving away from a given route.  The Prology iMAP-5600 cards themselves are now available in the new HD format, which allows you to view content on a 5-inch screen with detailed visual analysis. </p><h2>  Functional </h2>

    <p>  The device should not be considered only as a tool for interaction with cartographic materials.  For this, a basic GPS mode of operation is provided.  In addition, the device also supports multimedia mode, in which you can listen to audio materials, watch video content, as well as read texts and run games.  However, in terms of additional applications, the device does not differ in wealth.  In this version, the car GPS navigator only offers a calculator and touch screen calibrator.  Most of the optional tools are focused on the capabilities of the navigator.  In this section, it is possible to note the automatic functions of the mentioned route planning, and voice notification, as well as calculating the route and loading the terrain. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The most positive feedback was received by the screen and navigator software.  The touch panel works clearly, stably and without delays, and the display transmits a bright and rich picture with good detail.  The Prology iMAP-5600 software is also commendable.  The reviews indicate not so much the shell of the operating system as the materials of Navitel.  In addition to the fact that the device has a built-in card, developers regularly supply target devices with quality updates. </p><p>  The technical filling deserves special attention, which, in fact, processes cartographic materials.  In this part, there are no pauses in downloads and transitions between cards, confident reception quality and reliability of the device.  It is also worth noting the style and design of the device.  In the basic version, the Prology iMAP-5600 Black is distinguished by the presence of a pleasant soft-touch plastic resembling a rubberized surface.  But a gray metallic version of Gun Metal is also available, which organically fits into modern car interiors.  At the same time, the case has a solid assembly, which during operation does not give squeaks and other technical noise.  True, the surface of the plastic, as many say, still retains fingerprints. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with constructive nuances.  First of all, users are disappointed with the mounting system.  The kit provides for a suction cup that breaks quickly and even in a solid state hesitantly holds the device.  Therefore, it is recommended to initially purchase a universal mount for the case, which can withstand mechanical stress and vibration in the elephant.  There is also criticism of the form factor of the model.  In particular, criticize the size of the display.  Still, the <span>navigation systems of</span> premium manufacturers have set the fashion for large-format screens, which is also reflected in the requirements of users for devices of other segments.  On the other hand, the disadvantage of this solution is offset by the quality of the Prology iMAP-5600 display.  The reviews also show that not every massive screen is able to provide the same degree of clarity.  And this is not to mention the exclusion of problems associated with the installation, placement and operation of large-format displays.  Still, compactness is an important feature for which many sacrifice and convenience when using translators of visual information. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  In the price segment for 4-5 thousand it is easy to find navigators attractive from the point of view of operational qualities.  At a minimum, this is the middle segment and the requirements for these products are significantly higher than in the budget category.  Another thing is that manufacturers often increase the status of their models due to new technologies, optional and various secondary features.  Against this background, a good navigator always stands out, having not only wide functionality, but also high-quality performance of basic tasks.  And the iMAP-5600 model is just different in that it facilitates the driver‚Äôs interaction with the Navitel map service.  The quality of the navigator is determined by the powerful processor and ergonomic controls.  And the basic tools are supplemented by automatic card management tools, also characterized by accuracy and high speed of action. </p>
