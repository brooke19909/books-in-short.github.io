    <h2>  "Centipede" </h2><p>  The construction of the Kolomenskaya metro station was completed in the late 60s.  This station is one of the same type, of which there are many in the Moscow Metro.  There are no elaborate sculptures and catchy ornaments.  Residents of the capital called such stations ‚Äúcentipedes‚Äù for their facelessness.  But if there is nothing to catch on to the gaze of a passenger who finds himself at the Kolomenskaya metro station, then an amazing picturesque picture opens up on the surface.  True, not immediately.  You should walk a few meters towards the reserve.  But more on that later.  The pavilion, despite its inconspicuousness, also deserves attention. </p><h2>  Features of the metro station "Kolomenskaya" </h2><p>  The walls are tiled.  The columns are finished in light gray marble.  The Kolomenskaya metro station still has a feature that distinguishes it from others built in the sixties.  Namely columns.  After all, they have the shape of an octagon in cross section.  The columns at the other station are square in cross section.  However, passengers hurrying to work or home hardly pay attention to this feature.  The city, which is in continuous motion, is Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Metro Kolomenskaya is located in one of the most densely populated areas.  Even if architects and artists in 1969 would have made efforts to make this pavilion bright and memorable, their efforts were hardly appreciated by local residents.  Tourists are not common here.  Foreigners prefer the historical center of Moscow.  While here, too, there is something to see. </p>

    <h2>  Area </h2><p>  Metro Kolomenskaya is located in the Nagatinsky Zaton area.  Fifty meters from the Orbit.  Not so long ago, this cinema, built in Soviet times, underwent a complete restoration.  On the other side is the Kolomensky Passage shopping center.  Other shopping malls located near the metro are Gvozd-2, Confetti, Kolomensky, Nora, Zatonka, Nagatinsky.  Most of them are located on Andropov Avenue.  Shopping centers Zatonka, Confetti and Nagatinsky can be reached by shuttle bus.  The stop is located near one of the exits: you need to get out of the first carriage from the center and turn left.  There is a tram stop on the other side, from where you can also get to anywhere in Nagatinsky Zaton. </p>

    <h2>  Cafes and restaurants </h2><p>  There are several catering facilities near the Kolomenskaya metro station.  There are no elite restaurants, mainly snack bars or cafes.  Not far from the cinema "Orbit" is the "Baku Boulevard".  The menu of this institution serves dishes of European and Caucasian cuisine.  However, according to reviews, the quality of service here is poor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At Andropov Avenue, Building 37, is the Cappuccino Cafe.  From this institution to the museum reserve is only twenty meters.  That is why on weekdays in the cafe to find a free table is not easy.  In the same building, but on the second floor, there is a club-restaurant "Pena".  There are many cafes in the vicinity of Kolomenskaya metro station.  And this is due, first of all, to the presence of one of the ancient sights of the capital - the Kolomenskoye Museum-Reserve.  It will be discussed further. </p><h2>  Museum Reserve </h2><p>  Kolomenskoye is part of the historical complex, divided into three parts.  One of them is the museum of architecture and buildings, most of which were created by the eighteenth century.  Among these buildings, however, there are also those that were erected in the Middle Ages.  All this can be seen if you get to the Kolomenskaya metro station, go to Orbit and walk 200 meters through the park of the same name. </p><p>  The history of these places is truly interesting.  Once there was a village, which, according to researchers, is the first settlement in Moscow.  In the thirteenth century, fleeing the Tatar-Mongolians, residents of the ancient city of Kolomna arrived in these places.  Hence the name of the village, then the modern street and, finally, the metro station.  Russian princes chose picturesque Kolomna places.  For several centuries there was their residence.  Ascension Church - the oldest monument in the museum - was built in the sixteenth century by Vasily III. </p><p>  At the time of Alexei Mikhailovich, the village of Kolomenskoye reached its peak.  With this ruler, several luxurious structures for those times were erected.  For example, the wooden royal palace.  Almost each of the subsequent kings did not disregard these places, erecting new structures.  But not all buildings, of course, have survived to this day. </p>

    <h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Museum-reserve "Kolomenskoye" keeps many secrets.  On its territory is the so-called Vlasov ravine.  According to legend, a person who gets into it can disappear.  At least for contemporaries, there is a legend that in the XIX century two local residents, deciding to shorten the path, crossed this anomalous place and ended up in the XIII century.  They returned home only after 30 years.  True or fiction, is unknown.  But now no one is in a hurry to cross the ill-fated ravine. </p>
