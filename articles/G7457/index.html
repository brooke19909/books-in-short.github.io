  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Prince Naryshkin. The history of the Naryshkin family</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Naryshkins are an old noble family, which in pre-Petrine times was considered small-scale.  Representatives of his high posts did not hold.  What changed after the accession of Peter?  From the school course of history, many know that one of the representatives of this noble family was the mother of the great Russian reformer. </p><p>  A small nobleman is an aristocrat who owns small land.  However, already in the 17th century the Naryshkins owned numerous Moscow estates, including Kuntsevo, Fili, Brattsevo, Sviblovo, Cherkizovo, Petrovsky, Trinity-Lykovo.  These were far from the last people, even in the pre-Petrine times.  There is such a thing as "Naryshkin Baroque", which denotes a certain direction in architecture, which became widespread in the second half of the 17th century. </p><h2>  Crimean Tatar Narysh </h2><p>  About when the first Naryshkins appeared, there is no exact information.  There is a version that this Russian noble family was founded by representatives of the Germanic tribe, whom the ancient Roman historian Tacitus mentions in his work.  True, most likely, this theory arose after the tsar was married to Natalya Kirillovna Naryshkina. </p><p>  There is a more believable version.  The founder of the clan was Mordka Kubrat - the Crimean Tatar, nicknamed Narysh.  This man came to Moscow in the sixties of the XV century.  As it often happened in the old days, the nickname eventually transformed into a surname.  The grandson of Mordka Kubrat was already called Naryshkin.  He was not a prince.  Moreover, representatives of this genus were not awarded the title later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The rise of the Naryshkins </h2><p>  In 1671, Natalia Kirillovna became the wife of Alexei Mikhailovich, the Russian Tsar, nicknamed for his relatively calm disposition, the Quietest.  Peter's mother was the daughter of Cyril Polyektovich Naryshkin - the governor, who became a boyar only after her marriage.  But the one who suddenly towered up in medieval Russia just as quickly could be in disgrace.  The brothers Natalya, who inherited the dignity of the father, were executed after the Streletsky riot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="streltsy riot" class="if uuid-2464267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2464267.jpg"></div><p>  In the Naryshkin family, the most common male names were Alexander, Leo, Cyril.  Since the beginning of the 18th century, carriers of this family have enjoyed privileges.  So, Lev Naryshkin, a cousin of Peter the Great, was one of Catherine II‚Äôs close associates, played the role of an entertainer-mass organizer of celebrations, holidays, picnics, which, according to historians, had an extraordinary talent.  Representatives of this kind rarely reached heights in the military or civil service, but always occupied pride of place in the Imperial Palace. </p><p>  In the XVIII century, most of the Naryshkin‚Äôs fortune was wasted.  However, a profitable marriage saved the situation.  Cyril Razumovsky married Ekaterina Naryshkina.  A considerable dowry was issued from the treasury.  Razumovsky has become one of the richest people in the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fight against Miloslavskys </h2><p>  After the death of Alexei Mikhailovich, his son ascended the throne.  He was painful, the boyars understood that he would not live long.  And as usual, they launched a struggle for power.  On the one side of the barricades were the Naryshkins, on the other - the Miloslavskys. </p><p>  The actual ruler was Artamon Matveev.  While he was in power, the Naryshkins remained in favor.  However, the Miloslavskys managed to get Matveyev sent into exile.  After that, the relatives of Natalya Kirillovna also had to retire.  True, for some time they again rose - after the death of the young king and to the Streletsky riot.  But the temporary elevation lasted no more than two weeks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tainy.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="miloslvskie against Naryshkin" class="if uuid-2464271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2464271.jpg"></div><p>  The best times in the history of the Naryshkins began after the overthrow of Sophia.  Now they had unlimited influence on state affairs. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  Who were the Naryshkins - princes or counts?  They had no title.  The princes of the Naryshkins called themselves abroad, where they ended up after the revolution.  The untitled nobles thus attached importance to themselves. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the Naryshkins acquired a special position already under Peter the Great.  The king granted the princely title in exceptional cases.  As for the count, the nobles who were closely related to the imperial family considered him to be considered below their dignity.  In one of the books dedicated to representatives of this aristocratic family, it says: below the Alexander Menshikov, who received the title of prince in 1705, the Naryshkins did not want to be. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Natalya Kirillovna </h2><p>  Mother of Peter I was brought up in the Moscow house of the boyar Artamon Matveev.  It was here that Alexey Mikhailovich first saw her.  After the death of her husband, difficult times came for Natalia Kirillovna.  The struggle between the Naryshkins and Mstislavsky, which ended not in favor of the former, developed. </p><p>  However, the influence of Natalia Kirillovna on her son was significant.  This is evidenced by the correspondence of Peter the Great with his mother. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chert-poberi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Naryshkina Natalia Kirillovna" class="if uuid-2464276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2464276.jpg"></div><h2>  Alexander Lvovich </h2><p>  This Naryshkin lived in the first half of the 18th century.  Alexander Lvovich was a statesman, headed the Naval Academy.  Peter the Great, he was a cousin.  After Elizaveta Petrovna ascended the throne, Alexander Lvovich joined the investigative commission over Minikh, Osterman, and Golovkin. </p><h2>  Kirill Alekseevich </h2><p>  The exact date of birth of this representative of an old noble family is unknown.  Presumably, Kirill Alekseevich was born in 1670.  Since 1716, he served as the Moscow governor.  An interesting fact from the life of Kirill Naryshkin: in 1721 he sued Pleshcheyev's relatives because of the estate in Sviblovo.  He lost the process.  Desolation reigned in the Naryshkin estate in the 20s of the 18th century, expensive furniture and decorations were taken out by the previous owners. </p><h2>  Alexey Vasilievich </h2><p>  This Naryshkin was born in 1742.  He was the son of a Belgorod governor.  In 1755, Aleksey Naryshkin was appointed to the headquarters of General-Feldzeichmeister Orlov.  He was a member of the retinue of Catherine II during a trip along the Volga.  Upon returning to Moscow, Alexey Naryshkin was awarded the title of chamber junker.  Since 1783, he served as Privy Councilor. </p><p>  The list of estates owned at different times by representatives of the Naryshkin clan is quite extensive.  One of the few surviving to this day is located in the west of Moscow.  The building, erected in the XVII century, belongs to the historical monuments of the capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alexey naryshkin" class="if uuid-2464278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2464278.jpg"></div><h2>  Naryshkin Manor </h2><p>  The historical and architectural monument is located in the Filevsky Park area.  His story is quite interesting.  After the Streletsky revolt, the village of Kuntsevo, which was owned by the Miloslavskys, was withdrawn by Naryshkin.  Her new owner was Lev Kirillovich - uncle of Peter the Great.  In 1744, his son laid a stone church on the estate, on the site of which a new temple was erected at the beginning of the 20th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotowalker.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuntsevo estate" class="if uuid-2464279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2464279.jpg"></div><p>  Under Alexander Naryshkin, the construction of a large house began, a garden was built, greenhouses were created.  In 1763, Catherine the Great visited here.  The main house, like many Moscow buildings, burned down in 1812.  But five years later, a new building appeared, which was soon supplemented with empire-style wings. </p><p>  In 1818, in honor of the birth of the heir to the throne, Frederick William III came to Russia.  His path lay along the Mozhaisk road, passing near Kuntsevo.  In honor of the momentous event, Alexander Naryshkin erected an obelisk on which was depicted Emperor Alexander I. </p><p>  In 1861, Alexander II and Maria Alexandrovna visited the estate.  A few years later, the owner of this land owned Kozma Soldatenkov.  He built a new house here, the facade of which was decorated with pilasters and a ribbon frieze. </p><p>  At different times, celebrities such as Mikhail Lermontov, Leo Tolstoy, <span>Alexander Herzen</span> visited the estate <span>.</span>  In 1960, the main building was taken under state protection.  Fifteen years later, there was a fire that destroyed the wooden buildings.  The house was dismantled, restored in its original form.  However, now, instead of wood, brick was used. </p><p>  In 2014, the Kuntsevo estate, which is its official name, was damaged by a fire.  The roof was completely burned along with the belvedere tower.  Restoration work began in the fall of 2015. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuntsevo manor church" class="if uuid-2464281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2464281.jpg"></div><h2>  Treasure Naryshkins </h2><p>  In St. Petersburg on Tchaikovsky Street there is a mansion that once also belonged to the famous noble family.  In 2012, restoration work was carried out here, during which <span>family jewels</span> were discovered <span>.</span>  The news of the find quickly penetrated the media.  Builders found the Naryshkin treasure in a room that was not in the building plan.  This stone bag was apparently made by one of the last owners of the palace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.softmixer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Naryshkin treasure" class="if uuid-2464256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2464256.jpg"></div><p>  The room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãsix square meters was stuffed with silver utensils with the family coat of arms.  One of the owners carefully packed the huge service into the newspapers of 1917.  The find is of great importance from a historical point of view.  This treasure gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe life of Russian aristocrats and the tastes that prevailed in the noble era. </p>
