Is it worth a visit?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The geographical name of the city of Senaki (Georgia) first appeared in the 17th century with reference to the old trading village and the cathedral on the right bank of the Tehura River.  Historically, it was the administrative center of Senaki Rides and part of the Kutaisi province.  After the construction of the Poti-Tbilisi railway line began (1872), the center was moved to its current location, 5 km from the old village.  Senaki was one of the important centers of rebellion against the Bolsheviks in 1924, as well as the center of the military rebellion of Georgia in 1998.  The city was an important military air base in the Soviet period.  The second infantry brigade of the Georgian army is now at the same base.  It was renewed after 2005 to meet NATO standards.  The city was also the site of the battle during the war in South Ossetia in 2008. </p><div class="photo" data-original="georgiaabout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Senaki Monument" class="if uuid-2539104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2539104.jpg"></div><h2>  City population </h2><p>  Historically, Senaki is known as a clearly mono-ethnic city with most Georgians.  According to the 2002 census, 98% of the total population were ethnic Georgians.  Senaki's oldest official population figures come from the 1897 census.  In the city, there were 1,248 people (927 men, 321 women).  The 1950-1970s were an important period for the development of Senaki, which also influenced population growth.  The 2002 census recorded 28,082 people (including IDPs from Abkhazia).  Today, apart from Georgians (98%), Russians (0.6%), Assyrians (0.2%) and others (0.2%) live in Senaki.  In Soviet times, many Jews lived in the city.  They mostly left the city in the late 70s. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.transparency.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãview, senaki" class="if uuid-2539106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2539106.jpg"></div><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Senaki is an important station of the Tbilisi-Poti and Tbilisi-Zugdidi railway lines.  It also connects several roads of international and national importance.  Due to its location, Senaki is one of the leading economic and trade centers in the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region.  In the Soviet period, there were mechanical, carpet and brick factories.  The processing of wine, tea and citrus has been developed.  Small and medium enterprises operating today in Senaki include several agro-industrial enterprises (walnut, laurel, tea, dairy, corn), and the production of wood and asphalt. </p><p>  In June 2016, the construction of a standard Euro 4 cement plant began near the city. Cement produced in Senaki will be targeted at both local and export markets.  At a distance of three kilometers from Senaki, you can find the resort of Menji.  In Soviet times, it was a famous balneological and recreational water resort, which today is heavily damaged and abandoned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Senaki Theater" class="if uuid-2539103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2539103.jpg"></div><h2>  Culture </h2><p>  Historically, Senaki has been one of the important cultural and educational centers of the region.  Two years after the creation of the Georgian theater, in 1879, the first performance took place in Senaki.  One of the first noble schools in Georgia opened in Senaki (currently Dzveli Senaki) in 1884.  Famous <span>Georgian writers,</span> scholars and public figures, including Simon Janashia, Konstantin Gamsakhurdia, Arnold Chikobava, Varlam Topuria, Petr Kavtaradze, taught at this school. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  One of the important sights of Senaki, Georgia (there is a photo of the city in the article) is the State Baroque Theater (architect Vakhtang Gogoladze).  The theater is part of the Georgian cultural heritage and is under reconstruction until 2018.  The city is also known for its neat streets with brick houses.  In the immediate vicinity (on the so-called ‚ÄúArchangel Hill‚Äù) you can find a historical church built by the monk Alex Shushaniya (named Senakeli) in 1908.  The church was one of the few that were not closed in Soviet times in Georgia. </p><p>  To the north of the city there are various types of spiritual and historical sights: Tektati Monastery, Shkhefi Fortress and Sakalandarishvili Fortress.  Near Senaki, you can also find the ancient archaeological and historical site of Nokalakevi (Archeopolis, Tsihe-Goji).  According to various sources (ex F. Diobua de Monpereoux), there was the mythical Colchian town of Ayia, and then the capital of Lazika, Tsikhegoji. </p><h2>  Shkhepi Fortress </h2><p>  This is a very colorful and original fortress in the old Senaki (Georgia).  Well visible from the road.  In order to get to it you need to turn off the road at the layout of the fortress.  Then go, focusing on the fortress itself: the path to the top on the right side along the cemetery.  Even on an excellent SUV you can‚Äôt drive to the very top, so it‚Äôs better to go on your own: from the burial site about half a kilometer, the entire climb is about a kilometer.  The fortress is well preserved.  From the top there is a magnificent view of the plain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otg.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The fortress city of Nokalakevi" class="if uuid-2539109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2539109.jpg"></div><h2>  The fortress city of Nokalakevi </h2><p>  A fortified city in western Georgia, in the Senak municipality, the capital of Egrisi, the place of the famous metropolis Ayia, where, according to legend, the Argonauts arrived.  For those who prefer ancient history.  The entrance to the town is located at the main gate.  And there is something to look at.  At least the Byzantine wall, the monastery of "40 martyrs", ancient steam rooms, a covered descent to the river Tejura.  How to get there: take the bus to Senaki that goes to Martvili.  Before entering the fortified town, you can look into the archaeological museum (located after the bridge over Tehura on the Senaki-Martvili highway), where you can see not only the pottery from the Bronze Age found in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fortified city, but also a map of Nokalakevi . </p>
