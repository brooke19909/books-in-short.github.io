  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY clothes.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, "Hand made" things are more relevant than ever.  Wicker, knitted, embroidered home furnishings bring warmth and coziness, filling the house with some unique charm.  And clothes with their own hands - in general, breaks all records of popularity.  Hand-made finish, individual cut, some original details that you will not find in ‚Äústore‚Äù clothes - all this makes many fashionistas slowly master the basics of needlework and create their own unique style.  Things made taking into account your own preferences and taste can emphasize individuality and give the image a special charm. </p><p>  Each person, regardless of age and gender, subconsciously strives for comfort and beauty, this is manifested in many areas: in school, at home, at work or in leisure.  Naturally, one of the factors that to one degree or another affect all these areas of life is our clothing.  Indeed, for each individual case, we usually choose different things.  How to choose the right thing that will look advantageous, will be comfortable and fashionable, without forgetting about personality and style?  You can go around many stores in search of a suitable wardrobe part, but there is no guarantee that the purchased item will be exactly the one you wanted to buy from the beginning.  Another option is custom tailoring, although there are some nuances here too - the price of custom tailoring is far from acceptable for everyone. </p><p>  For those who prefer originality and originality in clothes, there is a win-win option, which is not only economical, but also affordable for almost everyone.  This is an independent manufacture of wardrobe items and accessories <strong>.</strong>  Do-it-yourself fashionable clothing is interesting and profitable.  Cutting and sewing is not at all such a difficult task as it seems to those who have never tried to prove themselves in this area.  Even if you have never held a thread and a needle in your hands, you can learn the basics of tailoring at special courses, or by resorting to the Internet.  If you are confused by the lack of patterns or patterns of the desired things, then in this case the same Internet will always come to your aid. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Do-it-yourself children's clothing</strong> is also an interesting enough area of ‚Äã‚Äãneedlework, where it is easy enough to show a creative approach and creative thinking.  Those who at least once sewed, changed or knitted clothes for little fashionistas know how exciting this activity can be.  Designing children's clothing from those materials that are at hand is profitable and practical.  Starting a sewing from children's clothes, you can take as a basis a thing that has already proved its excellent quality and wear, and having made a new thing for a baby from it, you can be sure that the fabric will not shrink, does not fade, and the thing will look great for a long time . </p><p>  If DIY clothing is exactly what you are interested in, make up your mind and take the first step.  Ask a friend, or buy a magazine with patterns, take a piece of the cheapest fabric (for the first sewing experiments, this is exactly what you need), remove the pattern and try to cut out any simple product - usually in models such magazines are marked with a special icon.  Now you need to sweep the cut out parts.  If you successfully passed this stage, you can safely buy a sewing machine. </p><p>  Sewing on modern typewriters is an exciting and affordable activity, automatic stitch tuning, several speeds and the choice of the desired line make it easy to achieve the desired result. </p><p>  There are no problems with fabric today either.  The choice of materials is now simply amazing, so choosing a decent and high-quality fabric for the future outfit is quite possible.  DIY clothing is not only interesting, but also very profitable, for example, you can sew a sheath dress from knitted fabric in just a couple of hours, while the cost of such a thing - depending on size and model - varies from 200 to 500 rubles.  (they cost so much, threads, fabric, tracing paper).  If you want to buy such a dress in the store, you will have to pay from 800 to 1000 rubles for it.  The savings are obvious!  In addition, if you sew such a dress yourself, you are unlikely to meet such an outfit on the street - do-it-yourself clothes are always exclusive! </p>
