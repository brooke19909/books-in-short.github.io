    <h2>  Carcassonne Fortress (France): a description of the city and location of Cite </h2><p>  This fortification was built on the right bank of the Aude River.  The fortress is located on a hill, southeast of the modern center of Carcassonne.  The city itself has long held a good strategic position, controlling the area between the Pyrenees and Montagnard Noir, and the path from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean.  The hill on which the fortress is located is a plateau a hundred and fifty meters high.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city as a whole is 65 square kilometers, which far exceeds the size of all other settlements in the province of Aude. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Carcassonne Fortress" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1715011.jpg" width="600"></div>

People have lived on these hills since the <span>primitive era.</span>  The Celts built a fort here, known from the sixth century BC.  Then, in 125 BC.  e., the Romans came to this territory and founded a fortified camp on this place (Castrum Julia Carcasso).  Later it was incorporated into the province of Narbonne Gaul.  The camp became known as Karkasum and gradually gained wide autonomous rights and privileges.  Therefore, it began to be called "Shite" - a fortress that has the title of a city.  Some towers and walls that can be seen in modern Carcassonne contain traces of Gallo-Roman masonry.  After the weakening of the empire, the fortress became one of the strongholds of the Visigoth kingdom.  They built their own walls on Roman foundations.  In addition, the Visigothic emperor Theodoric ordered the construction of a basilica.  In 725, the Carcassonne was captured by the Saracens.  Legends about this period attribute the appearance of the name of the city to this time.  Allegedly, when the citadel besieged Charlemagne, the wife of the Saracen king, Dama Karkas, cunningly forced him to withdraw the troops.  In fact, the dominion of the Arabs lasted only until 759, when they were expelled from these lands by Pipin Korotky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress Carcassonne France" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1715013.jpg" width="600"></div>

But since they had neither the means nor the ability to control the city directly, the counts began to do it instead.  But all of them were petty seniors who did not influence the development of their possessions too much.  But when, from the eleventh century, Carcassonne belonged to the powerful Viscount family of Trenkavely through marriage to the heiress of the last counts, the city changed.  A castle was built there, and the dilapidated fortifications were repaired.  They surrounded the citadel with a ring.  Under the rule of the Trenkavels, the city reached its political and cultural heyday.  The Viscounts were vassals of the Count of Toulouse and King of Barcelona. </p><h2>  Epic of the Cathars </h2><p>  The walled city of Carcassonne is known for its role in the so-called Albiguian Crusade.  Its rulers were tolerant of Christian dissidents of the time, whom the Roman Catholic Church called heretic Cathars.  Trenkaveli showed them honor and respect and refused to give them to the crusaders.  In August 1209, an army led by the papal legate Arno-Amori took control of the city.  Raymond-Roger Trenkavel, who went to negotiate with the besiegers, was captured and then poisoned.  The new viscount was declared the leader of the Crusade Simon de Montfort.  All residents were expelled from the city in one-piece shirts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="City fortress Carcassonne" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1715022.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The era of French rule and the Inquisition </h2><p>  When the crusaders captured Carcassonne, the fortress became the outpost of the capture of Occitania.  Simon de Montfort further strengthened her.  Only his allies and nobles and merchants loyal to him were allowed to settle in Shite.  All other residents of the city were to be built in the vicinity.  In fact, in those days, Carcassonne was not fortified for defense against external enemies, but to prevent the revolt of the Occitan.  In the forties of the thirteenth century, the son of Raymond-Roger tried to storm the city, but he did not succeed, and he was forced to flee to the <span>kingdom of Aragon.</span>  In 1247, the fortress passed under the control of the French.  After the establishment of the Inquisition in Occitania, the city became one of the outposts of the new religious police.  Here appears a special prison for heretics - Moore.  Until now, the guides show the so-called Tower of the Inquisition.  From it one could see the place where the heretics were burned at the stake on the banks of the river Aude. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress carcassonne france city description" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1715015.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The following years.  The restoration of the ensemble </h2><p>  In the middle of the thirteenth century, the fortress of Carcassonne became a border between France and Aragon.  It became so impregnable that during the Hundred Years War the British troops could not take it by storm.  This failed the army of the Huguenots during the religious conflicts of the sixteenth century.  But after 1659, when the entire territory of the province of Roussillon began to belong to France, the border moved to the west, and the significance of Carcassonne markedly decreased.  Fortifications were abandoned.  The city of Carcassonne fell into decline.  The fortress at the time of Napoleon was a rather miserable sight.  The government even decided to tear it down.  But the famous writer Prosper Merimee led a real public campaign to save the medieval heritage.  A little later, the restoration of the historical monument began, headed by the most famous specialist in medieval architecture of the time, Viole-le-Duc. </p><h2>  What does modern Shite look like? </h2><p>  Although the restoration of the old city gave it a not very authentic look, this work was recognized as a genius.  Now the Carcassonne fortress with its architectural ensemble since 1997 is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Administratively, all historical monuments are divided between different owners.  Walls, the castle of counts, towers and fortifications are the property of the state.  They are classified as monuments of national importance.  And the rest of Shite belongs to the municipality.  Narrow medieval streets, squares and restaurants styled in the Middle Ages give the city a special charm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Carcassonne fortress reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1715025.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Major Attractions </h2><p>  Carcassonne Fortress is surrounded by a double belt of fortress walls.  Their total length is about three kilometers.  There are 53 towers and barbicans on the walls in order to protect the city from siege vehicles.  In addition to them, the main attractions of Cite are the castle of counts and the Cathedral of Saints Nazarius and Celsius.  In front of the main entrance to the fortress, in front of the Narbonne Gate, you can see the bas-relief of Ladies Carcass.  The cathedral building is divided into two parts - Romanesque and Gothic.  The exterior of the church is decorated with gargoyles and pinnacles.  The temple also has ancient stained glass windows.  Among the tombstones, the bas-relief in honor of Simon de Montfort is of interest.  The so-called earl castle of the eleventh century has become an archaeological museum.  In addition, on the territory of the citadel there is an exhibition dedicated to the Inquisition, which tells about the history of the tribunal and exhibits instruments of torture. </p><h2>  Carcassonne (castle): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have been here mention this medieval ensemble as an amazing place with an ancient and heroic history.  He is beautiful, "fabulous" and completely immerses the traveler in ancient times, as if making him a participant in the events.  It can be inspected for hours, in all its details.  The city as if descended from a <span>medieval engraving.</span>  No wonder so many historical films were shot here.  From the formidable walls of this fortress, it blows with strength and power.  And this impressive building is surrounded by no less picturesque landscapes. </p>
