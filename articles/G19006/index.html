  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Synthetic detergents</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The production of <span>detergents</span> began during the First World War in Germany.  In Russia, the first powder was released in 1953.  It was called "News" and included products isolated from sperm whale salomas. </p><p>  Synthetic <span>detergents</span> are multicomponent mixtures of substances.  Their aqueous solutions are used to remove impurities.  Synthetic detergents for the most part include (except for the direct detergent components - surfactants) salts of inorganic acids (carbonates, phosphates), which enhance the activity of the mixture.  In addition, the composition of the solutions includes disinfecting and bleaching ingredients, defoamers or foaming agents, colorants, flavorings and others. </p><p>  Surfactants (or surfactants) are organic compounds that have a surface effect.  They are able to form a semi-colloidal solution and foam.  The surface activity of substances helps to reduce surface water tension, thereby increasing the wetting properties of water. </p><p>  Mixtures for cleaning are divided into several types: </p><ol><li>  Alkylammonium chlorides. </li><li>  Alkyl aryl sulfonates. </li><li>  Alkylsulfonates. </li><li>  Alkyl sulfates. </li><li>  Alkyl carbonates (soap). </li></ol><p>  Soap is obtained by processing fatty raw materials.  Sulfonates and sulfates are synthetic detergents.  All of the above mixtures belong to the category of ionic (forming ions) substances.  In an aqueous solution, they decompose (dissociate) into ions. </p><p>  Nonionic mixtures exist.  They do not dissociate in water, but dissolve in it.  This is due to the presence of large quantities of hydrophilic groups (OH, for example) in the molecule. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Non-inogenous surfactants may be of natural or synthetic origin.  The latter are OH drugs, formed <span>by ethylene</span> and phenol <span>oxide</span> , fatty alcohols. </p><p>  Despite the fact that surfactants are the main components that make up synthetic detergents, their washing effect is weak in itself.  In this regard, to enhance activity, alkaline and neutral salts, bleaches, enzymes (enzymes), and foam stabilizers are added to the mixture. </p><p>  Due to the presence of alkaline salts, the colloidal structure and emulsifying ability of solutions are enhanced.  These components contribute to the formation of a stronger film of detergent near the particles of contamination.  In addition, thanks to alkaline salts, water softens and a favorable environment is created for cleansing (washing) of various tissues.  So, for example, for washing linen and cotton products, it is advisable to use strongly alkaline additives (trisodium phosphate, soda). </p><p>  Hexamethophosphate forms a slightly acidic environment in the composition of the detergent.  These conditions are very favorable for washing wool products. </p><p>  <span>Sodium sulfate</span> belongs to the category of fillers.  These components contribute to improving the structure of <span>colloidal solutions.</span>  The use of bleaches as additives eliminates the need for blueing underwear. </p><p>  To stabilize and improve foaming properties in detergents, alkylolamides, foam stabilizers, are used. </p><p>  There are three main types of synthetic detergents.  In washing, powder mixtures are most often used.  Liquid detergents are being introduced into the household chemicals market quite actively today.  Paste mixes are currently not used as often. </p><p>  Among the main consumer properties of washing mixtures, washing, antiresorption (the ability to retain contamination in solution) and foaming activity should be mentioned.  Equally important is <span>the pH</span> of the solution environment. </p>
