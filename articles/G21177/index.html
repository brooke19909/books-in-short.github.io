    <h2>  Station history <strong></strong></h2><p>  Tula metro station was opened in 1983, on November 6.  She became part of the first section of the Serpukhov line "Serpukhovskaya" - "South".  According to the initial draft, it was planned to name the station ‚ÄúDanilovskaya‚Äù, then, in 1991-1992, it was proposed to name it ‚ÄúDanilovsky Monastery‚Äù, but as it was called ‚ÄúTula‚Äù, it did not change its name later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro area Tula" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/403056.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <strong>Description</strong> </h2><p>  Currently, this station is part of the Serpukhov-Timiryazevskaya line.  It is surrounded by such stations as Serpukhovskaya and Nagatinskaya.  Metro Tula is a single-vault station, which has a shallow location.  Its depth is only 9.5 meters.  It was built according to the project developed by famous architects V.P. Kachurinits, N.G. Petukhova and N.I. Shumakov.  A monolithic reinforced concrete structure was used as the main material.  According to similar projects, several other stations were built located near the Tulskaya station.  It has only one platform and two vestibules underground, which are located between Kholodilny Lane and Bolshaya Tula Street.  It is the last shallowest station on the south side. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The lobby is dedicated to the armourers of Tula.  Its track walls are covered with white marble, and the floor with gray granite.  The main decoration is the original lamps in the shape of a rhombus and a carved ornament.  They are installed at the junction of the arch and track walls.  In addition, the edge of the vault is decorated with a peculiar ornament on concrete, consisting of geometric shapes.  Along the center of the platform are benches with pointers located on them.  This is a station without track development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow metro Tula" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/403055.jpg" width="600"></div>
