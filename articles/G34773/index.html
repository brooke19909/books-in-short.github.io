    <h2>  The main "chip" </h2><p>  The <span>Highscreen Ice 2</span> smartphone <span>, an</span> overview of which is presented here, has one distinctive feature - a second screen.  Not the same as the Russian YOTA gadget, but a small one on the rear panel.  But very necessary!  The creeping line mini-display shows the most basic data that users so often need: time, date, battery, basic data from selected applications, notifications of missed calls and messages.  Such a simple thing that so many smartphones lacked!  Now there is no need to constantly turn on the backlight on the phone in order to find out all this data. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone highscreen ice 2 review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1014555.jpg"></div>

In 2009, the company began to produce low-cost smartphones that appealed to many users around the world.  Stable work and high-quality gadgets competed with eminent and long-known brands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen ice 2 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1014553.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The screen size of Highscreen Ice 2, a review of which will be interesting to all potential buyers, is only 4.7 inches.  This is slightly less than the usual five for 2015.  But the lack of these 0.3 inches pays off by the presence of a second screen.  It is located on the back cover, which is made of high-quality non-slip plastic coated with protective glass.  The color rendering of the device is simply excellent, according to experts.  All colors are saturated, bright, but natural.  No yellowness or inappropriate acidity was noted.  Everything is pleasing to the eye.  In addition, the viewing angles of Highscreen Ice 2 Galaxy are extremely successful: no dimming and dropping of color is observed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen ice 2 galaxy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1014552.jpg"></div>

The user can independently choose which information and with what frequency will be shown on the display.  By itself, it is small - 23 by 5 mm.  But this is quite enough.  Moreover, the smartphone does not ‚Äúeat‚Äù the battery from this.  That is, the second display is very ergonomic, even if the data transfer frequency is set to the maximum.  Highscreen Ice 2, reviews of which will be presented below, precisely thanks to the second screen compares favorably with its competitors in its price category. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  All users unanimously conclude that the Highscreen Ice 2 smartphone, the review of which is useful to study before buying, looks very unusual and beautiful.  Rear <span>protective glass</span> (Corning <span>Gorilla Glass of the</span> third generation) allows you to protect your smartphone from damage during careless use.  For example, in the fall.  By the way, not many companies use Corning Gorilla Glass for the back cover.  The front glass is also made of this material.  The color scheme is presented in four shades: blue (noble dark), white, gray and black.  The speaker is located at the bottom of the rear panel, in the middle.  This provides a uniform and fairly loud sound.  The main camera is located in the upper left corner, which is also very convenient.  The brand name is displayed on the entire back panel.  And since it is rather big in itself, it looks very beautiful and stylish.  Smartphone Highscreen Ice 2 really looks very different from its competitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen ice 2 case" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1014551.jpg" width="306"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  But he is far from perfect.  Manufacturers installed on the device a slightly outdated eight-core MediaTek MT6592 processor with a clock frequency of 1.7 Hz.  By the way, it smooths out such an unpleasant moment.  Due to the high frequency, the gadget works perfectly.  All modern demanding games and applications work quickly and without lags.  It is noteworthy that the Highscreen Ice 2 Galaxy smartphone has proven itself with multitasking.  Applications even in the background work stably, without causing discomfort to the user.  And all the necessary alerts can be seen on the second display if desired. </p><h2>  Device memory </h2><p>  Phone Highscreen Ice 2 has a RAM of 2 GB.  This is already the standard indicator for 2015.  Modern applications and games require more and more RAM, so its presence is really necessary.  And here the Russian-Chinese smartphone did not disappoint.  Even very demanding game settings work without any problems.  Yes, and applications, too.  Although some still have to manually "slightly downgrade" the settings.  Built-in <span>external memory</span> for storing information in a smartphone 16 GB.  And this is also a standard indicator.  Those who lack the declared 16 GB (of which about 14 GB are available) will benefit from a memory card slot.  More precisely, the slot is dual - it can be used either for an SD card, or for a second SIM card.  At the discretion of the user. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone highscreen ice 2" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1015676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  External camera </h2><p>  Here, too, everything is quite standard and expected - 13 megapixels.  The camera itself is slightly recessed into the back cover, but a metal edging protrudes above it so that the pictures do not turn out to be illuminated.  Next to the camera is a noise canceler and speaker.  Everything together works perfectly.  Pictures are obtained in high definition, without unnecessary noise and distortion.  Of course, one cannot compare with flagship cameras, since Highscreen Ice 2 has a matrix that is not the strongest.  But the pictures are still high-quality and beautiful.  Autofocus works smoothly, without braking and freezing, shooting modes are enough with the head.  Those who need more effects should pay attention to photo editors. </p><h2>  Front-camera </h2><p>  But it is small - 2 megapixels.  Highscreen Ice 2 Blue, like any other in this series, does not allow you to take the most clear selfies.  But this is enough for video communication.  And with a solid hand and proper lighting and selfies, they turn out to be high enough for 2 megapixels.  Photo editors can give vague photos a special charm.  And by the way, the standard settings for this are quite enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone highscreen ice 2 galaxy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1014549.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Communication standards </h2><p>  Well, here, too, is not too modern - there is no support for 4G and LTE.  All previous ones are supported without problems.  Of course, new communication standards are not yet working everywhere in Russia, but this moment is just around the corner, so the lack of 4G can be considered a serious minus for Highscreen Ice 2 (Gray, Blue, White or Black).  This will be missed in a year or two. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Its capacity is 2500 mAh.  In general, a good result, given the fact that there are still two screens.  Let one and very ergonomic.  With such a processor and maximum brightness, the battery screen is enough.  It is noteworthy that with the Internet constantly turned on (wireless Wi-Fi or built-in 3G) and the phone‚Äôs average workload, the charge lasts all day.  So, rushing around in search of an outlet in which case you do not have to.  Well, those who play games all the time can be advised to purchase an external drive, which will always be at hand. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Many modern manufacturers have begun to significantly save on this.  But Highscreen Ice 2, reviews of which will help you make the right choice, compares favorably with today.  So, in the company box are: </p><ul><li>  Detailed instructions in several languages ‚Äã‚Äã(including Russian). </li><li>  A clip for opening a memory card slot and a SIM card. </li><li>  Stereo headset (about it will be a little lower). </li><li>  Charger (‚Äúplug‚Äù itself). </li><li>  USB cable (aka wire to the ‚Äúplug‚Äù). </li><li>  Smartphone. </li></ul><p>  The box itself is made of thick cardboard, which shows a model in ice haze (Ice is all the same).  It looks impressive and presentable. </p><h2>  About the headset </h2><p>  Most often, users save on it.  But not Highscreen.  This is a really high-quality headset that you don‚Äôt want to change to another.  It fits comfortably in your ear, provides good sound.  And with the correct <span>equalizer setting</span> in the media player, a very good music player is obtained.  And this is also very important for many users.  For the headset, you can separately purchase replaceable pads. </p><h2>  Reviews of specialists </h2><p>  Many experts who have already tested the smartphone against all possible criteria rate it out of four out of five possible points.  Still, the lack of a good processor makes itself felt.  But in terms of design, the device gets the highest score - none of the competing manufacturers have this.  Which made the Highscreen Ice 2 smartphone so popular among Russian buyers.  Experts were satisfied with the gadget, since it justifies its cost (14-16 thousand rubles) no worse than its competitors. </p><h2>  Opinions bought </h2><p>  Many people liked the budget smartphone first with its unusual design, and then with the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù.  Even if she is somewhat mediocre and not always reaching the flagship ones, she fully fulfills her money.  There are no dissatisfied.  Both girls and young people who bought the described model were left with a good impression.  For daily needs, the smartphone is enough, and no one expects more from it. </p><p>  In addition, the weight and dimensions of the device make it also convenient.  So, the smoothed corners with a 4.7-inch screen allow the smartphone to comfortably lie in the hand of both men and women.  And even a teenager.  Due to the fact that the back cover is covered with glass, there are no fingerprints on it.  And if it remains, they are easy to remove from the surface.  The screen is the same.  In this case, the protective film still needs to be glued.  Many girls note that with the active use of the smartphone, the glass eventually scratches from the nails.  This point is worth considering.  Some city dwellers did not like the lack of 4G, but overall, the availability of Wi-Fi at hand mitigated this drawback. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to pick up a cover for Highscreen Ice 2, as it might seem at first glance.  The Russian-Chinese company made sure that customers were satisfied.  To date, there are many models of covers, bumpers, pads and rear panels for the smartphone.  Therefore, to make it outwardly even more unusual is possible, if there is a desire.  Covers differ from others in that they have a special slot for a second screen.  And this gives a special charm, according to some buyers. </p>
