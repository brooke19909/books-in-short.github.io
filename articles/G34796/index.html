But it also happens that they are not familiar to everyone, but only to local residents who honor the memory of their heroes.  Senior lieutenant of the police Petushkov Vasily Timofeevich is one of those whose name is well known in South Tushin (Moscow) thanks to old-timers and cadets of the police college, who are equal to the best in the profession. </p>

    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  The whole life path of the hero is a biography of thousands of the same girls and boys born in the 20s who grew up and experienced difficulties with their country.  He was only a little more conscientious and more honest than many.  His homeland is the Kaluga region, a small village Sergeevo.  Born in 1925, he was accustomed to work from childhood, helped elders in the field and on the farm.  Having lost his parents early, he went to Leningrad to enter FZU in order to learn how to become a locksmith.  Here he found war, and from the age of 16 the guy worked at the factory, participating in defensive works.  For this, he will subsequently be awarded the medal "For the Defense of Leningrad." </p><p>  In 1942, the school was evacuated to Yaroslavl.  Vasily Petushkov, whose biography is described by N. Sizov in the book ‚ÄúChevro Code‚Äù, will remember very well how during the shelling on the railroad the masters closed their pupils with their bodies.  And he will live by measuring every step with the human feat of the older generation.  After the war, the young man began his career at the Vympel plant in Moscow, became the leader of the Komsomol cell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Way to the police </h2><p>  After working at the plant for 4 years, Vasily Petushkov married a girl named Lydia.  He, as the secretary of the Komsomol committee, was invited to move from the hostel to his own apartment.  But he lost it to those who languished in line for more than ten years.  Perhaps it was this act that became decisive when the wife decided to go to another.  She wanted to live well, and he honestly.  He learns about this step of his beloved woman in the army, where he will go according to the Komsomol recruitment in order to become a military man.  Having served in Smolensk, he will receive the rank of captain, leading the Komsomol members of the battalion, and then the regiment. </p><p>  Returning to Tushino, which in those years was part of the Moscow region, Petushkov went to the city party.  It was the 1956th.  Secretary of the city party committee Vasily Pushkarev spoke about the prevalence of hooliganism and the difficulties in working with youth, recommending the former soldier to go to work in the police.  The local police service also helped solve the housing problem, so Vasily Petushkov ended up in the 129th police station, becoming an inspector at one of the most difficult sections, which people often called the ‚Äúzone‚Äù among themselves. </p><h2>  Police Service </h2><p>  The handsome dark-haired man with a tanned face, on which attentive eyes stood out under a hat of thick eyebrows, was not long left alone.  He soon got married.  The new wife Lyubov Andreevna gave birth to a son, Yuri, who turned three years old on the eve of the tragic events.  Petushkov Vasily plunges into the work with his head.  He likes clarity, laconicism, military discipline.  Having thoroughly studied the special contingent on his site, he realizes that it is impossible to deal with drunks, rowdy and hooligans alone, therefore he relies on voluntary people's squads (DND) and public courts, which attracts working youth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For several years, Vasily Petushkov turns into an outstanding investigator.  In hot pursuit, he manages to investigate the theft, remove the murder charges from one of his charges, and identify the thieves in the hosiery factory.  His authority among the population becomes so significant that he does not dare to deceive people's expectations and change jobs.  A lecture hall of legal knowledge begins to work on the territory, for the district police officer is convinced: the main thing is not to punish the offender, but to prevent the offense. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the feat </h2><p>  On January 13, 1962, on the eve of the holiday, which the country traditionally celebrated for many years, Petushkov was urgently summoned to a dormitory located on his site, where citizen G. rowdied. His wife managed to escape, but two children remained hostage to the drunken spouse.  Leaving home, Petushkov dialed Lyubov Andreevna‚Äôs phone to report that he was leaving a sleeping child at home in the hope of her returning from work soon.  Nobody knew that this would be their last conversation in life. </p><p>  Together with the operative and combatants, they arrived at the hostel, where the neighbors in fear told about the presence of a hunting shotgun with a bully.  Negotiations failed.  On the contrary, hearing about the arrival of the police, citizen G. began to threaten reprisals against the children.  Their cry was heard.  Without a second's hesitation, the senior lieutenant knocked the door open with an ax and burst into the room.  A shot at point-blank he was mortally wounded, but the operatives managed to neutralize the villain. </p>

    <h2>  Afterword </h2><p>  Posthumously Petushkov Vasily Timofeevich will be awarded the Order of the Red Star, and Factory Street will be renamed to the street named after him.  But more important than the awards is the human love that the ordinary district inspector has earned from the residents of his neighborhood.  Thousands of fellow citizens came to his funeral, who later gathered in the House of Culture, where the trial of citizen G. will be held to support the decision on an exceptional measure of punishment for the killer. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the wife and son will follow in the footsteps of their loved one.  Lyubov Andreevna will begin to work in the police and will rise to the rank of colonel.  Yuri, the father of three children, will graduate <span>from a police</span> high <span>school</span> in Omsk, but will continue to work as the director of the orphanage.  On the territory of the microdistrict there is a police college, where they honor the memory of all the heroes who sacrificed their lives in the performance of professional duty and where there is a corner of their memory.  And the site contains verses by an unknown author: </p><p>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not customary for us to pray for cops, <br>  They are sometimes not considered for people. <br>  But somewhere the finger pulls the trigger, <br>  And he takes someone‚Äôs bullet of operas ... " </p>
