    <h2>  A little about the city of Mytishchi </h2><p>  Mytishchi is not the smallest city located in the north-east of the capital, at a distance of about 19 kilometers from its center.  A striking landmark and definition is that the city of Mytishchi is located on the Yauza River, being <span>a satellite city of Moscow.</span>  The population exceeds 200 thousand people, increasing every year by several thousand.  This happens not only due to natural growth, but also due to the migration of state residents.  Arriving citizens need to live somewhere and the new building ‚ÄúLeader Park‚Äù provides an excellent opportunity for this. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  In the northern part of the city of Mytishchi, in microdistrict 17A, not far from Volkovskoye Shosse, at a distance of about five kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road, the Leader Park residential complex is located.  You can get to it in various ways.  If you drive on personal vehicles, then from MKAD turn onto Yaroslavskoye Shosse, then onto Olimpiysky Prospekt and follow to Projected Drive No. 6450. Another option is also to turn off from MKAD onto Volkovskoye Shosse.  The road will directly lead to the above passage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the complex, located in the city of Mytishchi (Moscow region), can be easily reached by train, which will stop at the station with the same name of the city.  And, accordingly, there is public transport in the form of fixed-route taxis and buses. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  In total, the developer designed six 17-story buildings, which are being erected with monolithic-brick buildings.  They will have an apartment fund providing for apartments from studios to three-room apartments.  Thus, each potential buyer will be able to find housing for themselves to their taste and budget.  The smallest apartments will be 27 square meters, the largest - a little more than 91 square meters.  In total, the project provides for 3184 apartments. </p>

    <p>  In the Leader Park residential complex, not only residential buildings will be built, but also all the necessary social infrastructure facilities so that its residents do not have to travel to the capital or the city center of Mytishchi for the goods and services they need.  Also in the apartments will be all the necessary communications, glazing of windows and balconies.  Finishing is provided by the developer, both finishing and without its implementation.  Silent elevators will deliver residents to the floor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Not all <span>Mytishchi, new buildings</span> from the builder, can boast that they offer their future residents accommodation in the zone with the most favorable environmental conditions.  Sometimes residential buildings are located near industrial enterprises, where the air is filled with exhaust pipes.  But this does not apply to the Leader Park residential complex. </p><p>  It is just surrounded by a forest in the form of the most beautiful forest parks of Pirogovsky and Elk Island.  Near the complex there are also <span>reservoirs: Rupasovskie ponds,</span> Klyazminskoe, Pirogovskoe, Pyalovskoe, Uchinskoe, Pestovskoe and Ikshinskoe reservoirs.  Together, this gives the residents of the complex a real opportunity to enjoy the fresh air all the time, without having to go specifically to the countryside on rare weekends.  The absence of a number of industrial enterprises provides an ecological idyll.  And many may think that they live outside the city. </p>

    <h2>  Layout of apartments and their cost </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Mytishchi (Moscow region) offer many new buildings.  But among them it stands out precisely LCD "Leader Park".  Its developer has provided for almost all the needs of its future residents and buyers of apartments, having designed various housing options: from small studios to fairly spacious three-room apartments.  Studio size starts at 22 square meters.  The size of a three-room apartment is on average about 90 square meters. </p><p>  As for the cost of housing, the LCD "Leader Park" offers quite affordable prices.  They begin in the region of 70 thousand per square meter.  And their maximum cost is 115 thousand per square meter.  As a rule, studios and one-room apartments are valued more than others. </p><h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  You can find negative reviews about the Leader Park residential complex, which is primarily due to the long-term construction of the first stage of construction.  The developer was supposed to rent the house back in 2015.  However, in fact, apartment owners received keys from them only at the beginning of 2017.  The entire project is planned for delivery at the end of 2018. </p><p>  On the positive side, low housing prices were noted.  In addition, the city of Mytishchi borders on the metropolis, therefore the complex is in good transport accessibility, which also makes it promising for the purchase of residential real estate. </p>

    <h2>  Own infrastructure of the complex </h2><p>  The complex is planned as a large-scale project, so the developer has designed its own infrastructure of the complex.  It will include four kindergartens, three secondary schools, sports and playgrounds.  The first floors of residential buildings are planned non-residential, they will be given to owners and tenants to accommodate various objects of social infrastructure: shops, pharmacies, office premises, hotels, spa.  For owners of their own vehicles, the builder plans to build an underground parking and ground guest parking. </p><p>  So that the residents of the complex located in Mytishchi (new buildings from the builder) feel as comfortable as possible, the courtyard area will be landscaped, and the entrances to the houses will be most conveniently located.  Walking areas will be provided on the territory of the complex so that you can take a walk after a hard working day or at the weekend. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  Mytishchi is far from the smallest city in the Moscow region.  Therefore, all possible infrastructure facilities are present in it.  Until they have built their own, apartment owners who have moved permanently to the complex can use the city infrastructure.  Nearby is a school, a kindergarten, many shops and hypermarkets. </p>

    <p>  Mytishchi also offers its residents and guests a water park, sports and fitness centers, an ice palace, a beach volleyball stadium and a karting track.  There is a house of culture, a leisure park, squares - all that may be required for a comfortable life and good rest. </p><h2>  Complex developer </h2><p>  The developer of the LCD "Leader Park" in the documents indicated LLC "Leader M".  Its founder (100%) and the head is Roman Lyabikhov.  In his possession is another 79 various organizations, which, in turn, form a development brand - GK "Leader Group". </p><p>  The history of this developer began in 1992, when he built his first industrial facility.  It was built in St. Petersburg.  After that, after 10 years, the company began to engage in the implementation of residential projects, and since 2012 it entered the <span>construction market in Moscow</span> and Moscow Region. </p><p>  But the undertaking cannot yet be considered successful, since over the past five years only one object has been commissioned - the Mendeleev residential complex.  But the company does not stand still.  At least the project portfolio currently has 5 projects.  Each of them is a separate obligation to buyers of apartments. </p><p>  Thus, from the pros and cons of this residential complex, the following can be distinguished.  The advantage will be a fairly close location to the capital, the relatively inexpensive cost of housing, excellent environmental conditions, which not every new building in the Moscow region can boast of.  Of the minuses, it is worth noting the too long obligation of the developer to put the complex into operation.  Also a minus is the underdeveloped infrastructure. </p>
