  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tyzyl Gorge: location, description with photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This unique gorge is one of the most beautiful and picturesque.  It is strewn with magnificent alpine meadows, beautiful flowers and wonderful waterfalls.  To this day, this area is almost untouched by the earth, because for various reasons people almost never visit it.  There are too small and simple slopes for lovers of downhill skiing, and in addition, until 2009, cars did not pass into these places due to road crashes. </p><p>  The article provides information about one of the most beautiful gorges - Tyzyl, located on the territory of Kabardino-Balkaria. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landscapes of the Tyzyl Gorge" class="if uuid-2940518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2940518.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Kabardino-Balkaria is a part of Russia, where a huge number of amazing natural beauties and historical monuments are concentrated in a relatively small territory.  One of the most picturesque and interesting places of the republic and the entire North Caucasus is the Baksan Gorge, which owes its name to the Baksan River, which extends 165 kilometers and originates in the glaciers of Elbrus.  Cutting through several ranges (Bokova, Melova, and Skalisty) and then flowing along the Kabardian plain, Baksan flows into Malka, which carries its waters into the Terek River.  On the right bank of the river.  Baksan (at the exit of the gorge to the flat terrain), flowing through the Baksan district of Kabardino-Balkaria, the village of Dygyulybgey (the administrative center of the district) is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In one of the most beautiful and unique gorges of the region and the entire Kabardino-Balkaria (Tyzylskoye) you can drive along the road that goes through Gundelen.  Unfortunately or fortunately, this gorge is rarely visited and little known among tourists, but it is no less beautiful and picturesque than the famous Baksan gorge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="buhankatur.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picturesque landscapes" class="if uuid-2940536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2940536.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the path to the gorge </h2><p>  The Tyzyl Gorge, located in Kabardino-Balkaria, is one of the most beautiful places.  Just a few years ago, a quite well-maintained road, in many places today it breaks off, washed away by mudflows.  The upper reaches of Tyzyl were inaccessible even in Soviet times.  Today, there are areas where the human foot has not set foot for more than a decade.  The nightmares crumbled and decayed from the weather and time, and the roads passing next to them were overgrown with impassable nettles of enormous growth.  In some places, they completely disappeared, completely merging with the surrounding landscape. </p><p>  If you make your way in transport, you have to go in a continuous sea of ‚Äã‚Äãdense green plants, completely hiding the car.  Such a trip is a little pleasure, since it is not known what obstacle you will encounter again.  But you can‚Äôt go far on foot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorge waterfalls" class="if uuid-2940527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2940527.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Tyzyl Gorge, starting from the village of Kendelen, can be reached by a road running through the <span>Baksan Gorge.</span>  Having passed from Baksan‚Äôs side through the rather long village of Zayukovo, at the monument to the ‚ÄúMourning Highlander‚Äù you should turn right and follow the road that leads to the Balkarian village of Kendelen.  It is located along the banks of a rapid mountain river and is surrounded by picturesque cliffs of mountains. </p><p>  Having passed through the village, you immediately find yourself at the beginning of the intended point.  In the Tyzyl Gorge located in Kabardino-Balkaria, reminiscent of the American prairies presented in Hollywood films about Indians, it is breathtaking.  After the village water intake, the gorge narrows, and then for about 20 kilometers there are cliffs hanging on both sides, decorated with fabulous waterfalls and a forest.  This breathtaking sight causes a feeling of unique delight, which then does not let go for a long time.  All the way along the gorge is accompanied by natural attractions, including waterfalls, canyons, caves, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viktorkotl.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorge caves" class="if uuid-2940530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2940530.jpg"></div><h2>  Burial grounds and caves </h2><p>  In the Tyzyl Gorge, a large number of burial grounds were discovered, which mostly belonged to the Koban culture dating back to the periods of the Bronze (XII-IV century BC) and the Iron centuries (VII-III centuries BC).  These are small and very low in height caves (from 0.5 meters and a little higher), located one above the other.  According to their structure and nature, it becomes clear that these burial grounds were cut out manually, since neighboring rocks similar in structure do not have such holes. </p><p>  Not far from the burial grounds there are caves of natural origin, striking in their size.  Once a residential refuge, they are fenced with stone masonry (thickness - 1 meter, height - 2-3 meters).  It turns out that in ancient times, human life proceeded here. </p>
