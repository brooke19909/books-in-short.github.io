Blouses, skirts, wraps, stoles, bathing suits and even boots are made using this wonderful ornament.  The grace and beauty of products made in this way of knitting pleases the eye, while striking in its simplicity.  Only true craftswomen are able to make products in a similar style.  Previously, ordinary residents of villages and villages spent the whole day only diligently knitting beautiful patterns for rich nobles, queens, etc.  Antique lace is very popular today and there is an explanation for this - it is extremely beautiful! </p><p>  In fact, ribbon lace is quite difficult to make for one simple reason.  In this matter, special skill is required, which is very difficult to master, you need to have some kind of talent.  But with a great desire, you can learn ribbon lace from scratch by crocheting a regular cloth consisting of beautiful lace ribbons.  There are a great variety of options for the implementation of such products, so get ready for experiments! </p><p>  The more carefully you make ribbon lace, the better.  Indeed, the beautiful appearance and accuracy of the product depends on this.  Tapes are not always symmetrical to each other and require careful bonding.  It also happens that the elements of a product made according to the same pattern have a different structure as a result ‚Äî some loose, others more rigid, etc. </p><p>  For the formation of lace, it is better to take motives that have an even number of rows.  If in this way to perform this beautiful crochet - ribbon lace called - then every time we will return to the middle.  Then, without breaking the thread, it will be easy to move on to another element.  Products that consist entirely of ribbon lace are considered quite difficult to execute, because all motifs should always be the same in size.  To do this, you need to accurately calculate the size of the motifs so that they fit the pattern. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The connection of finished tapes in the process of stitching or knitting at certain points so that the fabric is not subjected to deformation, is also technically difficult.  To facilitate the implementation of products that repeat the complex contours of the finished pattern, it is necessary to clearly combine ribbons and mesh.  Any change in the contour of the tape to the width of the grid for the pattern is made by adding and decreasing a certain amount in the row of rapports.  The grid also helps to emphasize the texture of lace, the expressiveness of all motifs of the pattern.  This effect can be enhanced by knitting lace ribbons with a crochet that is thinner than knitting a net.  The mesh and tape must be connected with single crochet columns or with a hitch.  To do this, remove the hook from the loop and insert it into the loop of the lace, into the one with which the mesh needs to be connected.  Grab the thread and broach.  Your <span>crochet</span> ribbon <span>lace is</span> done. </p><p>  Another kind of ribbon lace is the so-called needle lace.  To get the desired pattern, you just need to lay it out of the finished ribbon.  How to make it?  You will need a silk braid, along the edges of which there are small loops - the ‚Äúcentipede‚Äù.  The loops around the edges of such a ‚Äúcentipede‚Äù are quite convenient to connect to each other, capturing them with a needle.  You can use any kind of braid or cord.  The choice depends on the material and type of product that you are going to make or on its purpose, if the product is a single one.  For knitting, it is better to take kapron threads - they are stronger.  For work, you will also need thick paper or oilcloth, a needle, tracing paper. </p><p>  How to make lace?  Put the pattern on the tracing paper and bast it with the usual basting seam.  Where the braid intersects, manually fasten it with a short, inconspicuous stitch (back to needle stitch).  Large gaps can be hidden with the help of brides.  After this, decorative seams are applied. </p><p>  Create beauty with your own hands! </p>
