Someone wants to live in comfort, having a luxury yacht and an apartment with a view of the Kremlin, other people are forced to look for money to educate children, others want to start their own business, but they do not have start-up capital.  What does a person do to solve his financial problems?  Naturally, it takes them to a credit institution. </p><h2>  The bank specializes in granting loans and credit. </h2><p>  For many, a loan at Sberbank is the only way out.  Why the choice in most cases falls precisely on this <span>financial structure?</span> </p>

    <p>  First of all, because it has an impeccable business reputation, which has been developed over many decades.  Moreover, in the arsenal of a banking institution there are several lending programs that are quite attractive from the point of view of benefits, and each person can choose the most suitable option for himself. </p><p>  Of course, a loan at Sberbank is a somewhat "dreary" procedure, since few people like to collect documents to receive money.  However, bankers in no case do not want to incur financial losses, therefore, make special demands on borrowers.  Often there are situations when the most conscientious customers are refused to issue money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At present, a loan in Sberbank for a large amount cannot be executed without interim measures, that is, a pledge agreement, the object of which, as a rule, is securities and real estate. </p><h2>  Requirements </h2><p>  Surely many people know that any financial structure does not borrow money "to anybody."  For example, a loan at Sberbank is issued to people who have Russian citizenship or are in the status of non-residents, but have received an official right to live and work in our country. </p>

    <p>  There are also age restrictions.  Persons over 21 years old can count on a loan.  In this case, citizens over 60 years of age, as a rule, are denied a loan, but they have the opportunity to take advantage of a special lending program.  Bank employees are also always scrupulously studying the borrower's labor activity.  For example, you plan to apply for loans at Sberbank.  Lending conditions stipulate that you must work at one enterprise for at least six months.  Remember this.  Also, your total work experience over the past five years should be at least one year. </p><p>  And, of course, in order to get a loan at Sberbank, the terms of which in some cases are disadvantageous for the client, it is necessary that the person has an impeccable credit history.  If it suddenly turns out that in the past you made a loan at another financial institution and did not always make timely payments to repay it, then do not be surprised when a Sberbank employee refuses you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  In order for you to get a loan without any delay, take care in advance of collecting the documents that are needed for its execution. </p>

    <p>  First of all, they will require an identity document (copy and original) from you.  You will also be required to provide a copy of the work book, which must be pre-certified by the employer.  In addition, you must provide the employees of the credit institution a certificate of income (2-PIT).  Of course, in order to get a loan from a bank, you must have an appropriate salary level. </p><p>  It should be noted that each lending program provides an individual list of necessary documents, you can find out information about this in the advertising materials of Sberbank. </p><h2>  Guarantors </h2><p>  Currently, credit institutions are actively using the guarantee institution to minimize their financial losses.  However, there are certain nuances. </p>

    <p>  For those who are interested in how to get a loan from Sberbank without guarantors, there is only one good news: if we are talking about an amount not exceeding 45,000 rubles, then no ‚Äúguarantors‚Äù are needed. </p><p>  In the case when a person expects to receive from 45,000 to 300,000 rubles, he must enlist the support of one guarantor.  If the client needs up to 700,000 thousand rubles, then he must bring two guarantors, well, and when he needs a larger amount of money - three people should act as guarantors of the borrower's financial viability.  At the same time, your income level should not be lower than theirs.  It should also be noted that a financial institution, issuing a loan in a large amount (from 300,000 rubles), will require the transfer of property as a pledge. </p><p>  In any case, a large loan at Sberbank without guarantors is more a myth than a reality. </p><h2>  How to weigh the pros and cons </h2><p>  Before deciding whether to borrow money from a bank, you should carefully think through everything and make all payments.  When making loan commitments, you must remember that your earnings should be enough to pay off debt, which should be paid on time.  Otherwise, you can dig a deep debt hole for yourself. </p>

    <p>  So, you want to decide whether or not you need a loan at Sberbank.  You can calculate the ‚Äúpotential‚Äù of this idea using a special calculator that you can use on the official Internet portal of Sberbank.  To use this tool, you will need to enter the address of your residence, indicate the approximate size of the loan and the term for its repayment. </p><p>  Surely many people thought about how much the loan at Sberbank would cost.  You can calculate any loan option today, be it a mortgage or a consumer loan.  If you are satisfied with the results of the calculation, then do not put the matter in a long box and proceed to the collection of documents specified in the booklet of the lending program. </p><h2>  The most relevant types of lending </h2><p>  Today, a huge number of people, including those of retirement age, draw up a consumer loan with a low income level.  For the use of cash in rubles, the borrower must pay 19% per annum and 14% per annum in foreign currency.  The loan term is designed for 5 years. </p><p>  Also, at present, many customers take loans for urgent needs, because its conditions do not imply a search for guarantors and registration of property as a pledge.  The rate is 21% in ruble terms and 15% in foreign currency.  The loan period is 5 years. </p><p>  Before you apply for a loan, carefully analyze all the conditions for its provision, in order to avoid paying fines, penalties and forfeits in the future. </p>
