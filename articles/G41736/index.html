Italy, ski resort Livigno</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Few ski enthusiasts know where Livigno (Italy) is located.  The map shows that the resort is so close to Switzerland that it is difficult to determine at a glance which state it belongs to.  However, Livigno is known not only among avid skiers or snowboarders.  Shopaholics around the world also know this place, because by a lucky chance, the villages of this ski area also enjoy the right of duty-free trade.  So here, among other things, you can perfectly buy, especially alcohol and ski equipment.  What other pleasures does the resort offer?  How to get there?  Which track to choose?  You will learn the answers to all these questions from this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Livigno italy" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/367099.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Resort History </h2><p>  The ski area itself is quite young, but the villages of which it consists are old.  San Antonio, Santa Maria and San Rocco have a lot to see - 16th-century churches with frescoes, patriarchal houses and cobbled streets.  As the name implies, Livigno (Italy), there were frequent avalanches.  Despising the danger to life, the area was mastered by smugglers.  Along with the illegal transportation of goods, they developed distillery cattle breeding.  And since the lords had a hand in the development of highland lands, they looked through their fingers at the smuggling pranks of their subjects.  And so it happened that even during the reign of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, duty-free trade flourished here.  And from the 70s of the last century, ski infrastructure began to develop.  Three villages as a result merged into one resort.  The ski area continues to ramp up.  Every year new ski lifts, hotels and restaurants open, new slopes appear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy ski resort livigno" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/367100.jpg?1396722244971" width="316"></div>

The resort is 35 kilometers from Bormio and 220 kilometers from Milan Airport.  From the capital of Lombardy you have to go by train to Tirano, and from there by bus to Livigno.  You can drive up to the Italian resort from Switzerland.  Therefore, many consider the starting point of Zurich Airport.  Especially easy is the way by your own or rented car - almost all the time by autobahn.  But the Forkola di Livigno pass (2315 m) is open only in the summer; at other times of the year, the resort from Switzerland can only be reached through the Mount La Chera tunnel.  Only one road - through the Foscagno Pass pass - offers Italy.  The Livigno ski resort is located just a few kilometers from the Swiss border, not far from the Zernets resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Livigno italy reviews" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/367101.jpg?1396722294243" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Transport communication inside the ski area </h2><p>  Free buses (green and blue routes) run through the three villages that make up the ski area.  They connect Livigno with Bagni Vecchio and Nuovi, Val di Dentro and Pontresina.  These beads go with enviable regularity from 7.30 in the morning until eight in the evening.  In addition, owners of a six-day ski pass can take the special bus Livigno (Italy) - Engadin (Switzerland) and test their strength on the northern slopes of the Alps.  The same ticket gives you the opportunity to ride on the tracks in San Colombano, Santa Caterina and Bormio.  But in Livigno itself there are more than a hundred kilometers of pistes.  They are divided into three regions: Carozello, Motolino and Val Federia (this last one is on the other side of the ridge). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Livigno italy map" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/367105.jpg?1396722370794" width="600"></div>

But he had already caught up with world leaders such as Courchevel, Montafon, Saalbach-Hinteglemm, Val d'Isere and <span>Madonna di Campiglio.</span>  The popularity of this place is largely facilitated by duty-free trade, which puts this Italian resort on a par with Andorra.  In 2012, Livigno was awarded the World Snow Avard Award and received the prestigious title ‚ÄúThe Best Vacation Destination in Europe‚Äù.  Every year in December, the Sqambeda international cross-country skiing marathon takes place here, because Livigno has more than 60 kilometers of tracks for this sport.  It is clear that the rest of the infrastructure - hotels, restaurants, ski schools, entertainment apr√®s ski - is at the highest level.  There is something to do here for snowboarders, climbers, dog sledding enthusiasts.  Not far from Livigno there is a beautiful lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Livigno italy hotels" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/367108.jpg?1396722412269" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Trails and lifts </h2><p>  The ski area is divided into two parts by the foot of the valley - Carosello and Motolino.  Their height is approximately equal - about 2800 meters.  The slopes of medium difficulty prevail on both slopes, but on Carozello there are more opportunities for beginner skiers.  But the aces can show the class behind the crest of the ridge in Val Federia and go down to Trepalla.  In Motolino, the ski lifts bring the spa guests to the top of Monte della Neve, from where the red and black slopes start.  Carosello also has no shortage of difficult slopes.  As for freeriding, because of the avalanche danger, this type of entertainment without a guide is prohibited.  Violators face a fine of up to 500 –Ñ.  For snowboarders, there are many interesting slopes in Livigno (Italy).  The reviews speak of two halfpipes, a border park and a border cross-country track, which operate in Motolino.  There is a fan park in Fontana Vetta.  As for the lifts and cable cars, they are enough in the ski area so that there are no queues even in high season. </p><h2>  When is it best to come to Livigno (Italy) </h2><p>  It‚Äôs always good to relax in this part of Lombardy.  No wonder this place belongs to the Milan and Lakes region.  In summer, there is a breath of Mediterranean climate.  From May to September, the daytime temperature does not fall below +24 ¬∞ C. In April and October it is also warm - +18 ¬∞ C. But if you are interested in skiing and snowy slopes, then you should visit the resort from November to May .  And even in the winter months, do not forget sunblock.  On the Italian slopes of the Alps it is sunny, the temperature during the day is always around +5 ... + 9 <sup></sup> . High zonality provides abundant snow cover even in the warmest winters. </p>

    <h2>  Livigno (Italy): hotels and apartments </h2><p>  Three old villages quickly reoriented themselves, shook off a touch of provincial boredom, and began to accept ski lovers according to all EU standards.  However, there are many small family hotels where the hostess herself bakes croissants for breakfast.  Italy is known as a country of very expensive hotels.  However, this rule does not apply to Livigno.  Here you can find apartments at a price of 350 –Ñ per week.  Out of eighty hotels, about fifty have three stars on their sign, but there are seventeen higher categories.  Among them, we can recommend Intermonty 4 * and Lent 4 *.  But judging by the reviews, vacationers prefer to stay in numerous apartments, cottages and chalets. </p><h2>  Ski and leisure schools apr√®s ski </h2><p>  The main attraction of this place is the fabulously beautiful nature of Livigno (Italy).  Photos of mountain peaks, valleys, small villages and ancient stone churches are requested on the pages of posters and calendars.  For those who are tired of skiing, the local bureau offers walking tours, horse riding and dog sledding.  The resort has an indoor swimming pool and saunas, where you can instantly relieve fatigue from feet clad in <span>mountain boots</span> .  With the advent of Apres-ski time, 130 restaurants, about a hundred bars, five pubs, two nightclubs hospitably open their doors.  And this is not counting the catering establishments at hotels and pizzerias, which do not have numbers.  Great at Camana Veglia, Bellavista, and vintage drinks are served at Galli's Pub.  The local drink is Bombardino - brandy, egg liqueur and whipped cream. </p>
