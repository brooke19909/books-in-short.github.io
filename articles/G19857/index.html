    <h2>  Some information about the pond </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis reservoir is 7000 ha, the maximum depth reaches 38.5 m, and the average - 14 m. It is not easy to judge about the origin of the name, because there are several versions.  Some argue that it came from the Bashkir "weld" ("failed"), others - from the Turkic "Uldim", which means "dead", while others interpret the word as "blue bowl".  And in 1892, the writer Mamin-Sibiryak visited the shores of this picturesque reservoir.  The lake is 14 km long and 9 km wide.  In the southern part, the pond has the largest dimensions, it narrows to the north, where it is divided into bays, peninsulas and islands.  Here is such an unusual reservoir of Uvilda.  The lake is located right near the Ural Mountains, a huge part of the coast is occupied by holiday villages, recreation centers, resorts, where tourists are always welcome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the lake of uvilda" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/444009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why is this place so popular? </h2><p>  Uvildy is not only the beauty of mountains and bays, it is also incredibly transparent, clean and healthy water.  A huge number of people visit these places in order to improve their health, because on the shores of the lake there is healing mud and many sources with weak mineral radon water.  Healing sulfate-bicarbonate liquid and <span>sapropelic mud</span> help to cure and prevent some diseases.  For such properties they call the pearl of the Urals the Uvilda pond.  People who suffer from ailments of the nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine systems and many others seek to visit the lake.  A mild climate, a high degree of <span>ionization of air,</span> dirt, radon waters - this is not even the whole list of those factors that attract travelers to these beautiful places. </p><h2>  I don‚Äôt want to be treated, but I want to ... see the islands </h2><p>  Yes please!  And this is possible if you decide to choose a vacation on Lake Uvildy.  Here you can admire not only the water surface, but also the islands, because there are many of them: rocky and wooded, small and large.  The largest of them is Starving, and the most mysterious is Elm.  From the name of the latter, it becomes clear what kind of vegetation is in place.  Yes, elms grow on this island.  "What is strange?"  - you think.  And what is surprising is that there are elms only on this island, in other areas of the island you will not find any such tree.  There you have a riddle.  In the north-western part there is a large peninsula Birch, its area is 476 hectares!  If there is time, be sure to visit other islands: Olkhov, Spruce, Bukov, Sea, Dolgonky and so on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What about fishing? </h2><p>  While women and children admire the local scenery, men can take their souls out fishing, not only in summer but also in winter!  Forest Lake Uvildy is known as a reservoir, which has not only, so to speak, ordinary fish species, but also rare ones listed in the Red Book.  Pike, ripus, bream, crayfish, nelma, omul, muksun, carp, etc. are found here. For lovers of spearfishing and diving, it is simply better not to find a place!  You can go fishing for the soul, or you can take part in competitions that are constantly held here.  However, be aware that only pensioners and children under 12 years old can enjoy this type of leisure for free.  Even in winter, fishing enthusiasts go to these places with full equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Most people who have been here cannot forget the cleanliness and freshness of lake water.  They say that such beauty is nowhere in the world.  All reviews boil down to the fact that the resort is good for everyone: a transparent lake, picturesque mountains, fishing, and treatment.  The only negative for some is the relatively high prices for treatment, although only good can be heard about its quality and effectiveness.  There is one more point that people who visited the lake talk about.  They advise you to definitely watch the sunset - this sight will not leave anyone indifferent. </p>
