Recommendations will also be given regarding the choice of communication method and type of operating system.  All this will allow the potential buyer to choose exactly the multimedia center that best suits his needs, and then configure it yourself without any help. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brockystv.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connect your samsung tv to the internet" class="if uuid-2385479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2385479.jpg"></div><h2>  Smart TV concept </h2><p>  More recently, all television devices performed only one function: they allowed you to watch TV programs.  But with the advent of digital technology, their capabilities have changed dramatically, and the degree of functionality has increased several times.  Now, in the software environment of this solution, it became possible to install additional utilities.  The latter allows the individual owner to select content and view it.  Some of these utilities allow free playback (Ivi, Twigle), but at the same time advertising is added to the film or television program.  There are paid programs, for example, Megogo.  In this case, you need to pay money and subscribe.  The list of available content in this situation is increasing, while shareware programs provide only selective access. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also on such entertainment devices a browser is preinstalled.  That is, it is possible to view pages and play videos based on HTML5 technology.  But the outdated Flash method is not supported in this case.  It is also possible to watch videos on the YouTube information resource. </p><p>  It is in the presence of all the previously described programs that it is recommended to implement in the future the phased connection of the TV to the Internet.  There are currently three software platforms based on Smart TV.  The first of these is the Tizen OS from Samsung.  The second is LG WEBOS.  Well, and a possible alternative to them is a stripped-down version of Android, which is used in multimedia devices from other manufacturers. </p><p>  The degree of functionality for them is approximately the same and the final choice is determined by the preferences and personal experience of a user. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.appliancecentral.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connect lg tv to internet" class="if uuid-2385481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2385481.jpg"></div><h2>  General setup </h2><p>  In general, the Internet connection of a LG TV or any other manufacturer consists of the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Unpacking the device from a safe shipping box.  Also, it is necessary to get the remaining components of the supply from it. </li><li>  Next, you must necessarily dismantle the transport fasteners and install supports. </li><li>  We select the installation location of the multimedia system and place it there.  We summarize the communications and connect them. </li><li>  Turn on the device.  We set it to the initial parameters.  We search for programs. </li><li>  We set up a network connection and install additional software. </li><li>  Testing the performance of the multimedia system. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="wifinut.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connect tv to internet via wifi" class="if uuid-2385483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2385483.jpg"></div><h2>  Choosing an installation location, assembling a TV, connecting </h2><p>  The installation location of the television device must be selected based on two criteria: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Ease of watching TV shows. </li><li>  The ability to supply communications. </li><li>  It is also necessary to consider the convenience of installing the multimedia center itself. </li></ul><p>  Any modern multimedia center is assembled as follows: </p><ul><li>  We remove the device from the packaging and lay it with a screen on a soft surface. </li><li>  We take out the support from the transport box and install it. </li><li>  Special transport fasteners are dismantled. </li><li>  Next, you need to install batteries in the control panel. </li><li>  At the final stage, the purchased device must be installed in the place of operation. </li></ul><p>  In two main ways, the TV can be connected to the Internet: via Wi-Fi or using twisted pair. </p><p>  When using a wireless transmitter, the list of communications includes a power cable and a signal cable with the corresponding signal.  The first of them connects the multimedia center with the power supply system and provides its power.  The second at the same time commutes the local antenna, satellite equipment or the cable operator‚Äôs gateway with the TV.  As a rule, the tuners inside such devices are universal and able to work with any type of television signal.  The exchange of information with the World Wide Web is implemented using a wireless Wi-Fi network and a transmitter of the same name. </p><p>  If twisted pair cable is used to connect to the Internet, the communication list is automatically supplemented by the RJ-45 port. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.senigallianotizie.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connect smart TV to internet" class="if uuid-2385484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2385484.jpg"></div><h2>  Turning on the device, setting initial parameters </h2><p>  The next step in connecting the TV to the Internet is to turn it on.  Then wait for the initialization process to complete.  When you first turn on the <span>multimedia system</span> will require you to set the current time and indicate the current value of the date.  The next window sets the location of the device.  If you skip this step, then the gadgets installed in the device‚Äôs shell will not work. </p><p>  At the end of this stage, an informational message appears stating that there is not a single available channel.  That is, the initial parameters are already set and you need to proceed to the next step. </p><h2>  TV Search </h2><p>  Next, connecting Internet TV to the TV comes down to searching for available channels.  It is recommended that this operation be performed automatically.  To do this, run the "Settings" menu.  Then in it we find the item "Auto Search" and run it.  Next, the system will require you to specify the type of input signal: satellite, local or cable.  If necessary, we also specify the type of information received: analog, digital, or combined analog-digital.  After that, the system will automatically search for available TV programs.  At the end of this operation, you must save the list received earlier and proceed to the next step. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizmodo.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connecting tv to tv" class="if uuid-2385485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2385485.jpg"></div><h2>  Setting connection parameters, installing programs </h2><p>  Further, connecting a SMART TV to the Internet requires setting connection parameters and installing specialized programs. </p><p>  To do this, go to the previously mentioned setup menu and select the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù item.  If a wired connection is used, then we set its parameters (address and DNS).  When they are automatically received, just set the appropriate checkbox in the settings.  In the case of using static addressing, we type the necessary values ‚Äã‚Äãin the input fields. </p><p>  When using a Wi-Fi-based network, we start the automatic search for available networks.  At its end, we select the name that our router uses.  We also enter a secret access code to establish a connection with the router. </p><p>  After that, go to the ‚ÄúSMART‚Äù menu and register in the application store (LG Store, Play Market or Samsung Apps).  Next, install the necessary software at our discretion.  If you can purchase a paid subscription, it is recommended to install Megogo.  Otherwise, you need to install Ivi or Twigle.  You can also install multiple applications.  We install YouTube without fail, where you can find a great variety of free and high-quality content. </p><h2>  Checking the performance of the multimedia center </h2><p>  On this, in fact, the connection of the TV to the Internet via a router is completed.  Now you need to check the correctness of the specified parameters.  To do this, we check the operability of all found channels.  Then we launch all the installed gadgets and launch multimedia content in them for playback.  At the final stage, go to the browser and browse the web.  If everything is done correctly, then the software should function without problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tclelectronics.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connect the TV to the Internet via a router" class="if uuid-2386820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386820.jpg"></div><h2>  Owners opinion </h2><p>  Connecting the Samsung TV to the Internet (or TV of any other manufacturer) allows you to fully reveal its potential.  Due to this operation, it turns into a full-fledged home multimedia entertainment center.  After the implementation of such a connection, the user is not strictly tied to television programs, but can play entertainment content at his discretion.  This is the main advantage of such systems.  Moreover, the source of content can be either a special application, or various sites on the Internet. </p><p>  By cons include a minor complication of the setup procedure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cybershack.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connect tv to internet" class="if uuid-2386821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2386821.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this material, a general algorithm for connecting a TV to the Internet was considered.  Performing it, you can easily configure any multimedia center to fit your needs.  The procedure for verifying the performance of such an entertainment system is also given. </p>
