    <h2>  Disadvantages of the "Globe" according to tourists </h2><p>  But Globus 3 * (Rimini) has not only good opinions.  Reviews about him are also negative.  Tourists note the following disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  There is not enough furniture on the balcony.  Usually there is one chair there, which is not very convenient if a married couple or a family with children has settled in the room. </li><li>  Air conditioning does not always work. </li><li>  The restaurant primarily serves tourists from Italy.  Russian travelers are forced to wait half an hour before they bring food. </li><li>  Lunches and dinners are rather meager and monotonous. </li><li>  A construction site is nearby, which makes a lot of noise in the morning and afternoon. </li></ul><h2>  Should I choose this hotel for your vacation? </h2><p>  Tourist complex Globus Bellariva 3 * Standard (Rimini) is a good budget hotel, which is suitable for a quiet holiday with your family on the Adriatic coast.  The quality of the services provided is consistent with the price set by the hotel owners.  The beach is very close, and the building has everything you need for a normal vacation. </p><p>  Of course, if you want to get high-quality service, then it is better to pay attention to more expensive hotels that provide a wider selection of services and entertainment.  But for a budget holiday, the Globe will be a great option.  It is also very convenient to stay for those tourists who want to travel around the country, and return to the hotel only for the night. </p>
