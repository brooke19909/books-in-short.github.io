this was the priority of the Chinese.</span>  <span>However, at the beginning of the two thousandth, Huawei decided to start producing smartphones.</span>  <span>And the first device (U8230) became very popular.</span>  <span>At least in Russia and the Republic of Belarus.</span>  <span>After that there were ups and downs.</span>  <span>But the company has evolved.</span>  <span>Only scandals related to industrial espionage can be attributed to falls.</span>  <span>Yes, and they did not particularly harm the giant.</span>  <span>On the wave of success, the Honor 8 Pro smartphone was just developed.</span>  <span>Its characteristics still look attractive.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>It is worth noting that Huawei has allocated these smartphones in a separate brand - Honor.</span>  <span>It‚Äôs impossible to find the Huawei logo on these gadgets.</span>  <span>And this cannot but rejoice.</span>  <span>During its existence, the Honor brand has given the world a huge number of wonderful mobile devices.</span>  <span>They were distinguished by chic design, incredible performance and excellent battery life.</span>  <span>And the Honor 8 Pro smartphone, the characteristics of which we will now study, also has all these advantages.</span>  <span>So, let's move on to the device‚Äôs interface.</span>  <span>What will delight designers of Huawei?</span> </p><h2>  Gadget Design: Part 1 </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="specifications honor 8 pro" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2047849.jpg"></div></h2><p>  <span>So, what about the look of the Honor 8 Pro?</span>  <span>We will leave the characteristics for later.</span>  <span>It looks like a smartphone should: expensive and beautiful.</span>  <span>The case is completely metal, which is somewhat unusual against the backdrop of a craze for glass and plastic.</span>  <span>But metal is even better, because at least it does not scratch so much and fingerprints do not remain on it.</span>  <span>There are several color solutions, but the gadget in the blue case looks the most spectacular.</span>  <span>The front panel is covered with tempered glass Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> with a 2.5 D effect.</span>  <span>This makes the phone look fashionable and stylish.</span>  <span>There are no familiar control buttons under the screen.</span>  <span>They are placed on it and are software emulated.</span>  <span>Above the screen, everything is standard - a speaker, sensors, a front photo module.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gadget Design: Part 2 </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone honor 8 pro specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2047848.jpg"></div></h2><p>  <span>The rear panel is of most interest, because it is here that two photomodules of the main camera are located.</span>  <span>Next to them is a heartbeat sensor and a two-section flash.</span>  <span>Underneath all this beauty is a fingerprint scanner.</span>  <span>Antenna inserts are painted in body colors, which adds aesthetic beauty to the device.</span>  <span>The case is non-separable, so you won‚Äôt get to the battery if you need to replace it.</span>  <span>On the side faces, the power and volume buttons are habitually located.</span>  <span>At the top end there is an infrared port and an additional noise reduction microphone, and a speaker, a charging connector and a headphone jack can be found on the bottom end.</span>  <span>This is the look of the Honor 8 Pro.</span>  <span>The characteristics of the hardware platform in line.</span>  <span>We pass to them.</span> </p><h2>  Performance and hardware platform: part 1 </h2><p>  <span>So what are the specifications of the Honor 8 Pro?</span>  <span>To do this, look "under the hood" of the device.</span>  <span>Under it, we see that the basis for the production of Huawei HiSilicon Kirin is used as the central processor - it is an eight-core processor (64 bits, clock speed 2.4 gigahertz).</span>  <span>RAM is two-channel, energy-efficient in the amount of 6 gigabytes.</span>  <span>The graphics processor is responsible for the Mali G71 coprocessor, which can handle almost everything, including OpenGL and DirectX.</span>  <span>It is clear that with such a filling for a smartphone, nothing is impossible.</span>  <span>Even demanding games like World of Tanks Blitz, Asphalt 8, and Modern Combat deliver stably 60 frames per second.</span>  <span>Is it worth saying that the device works quickly and smoothly, and applications of any simpler type "fly" at all?</span>  <span>Such performance is a branded feature of Honor smartphones.</span>  <span>They have always been very powerful.</span> </p><h2>  Performance and hardware platform: part 2 </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei honor 8 pro specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2047846.jpg"></div></h2><p>  <span>The volume of the internal drive designed to store user data is 64 gigabytes.</span>  <span>If this does not suit someone, then he can expand the storage using a Micro SD memory card.</span>  <span>It can be installed in the slot designed for the second SIM card.</span>  <span>Note that the craze for hybrid slots has not passed and ‚ÄúHuawei‚Äù.</span>  <span>The device supports the latest generation LTE networks, has a Wi-Fi transmitter operating at a frequency of 5 gigahertz, Bluetooth 4.2, the required number of sensors and a very quick GPS module.</span>  <span>It searches for satellites in a couple of seconds after turning on.</span>  <span>These are the main technical specifications of the Huawei Honor 8 Pro.</span>  <span>Now you can go to the device screen.</span>  <span>He can also bring a number of surprises.</span> </p><h2>  Smartphone display </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="technical specifications of huawei honor 8 pro 64gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2047844.jpg"></div></h2><p>  <span>Let's move on to the Honor 8 Pro screen.</span>  <span>Characteristics and an overview of the main parameters quite clearly hint to us that just a smart panel is installed here.</span>  <span>Judge for yourself.</span>  <span>Screen Type - LTPS LCD.</span>  <span>This is even better than the notorious IPS.</span>  <span>The display resolution is 1440 by 2560 pixels.</span>  <span>That is, this is not even Full HD, but all 4K.</span>  <span>The screen has realistic color reproduction, chic viewing angles and a decent pixel density per inch.</span>  <span>By the way, the screen size is 5.7 inches, and this, by the way, is almost a gigantic size.</span>  <span>But it is not particularly felt when using a smartphone.</span>  <span>It is worth noting that the screen has a decent anti-reflective coating and excellent brightness.</span>  <span>This allows you to easily use the device outdoors on a sunny day.</span>  <span>Fingers glide well on the touchscreen, there are almost no prints.</span>  <span>This is a merit of a high-quality grease-repellent coating.</span>  <span>It is also possible to work with gloves.</span>  <span>The Honor 8 Pro screen is definitely one of the best in the segment.</span> </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  <span>Technical <span>characteristics of the Huawei Honor 8</span> Pro 64GB (as, in principle, versions with other amounts of memory) in the field of the battery are truly amazing.</span>  <span>The gadget has a 4000 mAh lithium-ion battery.</span>  <span>This is an unprecedented volume.</span>  <span>And there is nothing strange in the fact that such a powerful gadget easily works up to two and a half days without additional battery recharging.</span>  <span>Video playback at maximum screen brightness can last more than 10 hours.</span>  <span>But there is no need to talk about such trifles as the reading mode or listening to music.</span>  <span>The gadget in these modes will easily work for a day.</span>  <span>This is the most autonomous flagship of all.</span>  <span>This device can easily work in mixed mode.</span>  <span>When LTE is on, autonomy, of course, drops, but even with this in mind, the phone "lives" for a very long time.</span>  <span>This is another ‚Äúlong-lived smartphone.‚Äù</span> </p><h2>  Honor 8 Pro reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 pro specifications and review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2047845.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Before making a purchase, always try to read product reviews and analyze the information received.  As a rule, all responses belong to real people, less often they are custom-made. </p><p>  The Honor 8 Pro smartphone has a good reputation.  Almost 80% of the reviews are positive.  Users rate the design and functionality of the device at 4-5 points.  They note the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  good cameras; </li><li>  excellent expansion and screen size; </li><li>  good sound quality from the speaker and when connecting headphones; </li><li>  speed of work; </li><li>  convenient interface; </li><li>  excellent value for money. </li></ul><p>  Negative points noted by users of Honor 8 Pro: </p><ul><li>  a smartphone sometimes ‚Äúhangs‚Äù when a GPS is connected; </li><li>  the battery holds a charge slightly less in time than the manufacturer claims, with the active use of the smartphone it lasts a maximum of one day. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>So what is the verdict regarding the Honor 8 Pro?</span>  <span>Its characteristics are such that this device can be considered ideal, based on practical considerations and the notorious ratio of price and quality.</span>  <span>Indeed, in performance it is only slightly inferior to modern flagships from Samsung, but it costs an order of magnitude cheaper.</span>  <span>This smartphone should be purchased for those who want to get a beautiful, fashionable, productive and hardy device for the right price.</span>  <span>The cost of Honor 8 Pro is not overpriced, unlike Samsung devices that are similar in technical specifications.</span>  <span>And this is another plus for the manufacturer "Huawei".</span> </p>
