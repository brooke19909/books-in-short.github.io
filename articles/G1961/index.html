    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  A lot of positive impressions remain with travelers after visiting the resort Grand Hotel Varna.  Reviews contain the following information: </p><ul><li>  one of the main advantages of the hotel can be considered that almost all employees understand Russian well and speak it; </li><li>  large clean area with a lot of green spaces;  in the dining room there are never any queues for distribution; </li><li>  there is a wellness center where you can undergo mud treatment, as well as take mineral water; </li><li>  good main restaurant menu with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables; </li><li>  convenient location (there are many shopping malls, as well as entertainment venues nearby); </li><li>  given the presence of breakwaters on the beach, the water in the sea is very calm; </li><li>  since the hotel is rarely 100% full, check-in occurs almost immediately upon arrival; </li><li>  Wireless Internet catches excellently almost throughout the territory and works at high speed; </li><li>  convenient gentle entry into the sea without any sharp stones; </li><li>  good animation for children; </li><li>  photos of the hotel, presented on the official website and other resources, are fully true; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel‚Äôs charter does not allow pets, for a fee, reception staff can turn a blind eye to this; </li><li>  the presence of an indoor pool with healing thermal water; </li><li>  TV broadcasts as many as six Russian channels; </li><li>  Great gym. <br><br></li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, a number of shortcomings and shortcomings in the Grand Hotel Varna 5 * hotel can be noted.  The reviews contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  music plays loudly by the pool every evening until midnight, and therefore this hotel is not suitable for those who are used to going to bed early); </li><li>  the walls of the corridors are painted with ordinary oil paint (as in a hospital), which managed to crack pretty badly; </li><li>  old shabby furniture in the rooms; </li><li>  in order for you to replace bath towels, you have to remind the maid several times about this; </li><li>  not very well thought out children's menu; </li><li>  thawed semi-finished foods (dumplings, nuggets, etc.) are periodically served in the dining room; </li><li>  having booked this or that room, you cannot be sure that you will be accommodated in the apartments of the selected category (instead of the triple room you can be accommodated in double rooms with an extra bed); </li><li>  the hotel‚Äôs pools are too small for such a large number of vacationers (this becomes especially noticeable in windy weather when no one wants to go to the beach); </li><li>  maids forget to replenish makeup in the bathroom. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Mixed feelings arise after reading reviews of the Grand Hotel Varna hotel.  "Grand Hotel Varna" 5 * is a fairly popular hotel located in a popular tourist area.  Given that its territory is combined with four other similar institutions, the infrastructure is common, and therefore it is always very crowded in the territory. <br><br>  Positive feedback can be heard mainly from picky tourists or from those for whom this holiday in Bulgaria was the first trip abroad.  Of course, in comparison with domestic resorts, the Grand Hotel Varna appears in a very favorable light.  The all-inclusive system operates here, and good opportunities for healing are provided.  At the same time, the location is very convenient.  Speaking of nutrition, it is worth noting that it resembles homemade.  You will not find any culinary delights here, but all the dishes are well known. </p><p>  Those travelers who have already managed to relax in the resorts of Turkey and Egypt may be somewhat disappointed.  This is due to the fact that they have a slightly different idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa five-star service.  Poor cleaning, lack of animation, crowding around the pools and many other unpleasant moments significantly spoil the impression.  Considering that the hotel territory is combined with four others, experienced tourists recommend buying cheaper tickets to lower star hotels.  At the same time, the same service will be available to you as in the Grand Hotel Varna. </p>
