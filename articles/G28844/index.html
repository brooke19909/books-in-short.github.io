    <p>  The future commissar studied a lot, in 1922-24.  graduated from a party school and higher courses at the Military Academy.  Tukhachevsky, attesting a cadet Tymoshenko, spoke of him as one of the brilliant cavalry commanders.  He said that, having the strong qualities of a "grunt", at the same time he constantly studied military affairs and was studying new equipment.  By 1933, Tymoshenko headed the cavalry corps.  And since August 1933, he has replaced the commander of the military districts of Belarus and Kiev, 1937-1940 - he himself leads the troops of the Kharkov, North Caucasus and Kiev Special Districts, Ukrainian and North-Western Fronts.  During the time of the Soviet-Finnish company, the famous ‚ÄúMannerheim Line‚Äù was breached under his leadership by Soviet troops.  Career quickly went uphill.  In March 1940, Tymoshenko was awarded the <span>Star of a Hero of the Soviet Union,</span> and in May received the highest title - <span>Marshal of the Soviet Union.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tymoshenko Marshal photo" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17406/306648.jpg" width="319"></div>

    <p>  The German attack provoked confusion in the Kremlin.  Stalin did not appear in public for more than a week.  And on June 23, it was Marshal Tymoshenko who was appointed chairman of the Supreme Command Headquarters.  Joseph Stalin occupied all command posts only in July 1941, including the post of People's Commissar.  And the marshal is transferred to the commander of strategic directions.  The history of many battles (near Vyazma, Kharkov, Rostov-on-Don) and victories (Iasi-Kishinev and Budapest operations) is inextricably linked with the name of Tymoshenko.  The Marshal, whose photo is presented here (and confirms the words of Baghramyan), was part of the Headquarters.  He commanded the fronts, coordinated their actions as her representative. </p><p>  After the war, Tymoshenko Semen Konstantinovich continues to serve.  Since 1960, he heads the General Inspectorate of the Soviet Army.  From 1962 to 1970 he steadily leads the committee of war veterans.  Marshal Tymoshenko received the second Golden Star for his services to the country and in connection with the anniversary already in 1965.  The hero died in 1970. </p>
