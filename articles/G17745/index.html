People (men and women) who do not have blood ties, for the purpose of mutual support, established relationships among themselves, in fact, close to related ones.  People say - a named sister, a named brother.  From these considerations, the answer to the question of what ‚Äútwin cities‚Äù means is quite clear.  <span>These are cities</span> that can be located in different states and on different continents, but have close, friendly relations.  There is even a worldwide organization of twin cities, and since 1863, the last Sunday of April is celebrated as World <span>Day of twin cities.</span>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Twin cities of Moscow" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/216054.jpg" width="344"></div>  After the Second World War, in order to strengthen ties between the allied, but still very different countries of Europe, America and the USSR, a new level of cooperation arose, which took shape in the concept of "twin cities."  What did this mean during the difficult time <span>the Cold War began?</span>  Firstly, the opportunity to learn more about life, culture, customs and traditions of people completely distant for us, residents of foreign cities on the other side of the Iron Curtain.  Secondly, it was a way to tell about ourselves to the world, to present the true values ‚Äã‚Äãproclaimed in our society - friendliness, peacefulness, mutual respect.  An interesting case is the emergence of friendship and the establishment of twin relations between Stalingrad and Coventry, an English city whose inhabitants supported the population of a destroyed and burned, but persistent <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãon the Volga.</span>  They sent a telegram with words of support, and then an embroidered tablecloth, which is stored in the Volgograd Museum.  This was the first case that laid the foundation for such a phenomenon as twin cities.  That this is a rather touching situation, sincere and open, I think there is no doubt.  In the future, and more prosaic reasons made it possible for the cities to become related, such as the similarity of name, geographical location and even industrial enterprises. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What do twin cities mean" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13600/216048.jpg" width="220"></div>  The phenomenon, which was called "twin cities", was quite common in the USSR.  The Great Soviet Encyclopedia indicates that 100 cities of our country had such close, friendly ties with 200 settlements around the world.  For example, the twin cities of Moscow - most often the capital of other countries, there are 88 in all. In the United States, this is one city - Chicago.  Between <span>these cities</span> there are cultural and economic ties, manifested in festivals, joint events, the exchange of experience, and trade relations.

    <p>  With the process of globalization and the rapprochement of various countries, this phenomenon may be outdated.  <span>The younger generation</span> rarely uses the phrase "twin cities" in their speech.  What is it for the modern world?  Most likely, the phenomenon under consideration has substantially changed and acquired the pragmatic nature of establishing economic ties that can bring mutual profit.  Nevertheless, you should delve into the archives and find out about the causes of the twinning relations of other cities with your native place of residence.  Maybe you find something interesting. </p>
