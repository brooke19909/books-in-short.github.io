It is made in the style of teddy, centipedes, amigurumi.  There are mice on a wire frame that can change the position of the body.  Interesting swivel mice with which to play.  The keychain mouse fits in your bag or pocket.  The barrel mouse will keep the milk mixture warm in a bottle or decorate a jar of spices. </p><p>  Consider how to crochet a mouse for a beginner and an experienced craftsman.  What is the difference between toys requiring support.  What sizes can be a mouse.  Two schemes with a description and a master class will help you choose the right model. </p><h2>  Keg Mouse </h2><p>  Cylinder-shaped toys are very practical.  They are stable, they can be put on a shelf.  If you do not stuff their body, they perfectly decorate banks.  In the photo there are several such mice made of colored yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted mice" class="if uuid-3171682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3171682.jpg"></div><p>  For such a model, you can collect all the remains of the thread and make the toy a striped body - this will depict a dress.  The head and legs are knitted from gray, white or beige yarn. </p><p>  Detailed description of how to crochet a mouse: </p><ul><li>  They start knitting with the top of the mouse in single crochet columns.  Six loops are added in each circle to make a dome.  When the circle reaches seven centimeters in diameter, stop making the increase. </li><li>  Knit a cylinder seven centimeters long and close the loop.  You can change the color of the yarn if the mouse should be in the dress. </li><li>  Make a circle with a diameter of seven centimeters and tie it to the cylinder. </li><li>  Knit ears - two circles with a diameter of three centimeters.  Close the loop and tie the ears to the head. </li><li>  Three balls are made: two parts - paws, one - nose.  Starting with three loops, add six in the second row, knit two rows without adding and tighten the knitting.  For the thread tied to the body. </li><li>  Eyes, antennae are embroidered, a tail is tied from the air chain. </li></ul><p>  Blush or pink eye shadow is applied to the cheeks of a white mouse.  You can replace them with crushed pencil lead. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mouse Big Bear </h2><p>  The model is a little more complicated - Big-legged.  It is also stable, but not at the expense of a large base, but thanks to large boots.  Such a mouse has hinged button fasteners and can stand, sit, raise its leg and make a ‚Äúswallow‚Äù.  Handles can only move back and forth, the head is sewn and does not spin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sonspopkes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted mouse traveler" class="if uuid-3171746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3171746.jpg"></div><p>  To close the button fastenings of handles and legs, the mouse is worn in a dress or suit that can be removed.  Shoes knit like socks and tightly stuffed.  The legs are tied to the shoes, they can not be removed. </p><p>  They begin to knit the mouse from the nose, form a cone (for this, six loops are added through a row), reach the desired volume and knit a cylinder several rows.  After they proceed to reducing the loops - six in each row. </p><h2>  Crochet a mouse from plush yarn </h2><p>  <span>Plush yarn</span> has its own peculiarities - they work very carefully to get an even beautiful fabric.  When stitching the product, do not use the main thread, use sewing thread.  When performing knitting, it is important to monitor the direction of the loops - any mistake on such a yarn will be striking. </p><p>  Amigurumi are very dense viscous, but in the case of plush yarn, it will not work to tighten the thread.  Therefore, from such threads knit dots and marshmallows.  Knitting density is recommended by the manufacturer of the yarn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you want to tie a teddy mouse, you can choose a keg scheme - such an animal looks good.  Better not to knit a complex shape.  Simple lines will only win.  You can offer a mouse scheme from mohair or fluffy wool - it also works. </p><h2>  How to crochet a furry mouse </h2><p>  To create a soft toy, it is important to choose the right yarn.  A fluffy mouse of a gentle pastel color looks good.  For such a toy, natural wool is chosen, since it creates a beautiful halo due to small fibers.  Usually, hook No. 5 is chosen for such yarn, but for a knitted toy a size of 2.5 is required - only this way the knitting will turn out quite dense. </p><p>  The muzzle is embroidered with dark threads of a smooth structure - a mouline thread or iris.  It is better not to insert finished eyes, as well as not sew buttons: this will depreciate the product.  The eyes are embroidered with a stitch, using a floss in four additions, or make large nodules.  The lips on the muzzle also embroider a mouline thread in four additions, but the antennae should be thin, for them they take one thread.  It should be remembered that the antennae should not be long.  For expressiveness, the muzzle is pulled together with a thread of the main color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Crocheted mouse" class="if uuid-3173161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3173161.jpg"></div><p>  The mouse, shown in the photo, in a sitting position has a size of about nine centimeters.  He will not be able to stand, so his stability depends on properly sewn legs.  The shape of the body is built of two domes with diminishing loops in the neck.  A detailed diagram explains how to crochet a mouse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Mouse knitting pattern </h2><p>  The main detail of the toy is a torso connected in a circle.  It has a small decrease in diameter in the center, which is achieved by reducing, and then adding loops.  The beginning of knitting is the classic amigurumi circle.  The addition of loops is done for the shape of the dome.  Upon reaching a diameter of five centimeters, the application is completed and four rows are knitted without adding.  On the next row, four loops are evenly reduced and four rows are knitted.  Then four loops are added and four rows are knitted, after which they go on to reduce the loops for knitting the dome. </p><p>  The following shows how to make such a mouse crochet, diagram and description of the process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting pattern fluffy mouse" class="if uuid-3174267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3174267.jpg"></div><p>  The paws fit in one way - both the upper and lower.  These parts begin to knit with three loops, the second row - six loops, the third - nine, then knit in a straight line.  Upon reaching the desired length, a white thread is introduced and loops are reduced.  In the diagram, these rows are shown in white.  The ears are knitted round, the white part on the diagram is marked by the inside. </p><h2>  Frame knitted toy </h2><p>  For an experienced craftswoman it will be interesting to make a toy on the frame using mixed techniques.  The toy in the photo has a wire frame inside, thanks to which it can take any poses.  A master class in the manufacture of crocheted mouse with schemes and description is given below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="es.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frame knitted mouse" class="if uuid-3171726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3171726.jpg"></div><p>  The value of this master class is that for products you can use individual parts, composing them in an arbitrary order.  The head can be sewn to a simpler model, frame handles can be used for almost any toy.  Caring for such a mouse does not imply frequent washing, bending and extension of the limbs.  It is rather a collectible. </p><h2>  Frame manufacturing </h2><p>  For the frame, you need a copper wire of large cross section without braid.  We cut off 36 centimeters and bend into three additions.  At the bend point we make a loop by twisting the two ends of the wire.  Through this loop, a piece of wire six centimeters long is inserted perpendicularly and fixed with small pieces of yarn wound crosswise.  On the other hand, the wire is cut to make three ends.  These are legs and tail.  The ends of the wire are also wound so that there are no sharp corners. </p><p>  At the shoulder level of the mouse, a wire of 8 centimeters in length is inserted and fixed with yarn crosswise.  The two ends of the foot wire are bent two centimeters each to avoid sharp corners and are wound with yarn. </p><p>  The frame is wrapped with stripes of padding polyester two centimeters wide.  It is like bandaging.  After the frame is wrapped, the synthetic winterizer is fixed with a sewing thread, passing in a circle all the wire.  Now you can start crocheting the mouse frame.  The small amount of toy detail determines the packing during knitting. </p><h2>  How to tie the neck, trunk, limbs and tail </h2><p>  From the place where the neck enters the head, six single crochet columns are pulled and so knitted to the shoulder girdle.  Then make the addition of loops, knitting from each two columns.  It turns out twelve loops.  So they tie the entire body to the beginning of the legs.  Do not forget to constantly add stuffing in the body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mouse frame" class="if uuid-3175884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3175884.jpg"></div><p>  Having reached the place where the legs of the mouse begin, six loops are left on a safety pin and continue tying one leg.  Upon completion, they begin to strapping the second leg.  For tying the handle from one loop of the shoulder girdle, six loops are pulled and knitted similarly to the legs.  The second mouse handle is crocheted as well.  The toy is dressed in a dress that will hide thin legs and a body.  On the legs, the feet are bent at an angle of 90 degrees. </p><p>  The tail is knitted in the same way, stretching six loops from the place where the legs begin.  Such a toy does not require support - it stands at three points, the tail gives stability.  But she can sit if her legs are bent. </p><h2>  How to tie ears </h2><p>  To crochet the ears of the mouse, use the even circle scheme.  Unlike the cone, here the addition of loops does not occur through a row, but in each row.  The beginning is ordinary: an amigurumi ring, six single crochet columns are drawn from it, then six loops are added in each row.  Upon reaching the ninth row, there should be 54 loops on the knit. </p><p>  <span>Four rows are knitted according to the scheme of the cylinder: do not add and do not reduce loops.</span>  <span>From the fourteenth row, they begin to decrease six loops in a row.</span>  <span>It turns out a double circle.</span>  <span>Such details will need two pieces.</span> </p><h2>  How to tie a head </h2><p>  Begin to knit a head with three loops or amigurumi rings.  The shape of the cone is performed until three centimeters in diameter are reached.  Then a 2.5 cm cylinder is knitted, after which the loops are reduced.  The scheme and description of the mouse crocheted are presented in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mouse head knitting pattern" class="if uuid-3174944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3174944.jpg"></div><p>  The beginning of knitting and the order of formation of the cone are shown in a circular pattern - from the first to the twelfth row.  The photo does not indicate the part of the head that fits without changing the loops in a row.  There should be forty-two of them.  So ranks from the thirteenth to the twenty-fourth.  On the twenty-fifth row, they pass to the formation of the nape.  The procedure for reducing loops is shown in the diagram in row form. </p><p>  On the twenty-fifth row, they fill their heads and insert the frame.  Next, they knit another row and immediately stuff it.  At the same time, they make sure that the wire of the frame remains in the middle.  After tightening the six remaining loops, the head should be 6.5 centimeters long.  The frame should not protrude, the packing should be uniform.  If the quality does not satisfy, it is better to redo the work at this stage. </p><h2>  How to attach eyes </h2><p>  When the mouse is almost ready, it remains to give expression to the muzzle: to sew on the eyes and nose, to make the antennae and mouth.  As eyes, you can use small black buttons.  It is better to choose those that are slightly convex.  A knitted mouse should have small shiny eyes. </p><p>  Mark the place where the eyes will be (you can use pins).  A large needle is inserted through these marks and the thread is pulled through the eye.  Then the needle is inserted into the same place where the thread came from, but hooking one thread of yarn.  Pull the thread through the eye of the second button and enter the place where the thread comes out, not forgetting to hook one thread of the knit. </p><p>  The threads that sewed the eyes are on opposite sides of the muzzle.  One of them needs to be moved to the other side by re-entering the eye attachment site.  Now that the threads are on one side of the muzzle, they are tightened.  Eyes go a little inside the head.  The threads are tied with a strong knot and they hide the ends inside the head with a hook.  Sew on the nose as well.  You can glue thin strips of mink fur under the eyes, these will be eyelashes. </p><h2>  Crochet mouse workshop </h2><p>  To associate a mouse with the very first photo - the one that regales itself with cookies - will not take much time.  The craftswoman spends about an hour on the manufacture of the product.  This toy consists of two large parts: the head and torso.  They fit in one pattern: cone, cylinder, reduction of loops.  In the video, she talks about how to crochet a mouse.  All highlights are shown in close-up. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="MLo9mwAODKw" data-url="https://youtu.be/MLo9mwAODKw" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/3/0/4/16304.jpg"></div><p>  The craftswoman does the reduction of loops, capturing only half the loop.  So it turns out more beautiful.  This mouse does not need a frame, but it has wire handles and legs that are inserted into an already finished trunk, piercing it above and below.  The limbs of the toy are not tied, but wrapped with yarn.  Palms and feet fit like balls, stuffed and sewn with sewing thread. </p><p>  If this model seems complicated, you can choose a very simple option for crocheting a mouse for beginners. </p><h2>  Keychain - a simple diagram </h2><p>  All amigurumi toys use a cone, oval, cylinder and circle in their circuits.  By learning to knit these elements, you can create new patterns yourself.  The oval-pointed mouse head from the master class may be suitable for creating a keychain.  A chain of air loops is tied to the center of the oval part - this is the tail.  Two circles according to the pattern of the ears can not be doubled, stop on the third or fourth row and close the loop.  The eyes and nose will be smaller than on a toy from the master class. </p><p>  Instead of embroidered eyes, you can use beads, although the quality of a crocheted mouse is visible in detail.  Do not underestimate embroidery.  You can take a floss and make eyebrows, antennae, mouth and cilia.  A red collar with gold beads will look good on such a mouse.  It can be knitted with air loops or one row of single crochet posts. </p><p>  A ring is inserted into the back, pulling a wire into it according to the principle of a frame head.  Crochet keychain. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Try to crochet the mouse using the above schemes or creating your own version.  This will be a good gift to someone from whom she settles. </p>
