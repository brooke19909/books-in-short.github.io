And when they tell us that this or that person has a European type of face, we can already roughly imagine what he looks like.  But appearance is not everything.  There is an interesting science called physiognomy, which claims that the type of person and the <span>psychological characteristics of a</span> person are closely related, and cites quite convincing examples to prove it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="face type" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/205035.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  For skeptics </p><p>  Some people believe that all this is utter nonsense.  With all due respect to this opinion, we hasten to note that physiognomy as a science has about three thousand years in its history.  The type of person and his connection with the inner world of man was at one time interested in such famous thinkers and scientists of antiquity as Aristotle, Hippocrates, Cicero, Ibn Sina, <span>Pliny the Younger</span> and Leonardo da Vinci.  In addition, a number of well-known domestic psychiatrists and doctors, including V.F.  Chizh, <span>I.A.</span>  <span>Sikorsky,</span> V.M.  Ankylosing spondylitis, note the connection of diseases and the psyche with external statistical signs, including with the shape of the head.  And if physiognomy were pseudoscience and mystical nonsense, would it be able to withstand such a test of time? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="determine face type" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/205010.jpg" width="373"></div>

Let us briefly list what this can say to a person who is well versed in physiognomy. </p><p>  Round face type </p><p>  Such people are distinguished by their good nature.  They are soft and peaceful.  They love to eat, good company, appreciate beautiful things and comfort.  It is curious that women with this <span>form of face are</span> highly likely to have a boy.  As a rule, they are excellent housewives, prefer <span>humanitarian professions</span> and are prone to teaching and literary activities.  If, in addition to the round shape on the face, cheekbones are clearly visible in combination with a high nose bridge and ‚Äúburning‚Äù eyes, then such a person clearly has organizational abilities and he can get a real leader.  Among the shortcomings can be noted cunning and injustice. </p><p>  Trapezoidal type of face </p><p>  It differs from others by a wide forehead and an unsharp chin.  Often found in artistic, intelligent, sensitive people.  Women of this type can create a comfortable and cozy atmosphere around them, and men can boast of high authority, although they do not always occupy leading roles.  The reason for this is a certain lack of will in protecting their interests, inherent in people with this form of face.  Nevertheless, men often become leaders in the family, they are quite demanding of others and want to control everything. </p><p>  Rectangular elongated face type </p><p>  The width of the forehead and chin is approximately the same.  Among such people, intellectuals and real talents are often found.  They are characterized by sensitivity, poise, judiciousness and strong organizational skills.  It is curious that if the holder of a rectangular type of face was not born in the autumn month, then he most often succeeds in the humanitarian field, and otherwise he can be very successful in finance and economics.  And for men born in December, it makes sense to try themselves in politics and banking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="european type of face" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/205042.jpg" width="495"></div>

He prefers to go ahead to his success and is distinguished by determination and perseverance.  Sometimes it may seem that people with a square shape are rude and heartless, but this impression is often misleading.  Among them, there are often good psychologists and excellent analysts who can successfully get out of the most difficult life troubles.  Their ability to get along with people is worthy of deep respect.  If you come across a woman with a square face shape, be careful, as such ladies often have a non-living character.  Sometimes they are vengeful and envious, but at the same time they are not strong in intrigue, so there will be no great danger from them. </p><p>  Triangular face type </p><p>  It features a wide forehead, a small nose, prominent cheekbones and deep-set eyes, combined with a slightly protruding chin.  These people are curious, talented and often become prominent personalities in the field of art or science.  Possible disadvantages are cunning, selfishness and inanimity.  Devotion and loyalty are by no means a priority for such people, but at the same time a person with a triangular face does not make false promises.  If the eyes are set too deep, this is a sign of excessive emotionality.  The sharp mind and resourcefulness of people of this type is combined with good imagination, cheerful disposition and impulsivity.  At the same time, they are often worried about spiritual emptiness, disappointment, and inner sadness.  Now, guided by our descriptions, you can try to determine the type of person, both yours and your friends, and check how close all of the above is to the truth.  Perhaps you will learn something new for yourself about the people who surround you. </p>
