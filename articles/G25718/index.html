It has great functionality, as well as an unusual design for standard 2 DIN radio tape recorders.  At the back are not only connectors such as an antenna, RCA inputs, etc., but also others.  This radio has many features, devices and functions that are found only in this version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": Jerry lionel, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer Avic HD3 in car" class="if uuid-2772854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2772854.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Diagonal display inches </td><td>  7 </td></tr><tr><td>  Screen resolution </td><td>  1440 √ó 234 </td></tr><tr><td>  Display type </td><td>  sensory </td></tr><tr><td>  Aspect ratio </td><td>  16: 9 </td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum channel power, W </td><td>  fifty </td></tr><tr><td>  Formats </td><td>  WMA, MP3, DVD, CD, CD-RW.

The Pioneer Avic HD3 radio tape recorder, which is intended for use in the CIS countries, is not an exception, since the entire menu is Russified.  It is suitable for family trips, children can enjoy watching movies and cartoons from any type of media. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the kit includes a remote microphone, it can be used with the Bluetooth connection, using the radio as a hands-free device.  You can also enable voice control, which works with minor flaws.  The disadvantage of this function for residents of Russia is that voice control is performed in English.  Commands recorded during production must be pronounced to recognize and memorize the user's voice system. </p><p>  When moving, the radio displays navigation, a multimedia player, a movie, video or car readings, including speedometer, tachometer, and cruising range. </p><p>  Thanks to the presence of the Bluetooth module, the radio can be used as a telephone.  Contacts from the device can be transferred to the radio memory, set the command to dial a specific number or subscriber, thereby making life easier for the motorist and making it safer, as the driver is not distracted by third-party things. </p><p>  Installing the Pioneer Avic HF3 is not as easy as it sounds.  Therefore, the installation should be entrusted to a specialist. </p><p>  A GPS antenna is included with the radio, which alone hints at the presence of a navigation system in the radio.  It is, but a detailed description in the radio's maps is available only for the two largest cities in the country.  But do not be upset, because very often there are map updates that can be installed using any media, including USB. </p><p>  When moving along a route, the navigation system shows the speed of movement, the angle of the car, the side of the light in the direction the car is moving, and so on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A route can be built either from one point to another, or by stopping at any place between these waypoints.  Search for a route is available in many options, for example: by address, by organization (theaters, clubs, restaurants, banks and so on).  There is also a search by city index. </p><p>  Also, when moving along a route, a voice assistant will notify you of a forthcoming maneuver, speed limit for a certain number of meters.  If the driver has left the paved route, then the system will change to the nearest path and continue driving.  Voice Assistant is more of a pleasant feature than a useful one.  Indeed, when driving on a multi-lane street, when turning or turning, the voice assistant will not help much - it is better to look at the monitor screen so that it becomes clear what kind of maneuver to take at the moment. </p><p>  The traffic jam display function is being developed by Pioneer, and is not yet available in any version.  But the system can build a route based on the conditions of the road, their standard workload.  She can build the fastest route, the shortest in distance, the highway route, the route without toll roads, and so on. </p><p>  There is a version of the Pioneer Avic HF3 2 radio, which has more advanced specifications and the functions arising from them. </p><p>  The price of Pioneer Avic HD3 is at least 61,000 rubles, which in terms of is $ 900. </p><div class="photo" data-original="charlottebooks563.weebly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer avic hd3 car" class="if uuid-2772856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2772856.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Pioneer Avic HD3 has no significant drawbacks, with the exception of the price, which is fully justified by the functionality. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  design; </li><li>  functional; </li><li>  display resolution; </li><li>  adaptation for the Russian segment of users; </li><li>  navigation system operating in Russia; </li><li>  excellent sound quality; </li><li>  built-in memory; </li><li>  the ability to supplement the system with third-party monitors. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="avic411.com" data-author=": Toro34, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer Avic HD3 inside" class="if uuid-2772857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103216/2772857.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Pioneer company has long strengthened its position as the best company for the production of car radios.
