The reviews of experts and the first owners characterize it as a device with great potential, which is great for both a beginner and a professional.  In terms of the quality of shooting, the model surpasses most of the so-called soap dishes and approaches semi-professional mid-range SLR cameras. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon G16" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1017330.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The device has a compact robust housing, which is made of magnesium alloy.  There are several non-slip pads on it, thanks to which the <span>Canon G16</span> camera does not slip.  Moreover, the user can take pictures by performing some settings in parallel, holding it with one hand.  The weight of the device is 356 grams.  The dimensions of the model slightly exceed the dimensions of many analogues, due to the presence of a viewfinder and a large number of controls.  Be that as it may, the camera fits easily into the pocket of your trousers or jacket.  You can wear it on the strap, for which there are special mounts on the ends.  Next to them are the <span>mini HDMI</span> and A / V Out interfaces under the covers.  On the top line, the Canon G16 developers installed a flash with a button for removing it, two mode dials, a hot shoe, as well as shutter and on / off keys.  At the bottom you can see the slot for mounting on a tripod, as well as compartments of the memory card and battery.  On the back there is a three-inch LCD screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon Powershot G16" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1017335.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  Japanese developers have equipped the model with their proprietary Canon HS system, which includes a 12.1 megapixel CMOS sensor with backlight and a DIGIC-6 processor.  The ISO sensitivity values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Canon Powershot G16 range from 80 to 1280. The quality of the pictures taken with the camera is pretty high.  It should be noted that the device is equipped with digital zoom.  At the same time, as evidenced by the reviews of its owners, they need to be used only in case of urgent need, as this adversely affects the picture.  In general, the detail can be called decent, but in the images of landscapes with an increase there is some blur. </p><p>  Not bad are the performance of the Canon G16 and in terms of serial work.  In particular, its speed is about 9.3 frames per second, subject to shooting until the memory card is full, and about 12.2 frames per second in a series of 5 shots.  Thus, the camera can be called a good solution in order to capture even very dynamic subjects in development. </p><h2>  Optics </h2><p>  The Canon Powershot G16 camera is equipped with a lens with the function of five times approximation of photographed objects.  In this case, its <span>focal length</span> is in the range from 28 to 140 millimeters.  This is enough to effectively cover the overwhelming majority of typical scenes in the modes of architectural photography, portraiture, genre, macro photography or landscape.  High aperture allows the device to focus clearly even if the lighting conditions are not the best.  The feedback from the owners of the model is a clear confirmation that beautiful pictures with a blurred background can be obtained even at a distance of one centimeter from the photographed object. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon G16 Camera" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1017337.jpg" width="600"></div>

Expert reviews indicate that at the time of the release of the camera, in this indicator, it became the best among all compact models from this manufacturer.  The reaction time of the system is less than 0.1 seconds, while the delay in operation takes only 0.22 seconds.  If necessary, quickly remove a suitable interesting episode, the user can do this instantly.  In other words, the chances of catching the right moment depend more on his reaction, and not on the device itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon g16 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1017336.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Information transfer </h2><p>  A very important feature of the model, many owners call the presence of a built-in Wi-Fi module.  Via a wireless connection, you can directly share the footage with other cameras from this manufacturer.  In addition, it allows you to send pictures to mobile devices (it is very convenient for storage and with the active use of social networks).  In addition, thanks to the module, you can snap pictures to the place of their creation, as well as control the camera using a tablet or smartphone remotely.  You should not forget about the possibility of direct printing of a photo on a printer directly from the camera. </p><p>  If you register on the Canon Image Gateway service, the owner of the camera automatically gets free access to the cloud storage of information, as well as a number of functions (for example, automatic synchronization and remote processing of material).  You can activate the service, not only through a computer, but also by pressing a special button on the device‚Äôs case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon G16 Price" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1017331.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other features and functions </h2><p>  One of the main features of the Canon G16, as for a device from its class, should be called the ability to record images in RAW format.  It should be noted that this function is usually characteristic only for professional-level cameras.  It allows the photographer to improve or adjust the color rendition (especially for pictures taken in poor lighting). </p><p>  For those people who like to experiment directly during the shooting process, the developers offer a number of various creative filters that allow you to impose various effects on the images.  Among them, both standard options and those that are Canon's proprietary development are provided. </p><p>  Quick access to the basic settings is provided due to the presence of a selector dial for operating modes, as well as a front steering wheel. </p><p>  Model Canon G16, among other things, is equipped with an optical viewfinder.  Due to this, the photographer can turn off the liquid crystal display during operation, thereby saving battery power.  In particular, in the standard operating mode, a full charge of the battery lasts an average of 350 frames, and when the LCD screen is turned off, this number doubles. </p><p>  The device is capable of recording videos in Full HD quality with a frequency of 60 frames per second.  In fairness, it should be noted that at the time of its release, not all the more expensive modifications were able to boast of such an indicator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon Powershot G16 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1017333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In conclusion, it should be noted that the Canon G16 compact camera, the price of which is approximately 550 US dollars, boasts a number of features and is able to create high-quality photographs.  In most aspects, it surpasses almost all ordinary ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù and is able to reveal the creative potential of not only a professional photographer, but also a beginner in this field. </p>
