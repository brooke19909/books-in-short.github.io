    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Friedrich Hayek was a significant social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th century.  His observation of how price changes signal individuals important information that helps them coordinate their plans has become an important achievement in the economy.  Hayek participated in the First World War and repeatedly said that this experience gave rise to a desire to become a scientist and help people avoid the mistakes that led to the armed conflict.  During his life, he changed his place of residence many times.  Friedrich Hayek worked in Austria, Great Britain, USA and Germany.  He was a professor at the London School of Economics, the University of Chicago and Friborg.  In 1939, Hayek received British citizenship.  In 1984, he became a member of the Order of the Knights of Honor and the first Hans Martin Schleyer Prize Laureate.  His article, ‚ÄúUsing Knowledge in Society,‚Äù was among the top twenty published by The American Economic Review over the first 100 years of its existence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Friedrich Hayek was born in Vienna.  His father was a doctor and freelance professor of botany at a local university.  Hayek's mother was born into a wealthy family of landowners.  In addition to Friedrich, the couple had two more sons (1.5 and 5 years younger than him).  Both Hayek‚Äôs grandfathers were scientists.  On the maternal side, his <span>second cousin</span> was the <span>famous philosopher</span> Ludwig Wittgenstein.  All this significantly influenced the choice of the sphere of interests of the future scientist.

    <h2>  Friedrich Hayek, The Road to Slavery </h2><p>  This is the most famous work of the Austrian economist and philosopher.  He wrote it in 1940-1943.  In it, he warns of the dangers of tyranny, which necessarily ends with government control over decision-making through central planning.  Friedrich von Hayek argues that the rejection of individualism and the ideas of classical liberalism will inevitably lead to the loss of freedom, the creation of a passive society, dictatorship and "slavery" of people.  It should be noted that the scientist‚Äôs claims were contrary to the prevailing views in the scientific work that fascism (national socialism) was the response of capitalism to the development of socialism.  Hayek pointed to the common roots of both systems.  Since its publication, more than two million copies of The Road to Slavery have been sold.  The work of Friedrich Hayek had a significant impact on economic and political discourse in the 20th century.  She is quoted today. </p>
