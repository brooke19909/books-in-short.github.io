Finding something right can be quite problematic.  It is most convenient to put the little things into boxes or special containers, distributing the items as intended.  This will simplify the search for the necessary things and unload from the little things the shelves of the cabinet. </p><p>  A box for storing things with your own hands can be made in many ways.  They can not only be made from a wide variety of materials, but also have an original shape and size.  For example, for folding toys you can make a large box, and for needlework you will need a small craft that can be placed on the desktop. </p><p>  In the article, we will present the reader with several options for making boxes for storing things with his own hands from fabric and packaging boxes, stitched and knitted, glued and woven.  You will be able to complete your favorite sample on your own, as you will be given a complete step-by-step manufacturing instruction with the corresponding photos. </p><h2>  Cylinder-shaped fabric containers </h2><p>  To make cylindrical boxes for storing things with your own hands, you will need a dense fabric that will hold the shape, thread, needle, sheet of Whatman paper to complete the drawing of the template.  First, the required diameter of the bottom of the box is measured.  Then - the circumference of the bottom.  This measure will be needed to build a pattern of the top of the box, because the length of the rectangular part of the cylinder will be equal to the circumference plus a few centimeters for the hem of the fabric at the seams.  The pattern of such a box for storing things with your own hands is presented later in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cylindrical box pattern drawing" class="if uuid-2321397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321397.jpg"></div><p>  After the template is made for future crafts, all sizes are transferred to the fabric.  We remind the reader that the material must be dense so that the cylinder holds upright.  They start work on sewing boxes for storing things with their own hands from the bottom of it.  The bottom is sewn around the circumference.  Remember to leave 1 cm of fabric in the hem.  When the bottom is neatly attached, the product is turned on its side and the sidewall is sewn in a straight line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.johannagullichsen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing a fabric box" class="if uuid-2320762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2320762.jpg"></div><p>  The upper border can be processed in different ways: just bend the edges of the fabric inward, sew on the handles for easy carrying, add a piping from another fabric or satin ribbon, thread a lace into the edge and tie a container on a bow or knot. </p><h2>  Button Boxes </h2><p>  To sew beautiful boxes for storing things with your own hands, you will need a dense cotton fabric, which can be strengthened with an additional layer of canvas or canvas.  There is also a modern synthetic material called cordura.  It is used for sewing bags and backpacks.  If you insert a layer of such fabric between the canvases of the main fabric for sewing boxes, then it will perfectly keep the product in an upright position. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="diy.allwomenstalk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric boxes for things" class="if uuid-2320766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2320766.jpg"></div><p>  Before starting sewing products, you need to make a pattern on a piece of paper according to the sample given below.  To make a template, it is enough to measure the size of the bottom of the box and its height.  The appearance of the pattern is presented further in the drawing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="box pattern drawing" class="if uuid-2321387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321387.jpg"></div><p>  Along the perimeter of the fabric, do not forget to leave 1-1.5 cm for the hem of the material.  After the pattern is transferred to the fabric, the stitching of the three layers of matter together begins.  Sewing occurs on the wrong side from three sides.  Then the product is turned on the front surface, and all the corners are carefully aligned with a spoke.  The last side is sewn up with an internal seam.  Subsequently, all sides are additionally sewn on a sewing machine. </p><p>  On each part, beautiful large buttons are sewn on both sides, which hold the sides of the box for storing things with their own hands.  In the photo you can see that the sides of the product are held with rubber bands folded by a figure of eight. </p><h2>  Felt box </h2><p>  For the same pattern, you can sew a box of dense material - felt.  There is no need to bend or trim the edges.  It is enough to cut the fabric and sew the sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt box" class="if uuid-2320723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2320723.jpg"></div><p>  For convenience, when carrying on the sides, oval holes can be cut.  This craft will be strong and durable.  It can <span>store shoes</span> or fragile items - glasses, tea sets.  If you make a box with low edges and put a pillow on the bottom, then your pet will immediately like it. </p><h2>  We use a packing box </h2><p>  You can make a box for storing things with your own hands from the old packaging.  Plain corrugated cardboard will look unaesthetically pleasing.  You can decorate the product with an ordinary hemp rope.  To do this, first cut off the lids of the box, leaving only the side parts.  Then you need to take a skein of hemp natural rope of any diameter.  It is advisable to attach the first few turns with a glue gun.  Then, the winding is continued using thick PVA glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard box decoration" class="if uuid-2320749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2320749.jpg"></div><p>  The last rows are also reinforced with a glue gun.  Then, from any cotton fabric, a cover is sewn onto the inner surface of the box according to the previously described patterns.  It is inserted into the middle of the craft, wrapping the edge on top of the container.  Having transformed the packaging box beyond recognition, you can decorate it with additional details if you wish, for example, pasting a pigtail out of a rope thinner or making a flower twisted out of it. </p><h2>  Wicker box </h2><p>  You can sew a box for storing things with your own hands from strips of fabric.  Previously, they need to be sewn with an internal seam from several different fabrics.  You can insert a thin synthetic winterizer inside, then the craft will turn out to be more voluminous and interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="quiltingdigest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wicker basket made of fabric" class="if uuid-2320738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2320738.jpg"></div><p>  When all the strips are sewn, weaving begins, starting with the bottom of the box.  Striped through one.  For convenience, linen tweezers are used that hold the strips in the required position.  The ends of the strips are wrapped inward, hidden under the weave and fixed with threads. </p><h2>  Knitted box </h2><p>  To make a decorative box for storing things with your own hands, you can use a flexible tube and lace.  Knit crafts a large plastic or wooden hook. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted box with a straw" class="if uuid-2320743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2320743.jpg"></div><p>  For those who know how to use a hook at least at the initial level, it‚Äôs not difficult to complete such a craft.  It will be enough to make the same movements with a hook, threading it into the dialed loops and pulling the cord through the resulting loop.  This is the initial pattern for those who are just starting to learn crochet techniques.  A plastic tube is obtained inside the bound web and holds the box in a standing position. </p><h2>  Craft from newspaper tubes </h2><p>  The difficulty in performing such a craft lies in the large number of necessary newspaper or magazine tubes.  To collapse this, you need to use a wooden stick or knitting needle.  They put it on the edge of the newspaper and wind paper tightly around the base.  The last turn is smeared with PVA glue so that the product does not unwind. </p><div class="photo" data-original="idomyselph.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper article" class="if uuid-2320770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2320770.jpg"></div><p>  As can be seen in the photo, such components will need a lot.  It all depends on the size of the box.  They are fastened together by thick PVA.  Corrugated cardboard can be taken as a basis.  The bottom can not be pasted over, but immediately start with the construction of walls.  The product can be given any shape, make the necessary partitions, alternate colors and arrangement of tubes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article presents samples of boxes for storing the trifles necessary in the house.  A detailed description and photographs will help to correctly perform such a craft at home. </p><p>  To create is interesting and entertaining, and hand-made things have positive energy and bring satisfaction to the master.  Try to complete any of the proposed options.  Good luck </p>
