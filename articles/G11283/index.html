    <h2>  General description of hotel Marittima 3 </h2><p>  Rimini attracts tourists with its historical center and amazingly beautiful sea coast.  Therefore, they usually come here at the end of their Italian trip to relax and enjoy a lazy beach holiday. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the city has a fairly wide selection of hotels of all categories.  But the most popular, of course, are democratic "treshki".  Especially in Italy, many of them are pretty good.  These are the hotels Marittima 3 in Rimini belongs to. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex is located in a multi-storey building and consists of four floors, in which forty-four rooms are located.  Some travel directories indicate that the hotel was built in 1968.  But the last reconstruction of Marittima 3 (Italy, Rimini) underwent recently - in 2013.  The hotel has been remodeled, the rooms are renovated and the furniture is updated.  At the moment, the hotel complex appears before tourists in all its glory, pleasing with interesting design and cleanliness. </p><p>  Keep in mind that the Marittima 3 hotel complex does not have its own territory, and there is a street right behind its entrance door.  But many tourists liked the cozy terrace of the hotel, where you can drink delicious Italian wine on warm nights and jam it with jamon.  This slightly compensates for the lack of territory, and also adds a special charm to the hotel. </p><p>  Almost all vacationers noted that the hotel has very few reviews, so they went here at their own peril and risk, but were very pleased with the rest.  The guests were impressed by the design of the hotel complex, especially the snow-white hall with leather sofas and armchairs, where you can watch TV and read books. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Perhaps some potential hotel guests will be disappointed by the hotel‚Äôs lack of a site.  After all, the entire infrastructure is limited by the lounge, elevator and restaurant. </p><p>  The hall looks very solemn, it is nice to be here on a hot day or a rainy evening.  At the same time, it is a cozy living room and library, where there are books translated into different languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  In the same territory there is a 24-hour reception with friendly staff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the reception you can offer luggage storage and a tour desk.

    <h2>  Service level </h2><p>  For potential guests of the Marittima 3 hotel (Rimini), reviews will help you understand how high the level of service is in this Italian treshka.  It is worth noting that there were no complaints about Internet services.  On the contrary, each tourist sought to clarify that the staff is always ready to help and even provides services that are not included in the range of required services.  For example, you will always be printed out from the Internet the schedule of buses or trains.  They will also tell you which nearby cafes offer discounts at lunchtime. </p><p>  Each guest can order room service, the staff will quickly bring delicious dishes or drinks from the restaurant. </p><p>  If necessary, vacationers can place a fresh press order in their room, as well as use the fax at the reception.  For an additional fee, guests have the opportunity to relax in the massage room, as well as order a transfer around the city or to the airport. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Keep in mind that the hotel rooms are quite small.  But this is very common in Europe, here you can rarely find a room of more than thirty-five squares.  The usual room size does not exceed sixteen square meters. </p><p>  The hotel has all rooms carefully renovated, they are simply decorated, but with a special taste and taking into account the needs of guests.  Elegant equipment rooms can compete with five-star hotels and always receive excellent reviews from guests of the hotel complex. </p><p>  All forty-four rooms belong to the same category, the only thing that distinguishes them from each other is the number of beds and the ability to smoke in the room. </p>
