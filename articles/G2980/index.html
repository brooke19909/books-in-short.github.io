The size of the limit is specified in the loan agreement and is the maximum amount of funds available to the client.  If the analysis of the client‚Äôs history shows the excess of revenue over expenditure, the absence of violations of the payment deadlines, then the limit may increase at the request of customers.  <span>The grace period (the period of</span> use of funds in which interest for the use of money is not charged) lasts 55 days. </p><p>  Trust Bank Addresses in Moscow: </p><ul><li>  st.

The bank provides credit by opening a revolving credit line, that is, the client has the opportunity to use the funds immediately after making a payment to the card.  Some Trust Bank credit cards work just like debit cards.  In addition to using the bank‚Äôs funds, a money storage function is available for the client, for which the bank transfers certain percentages.  Closing the card can be done at the request of the client at any time, provided, of course, all the debt to the bank is fully repaid.  To close, you need to come to the bank, write a statement and turn in a card.  The final settlement will be executed after 35 days from the date the card expires or from the day of its early closure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reviews on the credit card of Trust Bank are of interest to many. </p><h2>  Card opening </h2><p>  In order to order it, you can use the following methods: </p><ul><li>  Internet and mobile banking; </li><li>  personal visit to the bank office. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card bank trust reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53966/2142522.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  If you submit an online application for a Trust Bank credit card, you can significantly save your own time.  Specialists of the bank quickly process such applications, drawn up via the website, and, accordingly, make decisions as soon as possible.  This option is very convenient for customers living far from the bank office.  When contacting the bank personally, the client fills out a written application.  Upon consideration of the client will be notified of the decision of the bank by phone.  You can find out all questions regarding applications and using credit cards by calling the hotline.  Trust bank addresses are not a secret. </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  In order to make preliminary calculations (calculate the amount of the credit limit and the approximate monthly payment), you can use the calculator on the bank's website.

If the bank makes a positive decision, then a loan agreement is concluded, which sets out all the conditions for issuing and using this card.

In addition, it is important to clarify and disable all services connected to the card. </p><p>  It should be noted that a certain period of time elapses between submitting an application and closing a card, in case some transactions made with a credit card could be delayed and arrive later.

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  According to customers, there are many positive aspects in using credit cards of Trust Bank.  For example, specialists of an institution often make concessions and help in debt restructuring if there is no possibility of timely payment of credit debt.  The bank may reduce the amount of the monthly payment, change the payment schedule and set a different payment term.  It is also noted that the approach to customers is always individual and takes into account all the nuances.  In addition, all customers respond to the support service of NB Trust in an exclusively positive manner.  But there are also negative reviews.  For example, some borrowers complained about the incompetence of office or hotline employees.  There were also cases of untimely crediting of the transferred payment, which, of course, entailed the accrual of a fine. </p><p>  Long queues at the bank‚Äôs offices are also noted as a drawback.  All customers using a credit card say that this card is beneficial to the borrower only if applied during the grace period, when interest is not accrued.  Users are also advised not to forget that withdrawing cash through an ATM of another bank will be mandatory with a commission.  Some customers have complaints about the withdrawal of insurance amounts from the account, about which they were not notified at the time of registration.  For this, numerous lawsuits are being filed against Trust Bank on credit cards. </p><p>  In general, this card can be an assistant in case of emergency, and it is better to return the used funds in the grace period.  In this case, its use will be beneficial to the borrower. </p>
