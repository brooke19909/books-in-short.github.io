A street of bars, a beautiful promenade, discos and nightclubs - there is something to do besides sunbathing on the shores of the Aegean Sea.  Many tourists choose first-line <span>hotels</span> in <span>Marmaris</span> to be closer to the beaches.  But this arrangement is immediately reflected in the price of a hotel room.  Therefore, budget tourists prefer not to spend money on such trifles as walking distance to the sea, and are looking for housing in blocks away from the waterfront.  As a rule, hotels there lure customers not only with a low price, but also with a higher level of service.  And if you do not mind walking to the sea (or use the free shuttle service to the beach, which is also included in the list of services of such hotels), we suggest that you consider the Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 * accommodation option in Marmaris.  Its description was made possible thanks to the numerous reviews that we carefully analyzed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Comet Deluxe Hotel 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1567979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  This hotel is located in the new quarter of Armutalan.  The city center with Bar Street, Atlantic Sea Park, the market and other entertainment can be reached by shuttle bus (four kilometers).  And in the immediate vicinity of the Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 * there are such interesting places of Marmaris as the Karasan Point Center shopping center, the amphitheater and the Aqua Dream water park.  Dalaman International Airport is eighty kilometers from the hotel.  A tourist will have to get to the hotel from it in less than an hour.  Reviews say that if it were not for the distance from the sea, it would be a fabulous place.  But if you have healthy legs and you are not averse to walking (especially since a walk in Marmaris is always fun), you are right here.  A shuttle bus to the center costs two liras (less than one US dollar).  But reviews urge you to avoid the city beach - it's crowded and a bit dirty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 Marmaris" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1567980.jpg" width="600"></div>

It has an almost family atmosphere.  Tourists say that on their second day, they get the impression that they came to stay with their friendly relatives.  The territory of the hotel is small, compact.  There are two outdoor pools with slides, one of which operates year-round.  They have a sun terrace full of sun loungers and parasols.  There is also a playground and parking - free for hotel guests.  The administration is trying to create maximum comfort for its guests.  Everywhere flower beds and neat paths.  The hotel itself consists of one three-story building with an attic.  It is noteworthy that all rooms are equipped with balconies, even those that are under the roof.  Reviews mention that it‚Äôs nice to enjoy the mountains and the pool, sitting on rattan chairs with a cup of coffee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1567981.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  The number of rooms at the Comet Deluxe Hotel is sixty.  We can say that this is a hotel with apartments, since all rooms for guests are equipped with a kitchen.  Even in the standard double room (with one wide bed) there is a small corner for self-catering with a coffee maker, electric kettle, electric stove for two burners, a sink and a cupboard for dishes.  A higher category is Deluxe.  These rooms are more spacious and designed to comfortably accommodate three or four people.  There are also two-room ‚ÄúStudio‚Äù (for two persons) and ‚ÄúApartments‚Äù (for four).  There is also a ‚ÄúFamily Deluxe Suite‚Äù and a honeymoon room.  All guest rooms have balconies furnished with rattan chairs and tables.  The bedrooms have a bathroom with daily replenished hygiene and cosmetics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Number of rooms in the hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1567983.jpg" width="600"></div>

Land in the Armutalan region is not as expensive as on the coast, and therefore it was possible not to skimp on the footage of the rooms.  Even the usual ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù for two guests is very spacious.  It has a seating area, an American kitchen and a wide bed - all in one room.  Room amenities reviews were considered very good.  Even the ‚ÄúStandards‚Äù have a flat-screen TV, individual air conditioning and a safe that holds a laptop.  And bathrooms with a shower are equipped with a hairdryer.  Family room is even more spacious.  He, like Studio with Apartment, is two-room.  The kitchen allows you to cook your favorite dishes or baby food, because it is equipped not only with tiles, but also with a microwave.  Superior rooms include slippers.  Reviews say that the maids clean the rooms very carefully.  Filling the minibar is free of charge on condition of payment "All inclusive".  But the use of Wi-Fi (according to reviews, very fast) is free for all residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Family room" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1567982.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dining at Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Turkey) </h2><p>  The price of the hotel room already includes breakfast.  Recently, the concept of Ultra All Inclusive has been introduced at the hotel.  It differs from the simple ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù by the presence of additional services, for which in other hotels you need to pay extra.  This, for example, is a hookah.  In a special cafe you will be filled with the device selected tobacco and smoked it.  There is a bar by the pool where guests are served soft drinks, freshly squeezed juices, ice cream, Turkish wines and distillates, as well as delicious cocktails that are amazingly tasteful.  Meals are served in the restaurant, which, in addition to an extensive hall, has an outdoor terrace.  A diet menu is available upon request. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 (Turkey)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1567984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say about food </h2><p>  The food at the Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 * is very tasty and varied.  Dishes are repeated only at breakfast, which is understandable: every person has already established habits regarding morning meals.  But for lunch and dinner, guests are offered a variety of delights of Turkish cuisine.  Adherents of traditional European food can also find dishes for themselves.  Reviews report that every day they give either meat or grilled fish.  There are always a lot of fresh vegetables and fruits - melons, watermelons, apples, pears, plums, peaches.  Turkish sweets are beyond praise.  But each dinner, along with baklava and other pastries, served a large cake decorated as for a wedding.  Children liked ice cream and fresh juices.  Tourists speak well about drinks at the bar.  The waiters are very helpful, there were no queues at the restaurant.  There was always enough food, regardless of when you come to the meal - to its beginning or to the end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Comet Deluxe Hotel 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1567985.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach, Pools </h2><p>  To compensate its guests the distance from the sea, the hotel Comet Deluxe 4 * launched a free shuttle to the coast.  The beach rented by the hotel is called Nirvana Beach - after the cafe.  It is located in the Icmeler region.  The beach is sandy, much cleaner and more pleasant than the coast in the city center.  And the Icmeler district itself is very beautiful.  The only negative is the transfer.  The bus leaves the hotel at a quarter past ten in the morning and returns at five.  Thus, you need to choose: either the sea or lunch.  But before the transfer there was no transfer at all, and hotel guests had to spend money on minibuses or walk through the city on foot.  Another compensation for the distance from the beach is the pools.  There are two of them - an adult and a child.  Both have water slides.  Despite its modest grounds, the hotel has a sun terrace.  After analyzing the reviews, we can conclude that most tourists traveled to the beach on a free bus, returned for lunch by minibus, and then relaxed in the pool. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Hotel Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 * fully lives up to its four stars.  For guests here, all conditions are created for a vacation full of pleasant emotions.  Ultra All Inclusive includes a hookah, bicycle rental (some tourists used to get to the beaches), airport shuttle, Turkish hammam, spa facilities.  There is excellent Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, you can chat with friends on Skype.  The reception is open 24 hours a day and its staff are fluent in English.  A baby cot and a professional nanny are available upon request.  At the reception you can book tours of Marmaris and the surrounding area.  Parking is free for guests of the hotel. </p><h2>  Comet Deluxe Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists were simply dumbfounded by the decoration and technical equipment of the rooms.  They did not look like a hotel room, but like a cozy apartment.  All rooms have a spacious furnished balcony and a kitchenette.  The rooms are higher than the "Standard" category - two rooms.  Plasma flat-screen TV, efficient air conditioning, good plumbing, comfortable furniture, clean, snow-white linens and towels - these are the characteristics of the reviews for the decoration of the rooms for guests.  The hotel itself is small - and this also gives it an atmosphere of family comfort.  The food here is very good, everything is delicious and varied.  There is no animation, but the hotel is positioning itself as a place of quiet and measured relaxation.  The main contingent of visitors is Ukrainians and tourists from Western and Central Europe. </p>
