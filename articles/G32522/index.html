This is a place where everyone can plunge into the atmosphere of the Middle Ages, get to know fully European traditions - every guide begins with something like this.  Tourists who come to Prague, slowly walk along the cobbled streets and enjoy the architectural sights.  However, recently there was a real scandal associated with this city.  ‚ÄúA monument has been erected to a prostitute in Prague!‚Äù  - announced newspapers and magazines, as well as many online publications.  <span>Is this</span> really true? </p><h2>  Scandalous sculpture </h2>

It is a man sitting on a bench, at whose feet a woman in a short skirt is kneeling on the ground, resting her head on his knee.  The sculptural composition looks ambiguous, it is also worth noting that under the hem of the lady's genitals are quite realistic and detailed.  It was the latter fact that excited the public the most.  What could it be if not a monument to a whore?  Around the monument there were a lot of gossip and speculation, the popular version was that the sculpture was originally wanted to be installed in the local red light district, but as a result, permission for this was not obtained.  However, in fact, the monument has nothing to do with prostitution.

The sculpture was installed back in 2001.  It was the property and advertising exhibit of the aforementioned company and urged not to deny itself a craving for excitement, however, after the bankruptcy of Sazka, the composition was removed from its usual place.  It turns out that the so-called monument to a prostitute in Prague has nothing to do with the fallen women?  Most likely, yes, the official version of the owners of the sculptural composition - the lady persuades her husband not to bet again, but to pick up the money and go home.  She kneels before him, but the man is unshakable.  The original name of the sculpture is Pencil Please.  You may notice that the player himself does not notice anything around, and his free hand froze in a characteristic gesture asking for stationery for recording.  However, why sculptures did not put on cowards on the girl remains a mystery.  Perhaps the gambling husband has already managed to lose the underwear of his wife in some other bet?

The upper surface of the bench is covered with large inscriptions calling to play and win.  Next to the man is also a bundle of money, these are large bills of 5,000 kroons, respectively, a whole fortune is depicted.  In one hand, a gambling enthusiast holds a weekly print edition of the bookmaker and her lottery ticket.  Female sculpture should depict utter gloom and sadness.  The husband is deaf to his wife's requests to stop, he continues to play.

    <h2>  Legends for tourists </h2><p>  Throughout the Czech Republic, the ‚Äúmonument to the prostitute‚Äù in Prague became famous not only because of its common sense and form.  According to many, the man in this composition is too suspiciously like Vaclav Havel in his youth (former president of the state).  Customers and owners of the monument claim that any similarity is an accident.  Rumor has it that it was considered a good omen to climb the bronze heroine of the sculpture under the skirt ‚Äúfor good luck‚Äù.  However, it was just a draw for visitors.  The monument was the property of the bookmaker, and its protection prevented any inappropriate actions regarding the sculpture. </p>
