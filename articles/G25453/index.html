Their sizes vary from 43 to 65 inches.  Almost the entire series is positioned as a budget option, but this does not mean that it does not have unproductive fillings and interesting ‚Äúchips‚Äù.  In this article, the LG 49UJ630V TV will be considered, its features, functionality, as well as reviews of its lucky owners. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The appearance of the LG 49UJ630V TV is not unusual.  All the material that was used for the production is plastic.  No stylistic refinements or decorative elements are observed. </p>

    <p>  Almost all interfaces and connectors are located on the back of the TV.  Therefore, if you install the gadget directly on the wall, then reaching them will be problematic.  And you still have to go there, since it is here that the LAN, HDMI, optical output for audio, analog antenna input, and video connection in the form of tulips are located.  A bit strange, but this TV has only one USB port, which is also located on the rear panel.  Next to it there are two more HDMI ports.  The control panel is located at the bottom of the TV. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Image output </h2><p>  The picture quality indicators of the device are not the highest.  For example, in a bright room with good lighting, gray tones will be observed instead of black.  Viewing angles are also not the largest, so watching from the side of the TV will not always be convenient. </p><h2>  Trumotion function </h2><p>  Test LG 49UJ630V showed that this function as a whole performs its role.  And it serves precisely to draw dynamic scenes.  Of course, the limitations impose a bit on the response frequency of the pixel, so sometimes small loops can be observed behind moving objects. </p><h2>  Device management </h2><p>  The TV uses the Web OS platform as software.  It is based, as was to be expected on the Linux kernel.  The main feature is that it can be built into almost any technology.  This device presents the system version 3.5.  It is also equipped with a built-in DLNA client, which is able to detect compatible devices nearby, with which you can transfer data to a TV. </p>

    <p>  Setting up and controlling the LG 49UJ630V can be done using a special Magic Remote.  True, you have to buy it separately.  A gyroscope is built into it, with which you can control the cursor on the TV screen.  In this case, you can not even direct the remote at the screen.  It has a special scroll wheel, similar to that located on an ordinary computer mouse.  Using it is convenient to browse sites on the Internet.  Well, and an interesting feature is a voice search.  By pressing a special key you need to pronounce a phrase and the TV will start searching by keywords.  Some recent models may include the Ivi online movie call button. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  More technical features </h2><p>  The TV screen resolution is 3840 by 2160 pixels.  The display itself is an LCD type.  Screen size as already mentioned 49 inches.  The TV features an active type of HDR technology that allows you to correctly handle high-contrast scenes.  The total power of the speakers is 20 watts.  Supports Ultra Surround technology, creating a spectacular surround sound.  On board there is also the so-called Magic Sound Tuning technology.  With its help, you can adjust the sound based on the analyzed room.  More precisely, the system will do everything by itself. </p><p>  For the processing of incoming sound, that is, the voice, Clear Voice 3 algorithms are responsible. The codecs that the TV is capable of playing are a fairly extensive list: MP3, AAC and other well-known formats. </p>

In this case, when you turn on, for example, a media player, the TV will turn on. </p><h2>  TV Reviews Analysis </h2><p>  As the review showed, the LG 49UJ630V is a very budget option.  That is, gourmets of good quality are better off looking for more expensive models.  When playing scenes that are too dynamic, some distortion and loops will follow, reaching for objects.  Although reviews of the LG 49UJ630V show that with the right settings, you can achieve a pretty acceptable image. </p>

    <p>  Playback of numerous formats can be recorded as a plus of this device.  Appearance is not burdened with decorative elements, it looks simple, but at the same time stylish. </p><p>  Another undoubted advantage of the TV is the support for the free operating system Web OS.  The network always has various options for firmware and software for it.  In general, the Linux-based system itself is fairly stable and reliable. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the LG 49UJ630V, one can distinguish low brightness, incorrectly displayed black color in some cases, and inaccurate pixel structure of the RGB standard among the disadvantages of TVs. </p><h2>  Overview of the main competitors </h2><p>  This model has quite a lot of competitors, so you should deal with it in more detail.  Reviews of the LG 49UJ630V showed that many users chose it on the basis of a good quality-price ratio, which means that competing models should be chosen according to the same principle. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi TV </h2><p>  The maximum resolution of this TV is a little disappointing compared to the hero of the article.  It is only 1920 by 1080. The diagonal is 2 inches smaller.  The operating system uses the notorious Android.  The sound in terms of power and built-in functions is practically no different.  Two speakers of 10 watts each are also used.  From the connected peripherals are available HDMI, VGA. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that Xiaomi has a fairly good development in the world, reviews on the TV showed that in it, there is no support for the Russian language.  Also, users note a lack of resolution in 4K format and not the most satisfactory sound quality. </p><h2>  Sony KDL-48WD653 </h2><p>  This model costs almost 5,000 rubles.  more.  At the same time, its diagonal is 48 inches.  The resolution also does not shine and is equal to 1920 by 1080. There is support for all known video formats, and television standards.  The sound of the competitor clearly let us down, and its total power is 10 watts.  Judging by the reviews about it, this is not the TV that can be used as a Smart TV.  Although such video hosting sites as Youtube are played on it without problems.  Also, users noted that the image on this TV looks great.  The sound, though not as powerful as that of the hero of the article, but is of high quality.  In general, this model has a slightly overpriced price with all the features and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Samsung UE49M5500AU </h2><p>  This is a model of the same price range.  But the specifications are noticeably lower than the LG 49UJ630V.  Its diagonal is 49 inches.  The maximum resolution is only 1920 by 1080. The sound is the same.  As follows from the reviews about it, the workmanship is excellent.  Although the assembly of all the "Samsung" and takes place in Russia.  In general, this model at the same price has much weaker characteristics. </p><h2>  TCL L49P2US </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the only model among competitors that has the same diagonal and resolution.  In addition, it is a good option Smart-tv.  For productive filling, 64-bit processors are used.  In this case, the price range is still the same.  The build quality is satisfactory, nothing hangs and creaks.  Android version 5 is used as the operating system. Walking through the menu looks smooth and crisp.  In general, this is probably one of the main competitors of the LG 49UJ630V TV. </p><h2>  Philips 49PUT6101 </h2><p>  This TV is an almost complete copy of the article being reviewed.  Its diagonal is also equal to 49 inches.  At the same time, it can issue a 4K resolution.  The TV is a typical example of high-quality Smart TV. </p><p>  As users note, the picture of the device is clear and juicy.  There are practically no bugs.  The number of settings, and, accordingly, the functionality is very large.  You can customize almost every aspect. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, one can single out the ‚Äúslowed down‚Äù operating system and a large number of settings in which you can get confused, but for someone it will be more of a plus than a minus. </p><p>  The cost of this TV does not exceed 40,000 rubles.  That is, it is the same budget, but no less functional than the LG 49UJ630V in the review. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews on the LG 49UJ630V, this TV is more than a decent model for its money.  It has all the necessary functionality that flagships can boast of.  It is possible to watch the image in ultra-high definition format.  There is a well-implemented Smart TV.
