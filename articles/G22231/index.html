Located on the shores <span>of</span> Lake <span>Onega Bay</span> , it is the best option for those who like to enjoy nature without losing sight of civilization. </p><p>  The city is surrounded by lakes Lamba, Logmozero, Denna and others, on the banks of which you can spend time with health benefits.

Not all spa hotels in Karelia can boast of such vast wellness and entertainment programs.  Separate treatment courses have been developed for children, so families come here, sometimes consisting of representatives of several generations. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Palaces" </h2><p>  If you choose for recreation and recreation hotels in Karelia on the lake (inexpensive), then the ‚ÄúPalaces‚Äù, also located on the Marcial Waters, will be optimal in terms of price - quality and quantity of services.

    <p>  According to vacationers, the hotel ‚Äú13 chairs‚Äù is notable for its low prices and the provision of a quiet family vacation in the center of a big city.  An important fact is the possibility of staying with pets (free of charge for animals), which is rare among 4-star hotels. </p><h2>  SPA Bungalow </h2><p>  The solitary rest began to enjoy great popularity among tourists, providing the opportunity to both relax and improve, and to go fishing to the heart in peace and quiet.  "SPA Bungalow" is a country house on the shores of Lake Ladoga, which provides 2 equipped rooms with private facilities, a shared kitchen and necessary appliances. </p><p>  It offers vacationers a SPA center with a bath complex, hiking and horseback riding, fishing, massage, beach and evening entertainment in complete comfort with all the benefits of civilization - television and the Internet. </p><p>  As tourists note, ‚ÄúSPA Bungalow‚Äù is one of the most inexpensive types of recreation, where you can come with the whole family, even taking pets. </p><h2>  All inclusive </h2><p>  Although experienced tourists will say that <span>hotels in Karelia</span> with a swimming pool (all-inclusive) do not meet generally accepted standards that meet this criterion, holidays here have not become less popular.  Yes, in local hotels there is no free alcohol, 3 meals a day on the basis of the "buffet" and other privileges, but most of the services included in the price of the ticket are wellness programs, a visit to the pool, sauna, massage therapist and more. </p><p>  Rest in Karelia itself is more aimed at improving the health of the whole family with visits to interesting excursions or outdoor activities. </p><h2>  Hotel Severnaya </h2><p>  Relaxing in a hotel equipped with a wide range of SPA facilities, a gym and a sauna will be a great way to regain activity and rejuvenate. </p><p>  Relaxing in one of 104 comfortable rooms with all the amenities of the Severnaya Hotel, guests can go through wellness and beauty treatments without leaving the hotel and get an even, beautiful tan in the solarium.  According to holidaymakers, this is the best offer for a holiday in the city with comfort.  Average rating is 8.3 out of 10. </p><h2>  Rest in Karelia in the winter </h2><p>  Winter Karelia is as popular as summer.  This is evidenced by the numerous reviews of enthusiastic guests of the republic. </p><p>  Here at this time of the year, those who are used to actively spending every day and those who prefer peace and silence feel great.  Cottages, motels and hotels in Karelia in winter offer: </p><ul><li>  ice fishing; </li><li>  ski walks; </li><li>  snowmobiling; </li><li>  weekend tours to Kizhi, to <span>the Kivach nature reserve</span> with an ice-free waterfall and to the island of Valaam; </li><li>  a trip to the Marble Canyon in Ruskeala; </li><li>  dog sledding or downhill skiing; </li><li>  Wellness in numerous spa hotels or resorts. </li></ul><p>  This is far from all that this small republic offers.  Its most important assets are not hotels and hostels, but ecologically clean nature, beautiful at any time of the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels in Karelia in winter" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/1329118.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Health and Beauty Tours </h2><p>  This type of recreation has become the most popular among people of any age and gender who are tired of large cities and stresses.  Every citizen of Russia can afford 2-3 days to restore strength and beauty, since these tours are inexpensive, but return to work and have a radiant look. </p><p>  Equipped with modern equipment, SPA hotels in Karelia easily compete with European ones in the number of procedures, quality and price of services. </p>
