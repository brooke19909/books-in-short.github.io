  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human analyzers: general structure diagram and brief description of functions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Human analyzers are specific structures of the <span>nervous system, the</span> main function of which is to perceive information and form appropriate reactions.  Moreover, information can come both from the environment and from within the body itself. </p><p>  <strong>The general structure of the analyzer</strong> .  The very concept of ‚Äúanalyzer‚Äù appeared in science thanks to the famous scientist I. Pavlov.  It was he who first defined them as a separate system of organs and identified the general structure. </p><p>  Despite all the variety <span>of sensory organs, the</span> structure of the analyzer is usually quite typical.  It consists of a receptor department, a conductive part and a central department. </p><ul><li>  The receptor or peripheral part of the analyzer is a receptor that is adapted to the perception and primary processing of certain information.  For example, an ear curl reacts to a sound wave, eyes to light, skin receptors to pressure.  In receptors, information on the effect of the stimulus is processed into a nerve electrical impulse. </li><li>  The conductor parts are the analyzer sections, which are the nerve paths and endings that go to the subcortical structures of the brain.  An example is the optic as well as the auditory nerve. </li><li>  The central part of the analyzer is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cerebral cortex on which the received information is projected.  Here, in gray matter, the final processing of information and the selection of the most suitable reaction to the stimulus are carried out.  For example, if you press your finger to something hot, then the skin thermoreceptors will send a signal to the brain, where the command to pull your hand will come from. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Human analyzers and their classification</strong> .  In physiology, it is customary to divide all analyzers into external and internal.  External human analyzers respond to those stimuli that come from the external environment.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  <strong>Visual analyzer</strong> .  The receptor part of this structure is represented by the eyes.  The human eye consists of three membranes - protein, blood and nervous.  The amount of light that enters the retina is regulated by the pupil, which is able to expand and contract.  A ray of light breaks through the cornea, lens and <span>vitreous.</span>  Thus, the image falls on the retina, which contains many nerve receptors - rods and cones.  Thanks to chemical reactions, an electrical impulse is formed here, which follows the <span>optic nerve</span> and is projected in the occipital lobes of the cerebral cortex. </li><li>  <strong>Auditory analyzer</strong> .  The receptor here is the ear.  Its outer part collects sound, the middle represents the path of its passage.  Vibration moves through the analyzer departments until it reaches curl.  Here, the oscillations cause the movement of otoliths, which forms a nerve impulse.  The signal goes through the auditory nerve to the temporal lobes of the brain. </li><li>  <strong>Olfactory analyzer</strong> .  The inner lining of the nose is covered with the so-called olfactory epithelium, whose structures respond to odor molecules, creating nerve impulses. </li><li>  <strong>Taste human analyzers</strong> .  They are represented by taste buds - an accumulation of sensitive chemical receptors that react to certain <span>chemicals.</span> </li><li>  <strong>Tactile, pain, temperature human analyzers</strong> - represented by the corresponding receptors located in different layers of the skin. </li></ul><p>  If we talk about internal human analyzers, these are the structures that respond to changes within the body.  For example, in muscle tissue there are specific receptors that respond to pressure and other indicators that change inside the body. </p><p>  Another striking example is the <span>vestibular apparatus,</span> which responds to the position of the whole body and its parts relative to space. </p><p>  It is worth noting that human analyzers have their own characteristics, and the effectiveness of their work depends on age, and sometimes on gender.  For example, women distinguish more shades and aromas than men.  Representatives of the stronger half have more <span>taste buds.</span> </p>
