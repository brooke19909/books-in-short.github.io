  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hitler's women: relationship stories, photos, fate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  "The embodiment of the trait in the human body" - so many called Adolf Hitler.  And not by chance.  It is hard to imagine that such a monster could have human bright feelings.  But, like any other man, the Fuhrer could not resist the feminine charm.  Hitler was loved by women.  This can be said unequivocally. </p><p>  Who are they - women of Hitler?  Killers, lovers?  We will talk more about the representatives of the weaker sex, who were in the close circle of the great Fuhrer. </p><h2>  Hitler's women: Eva Brown - girlfriend </h2><p>  It is this woman who must open the "track record" of Hitler's mistresses.  When Eve met the 40-year-old Adolf, she was only 17 years old.  Then she assisted the photographer.  Relations with Adolf Hitler were very difficult and tense, since Eve was very jealous of the F√ºhrer to his many mistresses.  Young Eve tried several times to take her own life because of difficulties in the relationship.  However, despite everything, the couple had a rich sex life. </p><p>  Once, Eva showed her close friends a photograph of the British Prime Minister on the couch in their apartment in Munich, her comment came out unambiguously and shocked her friends: ‚ÄúIf he knew what was happening on this couch.‚Äù </p><div class="photo" data-original="katana17.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eva brown" class="if uuid-3129679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129679.jpg"></div><p>  The girl was almost one with Hitler.  However, she spoke with the German people extremely little and rarely.  All perceived her as hostesses in the house, which was located on Mount Obersalzberg.  However, Hitler did not introduce Eve to anyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On April 29, 1945, the couple legalized relations in the bunker of the Reich Chancellery.  In just a couple of hours, both newlyweds ended their lives with suicide.  Eve drank a capsule containing potassium cyanide in front of her husband's eyes.  Happiness did not last long. </p><h2>  Magda Goebbels </h2><p>  You can talk for a long time about who Hitler's women are.  Magda Goebbels - the first Frau, wife of Joseph Goebbels, the head of the NSDAP propaganda department.  Many historians are sure that their marriage was calculated.  Despite the greed of this relationship, Magda gave birth to six children in this marriage.  But the children further complicated their relationship.  Joseph constantly cheated on his wife.  He was annoyed that Magda was in close contact with Hitler. </p><p>  The German beauty almost never made concessions to her husband.  At least two or three lovers she always had.  Historians believe that Magda is an ardent follower of the Third Reich.  However, when the war began to go against Hitler‚Äôs plan, Magda was the first to question Adolf‚Äôs success.  Once she heard the F√ºhrer on the radio and quickly turned off, saying: "What nonsense he carries." </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.paginasiete.bo" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="adolf hitler and women" class="if uuid-3129682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129682.jpg"></div><p>  After the suicide of Eve and Hitler, Magda and Joseph went the same way.  First, they killed their joint children by drinking them morphine.  Then they put a cyanide capsule into each child‚Äôs mouth.  On the same day, the couple committed suicide. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gels Ruabal </h2><p>  Gels is the father's daughter of Adolf Hitler's sister.  Having entered the Munich Medical University, the girl moved to Adolf‚Äôs apartment.  The same, in turn, immediately began to influence the young girl. </p><p>  When Hitler found out that Geli was meeting with his driver, he forced her to end this relationship.  He fired the driver, and Gels since then only accompanied by appeared in public places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radiomitre.cienradios.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler woman photo" class="if uuid-3129684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129684.jpg"></div><p>  In 1931, a young girl wanted to move to Vienna.  Uncle Adolf forbade her to do this.  Gels could not stand such pressure and shot herself. </p><p>  Definitely no one can say in what relationship she was with Hitler.  Some believe that she had a love relationship with the Fuhrer.  Others, on the contrary, consider her a victim of a tyrant.  It is safe to say that their relationship cannot be called happy and healthy. </p><p>  Hitler himself later admitted that Geli was the only woman he truly loved.  In her bedroom, all things remained intact, and portraits with her image adorned the walls in the Office of the Federal Chancellor. </p><h2>  Unity Mitford (Valkyrie) </h2><p>  Hitler was surrounded not only by native Germans.  Unity Mitford is Adolf's mistress, daughter of a British aristocrat.  She was head over heels in love with Hitler, so in 1934 she left for Germany and met him at a Munich restaurant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  She gradually entered the circle of associates and actively began to support the Nazi regime.  Adolf Hitler later provided her with an apartment.  When Unity moved into this apartment, a Jewish family lived there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.twoeggz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler loved women" class="if uuid-3129687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129687.jpg"></div><p>  As soon as Hitler officially declared war, Unity tried to commit suicide.  However, the attempt was in vain.  Almost until the end of the war, Unity lived in England under the supervision of her family.  She could no longer serve herself.  The bullet in the head remained, and too close to the brain.  Therefore, the doctors did not dare to do the operation.  She died in 1948 from a tumor that formed as a result of meningitis. </p><p>  In 2007, The New Statesman magazine published an article stating that Mitford was returning to Britain already pregnant with Hitler.  In the hospital, she gave birth to a baby.  But he was given to foster parents. </p><h2>  Emmy Goering </h2><p>  In the story about <span>Adolf Hitler and his women</span> <span>, it is necessary to mention the beautiful German actress Emmy Goering.</span>  <span>She was the second wife of the Reich Minister of the Ministry of Aviation.</span>  <span>In German society, she was called the first lady of the Third Reich.</span>  <span>It was this title that caused jealousy on the part of Eva Brown.</span>  <span>Emmy did not like her.</span>  <span>However, both rivals had a mutual dislike of each other.</span> </p><p>  Emmy has always been the focus of media attention.  Often published photos of her chic life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.berlinerdom.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most shocking hypotheses" class="if uuid-3129689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129689.jpg"></div><p>  After the war ended, Emma was sentenced to imprisonment.  However, a year later she was released.  The rest of the days she spent in a small Munich apartment. </p><h2>  Inga Lei </h2><p>  The most shocking hypothesis: Hitler's women committed suicide, remaining loyal to the F√ºhrer until their last breath.  And it's hard to argue with that. </p><p>  Inga Ley is the wife of Robert Ley, a Nazi party official.  She had an affair with Hitler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler women their fate" class="if uuid-3129691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129691.jpg"></div><p>  In his apartment, her portrait in the nude style even hung.  Soon she committed suicide. </p><h2>  Elsa Brookman </h2><p>  A born aristocrat, the Romanian princess Elsa Brookman was the daughter of Prince Theodore.  The young beauty married the German publisher Hugo Brookman.  She and her husband simply adored Hitler, in every possible way financing him.  However, both before and after the failed attempt to carry out a coup in 1923. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ns-dokuzentrum-muenchen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinfred Wagner Muse" class="if uuid-3129693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129693.jpg"></div><p>  Elsa, like many of Hitler's women, was devoted to him.  So that the F√ºhrer could contact high-ranking people, she specially opened a salon for representatives of high society.  Elsa later published philosophical thoughts on this subject. </p><h2>  Eleanor Baur </h2><p>  An ordinary <span>nurse, before being in Munich, gave birth to two illegitimate children.</span>  <span>Like all Hitler women, Eleanor was his close friend and lover.</span>  <span>Later, she founded the National Socialist German Workers Party.</span>  <span>She was the only woman who took part in the seizure of power under the name ‚ÄúBeer putsch‚Äù.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="keclips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="women and marlene" class="if uuid-3129694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129694.jpg"></div><p>  Eleanor Baur is one of the few who helped organize the Dachau concentration camps.  She was later accused of using prisoners as labor.  Even after ten years in prison, she did not renounce Nazism.  She died in 1981. </p><h2>  Charlotte Lobjoy </h2><p>  This girl was the daughter of a French butcher and the first Hitler girl that everyone knew about.  She was only 18 years old when she met a young corporal Schicklgruber.  However, the servant soon escaped from the bride. </p><p>  It is not known for certain how this woman happened to be with Hitler.  Hitler (in the photo below son) did not recognize the child from her. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mehele.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler's son" class="if uuid-3129724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129724.jpg"></div><p>  It was impossible to prove kinship at the time. </p><h2>  Maria Reiter </h2><p>  She was the 16-year-old daughter of a tailor at the time of meeting Hitler.  Then he was a famous politician in Bavaria.  Historians believe that he himself met a young lady during a walk. </p><p>  Maria's father was an ardent opponent of the nationalists, even attended special meetings of the Social Democratic parties.  This moment gave special piquancy to the couple‚Äôs secret meetings.  Relations between Mary and Hitler resembled the story of Romeo and Juliet. </p><p>  Adolf called the girl a cute child and pussy.  Mary was blindly in love with Hitler.  She forgave him everything, including cruel antics to the dog, disgusting comments about meat dishes in the restaurant.  Adolf was an avid vegetarian. </p><p>  Many believe that the couple did not have intimate relationships.  In 1928, they parted as Hitler‚Äôs political opponents tried to denigrate him with platonic relations with Mary.  Break the girl was not easy - she tried to commit suicide.  But the attempt was unsuccessful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler women eva" class="if uuid-3129700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129700.jpg"></div><p>  Soon, Mary became Adolf's mistress.  Their relationship continued until they got bored with Hitler.  After the war, Maria was one of the few who defended the Fuhrer from accusations of male inferiority. </p><p>  The whole world was inspired by the idea that Adolf Hitler was flawed as a man.  They cited as evidence the fact that the Fuhrer was inferior due to a wound in the groin during the First World War.  Many spoke of the fact that Hitler was homosexual and impotent.  These topics literally ‚Äúsucked‚Äù during the discussion of his life.  Only close friends of his youth, his beloved women claimed that Adolf as a man was absolutely healthy. </p><h2>  Marlene Dietrich </h2><p>  The women of Hitler and Marlene Dietrich are a complex phrase.  Marlene was the only woman in the world who refused the great Hitler to be his mistress.  Dietrich is the Fuhrer's favorite actress.  He never hesitated to talk about it.  The dictator kept talking about the beauty of her legs.  Whether Adolf Hitler managed to get his darling into bed is still an unsolved mystery. </p><h2>  Leni Riefenstahl </h2><p>  A talented actress, director, sophisticated beauty Leni admired Hitler's performances.  Once she secretly wrote a letter to him asking him to meet in person. </p><p>  Hitler could not go past this energetic, charming and manly demanding of people.  Leni was a real "black sheep" among her contemporaries.  She flew airplanes, lugging through deserts and seas.  I filmed and filmed all the time. </p><p>  The frames of the official chronicle show how the two abnormal were well surrounded by each other.  But according to the official version, they met with Hitler only on business matters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.counter-currents.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="women of the Fuhrer" class="if uuid-3129703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129703.jpg"></div><p>  Adolf Hitler, an innovative filmmaker and personal cameraman - these definitions have always remained with Leni‚Äôs name.  Critics from all over the world agreed that Mrs. Riefenstahl was not a member of the National Socialist Party.  However, thanks to her films, thousands of people joined the ranks of nationalists. </p><p>  For the rest of her life, she proved to the whole world that she wanted to shoot just a movie.  Her filming was just pure art.  However, no matter who says anything, it was Leni who created the film ‚ÄúTriumph of the Will,‚Äù which is considered an artistic symbol of fascism. </p><p>  Later this film was shown at the Nuremberg trials as an illustration of Nazi ideology.  Many years later, Leni said: ‚ÄúI regret that I shot this film.  If I knew what he would bring to me, I would never have taken it off. ‚Äù </p><p>  After the end of World War II, Leni ended up in prison several times, and spent two years in an insane asylum.  After many, many years, the charges of aiding Nazism were dropped and she was no longer persecuted.  However, world cinema has forever turned its back on the great director.  Leni died at the age of 102. </p><h2>  Winifred Wagner </h2><p>  Daughter of the famous German composer Richard Wagner.  After the death of her husband, she organized the annual Bayreuth Festival.  Then many already knew who Hitler's women were.  Winifred Wagner - a muse in the life of the Fuhrer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="occultthirdreich.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magda Goebbels First Frau" class="if uuid-3129706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3129706.jpg"></div><p>  She met Hitler in the 1920s.  Twentieth century.  Then Wagner provided Adolf with a paper to write Mine Kampf. </p><p>  In 1933, rumors began to circulate that Wagner‚Äôs widow was about to go down the aisle for Hitler.  However, this did not happen.  Although many argue that Winifred despised hatred of Jews from Hitler.  Like many women of Hitler, Wagner remained devoted to him until the end of her days.  They were friends for society. </p><p>  Behind every great man is a great woman.  It's hard to argue with that.  Adolf Hitler and his women are proof of this.  The F√ºhrer is an outstanding personality, although not on the positive side.  His political activity left a bloody and irreparable mark in the history of the twentieth century.  Hitler‚Äôs women and their fate, which ended in failure, are an example of how one person can affect the lives of many. </p><p>  Hitler had many one-time short intimate relationships.  Some fans from the great Fuhrer, while others were looking for his benefit in it. </p>
