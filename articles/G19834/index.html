Not all of them know that just 40 km from a romantic European city is the extreme point of Eurasia - the place where the earth ends.  This is the cape of Cabo de Roca.  This is the real edge of the earth, which offers a fantastic view of the endless sea.  Read more about the cape in the article below. </p><h2>  A bit about the history and geography of the cape </h2><p>  The first frightening cape was found by the Romans, who gave it the name Great Cape.  During the great geographical discoveries, the name was changed to Lisbon and only after a while on Cabo de Roca.  Only in 1979 were data publicly reported that the westernmost point of Europe was located here.  Since that time, the place has a huge tourist popularity. </p><p>  The cape, which has a height of 140 meters, is located in the Sintra-Cascais park.  To get to it, you need to walk along a picturesque winding road.  The mountain is very high and has a steep cliff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rocky shores of rock" class="if uuid-2459754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2459754.jpg"></div><p>  Being here, you understand why the cape was so respected by ancient people. </p><h2>  How to choose the time for a trip? </h2><p>  In Cabo de Roca (Portugal), you can see tourists at any time of the year and at any time of the day.  This place is never empty.  Each time of the year and day is good in its own way.  If you choose the first half of the day for a trip, you can look at the walls of the lighthouse lit by the bright rays of the sun, and also go down to the sandy beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cafe Cabo de Roca" class="if uuid-2459796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2459796.jpg"></div><p>  Connoisseurs are advised to come here in the afternoon to see a fantastic sunset and take beautiful photos.  Coming to the cape at night fall into a completely different world.  The lighthouse propeller rotating above the head seems to transport the tourist into a mystical and unknown world.  These are very vivid emotions!  You should be aware that there are no hotels nearby, so if you are traveling without a car, bring along a travel mat, blanket and thermos with a hot drink. </p><h2>  What is the weather like in Cabo de Roca? </h2><p>  At the extreme point of Europe it is always windy.  The never-abating wind also explains the scarce vegetation of the area.  If you want to see the sunset on the cape, bring a jacket with a hood, it may rain. </p><p>  Take into account the strength of the wind and when trying to take interesting photos.  Remember that the fences here are not strong enough! </p><div class="photo" data-original="deweyinportugal.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="western point of Europe" class="if uuid-2459773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2459773.jpg"></div><p>  Do not risk your life for the sake of a photo, a strong wind can easily carry a person into the abyss.  It should be remembered that the wind force at the edge of the earth changes very quickly.  In a couple of seconds, a light wind can turn into a squall, so climbing over fences in the evening is dangerous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to the cape? </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to the extreme point of Europe.  If you are a tourist who always wants to have support, then while in Lisbon, get a tour of Sintra and Cascais.  It includes a race to Cabo de Roca, but you will not be able to choose the time of day and time spent on the cape. </p><p>  The next method is minibus No. 403. It follows the route between Sintra and Cascais approximately every 1.5 hours.  The method is not so simple - from Lisbon by train you need to get to Sintra or Cascais.  Bus stations in both cities are located near the final stops of trains. </p><p>  How to get to Cabo de Roca by car?  Highway 247 connects Cascais and Peniches.  You need to move along it, and the signs are found constantly, it is very difficult to get lost.  The road will be picturesque and enjoyable: at first the highway goes along the sea and the beach, then it rises into the mountains, where centuries-old pines, eucalyptus and plane trees grow.  After that, you just need to take the highway down towards the cape. </p><h2>  The main attraction of Cabo de Roca is the lighthouse </h2><p>  The main attraction on the cape is one of the key landmarks in the sea for all sailors in Western Europe - the lighthouse.  Historically, the art of navigation and cartography has always been valued in Portugal, so in 1758 the Marquis de Pombal ordered the Minister of Finance to allocate funds for the construction of six lighthouses.  Until that time, lighthouses were only in the south and north of the country, but now it was decided to cover the west. </p><p>  Cape Cabo de Roca is a rocky cliff, so the lighthouse here was built from scratch.  The height of the lighthouse is 22 meters, and its rays send light into the sea for fifty kilometers.  Four flashes and a pause - the beacon signal remains the same to this day.  Initially, oil lamps were the light source, but at the end of the 19th century electricity was brought here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wiadomosci.wp.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cape Cabo de Roca" class="if uuid-2459746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2459746.jpg"></div><p>  The lighthouse is also unique in that a real ranger works on it.  Such a position exists on 4 of 52 Portugal lighthouses. The rest is controlled by automation.  The picturesque lighthouse is open for visitors on Wednesdays from 14.00 to 17.00, and the entrance inside is free.  It should be noted that it was allowed to enter it only in 2011, so it is not known how long the visit will last. </p><h2>  Cape Infrastructure </h2><p>  In addition to the famous lighthouse, a pad pad cross and a sign indicating that you are on the westernmost point of Europe are installed on the top of the cape.  Every traveler must take a photo here.  You can also purchase a certificate confirming that you have visited this amazing place. </p><p>  The description of Cabo de Roca would not be complete without a story about the local (rather meager) infrastructure.  After sightseeing, you can visit the cafe and souvenir shop.  By the way, from here you can send a postcard to friends and family, decorated with a unique stamp. </p><p>  On a steep and rocky road you can go down to the beach and plunge into the ocean.  In no case should you use the road in the rain or immediately after it - it is very dangerous!  There were cases that ended tragically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mandelan.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the cape" class="if uuid-2459756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2459756.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to bring a truly authentic souvenir from the ends of the earth, then purchase it not at the cape itself, but in the town of Azoya.  In addition to porcelain figures of lighthouses, real Portuguese handmade dishes and marine-themed souvenirs are sold here.  You can also try local, rather interesting drinks. </p><h2>  Where to go after the extreme point of Europe? </h2><p>  If you are a zealous traveler who does not stop at visiting one interesting point on the map, go further.  After Azoya, the road opens the way to various interesting places that surround the cape.  Turning left you will find yourself in Sintra with its notable palaces and castles.  Along the road to the right is Cascais, which is famous for its casinos and night clubs. </p><p>  Lovers of elite beaches and surfing can stay in Ginshu.  Nearby is the country's only hotel-restaurant, which has two Michelin stars.  Moreover, it is located in an ancient fortress of the XVII century with a wonderful view of the ocean.  If you are a lover of silence, then go to the "Apple Beach". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.patrickcomerford.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cape infrastructure" class="if uuid-2459763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2459763.jpg"></div><p>  To visit <span>the westernmost point of Europe</span> - Cape Cabo de Roca - only a traveler who does not fear difficulties, inhospitable rocks and winds dares.  But having been here once, you will never forget this place! </p>
