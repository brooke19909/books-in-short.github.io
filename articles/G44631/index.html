But we will not talk about the capital of this country.  We are interested in the largest industrial and commercial center - Barcelona.  Description of the city, history, attractions, as well as information about many other things you will find in this article.  <span>Spain's</span> second largest <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãis</span> waiting to share its secrets with you. </p><h2>  From Antiquity to the Middle Ages </h2><p>  How Barcelona appeared, a city in Spain, is not exactly known.  There are two versions of the occurrence.  One relates us to the Greek <span>myths of Hercules.</span>  The second is somewhat closer on the scale to our days and leads to the third century BC.  At this time, Roman troops conquered the city of Laye and equipped it as a fortress with a center located on the mountain.  The nearby Tarracon was significantly larger and more important than a small fortification. </p>

Riches accumulated, and with them the importance increased.  Own coins appeared.  By the fifth century, Barsino, named after the commander, pushes large neighbors and occupies one of the leading positions.

    <p>  Numerous wars and invasions suffered Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe history of the city was varied and exciting.  Visigoths, Moors, Muslims, Franks - they all visited this land. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern history </h2><p>  Barcelona has survived more than one war and succeeded by several rulers: Charles III, Philip V, General Suchet, Napoleon.  During this time, it is difficult to say that the city had stable development and prosperity. </p><p>  Most enterprises appeared during the industrial revolution - in the 19th century.  At that time, the city managed to somewhat weaken the tight control of the Spanish authorities.  The protective wall erected in the Middle Ages was demolished.  The fortress turned into a beautiful city park. </p><p>  In the 20th century, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa city in Spain, begins its rebirth.  In 1929, the next world exhibition is held.  After the capture of the Republicans during the Civil War, the city was subjected to intense cultural and political repression.  Catalan is becoming banned. </p><p>  After the disappearance of dictatorial influences, the city turns into a major cultural center.  The Barcelona Office is striving to revive the <span>Catalan language,</span> and gradually it is returning to everyday life. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Today, the city has a lot of attractive places that reveal to tourists the history, culture and nature. </p><p>  For example, the Old Town is a historical center.  Residential buildings, burials of the Roman era can be seen in the Gothic quarter. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Interesting and bizarre creations of architecture are collected in the quarter of Discord. </p><p>  Notes of modernism can be traced in the buildings of the Holy Cross. </p><p>  All this speaks of the diversity of architectural styles and trends that fill Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãa city in Spain.  Attractions include huge spacious parks. </p><p>  Near the port is <span>Mount Montjuic</span> with an ancient fortress, which today serves as the Military Museum.  Here you can also see one of the first bullring. </p><p>  Park Guell cannot be called too large, but, despite its modest size, there is something to see here: a twisted bench, a columned hall, two pavilions. </p>

    <h2>  Famous houses </h2><p>  Special attention deserves the architecture of the city.  Walking the streets, tourists can see the amazing creations of the famous master - Antonio Gaudi. </p><p>  The most famous mansion is located in the Eixample district.  One glance at the facade is enough to realize that you have not seen this before. </p><p>  Amazing shapes and colors will open for tourists Barcelona - a city in Spain photo, which you can see in the article. </p><p>  The facade of the building is decorated with windows with smooth outlines, delicate elegant details.  Bright colors of the mosaic create a variety of paintings, stained-glass windows of stained glass add fabulousness. </p><p>  Another creation of the master‚Äôs hand is Mila‚Äôs house.  It combines a residential building and an architectural monument. </p><p>  At first, the townspeople took this creation with some rejection.  The house looked too innovative and bold against the background of other structures.  However, not only the facade of the building is noteworthy.  For example, it does not have load-bearing walls, and interior partitions can be installed at the discretion of residents.  The architect paid special attention to ventilation, which allows dispensing with air conditioning. </p>

    <h2>  Modern attractions </h2><p>  Amazing buildings in the city appear today.  So, ten years ago, an amazing creation was opened to residents and tourists - Agbar Tower.  Over one hundred and forty floors, an amazing oval shape, resembles a boulder that has grown from the ground, or a multi-colored cucumber. </p><p>  The facade is made of concrete and covered with a glassy shell, part of which is transparent, the other is not.  Looking around the tower, you can see how it shimmers with all the colors of the rainbow, from afar the facade, like a liquid mass, changing its color depending on the incident light. </p><p>  The building is designed so that the windows serve as solar panels and ventilation. </p><p>  The huge height allows you to see the tower from anywhere in the city. </p><p>  Another attractive place for tourists is the aquarium.  Here thousands of species of underwater inhabitants are collected, representing more than a dozen ecosystems.  Visitors are given a unique opportunity to see near small fish and huge sharks. </p><p>  All this magnificence opens to its guests Barcelona - a city in Spain, which is definitely worth a visit. </p><h2>  The pearl of Barcelona </h2><p>  The building, the Temple of the Sagrada Familia (Basilica de la Sagrada Familia), deserves special attention.  The original author was Francisco del Villar, later Antonio Gaudi continued the work and completely changed the original project.  He breathed new life into the temple and endowed it with a special meaning. </p><p>  A unique feature of the building is its construction period.  For more than two centuries, it continues to develop, change and grow.  And at the same time does not lose popularity among tourists from all over the world. </p>
