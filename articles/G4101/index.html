The city has an ancient and fascinating history.  It is first mentioned in written annals dating from 1326.  Researchers believe that its first inhabitants were pirates.  It received its name in honor of the pirusts - the Illyrian tribe.  Traces of Neolithic culture were discovered in the ancient Spila cave above Perast. </p><h2>  Perast (Montenegro) attractions </h2><p>  The main part of the city's memorable places is located on the embankment, which bears the name of the navigator Marko Martinovich.  The original baroque houses and palazzo, which belonged to the Martinovich family and Admiral Matias Zmaevich, give the city an extraordinary charm.  Nowadays, they perform an exclusively aesthetic function.  They remind of the former greatness and power of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perast city Montenegro" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1008797.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bujovic Palace </h2><p>  Unlike them, this structure is one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.  It was built of stone in 1687.  Today it houses the museum of the city of Perast.  Among its exhibits are a solid collection of weapons, a collection of ancient manuscripts and manuscripts, ancient photographs and paintings, sea charts, ship diaries and costumes of past eras. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Monument to the Sea Glory of Perast </h2><p>  This Admiral Square is located in the very center of the city.  It is dedicated to Matias Zmaevich.  Over Perast, on a mountain, half-ruined bastions of the fortress of the Holy Cross rise.  Once they did an excellent job with a difficult task - a reflection of the attacks of the Ottomans. </p><p>  To this day, of the ten cardak towers, which during the siege served as a refuge for the townspeople, only the Matusevich‚Äôs tower has survived.  The 55-meter bell tower is visible from anywhere in the city.  It adjoins the main church - the church of St. Nicholas.  From the top of the bell tower offers a magnificent view of the bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perast Montenegro" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1012878.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Island of st george </h2><p>  The city of Perast (Montenegro) impresses guests with its beautiful nature.  As a rule, all tourists who come here tend to get to this mysterious island.  In ancient times there was an abbey and many temples.  Over time, the complex fell into decay, and citizens began to bury on this land.  Now it is often called the island of the Dead.  This is a very interesting mystical place, getting here is not so easy - the island is closed to the public. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perast city Montenegro" class="if" height="199" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1008809.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Virgin Island </h2><p>  The city of Perast (Montenegro) is famous for its artificial island and the Church of the Virgin, located on it.  The temple was built in 1630. </p><p>  According to an ancient legend, during a severe storm, two sailors managed to escape on a rock.  To their great surprise, they found here the icon of the Mother of God.  In honor of their salvation, they decided to build a church on this site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perast Montenegro photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1008804.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To create an artificial island, old and captured ships were used, which were drowned using rocks and stones.  They say that since then there is a custom - every sailor who returns home must throw a stone near the rock.  Today, custom has become a local holiday.  Every year on July 22, citizens swim in boats to the island and throw stones at the deep sea.  The creation of the island and the construction of the church took almost two centuries. </p><h2>  Church of the Virgin </h2><p>  The city of Perast (Montenegro), a photo of which is increasingly appearing in travel agency brochures, attracts lovers to combine beach vacations with sightseeing. </p><p>  The Church of the Virgin is active today.  Here every Saturday there is a wedding.  Over the icon of the Mother of God, the entire wall is hung with wedding bouquets and wreaths that brides give to the Holy Virgin on the happiest day of their life.  Silver incense sticks hung on the walls of the church, made in the form of ships that were presented to the church by sailors upon their return from sailing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="perast montenegro reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1013272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The painter Tripo Kokol, who worked in the Baroque style, painted the temple for ten years, so the church resembles a gallery.  At the end of the 18th century, a marble altar was installed in it, and on it the icon ‚ÄúTheotokos on Rifa‚Äù.  If you happen to be here, go behind the altar, find a small hole on the back wall.  There is a belief that if you put your hand in it and make a wish, it will certainly come true. </p><h2>  Bujovici Palace </h2><p>  Everyone who has already visited Perast (Montenegro), believe that the most beautiful building in the city is the Bujovici Palace.  It is built of stone ruined walls of the city of Herceg Novi.  It was laid in 1694.  This date is indicated on stone signs located on the facade of the palace.  It is interesting that a palace was built in honor of the national hero Vitsko Buyovic during the period of the <span>Venetian Republic.</span>  The author of the project was the Venetian architect Giovanni Fontana.  Above the entrance to the palace, the generic coat of arms of Bujovici has been preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perast Montenegro" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1012771.jpg" width="600"></div>
