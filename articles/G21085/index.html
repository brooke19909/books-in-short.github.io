The island has long won the title of a resort.  Every year, many vacationers rush here, eager to enjoy the sea and the sun.  Meanwhile, not all hotel complexes operating in Cyprus can boast of decent service and good rooms.  For this reason, when planning a vacation, it is better to choose the most suitable option yourself and not rely on the advice of tour operators who are not interested in providing true information. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Atlantica Aeneas Resort consists of low-rise buildings in a traditional Cypriot style.  The buildings are made of natural stone with tiled red roofs.  The complex is located in a cozy place and occupies almost six hectares of land, surrounded by gardens.  The advantage of Atlantica Aeneas Resort SPA is its location, because across the road from it are the most beautiful beaches of Nissi Bay.  This picturesque place with a beautiful coast is a great option for a sea holiday. </p>

    <p>  The complex has several conference rooms of various capacities for conducting business negotiations.  The hotel also organizes wedding events for which there is a special room. </p><h2>  Children's entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel administration takes care of its guests, and therefore offers the youngest tourists to visit the children's pool and playground on its territory.  The restaurants of the complex have special high chairs for babies.  Upon request, a cot is available for guests.  Every evening, animators arrange a mini-disco for young tourists. </p><p>  In addition, children over four years old can attend the club during the day, where they are offered a variety of games. </p><h2>  Hotel Atlantica Aeneas Resort: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would like to note that it can be safely attributed to the best Cypriot hotel complexes.  This is confirmed by numerous admired reviews of tourists. </p><p>  First of all, I want to note that the Atlantica Aeneas Resort SPA 5 * hotel has a very unusual territory.  It seems that the complex is a continuous pool around which buildings are built.  All this is done so harmoniously that it causes complete delight.  All the time spent here on vacation, you are surrounded by water, which creates a certain atmosphere of peace. </p>

    <p>  The children's and adult pools are very clean, so you can go into them without fear. </p><p>  Ayia Napa's beaches deserve some praise.  It is difficult to find a resort with such a beautiful sandy coast without pebbles and shells.  It is just a real paradise for children.  In addition, it is necessary to note the cleanliness of the sea and the lack of algae. </p><p>  To the beach to go no more than three minutes, you just need to cross the road, but there is no busy traffic on it, and drivers pass pedestrians at the crossing.  Therefore, there is no inconvenience. </p><p>  According to tourists, classes at the kids club take place in English, since there is no Russian-speaking animator.  This is not very convenient for babies, although not critical.  The hotel has a wonderful playground for children, which is always the center of all games. </p><p>  Buying a ticket, tourists can always arrange a transfer.  The hotel is happy to provide such a service.  The staff will meet you on time and promptly deliver to your destination. </p><p>  The staff of the hotel complex works very harmoniously and well, the settlement is fast, daily cleaning is carried out efficiently. </p>

    <p>  There are probably no bad rooms in the hotel, they are all clean, with good furniture and spacious.  The most interesting of them, according to vacationers, are those that have their own access to the pool. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth dwelling on the issue of <span>food at the</span> Atlantica Aeneas Resort 5 * <span>hotel</span> .  It is food that always causes a lot of discontent from vacationers.  But this does not concern our hotel.  According to tourists, the food in the hotel complex is organized at a high level.  The dishes are very varied and delicious.  For breakfast, for example, you can enjoy scrambled eggs, pancakes, yoghurts, milk porridges and many other dishes.  The chef cooks meat and fish dishes, which are always enough.  Guests are offered a large selection of salads, vegetables and fruits.  But from desserts, rolls and pastries in general, you can not tear yourself away. </p><p>  If the child does not like food, then you can always turn to the cook, he will easily solve the problem by preparing smoothies or mashed potatoes from suitable ingredients in a blender.  I would like to note that all the dishes in the hotel are very tasty and like our compatriots, there is not such a strong contrast between tastes as in Turkey or AOE. </p>

    <p>  The all-inclusive meal plan is so tight that vacationers simply have no time to get hungry.  There are snacks, drinks, desserts, coffee and more.  So there is no problem with food.  You can safely come even with the smallest children.  In general, tourists are advised to purchase a package with <span>All inclusive</span> meals <span>.</span>  It is really very convenient and practical. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel was originally aimed at couples with children, even the names of rooms and their equipment testify to this.  Nevertheless, it cannot be said that hotel guests have nothing to do except get-togethers by the sea.  During the daytime, the hectic life just boils around the pool.  In the evening, guests will enjoy shows and live music concerts.  No one will be bored. </p>
