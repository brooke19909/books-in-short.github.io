  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Baltic", Yekaterinburg: address, developer, description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Yekaterinburg - the capital of the Urals - the city is quite modern and developed.  That is why there is absolutely nothing strange and surprising in the fact that its residents have become more demanding of residential real estate.  The Khrushchevs of the same type and panels were replaced by modern residential complexes, entire blocks offering the most comfortable living conditions.  One of such projects is the Baltiysky LCD complex (Yekaterinburg). The developer positions it as something unique and inimitable. But how are things really? As part of this material, we will make the most objective review of the complex, identify all its advantages and disadvantages . </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  So, the description of the Baltiysky residential complex (Yekaterinburg) presents to our attention a business class residential project.  Construction is carried out in several stages in a single stylistic design.  The authors of the project wanted to emphasize the nobility and luxury of the capital of the Urals.  From the advantage of the LCD "Baltic" (Yekaterinburg) I want to note the high level of comfort and excellent environmental conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.atomstroy.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Baltic Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-3194668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3194668.jpg"></div><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  All buildings are erected using monolithic technology using gas blocks that give the building excellent heat and sound insulation properties.  Brick is used for cladding.  The developer chose precisely the horizontal wiring of water supply and heating systems.  Each entrance has high-speed elevators with minimal noise.  The builder also took care of the technical equipment of the apartments, installing ultra-precise two-tariff electricity meters and water meters, as well as equipping entrances for low-voltage networks, especially the Internet and television.  A fire alarm has been installed that provides a high level of security to each resident. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The construction is led by the Atomstroykompleks company (Yekaterinburg), a rather experienced developer who has successfully implemented many projects.  The basis of each of them is comfort for each resident, which is why all projects are so popular and in demand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novosel99.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltic housing estate" class="if uuid-3194682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3194682.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of the Baltiysky residential complex, an area was chosen within the boundaries of Akademika Vonsovskogo and Mikheev streets.  The southwestern district of the city is rightfully the most promising from the point of view of residential development.  Everything is new here: communications, roads, infrastructure, and most importantly, luxury residential complexes with a huge house territory, which has enough space for games and sports grounds, full-fledged recreation areas and even parking lots.  LCD "Baltic" (Yekaterinburg) is adjacent to a picturesque forest park that separates the neighborhood from the hustle and bustle of the metropolis.  In addition, it affects the favorable environmental conditions.  Address LCD "Baltic": Yekaterinburg, st.  Academician Vonsovsky / st.  Mikheeva / blvd.  Academician Semikhatov, which only confirms its scale and scope. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd baltic where is" class="if uuid-3195107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3195107.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The new residential neighborhood is located near the city center, by private car, the journey takes no more than 15 minutes.  Well, if you do not have personal transport, it is unlikely in this case that you can be upset, because in the direction of the complex quite new public transport routes have been launched.  And this is only the beginning, because as the microdistrict grows, the transport network will only expand and expand, which will ultimately allow you to get to any point in the city in the shortest possible time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer of the Baltiysky residential complex (Yekaterinburg) confirms that its complex is being built in a new residential neighborhood, which caused a lot of concern.  Potential buyers, impressed by the scale and prospects of the project, are really worried about the infrastructure facilities responsible for the promised comfort and high standard of living.  Two kindergartens and a comprehensive school are already functioning in the microdistrict; in the near future, a magnificent pedestrian boulevard with shops, cafes and full-fledged recreation areas will appear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ekb.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Baltic Yekaterinburg Description" class="if uuid-3194687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3194687.jpg"></div><p>  Now, with regard to the own infrastructure of the LCD "Baltic" (Ekaterinburg).  The first floors of residential buildings are reserved for commercial infrastructure: shops, pharmacies, laundries, bank branches, communication salons and others.  For all car owners, ground and underground parking is provided - there is definitely enough space for everyone and even guests coming to the complex.  Modern gambling and sports grounds are equipped on the territory of the house, which will be interesting not only for children, but also for adults. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  A choice of buyers are offered one-, two- and three-room apartments from 42 to 106 square meters.  These are not just apartments, but entire apartments where every resident of even a large family will be comfortable.  The balance is achieved not only due to the impressive area, but also thoughtful planning solutions proposed in sufficient variety. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The developer Atomstroykompleks (Yekaterinburg) preferred European standards and traditions of decorating living space: we offer apartments with huge kitchens, dining rooms, spacious isolated bedrooms, halls, where it will be possible to organize a place for storing outer clothing and shoes, as well as additional bathrooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ingraficon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd baltic yekaterinburg reviews" class="if uuid-3194686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3194686.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments with terraces and mezzanines </h2><p>  If you are not embarrassed by living on the second floor, pay special attention to luxury apartments with terraces - their role in some buildings is played by the roof of the shops.  The space of the terrace is divided into two zones: the first is free for planning and arrangement (it must comply with the regulations and not spoil the facades), the second is the green zone, which is a kind of barrier between the house and the street, as well as a certain aesthetic component. </p><p>  Pay attention to apartments with mezzanines - they became possible due to the existence of a technical floor.  On the second tier, you can organize a full-fledged workplace, bedroom, relaxation and relaxation area, even a full-fledged home theater or play space for children - there are a lot of options, so every resident will definitely find use for the additional space hidden from the eyes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.e1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Baltic Yekaterinburg builder" class="if uuid-3195209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3195209.jpg"></div><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  High class housing LCD "Baltic" (Yekaterinburg) implies the presence of a fine finish in each apartment.  All square meters are transferred to residents with installed plastic double-glazed windows of European manufacture, including on balconies, modern heating radiators with temperature regulators, high-quality entrance and interior doors.  The walls are covered with wallpaper for painting, which will be an excellent background for your future color experiments, and a durable and hardy laminate of the 33rd class is laid on the floor.  In addition, metering devices are installed in each apartment and all necessary communications are carried out.  Almost every apartment has a main bathroom and a guest bathroom with high-quality modern fixtures. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  The project is being built in several phases, today some buildings have already been commissioned and settled, but the completion of construction is scheduled for the end of 2019, so each of you still has a unique opportunity to purchase your dream apartment in the 5th stage building.  The cost of real estate starts from 3.2 million rubles.  The developer offers favorable conditions for the purchase of apartments: installments, mortgages from leading banks in the country. </p><h2>  Responses of residents </h2><p>  Most of the residential buildings have already been commissioned; accordingly, the first reviews can already be obtained.  LCD "Baltic" (Yekaterinburg) was a success - it was to this opinion that a huge part of the first tenants came. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viberi-kvartiru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Baltic Yekaterinburg housing class" class="if uuid-3194689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3194689.jpg"></div><p>  So, the project turned out to be really bright, spectacular, definitely worthy of attention and detailed consideration.  The apartments are bright and spacious, and due to well-thought-out layouts, it is possible to use every square meter of area.  The decoration was performed with high quality, does not cause any complaints and claims from the residents - many of them did not even begin to change anything, making only certain decorative notes in their space. </p><p>  The size of monthly utility bills is a rather relevant topic.  So, due to the work of an autonomous boiler room, it was possible to reduce the amount of heating and hot water supply fees - residents of the Baltiysky residential complex (Yekaterinburg) pay much less than their closest neighbors.  At the same time, the management company, in full, judging by the reviews of residents, performs its functions: garbage is removed on time, the yards are clean and well-maintained, the entrances are bright and spacious. </p><p>  And, of course, the huge courtyards with modern venues, areas for sports and recreation are impressive, each, starting from their preferences and wishes, will choose an occupation to their liking, and they can do it without leaving the territory. </p><p>  As for the infrastructure, there are certain complaints, since the microdistrict itself, and the complex in particular, are young.  But as the growth and development of the neighborhood will be the best for life in the city. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  LCD "Baltic" (Yekaterinburg) - one of the brightest and most promising projects of the Ural capital, rebuilt in a young area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  If you want to live in an environmentally friendly place, enjoy the gorgeous view from the windows of your apartment, but at the same time you are ready to suffer inconvenience for some time due to the underdeveloped infrastructure, you will definitely like the complex. </p>
