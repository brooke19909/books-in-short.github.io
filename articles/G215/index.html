    <h2>  The development of Siberia </h2><p>  Almost immediately after the formation and strengthening of the Russian state, expansion began in other lands.  In a new history, it originates in the sixteenth century.  In 1580, the first detachments went to the almost uncharted lands of Siberia.  Cossack Ermak led the campaign.  The people who went with him were free Cossacks who sought a better life.  In the first two years of the expedition, significant success was achieved by capturing several fortresses.  The political situation was also explored and the features of the enemy were clarified. </p><p>  After the success of the Cossacks became known in Moscow, the tsar personally authorized the development of new lands.  Thus began the centuries-old territorial expansion of Russia to the east.  The conquest of new territories took place in several stages.  First, the Cossacks landed and found settlements of a local tribe.  Then they entered into peace negotiations with them, offering on a voluntary basis to kneel before the Russian Tsar.  If the tribe agreed, then the local population was taxed, and the so-called wintering camps were built in the settlement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conquest </h2><p>  If the natives refused to accept the conditions, then guns, sabers and rifles were used.  After the conquest in the village put a prison in which there remained a garrison.  Following the military detachments were settlers: Russian peasants who were looking for a new life, future administration, clergy and merchants.  Thanks to this, the natives quickly assimilated.  Many understood the benefits of citizenship to the king: scientists, engineers, doctors, and other creatures of civilization liked the local tribes. </p><p>  Until the eighteenth century, the land and sea borders of Russia expanded quite rapidly.  This ultimately led to a conflict with China and other Asian countries.  After that, the <span>development of Siberia</span> slowed down and was completed only at the beginning of the twentieth century. </p><h2>  Campaigns of Peter the Great </h2><p>  At the same time, the territorial expansion of Russia to the south took place.  Peter the First saw the liberation of the Crimea and the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov as a priority.  At that time, Russia did not have access to the southern seas, which complicated trade and left the border in danger.  Therefore, in 1695, a campaign begins on Azov.  It was, rather, an intelligence mission.  And already in the winter of that year, preparations for the army began.  A flotilla was built.  And in the spring of the same year, the fortress was besieged.  The besieged Turks were frightened by the seen armada and surrendered the fortress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land and sea borders of Russia" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1452287.jpg" width="242"></div>

But Peter's gaze was still directed to the Crimea and the Black Sea.  It was not possible to break through to the Kerch Strait to him.  After this was followed by another war with Turkey and its vassal of the <span>Crimean Khanate.</span> </p><h2>  Promotion north </h2><p>  The territorial expansion of Russia to the north began with the conclusion of an alliance with Denmark and Poland.  After the <span>military reforms of Peter the Great</span> , the campaign against Sweden began.  But near Narva, the Russian army under the command of the Saxon field marshal was defeated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="territorial and political expansion of Russia" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1452285.jpg" width="600"></div>  Nevertheless, a year later a new campaign began, led by the great king himself.  In a few days, the <span>Nyenschanz fortress</span> was taken <span>.</span>  After capturing the whole north, the city of St. Petersburg was laid.  The land and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãborders of Russia</span> advanced north.  Access to the Baltic Sea allowed to expand its influence on the sea.  Karelia was attached.

    <p>  In response to the defeat, Charlemagne launched a land campaign against Russia.  He advanced inland, draining his troops.  As a result, on July 8, 1709, the twenty-thousandth army of the Swedes was defeated near Poltava.  After that, in a short time, Russian troops launched an attack on Pomerania. </p><p>  Sweden lost all of its continental lands, and Russia established itself as one of the leading military and political forces in Europe. </p><h2>  Expansion west </h2><p>  After that, the territorial and political expansion of Russia went west.  After the defeat of the Turkish vassals, the path was opened beyond the Carpathian mountains and to the Balkans.  Using the influence on the land enslaved by the Turks, Russian troops were preparing uprisings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="expansion of the Russian empire" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1452289.jpg" width="600"></div>  Thus began the liberation war of the Slavs against the Muslim yoke.  The result was the formation of several Slavic Christian powers, and Russia expanded its own territory.  The expansion of the Russian Empire to the west continued for several centuries, as a result of which the tsars of Poland, the Baltic states and Finland swore allegiance to the Russian tsar.
