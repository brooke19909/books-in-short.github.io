    <p>  The beaches of the resort are quite wide and sandy, with small bays that are convenient for swimming.  In total, the city has three beaches with a length of 1.5 kilometers.  All of them are protected, after the spa people disperse, and are removed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are a sufficient number of bars and restaurants on the coast, there are sports fields, rental points for water equipment.  All the beaches of the city are completely free, you only need to pay for the rental of sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  In St. Vlas, transport links are well established.  From Burgas to the city can be reached by bus, making a transfer in the city of Sunny Beach.  In addition, you can rent a taxi, which will cost 160 BGN.  You can get to neighboring cities from St. Vlas by shuttle buses (to Nessebar, Elenite, Sunny Beach), which run every half hour.

    <p>  There are no more serious entertainments in the town.  Therefore, vacationers can independently visit the ancient Nessebar or Sunny Beach.  In addition, excursion trips are organized in each hotel: ‚ÄúWine tasting in Burgas‚Äù, ‚ÄúBulgarian village‚Äù, ‚ÄúSofia-Rila Monastery‚Äù and many others. </p><h2>  Moonlight Hotel 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I certainly want to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to relax in it.  Moonlight Hotel 5 * (Bulgaria, Sveti Vlas) has slightly conflicting reviews (from enthusiastic to negative).  Therefore, let's discuss in more detail the impressions of vacationers.  The hotel has a very good location.  Proximity to the sea is the main question that interests vacationers.  There is a bus stop near the complex, so you can travel on your own if you do not rent a car.  Getting to the city center is easy, and you can take a walk along the coast. </p><p>  As you know, European hotels do not have their own beaches.  Tourists use the municipal coast.  The proximity of the hotel to the sea is an indisputable advantage of the complex.  However, many vacationers are unhappy with the state of dilapidated wooden steps leading down to the beach.  In their opinion, a five-star level establishment should have built a safer descent or repaired the existing one. </p>

    <p>  The beach itself near the hotel is small.  The coastline in this region is quite narrow, and therefore represents a narrow strip.  During the high season, an incredible number of vacationers accumulate on the beach.  Enterprising tourists, so as not to crowd on the coast, just relax on the sun loungers by the pool, and go swimming down to the sea.  Sunset at sea is convenient, algae appear very rarely, and the water itself is clean. </p><p>  If you walk along the coast, you can walk to another beach, which has sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, in Moonlight Hotel 5 * <span>(Bulgaria, St. Vlas)</span> food is organized at a good level.  Adequate amounts of food are always present at the buffet.  The dishes are varied and delicious.  Especially guests praise grilled vegetables and meat and stewed vegetables.  On tables, in addition to meat, there are always salads, side dishes, sweet dishes.  Local alcoholic drinks, according to guests, of excellent quality.  The pool bar is open until 18.00, and then tourists move to another restaurant nearby. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  What is the advantage of Moonlight Hotel 5 *?  There are a lot of hotels on the coast and each has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses.  Moonlight is a new complex that has been operating for only a few years.  Therefore, the hotel rooms are new and beautiful.  According to tourists, the apartments are well equipped, all the furniture is not worn out and pleases the eye.  The view from the window is especially good if you are lucky to become the owner of a room with a sea view.  The apartment has all the declared equipment, plumbing is working properly. </p>

    <p>  As for cleaning, not all guests are satisfied with its quality.  Apparently it all depends on which maid is on duty.  In general, cleaned daily, rooms are clean.  Bed linens and towels are changed quite often, they even put cute figures out of them (without a tip). </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  At Moonlight Hotel 5 * tourists do not have to get bored.  If you are a supporter of animation, then it is here.  During the day, classes in water aerobics are held in the pool, they are invited to play water polo, and they organize various entertaining events.  For this reason, vacationers tend to spend most of their time by the pool.  In the evenings, a show program is provided for kids and adults.  In general, it‚Äôs fun to relax, and tourists are very pleased with the animators. </p><p>  I want to say a few words about the hotel staff.  All employees are friendly and do a great job.  They check in very quickly upon arrival, even if you arrive earlier than 14.00.  The restaurant waiters serve well.  Periodically, the hotel there is an influx of vacationers, as a result of which there are not always enough places in the dining room, then there are small queues in anticipation until they are free.  But in general, the complex is good and worthy of attention from tourists. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Moonlight Hotel 5 * is a good hotel located on the very coast of the sea.  It can be a good place to relax at an affordable price.  Especially the hotel will appeal to those tourists who are accustomed to combine sightseeing and sea vacations. </p>
