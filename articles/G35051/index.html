    <p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Under the simplified tax system "Revenues", accounting for fixed assets</span> will not lead to a decrease in the taxable base.  In this case, there are no expenses necessary for taxation.  Accordingly, in the <span data-mce-mark="1">case of the STS "Revenues" the accounting for fixed assets</span> can be kept only for the analysis of the state of assets.  This information can be used to make management decisions.  But <span data-mce-mark="1">on the <span>simplified tax system "Revenues minus expenses"</span> accounting for fixed assets is</span> very appropriate.  Let's consider it in more detail. </p><h2>  OS Feature </h2><p>  Regulatory acts in the field of accounting, established certain features that must comply with the OS.  Fixed assets are material values: </p><ul><li>  Intended for operation for a long period (more than a year). </li><li>  Used for profit. </li><li>  Being depreciable. </li><li>  The cost of which is higher than the established limits.  For accounting, the maximum price is fixed in the accounting policy and should be at least 40 thousand rubles. In tax accounting, the figure is higher - not less than 100 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  In accounting <span data-mce-mark="1">with the simplified tax system, the costs of fixed assets</span> (their purchase, modernization, improvement, retrofitting, reconstruction, repair) are included in the taxable base, reducing it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Posting </h2><p>  At <span data-mce-mark="1">USN, accounting and tax accounting of fixed assets</span> is usually carried out by organizations.  Usually, documentation is compiled in a simplified form, as enterprises are small.  Individual entrepreneurs may not keep accounts.  Nevertheless, they still need to determine the value of fixed assets, since the indicators are used for tax purposes. </p><p>  In <span data-mce-mark="1">accounting at the simplified tax system, fixed assets</span> are at initial cost.  If the entrepreneur conducts abbreviated reporting, then the objects are: </p><ul><li>  At the cost, which is formed from the price indicated by the supplier in the accompanying documents, and installation costs, upon acquisition of the operating system. </li><li>  By the size of payment for services to the contractor - when creating the object. </li></ul><p>  The remaining costs that arise when acquiring or creating an operating system are written off to other costs. </p>

The main asset can arrive either before the <span>transition to the simplified tax system</span> or during the application of this special mode. </p><p>  The peculiarity of tax accounting is that the costs of fixed assets are recognized after payment and provided that the facility is already capitalized and operated by the enterprise. </p><p>  The allocation of expenses on fixed assets to expenses for tax purposes is carried out in the year the funds are put into operation.

    <p>  At the end of December of the last year of the organization‚Äôs functioning in the main tax regime, the residual value of the object is taken into account.  This indicator is reflected in column 8 of the Book on accounting for income and expenses. </p><p>  The method of transferring value to expenses in the simplified tax system affects the period of use. </p><p>  If the period is less than 3 years, the entire cost for the year of operation established at the time of the start of the use of the simplified tax system is debited.  1/4 of the price is calculated and included in the expenses on the last date of each quarter.  For a period of 3-15 years, during the first year half of the cost is written off (12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãper quarter), in the second - 30%, in the third - 20%.  If the period of use exceeds 15 l., Write-off is carried out at 10% for 10 years. </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  Suppose, in 2016, the enterprise switched from OSNO to STS, and at the time of the transition, it had a machine, the residual value of which at the end of December 2015 amounted to 160 thousand rubles.  The term of use of the equipment is 5 years. </p><p>  In 2016, only 50% of the cost - 80 thousand rubles, is taken into account in expenses.  This value must be divided into 4 equal parts.  Each of them - 20 thousand rubles.  - is debited on the last day of the corresponding quarter. </p><p>  In 2017, 48 thousand rubles will be transferred to expenses.  - 30% of the residual price.  This amount should also be divided into 4 equal parts (12 thousand rubles).  In 2018, 32 thousand rubles will be written off.  This is 20% of the residual stat.  The amount is also divided into 4 parts and written off at the end of each quarter for 8 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Accounting for fixed assets on the simplified tax system in 1C </h2><p>  As mentioned above, in order to accept an object for accounting, it must be acquired and put into operation.  To recognize the costs in tax accounting, it is necessary to record the fact of payment for the purchase. </p><p>  To reflect the acquisition operation in the program, you must open the "Purchase" tab and create a document "Receipt of products and services."  As the type of operation, "Equipment" is selected.  In the tabular part, you need to indicate the nomenclature, quantity and cost of the purchased object.  In the column "Account" is 08.04. </p><p>  To reflect the payment, a payment order is filled out. </p><p>  On the day the OS is put into operation, the document ‚ÄúAcceptance for accounting‚Äù is issued.  In it, in addition to general information about the object, there are two tabs.  The first is accounting, and the second is tax accounting.  If the accountant is well versed in the features of the reflection of information, he will be able to fill out all the fields correctly.  In this case, accounting operations (accounting and tax) in the program will be automatically performed when the document "Period Closing" is carried out. </p><p>  Suppose an enterprise acquired a computer worth 25 thousand rubles.  The object was put into production use on 02/12/2010. Accordingly, the same date should be in the document ‚ÄúAcceptance for accounting‚Äù. </p><p>  In the "OS" tab, you must specify the name of the asset.  It must be assigned an inventory number.  In addition, the account from which the OS was debited (08.04) is indicated.  Next, indicate the type of operation performed in relation to the object.  This will be ‚ÄúAcceptance for accounting with subsequent commissioning‚Äù.  Next, the method for recording depreciation costs is determined, the corresponding account is indicated to which the depreciation amounts will be written off. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the tab "Tax Accounting".  In the "Cost" (expenses on the simplified tax system) field of the facility, the full value of the initial price of the asset should be indicated.  The size and dates of payments actually made on the fixed asset are shown separately in the corresponding columns.  If the cost of the equipment was completely paid off, then the entire amount (for example, the same 25 thousand rubles for a computer) can be recognized as expenses. </p><p>  The most important thing when reflecting the OS is to correctly enter information in the "Procedure for including st-sti in expenses" field.  The program will offer to include in the structure of expenses or depreciable property or not to include in expenses.  If the asset was purchased for a fee, the period of its use exceeds a year, and the cost exceeds 20 thousand rubles, it is classified as depreciable property. </p>

    <p>  In the ‚ÄúAccounting‚Äù tab, you should indicate the accounts on which the operations for accounting and depreciation will be taken into account, the method of its calculation.  An enterprise may not be limited to the common linear method.  Here it is necessary to assess the situation.  It is likely that it is more convenient to calculate depreciation will be the <span>way to reduce the balance</span> using the acceleration coefficient. </p><p>  If the OS is acquired by installments, the costs of it are subject to write-off in the part of the amounts actually transferred to the seller. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As a rule, when accounting for an OS on a simplified system, there are no special difficulties.  Nevertheless, some nuances related to taxation should be taken into account.  The accountant needs to carefully monitor all changes in the law. </p><p>  Significantly facilitates the work of a specialist software 1C. </p>
