    <h2>  Zakynthos Island in Greek Culture </h2><p>  According to ancient legend, the island of Zakynthos (Greece) conquered the great Olympic gods Apollo and Artemis with its incredible charm.  It is not surprising that mere mortals instantly fall under the charm of this wonderful land.  In the works of the great Homer, Zakynthos is mentioned as an island "drowning in emerald forests."  The islanders in ancient times especially revered Apollo as the patron saint of various arts and were famous among the Greeks for their special love of music and poetry.  The culture of Zakynthos reached its peak under the control of the Venetians.  However, the Greeks revere this island not only for its extraordinary beauty.  It turns out that this land is the birthplace of one of the greatest poets of Greece - the great Solomos Dionysius, the author of the "Anthem of Freedom."  On the central square of Zakynthos, a monument is erected in honor of this famous person. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

If you are looking for a place where the climate offers the perfect holiday at any time of the year, head to Zakynthos Island.  Greece, the photographic images of which amaze the imagination, hospitably welcomes everyone who wants to spend leisure time on its shores.

The holiday season lasts from May to October. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Blue caves </h2><p>  The most interesting places on the island of Zakynthos (Greece) are of natural origin.  These are magnificent beaches with delicate golden sand, picturesque grottoes, beautiful plants and incredible panoramic views.

    <h2>  Askos Nature Reserve </h2><p>  Askos Stone Reserve is another highlight of Zakynthos Island.  Greece, whose attractions are not limited to architectural and historical monuments, is famous for its natural splendor.  And Askos is another proof of this.  In the reserve you can find rare species of plants and animals from around the world.  The untouched grandeur of the nature of Zakynthos here harmoniously combines with large stone structures, water tanks and wood compositions created by man.  The territory of the reserve is 500 thousand km.  It created the conditions for the habitation of approximately 1,500 birds and animals, including deer, raccoons, llamas, ponies, chinchillas, etc. The excursion can be continued in the famous museums of the island.  There are several of them in Zakynthos: a museum of <span>Byzantine art, a</span> house-museum of the Roma Alexander family, a museum of famous poets of Greek origin Andreas and Dionysius Solomos. </p><h2>  Architectural Attractions </h2><p>  Several ancient architectural monuments have been preserved on the island of Zakynthos.  Greece, the map of which is presented in this article, is rich in such sights.  On the territory of the old city of Argasi there is an ancient bridge, one part of which is covered with sand, and the other is buried in the water.  The real pride of Zakynthos are Byzantine temples and churches.  It will be especially interesting for travelers to visit the ancient church of St. Dionysius and the medieval church of St. Nicholas.  In the small settlement of Maherado there is the church of St. Martha, and in the tiny village of Lagopodo, a convent was built that was built in honor of the Virgin Mary Eleftheria.  The oldest temple of the goddess Artemis became the place where the Church of Our Lady of Skopietissa was erected from white stone. </p>

    <h2>  Gerakas Beach </h2><p>  A great place to relax is Gerakas Beach.  It is located in the southern part of Zakynthos.  The waters in these places are calm, the sand is impeccable, the places around are unusually beautiful.  This beach is the habitat of the rarest animals - Caretta-Caretta <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãturtles</span> , laying their eggs in coastal sand.  Since only one or two turtles survive out of the 1000 alleged individuals, their minks are carefully guarded.  Gerakas is part of the National Marine Park.  Locals take great care of outlandish turtles and strictly guard their peace, so all water sports are prohibited on the beach.  The people of Zakynthos Island (Greece) take care of preserving the identity of local nature.  Hotels located in the Gulf of Gerakas (Hotel Gerakas Belvedere Luxury Suites, Villa Katerina, Louis <span>Palazzo di Zante Hotel, Zante</span> Royal Resort, etc.) provide all the conditions for a comfortable stay and relaxation. </p>
