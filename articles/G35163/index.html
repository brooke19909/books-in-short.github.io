They are components of a small state.  Its name is the Union of Comoros.  This state is located on the territory of the Comorian archipelago.  Moreover, it consists of three large islands.  Their list includes Moheli, Grand Comor and Anjouan.  The archipelago also has the <span>island of Mayotte,</span> which is ruled by France.  It is worth saying that there are volcanoes on the islands that retain their activity to date. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Comoros are in the tropical zone.  The climate is humid and quite hot.  In this case, there are two pronounced seasons.  So, from November to April, the wettest and warmest period is observed.  The rest of the year is dry and cool. </p>

    <p>  Comoros is undesirable to visit during the wet season (November-April).  At this time, there is a sweltering heat.  At the same time, it is accompanied by almost one hundred percent humidity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Comoros are best for relaxing during the period from May to October.  In this cool season, the air temperature does not rise above twenty-five degrees.  It is from May to October that an almost perfect climate reigns over most of the archipelago.  In the cool season, the air is fresh due to ocean trade winds and is full of aromas of flowering cloves, vanilla, cinnamon and ylang-ylang.  However, during this period, the weather sometimes deteriorates sharply due to the arrival of cyclones and monsoon winds from the ocean. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Comoros is known for its unique flora and fauna.  Almost thirty-seven species of animals live here, many different plants grow that are not found anywhere else in the world.  The oldest forms of life on our planet have been discovered in the waters of the coastal ocean. </p>

    <p>  Among the representatives of the fauna of the Comoros, one of the rarest animals on earth stands out.  It's about a livingston bat.  <span>Rainforests</span> are the habitat of mongooses, lemurs and tenreks.  In the waters of the coastal ocean, coelocants were caught.  These are bristled fish that were found in ancient times (almost four hundred million years ago). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ponds </h2><p>  Comoros do not have permanent rivers.  However, there are freshwater lakes.  They are located in the craters of inactive volcanoes. </p><p>  A real natural monument is Lake Sal (Salt Lake).  For many decades, it has attracted the attention of not only travelers, but also scientists who seek to unravel its secrets. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="comoros tours prices" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/393389.jpg?1399743826209" width="350"></div></h2><h2>  Comoros.  Grand Comor Map </h2><p>  In the northern part of this island you will find Lake Sal.  It occupies the vent of an extinct volcano.  With reliability, no one can judge the depth of this reservoir.  In this regard, it is also called the Abyss.  The uniqueness of the lake lies in the fact that it contains salt water.  Why?  There is no single answer to this question.  There is simply the assumption that the reservoir feeds the ocean.  Another unique feature of the lake is the presence of a large number of algae in it.  Because of this vegetation, it changes color twice during the day.  In this case, the lake may look dark green or shimmering blue. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Comoros (photos of amazing landscapes are presented in the article) attract tourists with its exoticism.  Only here you can see a large number of unusual birds and bright flowers.  An attractive landscape with tropical plants and steaming volcanoes decorated with frozen lava will delight the eye of vacationers. </p>

The cost of a ten-day permit for one person is within fifty thousand Russian rubles.  Another hundred thousand will have to pay for the ticket.  Rest here is expensive.  However, this is a wonderful place with luxurious beaches, covered with fine white sand.  In addition, the Comoros attract diving and other active water sports.

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  In Comoros, the same classification of hotels that exists around the world is accepted.  That is why all tourists will find an acceptable place to stay here without any problems.  When planning a trip to Comoros, tours can be selected both with accommodation in a budget hotel, and with accommodation in a five-star hotel with comfortable conditions. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Having visited Comoros, you should certainly go on an excursion to the largest city of the archipelago - Moroni.  Its second name is Port-au-Butr.  This is the youngest city in the country on the island of Grand Comor.  It is the capital of the state.  Moroni has a large number of mosques.  The oldest of them is Friday.  This building is the most popular attraction of the capital of the Comoros.  The Friday Mosque was erected as early as 1472. Coral limestone, which has retained its white color to this day, served as the material for the construction of the temple.  The appearance of the Friday Mosque clearly shows the bright features of Arabic architecture.  They were reflected in two-tier arched galleries, a high carved border located along the perimeter of the roof, a minaret, balustrades and a green dome with a crescent moon located on its top. </p><p>  Another attraction of Moroni is a bright and colorful bazaar.  A popular destination for excursions is the port of Medina.  It is interesting to wander through the ancient Arab quarter, which will amaze tourists with its magnificent architecture. </p>

It is well known for woodworking workshops located on its territory.  At the local market you can buy caskets and a variety of crafts.  All of them are made from expensive wood species growing in the Comoros. <br>  Mitsuja is also famous for ancient tombstones decorated with artful ornaments.  Locals believe that under one of them lie the remains of a saint, protecting them from evil spirits.

Many vacationers notice their shyness and modesty.  Restrained orders dominate even in the shopping arcades, where the seller advertises, but does not impose his goods at all. </p>
