One such company is Acer.  Acer laptops, reviews of which we will analyze a little later, are compact, powerful, use high-quality materials and have a beautiful design.  These devices are a worthy alternative to Apple products.  Yes, and laptops from the "Acer" are unmatched cheaper.  So, let's move on to the specifics.  But first, some general information about the manufacturer. </p><h2>  About Acer </h2><p>  The company was founded in China in 1976.  Initially, the manufacturer was engaged in the production of personal computers.  It was this company in 1985 that created the world's first 32-bit computer.  The notorious IBM was in second place.  Over its history, Acer has absorbed many electronics manufacturers.  By the way, BenQ products (so well known to Russian users) are also the brainchild of Acer.  In addition to laptops and PCs, the company also produces monitors, communicators, computer peripherals, keyboards, drives, projectors and other necessary goods.  However, Acer laptops work best.  User reviews make it clear that the laptops of the company are reliable, modern and work perfectly in any conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acer laptops reviews" class="if uuid-2357866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357866.jpg"></div><p>  Over its long life, the company "Acer" has managed to give the world a huge number of high-quality devices.  Currently, the manufacturer may well compete with giants such as Samsung and Apple.  Only their industries are fundamentally different.  Acer has computers and everything related to them.  But the two giants mentioned above focus on mobile devices.  However, we move on to user reviews of various laptop models.  Acer laptops, reviews of which we will analyze later, are an example of a modern mobile computer.  And now you will understand why. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Positive feedback on the Acer Aspire SP515 </h2><p>  This laptop is positioned by the company as a device for productive work.  Therefore, there is neither a powerful video adapter, nor a new-fangled solid-state drive.  But there is a high-quality screen, a comfortable keyboard and no less convenient touchpad.  According to user reviews, this device seems ideal for those who work a lot at the computer.  The IPS-matrix of the screen will not let your eyes get tired, and your fingers will not hurt from a perfectly made keyboard.  In general, this is exactly what distinguishes Acer Aspire laptops.  Positive reviews are well deserved.  And their overwhelming majority.  Especially the owners note the powerful and productive <span>Intel Core i5 processor.</span>  An important role here is played by 8 gigabytes of RAM, working in dual-channel mode.  Professional programmers note a rather high speed of the laptop in the process of compiling something. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.conrad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acer aspire laptops reviews" class="if uuid-2357884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357884.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews for the Acer Aspire SP515 </h2><p>  But the negative reviews about this model come from those who could not play World of Tanks on this laptop.  Indeed, the power of the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 video adapter is clearly not enough for these purposes.  But this is a laptop for work.  Do not forget about it.  For games, it is better to consider the gaming line of the same manufacturer.  Acer laptops, reviews of which we are now reviewing, have every chance of becoming the first devices after Apple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Positive feedback on the Acer Extensa 2540 </h2><p>  This laptop leaves a double impression: on the one hand, it has the latest generation Intel processor and a solid-state drive on board, but on the other, a rather budget screen based on the TN matrix.  How to explain such a move on the part of the company is not clear.  But let's see what users say about a device like the Acer Extensa laptop.  Reviews say that the vast majority of owners of this car are quite happy with the purchase.  Users claim that the laptop works quickly and seamlessly (which is not surprising, with such and such characteristics).  Also, users note the high quality of the materials used in the assembly.  A lot of praise is heard in the address of the company and for the modern ultra-thin case of the device.  In general, users are happy with this laptop.  It resembles Apple products.  The only difference is that it costs two times cheaper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kupi.cn.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acer extensa laptop reviews" class="if uuid-2357888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357888.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews for the Acer Extensa 2540 </h2><p>  There are very few people dissatisfied with this laptop.  Basically criticized is the cheap display, which by no means fits into this laptop.  If we take into account the other characteristics, then there should be at least an IPS matrix.  But no.  Only TN with a glossy finish.  It‚Äôs good that the resolution is Full HD.  Some users also speak negatively about keyboard ergonomics.  Indeed, to please the size and slim body, the keyboard has undergone some changes.  She became not very comfortable for work.  There is also another negative review about this laptop.  It concerns an optical drive.  Or rather, its absence.  However, it's time for users to get used to the fact that optical media in the 21st century is an anachronism.  Therefore, the corresponding drive is not in this laptop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Positive feedback on the Acer Aspire ES1 </h2><p>  Another workhorse is the Acer Aspire ES1 laptop.  Reviews about him are full of positive epithets.  But there are a lot of those who categorically did not like the product.  Nevertheless, this is a very modern laptop with a powerful processor, a decent amount of RAM (8 gigabytes) and a Full HD-screen.  Users note that working with this device is a pleasure.  It affects the <span>ergonomic keyboard</span> and Full HD-screen with IPS-matrix.  The increased battery capacity is another reason for laudatory od.  With such a battery, you can work from almost anywhere, without really thinking about recharging.  This is exactly what the owners of a wonderful device say.  The design and quality of the materials of the case are praised separately.  Although plastic is used as the main material, not newfangled aluminum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.startlr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acer aspire es1 laptop reviews" class="if uuid-2357891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357891.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews about the Acer Aspire ES1 </h2><p>  Where without negative reviews?  The users did not like the fact that the device comes with only one (and very weak) built-in video card - Intel HD Graphics 505. It will only work for the "Merry Farm".  However, this is a laptop for work.  But the fact that there is only one slot for RAM (and that one is busy) is really a minus.  After all, everyone is well aware of how much the device‚Äôs performance improves when the RAM runs in multi-channel mode.  Well, the lack of an optical drive is no longer considered a minus. </p><h2>  Positive feedback on the Acer Aspire E5 </h2><p>  This is almost the only laptop from Acer, which is entirely based on AMD components.  It cannot boast of special performance, but it is quite capable of showing itself when working on it.  So what is an Acer Aspire E5 laptop?  Reviews about him are mixed.  Positive and negative are approximately the same amount.  But here it is important not to forget that this is a budget segment device.  Users note that the laptop works quickly and quickly.  If you do not load it with overwhelming tasks.  The AMD processor does a pretty good job.  According to the owners, this ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù copes well even with some games.  True, only at the minimum graphics settings.  But this is not so important.  Also, the user is noted as a plus the presence of a full-sized keyboard with an additional digital unit.  She is the best suited for work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="itdiscounts.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acer aspire e5 laptop reviews" class="if uuid-2357895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357895.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews for the Acer Aspire E5 </h2><p>  And now about a fly in the ointment in this barrel of honey.  All users are surprised by the presence of only one slot for the RAM module (and even that one is already taken).  Typically, laptops of this level have ample upgrade opportunities.  But not this Acer.  Also, many were not pleased with the frankly cheap plastic body.  Minus many consider the display with a TN-matrix.  However, complaining about him is already too much.  After all, this is an entry-level model.  With all the ensuing consequences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uno.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acer travelmate laptop reviews" class="if uuid-2357920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357920.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews for the Acer Aspire A315 </h2><p>  The Acer Aspire A315 is a pretty controversial laptop.  On the one hand, it has good performance.  But on the other hand, it‚Äôs not suitable for anything other than work.  This is also noted by users.  Laptop owners praise a bunch of SSD and HDD.  This allows the device to work quite quickly.  But a cheap display, plastic housing and the lack of a discrete adapter spoil the whole picture.  The device‚Äôs battery also received negative reviews.  The stamina of this laptop from the ‚ÄúAcer‚Äù is generally none.  Although this is not a gaming model.  But most users liked the keyboard.  In general, this Acer is just for work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mspoweruser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acer aspire a315 laptop reviews" class="if uuid-2357909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357909.jpg"></div><h2>  Acer Travelmate X3 Reviews </h2><p>  Based on the name, it can be assumed that this laptop is for those who like to travel.  What is unusual about the Acer Travelmate laptop?  Reviews about him clearly make this clear.  Users note several positive features at once: a powerful processor, a smart solid-state drive, decent battery life and the presence of a keyboard backlight.  All this makes the laptop indispensable for the traveler.  According to owners, this laptop is able to work for 8-10 hours in mixed use mode.  This is an absolute record holder.  As for the negative reviews, there are almost none.  For gamers do not get this laptop. </p>
