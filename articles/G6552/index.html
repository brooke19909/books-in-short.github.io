Perhaps because not many people know how interesting and beautiful this place is.  On the shores of this reservoir there is no full-fledged infrastructure, however, you can have a great time here both for those who just love to sunbathe lazily in nature, and those who like to spend their leisure time actively. </p>

    <h2>  Immaculate Beauty </h2><p>  Unfortunately, human nature is designed in such a way that no matter what people touch, they destroy everything that is created around them.  The many natural riches of our planet are the more beautiful and cleaner, the farther away from them is civilization.  The Shchelkovo Dolomite Quarry is located twenty kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road; this place was chosen by local few tourists, visiting fishermen, as well as true lovers of unique natural pearls. </p><p>  Those who have been here once, remain in love with the reservoir and the surrounding area forever.  Some tourists even call the Shchelkovo quarry near Karelia, which is partly true. </p><p>  Here, vacationers can enjoy the purest water, stunning views and amazing finds, among which there are natural crystals, ancient fossils and the wonderful beauty of flora and fauna. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Shchelkovo wealth </h2><p>  Schelkovo is a small town in the Moscow region, according to official figures, about one hundred thousand people live on its territory, although in reality this value is twice as high.  The water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis region is quite rich, the city itself is located on <span>the Klyazma River,</span> in addition to it, sources such as Ucha and Vorya flow in the area. </p><p>  There are also lakes here: Bear, Black, Miner;  ponds: Barsky and Schelkovo-7.  It is worth noting such reservoirs as the Artemyevsky quarry, Schelkovsky (Gagarinsky) quarry and Oryol quarry.  Many Muscovites visit the Shchelkovo district to swim in the ponds and lakes located on its territory.  Local authorities helped ensure that the region has created enough comfortable beaches and places for recreation near open water.  Note that the Shchelkovo quarry does not apply to them.  With the exception of some descents, the approaches to the water there are completely impregnable and quite dangerous. </p>

    <h2>  Career appearance </h2><p>  But it is this reservoir that is most popular among bathers and fishermen.  Earlier, a deposit of limestone and dolomite, colored clays was discovered at this place, and sand could also be mined here freely.  The development of the quarry began in the post-war period, violent activity was curtailed only in the early eighties.  Then a huge pit was flooded with water for the purpose of reclamation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The quarry (the whole, and not the reservoir itself) has a rather impressive area.  Its length is approximately three kilometers, its width is not so great - 400-500 m, but the depth at the lowest points is very serious - 25-30 m. In the eastern part of this industrial facility, the Shchelkovo reservoir is located.  The quarry, which once supplied people with dolomite and limestone, is now not used for its intended purpose, but has not remained abandoned.  In its waters, the depth of which sometimes reaches 10-12 m, fish are bred. </p>

    <h2>  Modern craft </h2><p>  Part of the quarry is still functioning, mainly dolomite, sand and clay are mined here.  This is evidenced by special equipment, which can be found at the entrances to the reservoir.  Of course, the scale of production is not the same as it was half a century ago, but those who like to look at the work of huge excavators and bulldozers will like this slightly apocalyptic picture. </p><p>  When no work is being done on the site, local historians like to come here in search of impressions and interesting finds.  Here you can find samples of the oldest rocks of the Jurassic period.  Steep gently sloping cliffs surround a huge plateau, the bottom of which is flooded with water.  They are painted in whitish color due to the high content of limestone in the soil and can become a trap for a careless tourist - the legs can easily get stuck in a sticky liquid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Business ideas </h2><p>  This place is curious not only with valuable <span>carbonate rocks,</span> although, perhaps, thanks to those who trade in dolomite and sand, there are good roads that lead to the Shchelkovo quarry.  How to get to this place, we will tell a little further. </p><p>  Not far from the reservoir, a small fishery was created.  Valuable fish species are grown in it (trout, perch, pike, catfish, grass carp). </p><p>  In order to attract a larger flow of tourists to these parts, interesting entertainments are organized here: here you can dive with scuba diving, go boating, water skiing. </p><h2>  How to get to the pond? </h2><p>  If you are interested in Schelkovo careers, how to get to them, we will now tell you.  The best way for personal vehicles from Moscow is along the Shchelkovo highway, you will need to go a little more than 20 km to the city of the same name.  Dolomite quarry is located near the village of Amerevo.  There is an <span>asphalt road to it</span> from Schelkovo itself.  It is very convenient to get here by train, you need to get off at the Gagarinskaya station (previously it was called 37 km).  This is the Moninsky railway direction, the Northern branch. </p><p>  We will also talk about how to get to the Oryol quarry, located in the Shchelkovo district.  The train route must be started from the Yaroslavl railway station.  Upon reaching Art.  Oseevskaya, you will need to walk about 1.5 km. </p><p>  By car, you should first go to the village of Anisino, located on the Shchelkovo highway.  Having followed the highway to the turn to Moninskoye Shosse, you will need to turn onto it and, after driving 4.5 km, drive into the village of Orlovka, next to which the desired object is located. </p>

    <h2>  About beach vacation </h2><p>  Careers are reservoirs in which usually clean water, clear, not polluted by harmful emissions from industrial enterprises and agricultural activities.  Another advantage, according to vacationers, is a good bottom, most often it is sand or solid rock, sometimes with a small layer of silt.  The minus of the quarries is quite cool water, a large depth of the reservoir and steep cliffs near the shore.  These are not places where you should come with children, and the Dolomite quarry is no exception.  The danger of this place lies in the little-known day, on which there can be branches, algae, different snags, in which it is easy to get confused. </p><p>  Another thing is the Shchelkovo quarry located in Orlovka.  Swimming is allowed there.  The beach is ennobled, vacationers have access to all the necessary infrastructure.  There are several places with a gentle entry into the water.  There are also places for accommodation on the shore of the reservoir, which is especially pleasing to tourists. </p><h2>  Fisherman's Note </h2><p>  The Shchelkovo quarry (Dolomite) is considered underpopulated.  There are practically no beach people here, but this place is a paradise for fishermen.  As we wrote above, in the territory adjacent to it, they are breeding trout, perch, pike, silver carp, crucian carp, carp and other representatives of the underwater world. </p><p>  It is worth considering that fishing in this career is paid, for 4 hours you will need to pay 400 rubles.  Although local residents say that this is not necessary, it is possible to fish for nothing. </p><h2>  Scuba diving </h2><p>  Another unusual entertainment is arranged on the shore of the reservoir - the diving center ‚ÄúThe Fifth Element‚Äù.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that diving here is organized not only in summer, which is quite common for this sport, but also in winter.  It is at this time of year that the Shchelkovo quarry is especially beautiful.  Fishing, or rather spearfishing, is one of the services that is most in demand among the clients of the dive center and has received positive reviews. </p><p>  In summer, during the dive, divers enjoy magnificent views of the underwater world, this place pleases with an abundance of fish, in the middle of June you can see a unique sight - huge catfish that rise from the bottom of the quarry.  They are quite used to scuba divers, and therefore provide an opportunity to consider themselves in all their glory. </p><p>  The underwater part of the coastline of the quarry is a flooded forest, cliffs of a reservoir, dotted with picturesque snags, in whose branches flocks of small fish hide. </p><p>  The center provides customers with all the necessary equipment for diving.  You can dive not only from the shore, but also from a boat.  Not far from it there is a small hotel, a place for camping.  You can relax after scuba diving in cozy gazebos, near which there are barbecue facilities. </p>

    <h2>  Lovers of antiquity will be interested </h2><p>  The quarry itself is surrounded by greenery and lush vegetation.  The location of this lake in itself is unusually interesting and unique.  Walking in a dense undergrowth or just getting to the coast along rather steep, sometimes steep slopes, you can find very interesting archaeological values. </p><p>  Since the rock was excavated at this location, outcrops of Jurassic deposits often come across on the surface of the soil.  These are petrified corals, trees and representatives of the polyofauna.  Paleontologists often come to the Schelkovo quarry, who in these places obtain real evidence of the existence of life in prehistoric times. </p><p>  No less unexpected, and therefore a fine find will be a quartz vein.  This is actually an amazing sight, full of pristine natural naturalness and purity. </p><h2>  Varied leisure </h2><p>  There are several quarries in the Shchelkovo district.  But it is the Dolomite that is of the greatest value for lovers of outdoor activities and vivid impressions.  There will be something to do for several days.  The main thing is to stock up on strength and good equipment, because vacationers have an unforgettable journey in quite difficult conditions. </p><p>  Not far from the quarry is the Znamenskaya Church, which is an architectural memorial of regional significance.  At one time, it was completely destroyed and plundered, the restoration of the temple was started in 1999, restorers were able to partially restore the former appearance of the church, however, some of its chapels were actually built anew. </p>
