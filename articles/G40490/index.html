    <h2>  Temple foundation </h2><p>  Like most churches and monasteries in Russia, the Resurrection Cathedral in Tver in the early twenties was already inaccessible to parishioners.  It was founded in 1913, closed in the mid-thirties.  Worship here was forbidden much earlier.  The temple was consecrated in April 1916.  On the day this important event took place, Elizaveta Fedorovna, the princess of the Romanov dynasty and the founder of one of the most famous Moscow monasteries, was present in the cathedral.  Two years later, a representative of the royal family was arrested, sent to Perm and killed there by the Bolsheviks. </p><h2>  The appearance of the temple </h2><p>  Resurrection Cathedral in Tver - a temple built in neo-Russian architectural style.  Such buildings were actively erected at the beginning of the 20th century in the Pskov and Novgorod regions.  It has a cubic shape, three apses, rather massive drums.  In the western part there is a narthex with choirs, which is completed on the facade with a gable.  You can view and evaluate the architectural features of the Resurrection Cathedral in Tver in the photo above. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  In Soviet times </h2><p>  In the early twenties, the cathedral was converted into a warehouse.  In one of its parts was a dining room.  The abolished temple, according to legend, was once visited by Krupskaya.  The cross had already been removed.  A five-pointed star was erected in its place.  Banners were hung in the premises with slogans corresponding to the spirit of the times, for example, ‚ÄúDown with the church‚Äù. </p><h2>  Rebirth of the temple </h2><p>  The cathedral was returned to the Orthodox Church in the late eighties.  Already then began active restoration work.  The temple belongs to the Tver diocese - one of the largest in Russia.  Perhaps that is why the restoration did not last as long as in other churches and monasteries of the country.  Services resumed in 1992, and soon a new gilded cross was erected at the cathedral.  The height of the cross is two and a half meters, the width is two meters.  In 2006, a small church was erected next to the cathedral, designed in the same style as the main building. </p>

    <h2>  Address </h2><p>  How to get to the Resurrection Cathedral in Tver?  The address of the temple: Barrikadnaya street, house 1. The temple is located on the border of the Proletarsky and Central districts.  It is in close proximity to the historic city center.  Nearby is the White Trinity Church. </p><p>  The Cathedral is part of the Nativity of Christ Monastery.  This monument of Russian architecture is visited daily by a huge number of tourists.  The cathedral, according to reviews, resembles a modern building.  In a small old church, located on the territory of the Nativity of Christ Monastery, the icons that have appeared here in the last century are preserved.  The wall painting has survived, which cannot be said about the Resurrection Cathedral.  Here, during the years of Soviet power, it was completely destroyed. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The Resurrection Cathedral was built in honor of the centenary of the Romanov dynasty.  We can say that it has a direct connection with the era of tsarist Russia.  At the same time, reviews about the temple are different.  For many, of great interest is the monastery, which is located in the Proletarsky district.  The cathedral is not impressive because of its visible modernity.  Others, on the contrary, are attracted by the unusual architectural style.  Indeed, in Moscow and Tver there are few such temples. </p><p>  Reviews about the architectural appearance of the complex, as well as about the atmosphere that prevails there, are various.  Perhaps it is worth visiting both the cathedral and the monastery to form your own opinion. </p>
