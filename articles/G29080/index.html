    <h2>  New life for old furniture </h2><p>  What can be done from the remnants of the wallpaper, spending a minimum of money and time?  Everyone is able to update old furniture with such material.  This will require the remains of wallpaper, varnish, glue, a primer and putty.  You can decorate almost any surface.  It can be doors, walls, drawers and shelves.  You can also paste cabinet furniture from the inside.  This will give her a more fresh and original look. </p><p>  Decorated furniture fits perfectly into any interior.  Original look products that are in harmony with the color scheme of walls or curtains.  If the furniture turned out to be bright and original, then it can become a good accent among interior items made in restrained colors.  Wallpaper on the table, chest of drawers or at the head of the bed, in harmony with the color of the walls, allows you to create a single and complete composition. </p><h2>  Furniture preparation </h2><p>  Before you start <span>decorating, furniture</span> should be prepared.  To begin with, it is worth removing the old coating, for example, varnish or peeling paint.  This is done with sandpaper.  Deep scratches, chips and cracks on the surface of the furniture should not be left.  They should be repaired with a putty designed for working with wood.  After that, the treated areas must be sanded using sandpaper.  This will allow the material to better fix on the surface of the furniture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In conclusion, the product should be completely covered with a primer.  Furniture before pasting should dry well.  It is not necessary to cover all surfaces with wallpaper.  Perhaps some part is worth painting.  You need to do this before you start working with the wallpaper. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="from the remnants of wallpaper with your own hands" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1354496.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to paste over? </h2><p>  To create a masterpiece from the remnants of wallpaper with your own hands, it takes a little imagination and the ability to work with simple tools.  First you need to carefully measure the surface to be treated.  The obtained values ‚Äã‚Äãmust be transferred to the wallpaper and cut a piece of the required size. </p><p>  It remains to stick the material on the surface of the furniture.  To do this, you can use wallpaper glue or PVA.  The first option is preferable.  <span>Wallpaper glue</span> allows you to slowly fix all the bends and folds.  The material should be applied to the surface and well smoothed, expelling the air from the folds.  The decoration process does not end there. </p><h2>  How to protect surfaces </h2><p>  The wallpaper on the table or on the dresser will look spectacular.  However, such surfaces are quickly contaminated.  For this reason, additional processing of the material is required.  If wallpaper made of paper was used for gluing, then it is necessary to cover them first with a protective film, for which you can use the remains of glue or a primer made on the basis of PVA.  The composition should be applied to the already dried material with a thin layer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The treated surfaces should be varnished, preferably water-based.  This should be done after the protective layer has completely dried.  To begin with, it is recommended to check the effect of varnish on a small piece of wallpaper.  If the material does not deform, then the composition can be applied to decorated surfaces.  When choosing wallpaper, it should be noted that after varnishing the material becomes darker by several tones. </p><p>  If wallpaper made on the basis of vinyl is used for furniture decor, then you can not worry.  Such material is easy to clean.  For work, you can also use <span>self-adhesive wallpaper.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wallpaper curtains" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1354499.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Fancy Blinds </h2><p>  There are more original ideas.  From the wallpaper you can make beautiful and bright curtains.  Paper-based blinds look very unusual.  They can be hung on any window.  In addition, such curtains from wallpaper look stylish and protect them from the sun no worse than foil.  Ready-made designs are quite light and almost indistinguishable from fabric products. </p><p>  For the manufacture of curtains from wallpaper it will take a little time and a minimum of costs.  When choosing a material, special attention should be paid to density: the denser the better.  In this case, non-woven are ideal.  As for the color scheme, you should choose light wallpaper with a small pattern.  In this case, the material should not be too variegated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to make curtains </h2><p>  As already mentioned, from the remnants of the wallpaper with your own hands, you can make original blinds.  To begin with, it is worth cutting a canvas that will correspond to the width of the window glass.  The wallpaper should be 25% longer in length.  An accordion should be made from the resulting piece.  The size of the folds should be from 2.5 to 5 centimeters.  Of particular importance is the direction.  The top of the folds should be directed up, and the bottom - down. </p><p>  After making the accordion, it is necessary to determine the middle of the product and make a hole.  To do this, you can use an awl, hole punch, thin drill.  In the resulting hole should be pulled the cord.  Finished curtains must be straightened.  The cord stretched across the entire curtain should be fixed by tying a knot on it.  Wallpaper curtains are almost ready. </p><p>  Double <span>-sided tape</span> should be glued to the upper fold <span>.</span>  This is necessary for fastening the finished product to the window frame.  The bottom folds, about five, should be glued in the middle, and then fixed with adhesive tape.  The result should be something like a peacock tail.  In conclusion, it is necessary to put on a latch on the cord, thanks to which it will be possible to raise and then lower the curtain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wallpaper on the table" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1354508.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Decorated lamps </h2><p>  What can be done from the remnants of wallpaper?  A good option may be the original lamp.  For the manufacture you need a frame from the lampshade and a certain amount of wallpaper.  A piece should be cut from the material so that a margin of about 2 centimeters remains from below and above.  Wallpaper must be carefully glued to the frame using wallpaper glue.  The left stock should be cut in several places, and then glued into the structure so that no wrinkles appear.  The result is an updated floor lamp with an unusual design. </p><p>  The finished product can be decorated if desired.  Ribbons and braid are ideal for this.  The lamp leg can also be decorated.  In this case, it all depends on your imagination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wallpaper ideas" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1354504.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pots for plants </h2><p>  Crafts from the remains of wallpaper can be not only original, but also useful.  Flower pots are usually made of clay or plastic.  Their design is often boring and inconspicuous.  Beautiful containers for plants cost a lot of money.  However, if desired, you can decorate them yourself.  Such products can decorate the house or serve as a good souvenir. </p><p>  To work with flower pots, it is better to use small pieces of wallpaper.  Material for decor is better to choose thin.  It will be easier to lay down, and wrinkles and folds will not form on the surface.  When the pot is completely pasted over, it is necessary to leave it for some time to dry.  Do not forget about protection.  On top of the wallpaper, put a layer of glue.  When the composition dries, an unusual flower pot should be varnished. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from the remains of wallpaper" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1354507.jpg"></div>
