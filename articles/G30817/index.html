The technology quickly passed the first stages and is currently used in mobile technology everywhere.  If ten years ago <span>push-button telephones</span> were quite common, today only a small assortment flaunts on store shelves. </p><h2>  Smartphones with a stylus are gaining popularity </h2><p>  Successful companies such as Samsung, AlGi and others every year declare that the popularity of such devices (in which you can use not only a finger, but also a special device called a stylus) can be increased.  What explains this?  And this is due to the fact that smartphones with a stylus are more convenient to use.  This accessory gives the user the ability to quickly manage editing spreadsheets, for example, or entering text.  The point here is precisely the accuracy of the set.  Let's talk about which models from this segment are the most popular. </p><h2>  Samsung with a stylus: Galaxy Note 4 smartphone </h2>

    <p>  The device was created by South Korean developers for people who love to read electronic books or browse pages on the international network.  Without attention you can not leave the processor, which consists of eight cores.  Their first four operates at a clock frequency of 1.9 GHz.  The second four - at 1.3 GHz.  The smartphone comes preloaded with three gigabytes of RAM.  It gives an excellent opportunity to multitask even with fairly demanding applications.  The built <span>-in memory drive is</span> designed for 32 gigabytes, and you can increase this amount by integrating an external device in the MicroSD format up to 128 GB. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A Samsung smartphone with a stylus boasts a camera.  She takes incredibly high quality pictures.  The matrix of the main module has a size equal to 16 megapixels.  The device is equipped with intelligent optical stabilization.  <span>The front camera</span> will be more modest, only 3.7 megapixels, but this is enough for the eyes to take high-quality pictures on it.  As a stylus, an electronic pen called S-Pen is presented.  It perceives requests and signals much better, therefore it has increased accuracy.  There were no negative reviews about this device. </p><h2>  LG G3 Stylus D690 </h2>

    <p>  This LG smartphone with a stylus was developed by the company for fans.  The developers promised to please the fans - they did it!  Another but original product with a name that clarifies the situation.  The main advantage of this unit is its screen, the diagonal of which reaches 5.5 inches.  <span>The resolution,</span> unfortunately, is small, only 540 by 960 pixels.  It is still unknown which processor model is installed in this phablet.  However, there is reliable information confirming that the iron filling has four cores.  They operate at a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  There is one gigabyte of RAM and 8 GB of long-term memory.  Not as much as we would like.  However, this is also enough for multitasking.  And the problem with the lack of long-term memory is solved by integrating an external, more capacious drive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A spoon of tar </h2>

    <p>  In terms of its photographic part, the subject of the current review is similar to Alcatel‚Äôs solution under the name OneTouch Hero 2. The main module has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  The secondary camera did not perform as well as expected.  Its resolution is 1.3 megapixels.  It seems that this should be enough to create good selfie shots.  However, be careful when buying a device if you like to customize the camera, as they say, to your needs.  As written in the reviews about this phablet, here the choice of configurations and their changes are very limited, so not all photo lovers are satisfied.  Nevertheless, the LG G3 Stylus D690 is exactly the device that belongs to the class of smartphones with styluses for little money. </p><h2>  Alcatel OneTouch Hero 2 </h2>

    <p>  Earlier, we already mentioned this device in passing.  However, now it's time to get to know him in more detail.  Smartphones with a stylus, an overview of which is presented in this article, have their own characteristics.  And what exactly can a solution from Alcatel offer us?  As it turned out, the device can surprise the user in a whole range of directions, from design and style to graphics and overall performance. </p><h2>  The most powerful iron </h2>

    <p>  The work is based on the chipset of the MediaTek family, and more specifically, the MT6592 model.  All eight cores operating at a universal frequency are working in it in a sweat.  By the way, it equals 2 gigahertz.  The volumes of operational and long-term memory, respectively, are 2 and 16 gigabytes.  ‚ÄúPermanent‚Äù can be increased by using an external microSD format storage device.  All this stuffing is hidden by a six-inch screen that displays a picture in Full-HD quality.  The role of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãplayed by the IPS panel. </p><p>  Attention deserves the camera device.  The main module is designed for 13.1 megapixels, and the front - for 5 MG.  Fans of creating high-quality photos will be uncontrollably happy with how the modules work.  The reviews about this phablet say that it is ideal for those who like not only to take pictures, but also to launch ‚Äúheavy‚Äù toys.  Be sure that the powerful hardware will easily pull these applications. </p><h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Note 3 Neo </h2>

    <p>  The list, which lists the <span>best smartphones</span> with a stylus as of 2016, is drawing to a close, and now we will talk about the model whose name was given above.  It has already become not just a rule for a South Korean developer, but a tradition to use an S-AMOLED type matrix.  The screen resolution of this device allows you to display the picture in HD quality.  The hardware consists of a six-core processor (‚ÄúCortex A15‚Äù).  Four of its cores operate at a clock frequency of 1.7 GHz.  The remaining - at 1.3 GHz.  The amount of RAM is two gigabytes.  Long-term - 8 times more.  It may seem to some that this is not enough.  In this case, you can simply purchase an external microSD drive up to 64 gigabytes. </p><p>  One of the most powerful features of this device are its cameras.  The rear has a resolution of 8 megapixels, it is equipped with an LED flash.  The video frame rate is 30 frames per second.  Selfie lovers will appreciate the front camera of the device, since it is equipped with a 2 megapixel module.  To make yourself a high-quality avatar and upload it to a social network, this will be more than enough.  In the reviews of this unit, negative aspects were noted regarding product quality.  The fact is that a certain batch of smartphones came out defective.  Therefore, from time to time, users come across just such models.  Currently, the situation is resolved, defective models are highlighted and removed from the equipment depots.  Therefore, purchases can no longer be afraid. </p>
