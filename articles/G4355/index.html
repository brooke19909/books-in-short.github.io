Schelkovo, Moscow region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many Muscovites and residents of the suburbs of the capital like to go on vacation not to distant lands, but to their native suburbs, for example, to Bear Lakes (Moscow Region, Shchelkovo District).  They attract with their beauty, unique energy, and some with riddles and mysticism.  Located to the north-east of the capital, just 15 minutes from the Moscow Ring Road, the lakes make it possible to break into nature even for a day.  The intriguing name involuntarily evokes associations with dense thickets and ponds with clear water, which are loved by the club-toed forest owners, brown bears.  In fact, everything is much more prosaic, but no less attractive.  Bear Lakes are truly unique reservoirs, on the banks of which there is a village of the same name, and more recently, a modern country club. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  A very correct decision is to come to the Bear Lakes on the weekend.  The beach, fishing and a bunch of other pleasures will help you to relax.  Getting here is easy.  Drive by car to the Moscow Ring Road, taxi onto the Shchelkovo Highway, turn right at the Bear Lakes signpost.  If there are no traffic jams, you can be there in 15-20 minutes.  Who does not want to go by car, can be reached by public transport.  Starting point - Metro Schelkovskoe.  Next, take bus number 361 and follow to the Bear Lakes stop (also no more than 20 minutes), which is located 300 meters from the country club and, in fact, the lakes.  You can use the train and go to the railway station "Bear Lakes", located in the village of the same name.  From there to the final destination - about 3 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lakes </h2><p>  No wonder Bear Lakes are so popular.

This stream connects with a stream to the Malashka River and to the smaller first Small Bear Lake.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãhis mirror is about 7 square meters.  km, depth - up to 14 meters.  It is much calmer here than on the Bolshoi, there are no pleasure boats, only a serene <span>water surface.</span>  But there is also a pier here.  Mostly fishermen use it.

Its depth is up to 10 meters, the banks are covered with cattail, but this pond has a bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bear lakes beach" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/926328.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  One of the advantages of the Bear Lakes Country Club is the beach.  Reviews of vacationers note that it has grassy and sandy zones.  Entry into the water is good.  Another advantage is that there are many attractions here: water slides and skis, catamarans, wakeboards, and trampolines in the center of the lake.  Of course, they need to get to something, for example, on a catamaran.  The beach is equipped with a toilet and shower, wooden loungers are issued.  Entrance for outsiders - 200 rubles.  Among the shortcomings, visitors call: </p><ul><li>  small beach size and, as a result, crowded people; </li><li>  the availability of this holiday for everyone, both guests of a country club and outsiders (this drawback is noted in the club as a whole); </li><li>  water is not always clean, especially during the flowering period of aquatic vegetation. </li></ul>

    <p>  For a long vacation, especially with children, the place is not very suitable, because, apart from the beach in summer and the ice rink in winter, there is no entertainment. </p><h2>  Where to relax in the Schelkovo district </h2><p>  In addition to the country club "Bear Lakes", where else can you go to nature?  Holidays in the Moscow region are inexpensively offered by many bases.  In the Schelkovo district, one can recommend the Atelika Sosnovy Bor hotel complex, which is really located in the forest near the wonderful forest lake, only 32 km from the Moscow Ring Road.  It offers comfortable accommodation, a large swimming pool, a sauna, a bathhouse, a hammam, sports grounds, a gym with exercise equipment and much more. </p>
