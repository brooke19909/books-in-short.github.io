  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How To Get Income From Reselling Apartments.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The business of reselling real estate is probably familiar to everyone.  But in this article we will talk about more profitable resales.  What is the "trick", you ask?  The secret is that you will have to find a very cheap apartment.  It should not be good, the apartment is ideal without repair, with ragged wallpapers, old windows.  Do not be alarmed if alcoholics used to live in this apartment or if someone died in it.  For the presence of an unpleasant smell, the owners will surely reduce the price.  Be sure to consider factors such as the condition of the house itself or the entrance, floor, proximity to a public transport stop or metro station. <br><br>  To select and buy an apartment, it is recommended to find an experienced realtor. <noindex>  <span>Buy an apartment through a real estate agency</span> </noindex>  can be cheaper and thus, you eliminate all possible risks of fraud.  Agree with a realtor about long-term cooperation, it will be beneficial to him and you. <br><br>  So, you have purchased a ‚Äúkilled‚Äù apartment at the lowest price for your city.  Now urgently drive into it and purchase materials for repairs.  You will have to do the repair yourself, without spending money on the wages of hired workers.  There are tons of repair instructions on the Internet.  Even the most inexperienced person can now learn to make high-quality and accurate repairs.  Even girls can do it.  Our main task is to transform the apartment beyond recognition, spending as little money as possible.  Make a good repair can be very cheap.  You just need to know some secrets, they are easy to find on the Internet at specialized sites or video hosting sites. <br><br>  You can repair a two-room apartment in just two months, while spending a small amount in the amount of 35-50 thousand rubles.  Do not spend money on replacing windows and plumbing.  They are easy to update using modern, affordable tools.  It is not necessary to change the front door, it can simply be sheathed, guided by special instructions. <br><br>  The most important thing is not to be lazy.  Work from 7 am to 10 pm.  Yes, it is very important to get up early so that you have more available time at your disposal, because, as you know, there is no repair at night, the noise will disturb the neighbors.  Already in the process of repair, arrange with a hired realtor to look for possible buyers for an apartment.  After the repair is completed - immediately sell the apartment at a higher price.  For cities such as Moscow or St. Petersburg, this difference can be from 500 to 800 thousand rubles.  That is, it will be enough for you to work just two months to live carefree for the rest of the year.  The difference in price - we take it for ourselves.  We put the rest in the bank at interest until the next transaction. <br><br>  Now let's talk about what to do if you do not have money to purchase even the cheapest apartment.  Many banks now give loans.  You can get a loan for 5 years with the possibility of early repayment.  The amount can be from 150 to 300 thousand rubles.  Now we buy the "killed" apartment.  Of course, in Moscow you will not find such an option.  But in the areas, it is very realistic to find an apartment for 150 thousand rubles.  Explore all real estate websites.  For example, in the Sverdlovsk region, you can easily buy an apartment for 150 thousand.  Naturally, you can not sell it for a lot of money (for example, after repair, such an apartment can be sold for 300 thousand rubles).  But the income of 150 thousand rubles for 2 months for the province is very good! </p></div></article>
