    <p>  The USSR - it was not just a country, but a whole power!  The ingenuous abbreviation hid the vast expanses, enormous fortitude, culture and unity of different peoples.  The greatness and scale of the country were striking in their power and sense of patriotism. </p><h2>  Creation Background </h2><p>  The chaos, devastation, and discontent of the people that had accumulated since the time of the <span>first Russian revolution</span> and backed up by subsequent events (armed uprisings, self-denial of Nicholas II, the First World War, Civil 1918-1922), demanded the creation of a single state with its views, beliefs, development program and independent ideology.  This was spotted on time by the head of the Bolshevik party V.I. Ulyanov-Lenin.  Having appreciated the current situation, he competently begins to promote the ideas of the party among the people, gradually leading people to understand that it is necessary to unite a number of republics into one system with their own authorities, a common army, navy, economy, and foreign policy.  The prerequisites for this were more than weighty.  It was required: </p><ul><li>  Immediately restore, and then stably develop, the economic well-being lost during the wars. </li><li>  From the point of view of foreign policy security, to create an impressive, indivisible army and navy. </li><li>  To unite the existing republics of Soviet power under the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding socialism, and as a consequence of it, communism throughout the Earth. </li></ul><p>  The Bolsheviks chose the right tactics - they carried their ideas to the people, introducing them under the loud slogans: ‚ÄúLand to the peasants, factories to the workers!‚Äù  or "All Power to the Soviets."  As a result, their competently constructed work led to the formation of a single, powerful state called the USSR, the abbreviation of which we have to decipher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Decoding of the USSR </h2><p>  After the end of the Civil War, several separate republics emerged, adhering to one direction in the conduct of both domestic and foreign policy.  The leading positions among them were held by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). </p><p>  The decision to create a new single alliance was not made immediately.  The duration of the process was facilitated by the fact that it was hatched under the conditions of an active polemic of two outstanding personalities: Stalin and Lenin.  The plan of the first envisaged the preservation of a single and main center for Russia with the possibility of creating other autonomies within its framework by other peoples.  Ulyanov considered the issue a little differently.  His main idea was based on the equality of all federations that make up the future union.  As a result, they officially adopted and approved the second option.  At the end of 1922, during the first Congress of Soviets, a historical event took place in Russia - the Treaty on the <span>Formation of the USSR</span> was signed <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Union ... </h2><p>  What is hiding the abbreviation of the USSR?  We will deal with this issue in stages.  So, the first word is "union."  Very capacious and short in structure, but so comprehensive and significant in content.  In many definitions, it implies the unification of something or someone at different levels and under various ideas, goals.  If we talk about the Soviet Union, then it united a chain of individual republics, interconnected by history, a common political, economic, as well as territorial interests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In just four letters are the happy years of life of different peoples and cultures.  For some two decades, a worthy path has been traveled from a country destroyed by military operations, full of unrest and ignorance, to an indestructible, mighty power with excellent chances for future development.  And most importantly - it was an equal state owned by the people! </p>

    <h2>  Soviet ... </h2><p>  The second concept, which includes the decoding of the USSR, is the word ‚ÄúSoviet‚Äù.  In essence, this term is not so much related to the Union as to the people of the country as a whole.  Indeed, it was thanks to his worldview, as well as the ideology that shaped the minds of that society, that one could speak of a special Soviet psychology.  And the republics inhabited by such a people are called Soviet. </p><p>  It must be admitted that over time a new definition has appeared in everyday life - the country of the Soviets.  Under such a kind phrase, people united that familiar and calm way of life that reigned in the <span>Soviet states.</span>  Many representatives of the older generation still recall the pleasant moments of the soviet period with a sweet smile on their faces: natural products without impurities and additives, delicious ice cream, lemonade and juices, affordable and free housing, open borders, Soviet films and records, a carefree and safe childhood with a lot of games in the yard and much, much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Soviet civilization is a special philosophy, a peculiar look at the world around us and human life as a whole. </p><h2>  Socialist ... </h2><p>  The decoding of the USSR does not end there, we move on to the next term. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, one of the main points of the Bolshevik program was the building of communism on the whole Earth.  And this socio-political system is inextricably linked with the process of socialism.  It is its lowest level and involves a <span>social division of labor, a</span> nation-wide economy and means of production, which are uniformly used by all members of socialist society.  They firmly believed in this idea, fought fiercely for it, persistently strove for it and stubbornly walked. </p><p>  By socialism, it was supposed to solve the problems that faced man in those days, in order to enable him to move on and grow steadily for the good of the USSR.  And this could only be achieved in the <span>society of socialistically</span> developed republics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR abbreviation with decoding" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19547/410831.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Republics </h2><p>  Initially <span>, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,</span> except for Russia, and more precisely the RSFSR, included: the Ukrainian, Belarusian and Transcaucasian republics.  The latter, in turn, included the regions of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.  In fact, the Russian Empire has not disappeared.  The dominant party of the Bolsheviks transformed it into a new form of statehood, which was called the "Soviet Union".  Over the years, the composition of the Union has changed; more and more new areas have joined it.  At the time of the collapse, there were fifteen.  According to the Constitution, all of them were considered <span>sovereign states,</span> for which there remained the right of free exit from the USSR at any time. </p><p>  Along with the fifteen republics within the Union, it also included twenty autonomous Soviet socialist republics (ASSR), eight autonomous regions (AO) and ten autonomous districts, in addition, a number of separate territories and regions. </p><h2>  Modern Russia </h2>

    <p>  As you know, <span>everything is known in comparison.</span>  And involuntarily, when it comes to the USSR, the majority begins to be puzzled to compare the period of the twentieth century with modern events.  Well, everyone‚Äôs right, but is it worth it?  After all, you must admit, no matter how the century is, both positive and negative traits will necessarily be present in it.  Another question, of course, is that their number may be unequal. </p><p>  It is definitely impossible to relate to modern society, at the same time as it is not worth it.  We can criticize, scold, and condemn today's order of life for a long time and hard, but it will not make it any easier for anyone, right?  Therefore, we will not focus on negative thoughts and turn to positive experience.  After all, as you know, any medal has two sides. </p><p>  Probably the best moment that can be highlighted in modern Russia is the huge number of opportunities now available to us.  And this concerns not only the open curtain, but also the broad outlook of citizens due to the diverse and accessible literature, and a more democratic approach in terms of organizing their life.  Today we have become much freer in our thoughts, dreams, goals and means of achieving them.  We are not limited by the norms and principles of public morality, we do not obey the charters written by the incomprehensible uncle.  We are free, and therefore we live.  Therefore, the abbreviation of the USSR, with the decoding of which this article introduces you, can be somewhat interpreted in accordance with the modern demands of society.  For example, the Union of Free Forces of Russia or Building Happy Fates of Russia. </p><h2>  A country that was not? </h2><p>  Speaking of the Soviet Union, more positive moments are recalled.  No wonder the USSR was considered the most powerful country with developed agriculture, free and high-quality education, the best healthcare, a planned and growing economy, and promising light and mining industries.  The USSR did not know what unemployment was.  People were confident in the future, were not afraid to stay on the street, as the state provided all its citizens with free housing.  But the main thing - it was an independent, self-sufficient state, in which the principles of equality and brotherhood dominated.  And nothing unites and tempers the spirit as a general idea.  What Soviet society was based on. </p>

    <p>  Decoding of the USSR - is it needed now?  To whom, why, for what?  We will answer with confidence: we need!  Just a must!  How pure, spring air, piercing through each and every one, how morning trills of birds, how the first snow sparkling in the sun, how invaluable the experience of generations is needed!  Because there is no better example for humanity that you want to be like.  And there is no better time that each of us recalls with pleasure.  Even this pair of points should not cause such a question, and even more so reasoning.  Let the uncomplicated abbreviation of the USSR firmly settle in the heart of every citizen of modern Russian society and remain in his soul for many, many years. </p>
