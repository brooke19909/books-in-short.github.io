And this is not surprising, since at the dawn of the era of conquering extraterrestrial space, many things were done for the first time, and what seems commonplace today was considered extraordinary.  This does not detract from the merits of those who, step by step, paved the way for those who in the future will have to fly to other worlds.  Among them is Vladimir Aleksandrovich Dzhanibekov, an astronaut who became the 86th earthman to overcome Earth's gravity.  At the same time, he led the first expedition with a visit to the orbital station.  In addition, Dzhanibekov is the only one who visited space 5 times in a row as a ship commander.  He also became the first and last citizen of the USSR, who was awarded the title of cosmonaut of the 1st class.  Of interest is the effect discovered by Janibekov, which at one time gave food to those who like to make apocalyptic predictions. </p>

    <h2>  Dzhanibekov (astronaut): biography before participating in the EPAS program </h2><p>  The future space explorer, scientist and artist V. A. Dzhanibekov, nee Krysin, was born on May 13, 1942 in the village of Iskander of the <span>Kazakh SSR</span> (now part of the Republic of Uzbekistan).  He studied at schools No. 107, 50 and 44 of the city of Tashkent.  Then he entered the local Suvorov Military School of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which he did not graduate because of its disbandment.  During his studies, he showed excellent abilities in physics and mathematics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although the young man dreamed of an officer career, he did not enter the military university by competition.  In order not to waste time in vain, Vladimir Krysin became a student at the Physics Department of Leningrad State University.  However, a year later he passed the exams for admission to the Yeisk Higher Military Aviation School and became his cadet. </p><p>  While studying at this university, he mastered the piloting of such aircraft as the MiG-17, Yak-18 and Su-7B. </p><h2>  Work in the cosmonaut squad </h2><p>  In 1965, Dzhanibekov (an astronaut later) graduated from the flight school and entered the service in the USSR Air Force.  He held the position of senior instructor pilot at the 963 training aviation regiment.  He prepared for the release of more than two dozen pilots of fighter-bomber aircraft of the Air Forces of the USSR and India. </p><p>  After 5 years, Dzhanibekov (he only dreamed of becoming an astronaut) was accepted into the cosmonaut corps and completed a training course for flights to the Salyut OS and Soyuz-type spacecraft. </p><p>  Later, in April 1974, he was enrolled in the staff of the Third Division of the EPAS 1st Division. </p>

    <h2>  Space Orbit Flights </h2><p>  In total, Vladimir Dzhanibekov took part in 5 space expeditions.  He made his first flight in January 1978, together with O. Makarov.  At the Salyut-6 orbital station, they worked with the main crew, which included G. Grechko and Yu. Romanenko.  The duration of stay in space was almost 6 days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second flight Dzhanibekov made in March 1981 as the crew commander of the spacecraft "Soyuz-39", which included a citizen of Mongolia J. Gurragchi. </p><p>  For the third time, the astronaut went on an expedition with A. Ivanchenko and the Frenchman Jean-Loup Chretien.  An abnormal situation arose on board the ship during this flight.  Due to a malfunction in the automation circuit, docking with the space station was performed by Janibekov in manual mode.  At OS Salyut-7, the crew headed by him worked together with A. Berezov and <span>V. Lebedev.</span> </p>

    <p>  Vladimir Dzhanibekov made the fourth space flight between July 17 and 29, 1984, together with S. Savitskaya and I. Volk.  In orbit, the crew headed by him worked with L. Kizim, V. Soloviev and O. Atkov. </p><p>  During this expedition, the astronaut made spacewalk with <span>S. Savitskaya,</span> which lasted about three and a half hours. </p><p>  In the fifth and last space flight, Vladimir Dzhanibekov set off in 1985.  A feature of this expedition was docking with an unworkable, uncontrolled Salyut-7 Union orbital station, which was repaired, which allowed its operation to continue for several more years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For the brilliant fulfillment of the tasks of this complex and in many ways unique flight, flight engineer V. Savinykh and ship commander Dzhanibekov (astronaut) were awarded. </p><h2>  Janibekov effect </h2><p>  In one of his interviews, Georgy Grechko spoke very warmly about Vladimir Alexandrovich, noting that he was engaged in deep research in the field of physics.  In particular, he belongs to the palm in the discovery of the Janibekov effect, which was made by him during the 5th space flight in 1985. </p>

    <p>  It lies in the strange behavior of a rotating body flying in zero gravity.  Like many other scientific discoveries, it was discovered quite by accident when Dzhanibekov (an astronaut) unscrewed the ‚Äúlamb‚Äù - special nuts with ears, which secured cargo arriving in orbit. </p><p>  He noticed that it was only necessary to hit the protruding part of these fasteners, as they begin to unwind without assistance and, jumping off the threaded rod, spinning, fly by inertia in zero gravity.  However, the most interesting is yet to come!  It turns out that, having flown about 40 cm with the ears forward, the nuts make an unexpected 180-degree turn and continue flying in the same direction.  But this time, their protrusions are directed backward, and the rotation occurs in the opposite direction.  Then, having flown about another 40 cm, the nut again flips (full turn) and continues to move the ears forward and so on.  Vladimir Dzhanibekov repeated the experiment many times, including with other objects, and received the same result. </p><h2>  "Wrench Apocalypse" </h2><p>  After the discovery of the Janibekov effect, dozens of explanations appeared for such an unexpected behavior of the nut in zero gravity.  Some pseudo-scientists even made apocalyptic predictions.  In particular, they said that our planet could well be regarded as a spinning ball flying in zero gravity, so it can be assumed that the Earth periodically performs somersaults, like the ‚ÄúJanibekov nuts‚Äù.  Even the period of time when the revolution of the earth's axis takes place was named: 12 thousand years.  There were those who felt that the last time our planet had flipped over during the Ice Age, and that such a coup would soon occur that would cause serious natural disasters. </p>

    <h2>  Explanation </h2><p>  Fortunately, soon the secret of the effect, which was discovered by Vladimir Dzhanibekov (astronaut), was revealed.  For its correct explanation, it should be taken into account that the rotation speed of the ‚Äúspace nut‚Äù is low, therefore, unlike a rapidly rotating gyroscope, it is in an unstable state.  At the same time, the ‚Äúlamb‚Äù, in addition to the main axis of rotation, has two other spatial (secondary) ones.  Around them, it rotates at speeds that are an order of magnitude lower. </p><p>  As a result of the influence of minor movements, a gradual change in the inclination of the main axis of rotation occurs over time.  When it reaches a critical value, a nut or similar rotating object makes a somersault. </p><h2>  Will there be a change in the direction of the earth's axis </h2><p>  Experts say that such apocalyptic phenomena do not threaten our planet, since the center of gravity of the ‚Äúlamb‚Äù is significantly offset from the center along the axis of rotation.  As you know, although the Earth is not an ideal ball, it is sufficiently balanced.  In addition, the value of the Earth‚Äôs precession and its <span>moments of inertia</span> allow it not to tumbling around like a ‚ÄúDzhanibekov nut‚Äù, but to maintain stability like a gyroscope. </p>

    <h2>  The main directions of scientific work in space flights </h2><p>  During his stay at the orbital station, Dzhanibekov conducted experiments in medicine, physics of the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, biology, astrophysics, and geophysics.  He also was engaged in testing on-board systems of the spacecraft, navigation equipment, pharmacological preparations, <span>life support systems,</span> as well as working out manual docking modes in a wide range of speeds and ranges. </p><p>  Of greatest interest is the experiment on the cultivation of a new stable cotton variety with a record fiber length (up to 78 mm) under the influence of cosmic radiation and under zero gravity. </p><h2>  In subsequent years </h2><p>  Dzhanibekov is an astronaut (photo above), who from 1985 to 1988 was the commander of the cosmonaut corps of the TsPK im.  Yu.A. Gagarin.  Since 1997, he has been part-time as a professor-consultant at TSU.  Today V. Dzhanibekov heads the Association of Cosmonautics Museums of Russia </p>

    <h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Dzhanibekov (astronaut), whose biography is presented above, was awarded orders and medals not only of the USSR and the Russian Federation, but also of other countries.  Among them is the "Golden Star" of the Hero of the Soviet Union.  Also, Vladimir Alexandrovich is a holder of the orders of Lenin, Red Star, Friendship, etc. </p><p>  In 1984, Dzhanibekov became a laureate of state awards of the Ukrainian SSR and the USSR.  Among the awards that the astronaut was awarded by the government of foreign states, it should be noted the ‚ÄúGolden Star‚Äù of the Hero of the MPR, the Order of Suche-Bator, the State Banner (Hungary), the Legion of Honor and the Gold Medal (France). </p><h2>  Hobbies </h2><p>  Vladimir Alexandrovich has been fond of painting for many years.  He is the author of illustrations of the science-fiction book of Yu. Glazkov, "The Meeting of Two Worlds."  In addition, the paintings of astronaut Janibekov exhibited at the Museum of Cosmonautics.  He also created sketches for American and Soviet brands dedicated to flying beyond the reach of space gravity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pictures of astronaut Janibekov" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1274482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the astronaut Dzhanibekov (nationality - Russian) originally bore the name Krysin.  However, in 1968, he met his future wife Lily.  The girl came from an ancient family, the founder of which was the khan of the Golden Horde Dzhanibek, son of the khan of Uzbek.  In the 19th century, their descendants became the founders of Nogai literature.  Lilia's father, Munir Dzhanibekov, had no sons and turned out to be the last man in his dynasty.  At his request and with the permission of his parents after marriage, Vladimir Alexandrovich took the name of his wife and continued the family of the Dzhanibekovs.  The couple had two daughters: Inna and Olga.  They gave father 5 grandchildren. </p><p>  The second wife of Vladimir Dzhanibekov is Tatyana Alekseevna Gevorkyan.  She is the head of one of the departments of the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics. </p><p>  Now you know what astronaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov is known for, whose biography is a story about a man who devoted his life to studying phenomena occurring in zero gravity, and to serving science and his country. </p>
