They are attracted by the unique and distinctive culture of the people and the rich historical heritage of these places.  Traveling in Hungary, it is worth visiting a number of small towns on the Danube.  One of these places is Vysehrad (Hungarian. Visegr√°d). </p><h2>  The geographical position of the city </h2><p>  Vysehrad is located in Central Hungary, in the bend of the Danube River, on its right bank.  Budapest, the capital of the country, is about 45 km away.  The population is only 1.7 thousand people. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.7829694" data-lng="18.973339099999976" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/5/1/1/11511.png"></div><h2>  Visegrad History </h2><p>  Despite its small size, the city of Vysehrad in Hungary has a rich history.  Due to its unique geographical position, the city is ideal for the construction of defensive structures.  It is not surprising that the first fortifications appeared here in the 11th century, during the reign of Rome.  Built on the high and impregnable hill of Sibrik, the fortress was repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt in subsequent centuries. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 13th century, Tatar-Mongol tribes settled throughout Hungary.  As a result of the invasion, the capital of the state - Buda - was almost completely destroyed.  In order to defend himself against the sudden raids of the enemy, King Bela IV ordered the restoration and fortification of the fortress in Vysehrad.  At the same time, the tower of Solomon was erected, thanks to which it was possible to keep under fire both the riverbed and the coastal strip.  By order of the king, a complex system of fortifications was built that ensured the safety of the country's borders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1310, King Charles I Robert ascended the Hungarian throne.  He was allowed to take the throne by the support of the pope himself.  His opponent was the Czech contender - King Vladislav, who was preferred by most of the inhabitants of Buda.  This created a tense and dangerous atmosphere in the capital.  Fearing for his life, the new king decided to transfer the capital to Vysehrad.  This has contributed to the active development of urban infrastructure. </p><p>  It was here that in 1335 the so-called First Vysehrad Congress was held, at which Czech King Jan I and King Casimir III of Poland arrived.  The initiator was the ruler of Hungary Karl Robert.  The purpose of this meeting was the formation of the Anti-Habsburg coalition. </p><p>  After the death of King Carl Robert, the capital was moved back to Buda, and the palace became the summer residence of the kings. </p><p>  Only after almost 100 years, when Matthias Corvin came to power in 1458, the city found a second wind.  A marble palace was built under him, which, according to contemporaries, was the most beautiful in Europe. </p><p>  Later the city was destroyed twice: in the 16th century during the Turkish invasion and in the 18th century during the Habsburg offensive, during the war for Hungary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visegrad.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Visegrad History" class="if uuid-2955958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2955958.jpg"></div><h2>  Solomon's Tower </h2><p>  Soloman Tower was erected in the 13th century and is a powerful hexagonal structure at the foot of the hill.  This is the only building that has remained from the bottom line of defense.  The thickness of the walls of the tower reaches 8 meters.  According to one of the many versions, it was named in honor of Tsar Solomon, grandson of Yaroslav the Wise. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For a long time it was used to conclude especially important prisoners.  In 1401, Sigismund of Luxembourg, who later became the Roman emperor, was held here.  Although he lived in the tower for only 4 months, he could not forget this time.  Already being an emperor, Sigismund participated in the improvement of the tower. </p><p>  The most famous prisoner is the ruler of Wallachia, <span>Vlad III the Impaler,</span> better known as Count Dracula.  He was captured by King Matthias on charges of conspiracy against the Crown and imprisoned in the tower of Solomon for 12 years.  According to one of the many legends, in the cellars of the tower, Tepes mocked the captured animals. </p><p>  There is another version, according to which Dracula was not in captivity in the tower, but under "house arrest."  With the support of the king, Vlad Tepes even married his cousin and lived in the tower of Solomon with his family. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visegrad.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Solomon's Tower" class="if uuid-2955934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2955934.jpg"></div><h2>  Vysehrad Fortress </h2><p>  Built in the 13th century, the fortress was blown up in 1702 by the Habsburgs.  Since then, it has not been used for its intended purpose and has been completely bombarded with earth.  Its remains were discovered by archaeologists in the 1930s.  Then began a major restoration, which continues to this day.  Today, the ruins of the fortress are accessible to tourists.  From its walls a picturesque panoramic view of the Danube opens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="szavazo.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vysehrad Fortress" class="if uuid-2955961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2955961.jpg"></div><h2>  Royal Palace </h2><p>  The Royal Palace can be called the main attraction of Vysehrad in Hungary.  Contemporaries called the palace marble.  The interior was decorated in the Renaissance style.  One of the best masters of that time, Giovanni Dolmata, worked on the decoration of the complex.  Thanks to him, the royal palace in Vysehrad was even called the new wonder of the world.  Halls and galleries were decorated with sculptures and mosaics, parks - with fountains. </p><p>  Today, the object is officially called the King Matthias Museum.  During the Turkish conquests, the palace was destroyed, and nowadays partially restored ruins are accessible for tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="howaneltravelmart.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King Matthias Palace" class="if uuid-2955939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2955939.jpg"></div><p>  In the reconstructed parts of the palace you can see objects of medieval life.  An interesting exhibit of the museum is the king‚Äôs bathtub, which was heated using an oven.  Sculptures of Renaissance masters are collected in the chapel at the royal palace. </p><p>  The most valuable exhibit is the Hercules Fountain, created by Giovanni Dolmat.  Archaeologists managed to find enough fragments for reconstruction.  In fact, this is the first creation in the Renaissance style not only in Hungary, but also generally outside of Italy.  A copy of the fountain is located in the courtyard, on a historic site. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The fountain in the palace" class="if uuid-2955955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2955955.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Vysehrad in Hungary </h2><p>  You can get from Budapest to Vysehrad in several ways: </p><ol><li>  By bus.  This is the most convenient way to get to Vysehrad in Hungary.  Buses leave every hour from √öjpest V√°roskapu Station.  The whole journey takes 1 hour 15 minutes. </li><li>  By train.
