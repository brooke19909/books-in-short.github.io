  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Diffusion is ...</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Diffusion is (literally) scattering, spreading, spreading.  Physically, <span>this concept</span> characterizes the process of transfer of energy or matter from a highly concentrated region to a region with a low concentration.  The most common phenomenon diffusion is associated with is the mixing of gas molecules (for example, when the aroma of perfume spreads in the air) or liquids.  The same process can be observed in solids.  For example, if the end of the rod is electrically charged or heated, then heat (or charge) will gradually spread from the hot section to the cold one.  Moreover, if you take a metal object, then the heat will spread quite quickly, and the electric current instantly.  If the rod is made of synthetic material, then the heat propagation will proceed slowly, and the electric one will be even slower.  The diffusion of solids occurs at an even lower rate. </p><p>  It should be noted that this term (like many others) is used today not only in physics. </p><p>  There is, for example, such a thing as diffusion of innovations.  This is such a process by means of which, over time, innovation is transmitted to business entities via communication channels.  In this case, diffusion is informational dissemination, the speed and form of which depend on the <span>communication channels</span> used <span>.</span>  Of great importance are the features of the perception of information by entities conducting business activities, as well as their ability to practical use of the information received.  With the diffusion of innovation, already mastered once and applied in another locality, in new places and conditions the number of consumers and producers increases.  Continuity of the process forms the boundaries and forms of distribution of innovations in a market economy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Experts note that in the context of business activities, diffusion is cyclical in nature.  Moreover, the implementation of the entire process of implementation, distribution of innovations is divided into certain stages: fundamental and applied research, development and design, construction, development, as well as industrial production, marketing and sales. </p><p>  Cultural diffusion is a concept that is used in the social sphere.  <span>This definition is characterized by the</span> process of mutual penetration of certain traits from one social group to another when they come in contact.  Moreover, diffusion may not leave any imprint on any of the interacting cultures.  However, it may happen that this penetration will provoke a strong and equal (or one-sided) influence.  The channels through which diffusion passes are mainly tourism, <span>population migration,</span> war, trade, scientific conferences, fairs and exhibitions, and the exchange of specialists and students. </p><p>  The distribution of innovations in the social sphere can be carried out in two directions: horizontally or vertically. </p><p>  Horizontal penetration (intergroup diffusion) is observed between individuals, groups of equal status. </p><p>  Vertical distribution occurs between subjects with unequal status.  This process is called stratification diffusion. </p><p>  <span>Traditional society is</span> characterized by a pronounced symbolic polarization of the population.  According to a number of culturologists, the middle class is considered an example of lifestyle and style today (for both the upper and lower classes). </p><p>  <span>Cultural diffusion</span> brings both positive and negative traits to society.  Thus, the spread of high ideas about life in the middle and (especially) the lower strata means, on the one hand, the enlightenment and democratization of the people.  On the other hand, high culture in this case can be perceived primitively and gone. </p>
