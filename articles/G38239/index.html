    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Choosing a lambrequin is not an easy task.  Before you go to the store for a cloth, you need to think carefully about what you need to get in the end.  The size, color, shape and material of the pelmet are of great importance.  Patterns of lambrequins and curtains do not depend on the type of fabric.  If the material is a little more than three lengths of the cornice - it does not matter.  Include all the fabric in the assembly - it will be even more beautiful. </p><p>  If the room has not one, but several windows, then the curtains should be the same for all.  Without sufficient experience, it is better not to undertake such a large amount of work.  Start with a room with only one window. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a lambrequin a lambrequin pattern" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847385.jpg" width="357"></div>

A window with an elegant lambrequin made of elegant fabric can turn it from a utility room into a cozy dining room.  How to sew a lambrequin?  The lambrequin pattern for the kitchen window, if the room is small, can consist of only one part.  It can be a swag or a rectangular bando.  To create interesting symmetrical folds, use a special braid for assemblies.  Choose a kitchen cloth that is light and not too mottled, as there are always plenty of ripples - vegetables, fruits, dishes, food packaging and so on.  A light pelmet contrasting to furniture and walls can visually expand the space, and vertical stripes formed by sewn-in or superimposed ties will increase the height of the walls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="free do-it-yourself lambrequin patterns" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Do not be afraid to sew the curtains yourself </h2><p>  In the manufacture of curtains, you need to have free space where you can expand it, and even better - hang the material, to create beautiful and even draperies and folds, as well as to symmetrically distribute the folds.  At first, it will seem very difficult to <span>sew a pelmet with your own hands.</span>  <span>The patterns of</span> volumetric parts presented in our article may put you at a standstill, because they do not indicate the exact numbers of the length and width of the elements.  However, do not rush to abandon the intention to sew curtains for yourself.  But we did not put down the dimensions, because the windows are different for everyone, but the details of the curtains are the same.  They can differ only in length and depend on the width of the cornice.  The number of swag and ties can be any. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns of lambrequins and curtains" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847331.jpg" width="334"></div>

If you want to visually lift it, plan more details with vertical lines - these are chillies, bells and ties.  Very good visual adjustment of the space is achieved by finishing with contrasting piping.  If you need to expand the room, use more horizontal lines - these are swagi and bando with a transverse pattern.  When the curtain closes the entire wall, there is always a feeling of more space than it really is.  If possible, try to install the longest eaves and fasten them as high as possible.  Unless, of course, you live in a palace, where the size of the rooms is very different from the size of the rooms in apartments of multi-storey buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing lambrequins patterns" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847333.jpg" width="283"></div>

    <h2>  Technological subtleties of sewing and finishing curtains </h2><p>  Sewing curtains and lambrequins, the patterns of which you see in this article, are quite capable of all more or less experienced seamstresses. </p><p>  For beginning tailors, the question often arises as to whether details should be swept before grinding.  Modern sewing machines with a movable mechanism of the foot allow you to sew without pre-stitching sewing stitches.  Large parts should be cleaved with pins.  To avoid needle breakage, sewing directly on them is not worth it.  It is more convenient to proceed as follows.  When the foot approaches the pin, first reduce the speed of the flywheel and the conveyor, and then, when the foot approaches the pin by a distance of 2-3 cm, carefully pull it out of the fabric.  Then increase the speed again.  Before the next pin, repeat the maneuver, and so on until the very end.  In the same way, you can sew on an oblique edging.  However, it may lengthen somewhat during the sewing process.  This is due to the fact that the <span>oblique inlay is</span> cut out not along the equity, but along the oblique thread, which prevents the edge from shedding and makes it more elastic.  The resulting inlet can be planted somewhat during operation, or it can be released.  In this case, at the end of the seam it will have to be cut off, and the edge of the tape gently bent.  This operation is the most time-consuming when sewing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing a pelmet with your own hands patterns" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847372.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  No pattern of lambrequins does not take into account the increase in oblique trim, because this element does not affect the length of the curtain. </p><p>  Cocktail, ties and bells, made of plain fabric and trimmed with a slanting trim, look especially beautiful and expressive.  Nevertheless, it is better for novice dressmakers to limit themselves to a simple hem. </p><h2>  Making a pattern is a simple matter </h2><p>  If you have never sewed curtains, but want to try yourself in this business, keep in mind - sewing even the simplest curtains requires a certain skill.  No need to look for free lambrequin patterns in stores or libraries.  With your own hands you can make a much more suitable pattern for your situation.  Take a roll of wallpaper and cut a piece equal to the width of the cornice.  Straighten it so that it does not curl into a roll.  Fasten to the ledge and use a felt-tip pen or pencil to draw a line for the bottom edge.  Move to the opposite end of the room and look towards the window. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself lambrequin patterns photo" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847338.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  If, in your opinion, the room with the paper bando you painted does not become narrower, smaller, or disproportionate, then consider that you did half the work - now you know what the ideal size of the lambrequin for this room is.  If there is a feeling that the room is not harmoniously distorted, adjust the pattern to a winning size.  Remember - the curtain will hang before your eyes for a very long time, therefore, the pattern of lambrequins must be verified and corrected before you start working with the fabric. </p><h2>  Determine the shape, number and size of draperies </h2><p>  It is necessary that the lambrequins harmonize the size and shape of the room.  If the window is improperly designed with a large object (and a lambrequin is a large object), you will constantly feel like you are in a room with a low ceiling and begin to walk along it, automatically clutching your head in the shoulders and stooping.  He will, as it were, press on you from above.  Or, by making the curtains too narrow, you will feel that the walls are pressing on you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tailoring of curtains and lambrequins patterns" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847332.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <p>  If you don‚Äôt have a cornice yet and you‚Äôre just going to install it, keep in mind that the vertical sheer curtains in the whole wall with a narrow laconic lambrequin under the ceiling will make the room visually more spacious, and the curtains and lambrequin with folds will overload it and the room will lose in area .  Lush cascades of drapery are suitable only for very large rooms.  However, if the fabric is white, light and transparent, then contrasting ties and small swags are quite acceptable, and made according to all the rules of ergonomics - even desirable. </p><h2>  Separate elements of lambrequins </h2><p>  A pattern of lambrequins may consist of several elements.  As a rule, these are bandos, ties, swags, chillies and bells.  Bando is often made smooth and stiff.  Trapezoidal ties are sewn in several places, symmetrically with respect to the lateral edges.  In addition, they can not be sewn, but made separately and fastened with decorative clips or pins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tailoring of curtains and lambrequins patterns" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847345.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Layout on fabric and cutting </h2><p>  Before starting work, the pattern of lambrequins is laid out on the fabric.  You can cut in any direction.  The main thing here is not observing the tension of the fabric (the location of the warp and weft threads), but arranging the patterns so that all the elements fit in completely and you subsequently do not have to make connecting seams on one part.  Swag, docked from several pieces of fabric, will be badly draped and will not stand out in the best way against the background of others. </p><h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  Sewing curtains requires a lot of fabric.  Choose a material whose width corresponds to the height from the cornice to the floor or to what place you want.  Curtains are made both lying on the floor, and ending at the level of the windowsill.  Here the rules are dictated by fashion, style, your desire and taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of lambrequins" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847380.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  The amount of fabric - the width of the cornice, multiplied by three, in extreme cases - two and a half, not less.  If you plan to subsequently wash the curtains, then consider the possible shrinkage.  This applies to fabrics made from natural fibers. </p><p>  A large room can be decorated with curtains made of dense, heavy fabric, such as brocade or velvet-devore, decorated with thick <span>decorative cords,</span> pickups or towels.  Such fabrics look very beautiful in combination with a transparent tulle.  Along the top edge, the most refined and bizarre lambrequins, patterns, photographs of which we have placed in this article will be appropriate.  We hope they will help you. </p><p>  Swag and ties can be made from one, or from different fabrics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a lambrequin a lambrequin pattern" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847379.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  When creating a style, feel free to use eyelets, magnetic holders, brushes, flowers, a slanting inlay, fringe, frill and braid.  Do not be afraid to do patterns of lambrequins with your own hands.  Photographs of even the most complex structures show that if you disassemble them into components, you get simple elements. </p><h2>  Particular attention - the choice of color curtains </h2><p>  Consider the design options for the windows in the photographs, give each of them an assessment in terms of the effect on the proportions of the room.  Pay attention to the color.  For curtains, try to choose fabrics that are in harmony with your appearance and represent the <span>color of your face</span> and eyes in the most advantageous light.  It is no secret that in our home environment we are often <span>not comme il faut.</span>  Let the curtains work for you - create a positive mood or emphasize the natural beauty of the shade of the skin and eyes.  Many neglect this advice and make curtains or a fashionable color, or one that you saw from someone you know or in a magazine.  The result most often turns out to be completely different from the one expected.  Proceed only from your conditions, and then your interior, and the window in particular, will make the same impression as those that you liked so much.  You will have your own imitators, and you will be considered a person with the perfect artistic taste and golden hands.  Since no one can repeat you, the beautiful interior will remain an unattainable ideal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns of lambrequins and curtains" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27011/847408.jpg" width="557"></div>

    <h2>  Ironing is an indispensable condition for creating beautiful, smooth and invisible seams. </h2><p>  After each operation, do not forget to iron the seams.  When the curtain or lambrequin is ready, it will be harder to do because of the large size of the product and fixed folds.  Small bruises will sag and soon straighten, and creases or wrinkles of the seams will remain, showing inaccurate work to others. </p>
