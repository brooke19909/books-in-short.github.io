    <h2>  The cost of living in the hotel Kaftans 3 * </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this hotel is located almost in the center of Kemer, the prices for rooms in it will pleasantly surprise tourists.  So, a seven-day tour with meals on the system "All inclusive" can be purchased at a price of just 12 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Kaftans hotel 3 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  As for the comments of tourists who visited the Kaftans Hotel, unfortunately, most of them are not positive.  We offer to understand this in more detail. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the Kaftans hotel 3 * managed to earn negative reviews on almost all counts, with the exception of its location.  So, since it is located almost in the center of Kemer, literally a few steps away there are lots of shops, restaurants, bars, night clubs and other places for entertainment.  The nearest beach is just 10 minutes walk at a slow pace.  This fact was appreciated by tourists. </p><p>  As for the rooms and the device of the hotel itself, here a rare traveler was satisfied.  So, according to the general opinion of our compatriots who spent their holidays at the Kaftan Hotel 3 *, furniture, plumbing and other furnishings in the rooms are very old and in a state far from ideal.  In many rooms, air conditioning did not work, taps, handles and cabinet doors constantly broke.  Also, the vast majority of travelers were unsatisfied with the quality of cleaning, as well as the state of bedding. </p><p>  Food in Kaftans 3 * (reviews of tourists only confirm this) also do not deserve special praise.  So, despite the fact that the price of a ticket to this hotel includes meals according to the All Inclusive system, not all vacationers took the opportunity to have lunch and dinner at their hotel.  According to them, the choice of dishes is extremely scarce, vegetables and fruits are stale and weathered, the taste is also very controversial. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaftans 3 turkey" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/479015.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><p>  Many of our compatriots were dissatisfied with the service staff.  So, according to numerous comments, the staff showed rudeness at the slightest expression of dissatisfaction on the part of the hotel guests and was not very keen to correct the situation. </p><p>  In general, most tourists agreed that the Kaftan 3 * hotel does not quite correspond to the declared three stars.  Nevertheless, it is not bad for a budget youth vacation.  After all, young people, as a rule, spend little time at the hotel, preferring to spend days on the beach, go on excursions or walk around the city, and go to bars and discos in the evenings.  For families with children, experienced travelers strongly do not recommend this hotel. </p><h2>  Kemer: resort description </h2><p>  Today, Kemer is a world-famous Turkish resort with a developed tourist infrastructure and a host of hotels and entertainment for every taste and wallet size.  It is located 42 kilometers southwest of Antalya.  On the one hand, Kemer is washed by the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, and on the other, it is protected by the high Toros mountains.  There are many pine forests in the region, and the sea air, combined with cool mountain winds, creates a unique climate that is very good for health.  In addition, despite the fact that the summer here is quite hot, and in August the air temperature often rises to +35 degrees Celsius, the heat is not felt so much and is tolerated quite easily.  All these features contribute to the magnificent comfortable rest of many tourists from all over the world. </p><h2>  Holiday villages Kemer </h2><p>  The Kemer tourist region includes several resort villages: Camyuva, Beldibi, Tekirova, Kirish and Goynuk.  In each of them you will find a lot of hotels that can satisfy all the needs of tourists.  There are both inexpensive two- and three-star hotels, and luxury four- and five-star hotels.  We offer you to learn more about each of the resort villages of Kemer. </p>
