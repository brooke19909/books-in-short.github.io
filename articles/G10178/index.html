    <h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  Before you begin, you need to decide which mask you want to make.  The following types are available: </p><ol><li>  In the form of a hoop with the image of a beast or a <span>fairy-tale hero.</span>  Mounted on the forehead.  Reminds this type of mask kokoshnik.  Usually used for children's productions. </li><li>  Riding Hood with the face of the beast.  It is put on the face with the most eyebrows.  She holds well on her head, quite comfortable. </li><li>  Bandage mask.  Sew from fabric. </li><li>  Carnival.  It is worn completely on the face.  There are also half masks - only to the mouth.  Attaches to the head with an elastic band. </li><li>  Hard mask with a pen. </li></ol><p>  Making a bear mask with your own hands is a snap.  First of all, decide on the type of product and the type of fabric. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY bear mask" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/379776.jpg" width="560"></div></h2><h2>  What material are they made of? </h2><p>  Usually recommended to do from papier-m√¢ch√©, cardboard, fabric.  Isolon is very popular today.  This is the material from which <span>tourist rugs are made.</span>  It is also used for insulation during construction work.  It is durable, holds its shape perfectly.  The main thing is not as hard as cardboard.  The possibilities of isolon are much wider in comparison with other materials.  The mask is pretty simple to make.  Cut parts from the isolon and connect them with a thermal gun, and you can use a stapler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Before you begin to make a mask, pay attention to the following recommendations.  If the role in the play requires a lot of singing or talking, it is better to make a half mask that covers only the cheeks and nose, and the mouth and chin remain open. </p><p>  The eyes on the mask should be in line.  The larger the cut, the better the view.  But first try on a template with cut out holes for the eyes to face.  The main thing is that everything fits. </p><p>  As for mounting the product on the head.  If you plan that the mask will hold on to the elastic, then make the holes through which it will be inserted at a distance of 1.5 centimeters from the edge of the mask.  Shoelaces, braid as a tie should not be used, since during the performance the ropes can come loose and the mask will come off the face. </p><p>  Bulky masks are best avoided.  Although they are very spectacular, they have poor visibility, and they also make movement and breathing difficult. </p><p>  Is there a child's morning party or a thematic corporate party?  The main attribute of a fairy-tale hero or carnival costume is a mask.  We advise you to do it yourself.  After all, you will kill two birds with one stone.  First, save money.  Secondly, show your imagination. </p><h2>  Mask "Bear" made of paper </h2>

The quickest option is to <span>cut out of paper.</span>  Everything is very simple. </p><p>  Print on the printer or draw the face of the bear yourself.  Cut to the office.  Use thick paper, and best of all glue the template onto cardboard.  Cut out.  Then colorize.  Use gouache best.  It lays well on paper and dries quickly.  In order for the Bear mask to hold well on your head, make holes on the sides and insert an elastic band.  You can do without cutting, just attach the staples to the brackets.  To make the mask voluminous, you can, for example, make eyebrows from foam rubber or fabric.  Make the black tip of the nose out of cotton wool by rolling it into a ball.  Cut a small shred out of a black bag.  Wrap a ball around it.  Screw tight to make a cork.  Secure with tape.  Twist the end into the hole for the nose.  Secure with tape inside.  Here's a charming bear mask made by myself.  You can cut it out of colored paper. </p><p>  This fascinating thing is good to do together with the children.  To make the outfit seem more realistic, complete it with brown trousers and a turtleneck of the same color. </p><h2>  Polar bear mask </h2><p>  If you make such a product, you will really appreciate the little lovers of the cartoon about the Umka bear cub.  You can make a muzzle of a white bear from a regular paper plate.  You will also need cotton wool, white corrugated paper, a plastic cup, a <span>stationery knife,</span> scotch tape, thin elastic, colored paper (black and pink). </p>

Then proceed to the nose.  Cut the holes in the plate with a knife, the diameter of which should be equal to the lower half of the cup.  Take the tape.  Insert the cup into the hole and secure it from the inside.  Tear the corrugated paper into small pieces and crush them.  Cover the mask on the front with shreds.  Make black tip out of black paper.  Draw the ears on the cardboard and cut them out.  Stick on pink paper, and glue corrugated paper over the edges.  Make holes on the sides of the mask and tie the elastic.  Done!  Here's a wonderful mask "Bear".  Complement the look with white clothing, and sew a tail made of cotton wool to the pants.
