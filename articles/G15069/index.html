    <p>  There are very few people in the new complex.  Many are frightened by the tragedy that occurred in another entertainment institution, which was located in this place (Transvaal Park).  February 14, 2004 the room suddenly collapsed.  That day, 28 innocent souls died.  However, despite the fact that there are very few visitors, there are not enough sun loungers - customers complain. </p><h2>  Advice from the administration </h2><p>  On <span>weekdays, the</span> institution starts operating at 10:00 in the morning and receives customers until 22:00.  On weekends, the complex opens earlier - at 9:00.  The ticket price for an adult for the entire shift is 1300 rubles.  For the child will need to pay 1000 rubles.  In the evening - other rates.  The tariffs of the water park from 18:00 until closing are as follows: adults - 1000 rubles, children - 800 rubles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who gathered for the first time in this water park should be aware that they are not allowed into the complex without a bathing suit.  You also need to take beach shoes, a towel and gel or shampoo with you.  Some customers will need a bathrobe and hat.  For children should take arm ruffles and <span>goggles for swimming.</span>  If you forgot one of these things, then on the territory of the institution all this can be rented or bought.  However, guests declare that a certain amount will have to be paid for this service.  Hiring a set of a bathrobe, slippers and towels will cost about 500 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Pearl of the area </h2><p>  In general, there are three metro stations on the <span>territory of Yasenevo</span> .  The nearest stop is just 15 minutes on foot.  But parents say that with small children the road will be longer.  Therefore, if there is an opportunity, it is better to come with the kids by car - this is what guests recommend.  The parking lot at the entertainment center is large, so there are many free spots on weekdays. </p><p>  One of the main buildings of Yasenevo is Marion (water park).  Complex address: st.  Golubinskaya, house 16. The institution itself is visible from afar.  Its large and shining sign is impossible to miss. </p><p>  Visitors are pleased with the camera for changing clothes.  Although many customers note that the booths are small, but there are many, and there are practically no lines.  To the soul, many users had comments.  The water flows now cool, then too hot.  Cranes are hard to set up. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fun start </h2><p>  "Marion" is an average water park.  The slides of this complex passed all the necessary checks.  Here you can find the most popular water attractions.  In particular, the ‚ÄúSpace Plate‚Äù is the first to attract attention.  First, customers overcome the high descent, from which they fall into a huge bowl.  Having made several circles in the middle of the plate, people fall into the pool.  This is actually a fantastic and unforgettable little trip.  But it is worth knowing that there is a great depth under the whirlpool.  Those who cannot swim can be frightened by the lack of a bottom. </p><p>  The maximum of extreme sports and emotions will be given by the Black Hole.  This attraction is a classic of water towns.  Owns this descent and "Marion" (water park).  Yasenevo is located just a few kilometers from the center of Moscow, so everyone can enjoy the descent from this snake.  The daredevils are waiting for a long and rapid fall into a black hole.  The dark tube is characterized by bends and smooth turns.  During the entertainment absolutely nothing is visible.  There is a feeling that the body is falling into the abyss.  You can conquer the mountain together. </p>

    <h2>  Adrenaline jumping </h2><p>  Especially a lot of emotions causes ‚ÄúWing‚Äù.  On an inflatable raft, the most desperate guests fall straight off a cliff.  They claim that many people are scared from insane speed.  However, two visitors are allowed on this attraction at once. </p><p>  The complex of water entertainment "Moreon" offers some fun on another interesting slide.  ‚ÄúBody slide‚Äù is 120 meters of sharp turns and turns.  The movement of a person in a pipe is either accelerated or slowed down.  This is an imitation of a real flight.  The conquerors of this descent are waiting for sharp, long falls and rapid bends. </p><p>  Breathtaking flight on another hill.  "Innertube slide" is a 130 meter yellow labyrinth.  You need to go down on this snake on inflatable rafts.  You can take a double shuttle if the weight of passengers does not exceed 180 kilograms.  The trip is very fast, long and extreme, so guests should be brave. </p><h2>  Fun for parents and children </h2><p>  Marion is a <span>water park in Moscow,</span> and one of the few that cares about collective recreation.  Many of the above slides are suitable for both adults and children.  Another descent, the name of which is ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù, is a wide cascading open snake.

    <p>  Can offer more relaxing entertainment water park.  Slides take a lot of energy.  Hydromassage pools, waterfalls and geysers will recover.  The water temperature in the jacuzzi reaches 35 degrees.  Real fiction is an artificial sea.  Here you can soak in the warm, high waves. </p><h2>  Cons of slides </h2><p>  Fans of water towns claim that the main drawback of these attractions is absolute colorlessness.  All the descents are so safe that even the biggest cowards do not have a sense of fear.  Adrenaline doesn‚Äôt jump here.  Of course, all the slides are available for children, and you can not be afraid that they will harm the kids.  However, adults can be bored.  Many complain that on some slopes there are seams that painfully hit on the back.  Do not like visitors and extremely loud music.  Also, experienced complain that there is a lot of water on the floor.  You can easily fall and hit. </p><p>  One of the most modern complexes in Moscow is Marion (water park).  Yasenevo is not a very large area.  Its population barely exceeds 175,000. Accordingly, the main flow of visitors is from the center of the capital.  By the way, in one day the complex can host 4,000 people.  Of course, such a number of visitors need to be well fed. </p>

    <h2>  Tasty dinners </h2><p>  Very nice kitchen in the complex.  The institution offers two-level food.  Here you can enjoy both hot pizza and delicious sandwiches.  There are also salads, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, cocktails and desserts.  In addition, the town offers a menu that visitors can find on the company's website.  Also, very often the administration arranges promotions and discounts on certain groups of goods. </p><p>  In general, Marion, the water park (Yasenevo), protects the wallets of its customers.  Prices in the complex are quite affordable.  For example, Caesar salad costs 280 rubles, and branded pizza costs 430. However, visitors do not like the fact that the cost of hot drinks is too high.  So, for one cup of coffee you have to spread more than 100 rubles. </p><h2>  Festive banquets </h2><p>  On weekends, visitors recommend buying tickets at 9:00 in the morning.  It is better to end the session before lunch.  Usually after 14 hours on holidays, a lot of people gather in the complex.  Also on the <span>red days of the calendar it is</span> very difficult to order food and find a free table.  Lunch can take up to 50 minutes.  The menu, as guests note, is only light snacks.  However, the food in the cafe is delicious.  And they do not allow taking food with them.  Therefore, parents recommend that they feed the children well before entertainment. </p><p>  Offers entertainment programs for groups of tourists "Marion" (water park).  Yasenevo meets hundreds of visitors every day.  Often in the complex arrange holidays and even corporate meetings.  For companies that plan to have fun and at the same time not spend a huge amount of money, organize special holidays and promotions.  The package of services may include: tickets, table rental for several hours, a solid menu to choose from, and even a photographer or animator.  Usually the program is designed for 6 people.  You will have to pay extra for an extra guest. </p>

    <h2>  Penal system </h2><p>  A lot of supporters have Marion.  Reviews, however, are not only positive, but also negative.  In particular, on weekdays, only one person can stand at the checkout.  Therefore, a queue often arises.  The staff itself is friendly, but sometimes there are indifferent workers. </p><p>  Also, visitors do not like the fact that late for the park has to pay dearly.  Customers who arrive one minute later than the specified time must pay more than 200 rubles in fine.  It should be noted that, regardless of whether you arrived after 5 minutes or after 50 - the tariff is the same.  According to the guests, it would be better if the money was withdrawn per minute. </p><p>  A considerable fine awaits those who have lost a towel or bathrobe.  The bracelet, customers share, holds on to the hand very poorly.  Therefore, you need to ensure that you do not lose it, because you also have to pay for it. </p><h2>  Hellish summer </h2><p>  Constant air temperature - 30 degrees.  Water stands at 29 ¬∞ C.  This is also one of the problems in the hot season.  In the summer, as noted by customers, the smell of bleach is very strongly felt.  Also in the room is a high temperature, and there is nothing to breathe.  Therefore, visitors are especially offended, because on a hot day I really want to get into a cool room with warm water and refresh ourselves from the scorching sun. </p><p>  Many slides go outside.  Therefore, under a hot summer sky, the pipes become very hot, sometimes a funny descent turns into a disaster - visitors share their impressions. </p>
