    <p>  Holidays in Egypt in March can be unpredictable, because at this time of the year the weather here is unstable.  Tourists need to prepare for sandstorms in mid-March.  The Khamsin wind carries sultry air from the desert with thick clouds of dust.  On the street, the thermometer can reach +40 degrees.  Because of this, there are sometimes limited opportunities to go on some excursions.  For example, to Alexandria and Luxor.  Although some argue that March is the most comfortable time for visiting attractions.  The lack of intense heat gives more sightseeing opportunities.  Sandstorms can obscure the rest for only a few days.  Experienced tourists are advised to seize closed clothing for such cases.  Most often, Hamsin storms do not reach the popular resorts of the Red Sea.  Ideal to relax at the end of March.  Sandstorms recede, air heats up and reaches +30, water - up to +24.

    <h2>  Egypt Holidays in March </h2><p>  When planning a vacation in Egypt in March, you can become a witness and participant in the festivities.  In some years, the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad falls on March.  The great Muslim festival is called Mawlid.  On this day in Egypt, a solemn atmosphere reigns.  Magnificent processions pass through the streets, and public readings of the Koran take place in the squares.  The Egyptians also have public holidays in March.  For example, on the 1st of the day, Athletes Day is celebrated in the country, and Mother's Day is celebrated on March 21. </p><p>  And yet it is an amateur - spring Egypt, a vacation in March.  Reviews of tourists in this regard are both positive and negative.  The first decade of the month can be overshadowed by a cold wind from the sea, the end of March - by sandstorms with heat.  Prices vary.  Yes, March is one of the cheapest tourist periods, but right before the spring break for schoolchildren.  The first half of the month is perfect for excursions and entertainment, the second - for a beach holiday.  At the end of March, a full-fledged holiday season is already beginning. </p>
