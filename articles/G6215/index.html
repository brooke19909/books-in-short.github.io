It is believed that this is an analogue of London Hyde Park, designed in the French manner.  In addition, it belongs to the largest parks in the world and plays a very important role for the city - it saturates the metropolis with oxygen. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Forest history </h2><p>  Today, the Bois de Boulogne is just a big beautiful park.  It is called a forest because of tradition.  But once upon a time in this place there really was a huge dense forest - the oak forest of Rouvray.  The first mention of it dates back to 717.  It was then that Childeric II wrote about her in his royal letter. </p>

    <p>  The forest became Boulogne in 1308.  Philip V Beautiful was seriously ill, he made a pilgrimage.  And it was here, in Boulogne-sur-Mer, that he was able to recover from his ailment.  In honor of this joyful event, he ordered the erection of the Church of Our Lady of Boulogne.  Unfortunately, the church was not preserved, but its name was transferred to the forest. </p><p>  Then France was swallowed by the <span>Hundred Years War;</span> it also hit the Bois de Boulogne.  Paris, which was in close proximity, was constantly subjected to raids and ruins of a huge number of thieves and robbers who found refuge in the Bois de Boulogne.  For this reason, a huge stone wall with a gate and a permanent guard was erected around the forest. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This continued until King <span>Francis I</span> built his hunting castle in the forest.  Then the forest was cleared of robbers and ragged, and also laid two large roads through it.  Then Henry of Navarre ordered the planting of <span>mulberry trees</span> here <span>,</span> and the forest turned into a plantation for the production of French silk. </p><p>  Since then, the Bois de Boulogne has not been so wild.  In the XVII century, duels were organized in it, and in the XVIII century, aristocrats walked.  And during the reign of Napoleon III, dying trees were replaced by pines and acacias, paved roads and hiking trails and gave the forest its present look.  As a result, the forest turned into a well-groomed park and became a favorite vacation spot for all of Paris. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Bois de Boulogne today </h2>

    <p>  Entrance to the park is free and around the clock for everyone.  However, access to some attractions and attractions will have to pay.  In addition, these areas of the park work only at certain times.  These include areas for children - the Climatic Garden, Bagatel Park with beautiful floral arrangements, the National Museum of Folk Art and the Hippodrome. </p><p>  The forest is full of all kinds of entertainment: a riding school, bike rental, a bowling alley, boating on the Lower Lake, hiking and much more. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth noting the magnificent Bagatel castle with a rose garden spreading near it.  This castle was built very quickly - in just 2 months.  June is the best time to visit the Bois de Boulogne, photos among the magnificent royal roses of various varieties will undoubtedly become diamonds of your collection.  But at other times of the year you can also see many beautiful plants - tulips, irises, daffodils, water lilies. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Forest structure </h2><ol><li>  Two racecourses: Lonshan and Otei. </li><li>  Climatic park: plants, menagerie, playgrounds for children and a museum. </li><li>  Bagatel Park and Palace with a huge rose garden. </li><li>  Museum of Folk Art. </li><li>  Pre-Catalan Park with an ancient bicentennial beech. </li><li>  Upper and Lower Lakes. </li></ol><h2></h2><h2>  Boulogne Forest <span>Nightlife</span> </h2>

    <p>  The forest has always been a great place for secret love meetings.  There was even a saying among the people that marriages in the Bois de Boulogne are concluded in the absence of a priest. </p><p>  Today, illegal alliances are also concluded here.  With the onset of darkness, many "night butterflies" flock to the forest from all over Paris, and men also come by car in search of "something unusual."  And the beautiful park alleys that children walk around during the day turn into a real open-air brothel at night!  Thus, inexperienced tourists who want to take a walk in the Bois de Boulogne in the evening will have many dangerous surprises. </p>
