    <h2>  Russia in the period of feudal fragmentation </h2><p>  In some principalities and estates, rapid growth of cities began, trade relations with the Baltic states and Germans began to form and develop.  Changes in local culture were also noticeable: chronicles were created, new structures were erected, and so on. </p><h2>  Large regions of the country </h2><p>  There were several large principalities in the state.  Such, in particular, can be considered Chernihiv, Kiev, Seversk.  However, the three <span>regions</span> were considered the largest <span>: the Galicia-Volyn</span> in the south-west, the Novgorod and Vladimir-Suzdal principality in the north-east.  These were the main political centers of the state of that time.  It is worth noting that they all had their own distinctive features.  Next, let's talk about what were the features of the Novgorod principality. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The sources from which the development of the Novgorod Principality began are still not entirely clear.  The oldest mention of the main city in the region dates back to the year 859.  However, it is assumed that at that time the chroniclers did not use weather records (they appeared by the 10-11th century), but collected those legends that were most popular among the people.  After Russia adopted the Byzantine tradition of composing legends, the authors had to compose stories, independently estimating the dates, before the weather records began.  Of course, such dating is far from accurate, so you should not completely trust it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Principality of Novgorod" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579827.jpg" width="550"></div>

Archaeologists have found three settlements located on the territory occupied by the Principality of Novgorod.  The geographical location of these areas is indicated in one of the annals.  According to information, the region was located on the left bank of the Volkhov River (where the Kremlin is now located). </p><p>  Over time, the settlements merged into one.  Residents built a common fortress.  She received the name of Novgorod.  Researcher Nosov developed the already existing point of view that the Settlement was the historical predecessor of the new city.  It was located somewhat higher, not far from the sources of Volkhov.  Judging by the chronicles, the Settlement was a fortified settlement.  The princes of the Novgorod principality and their governors were in it.  Local local historians even expressed a bold assumption that Rurik himself lived in the residence.  Given all this, it can be argued that the principality of Novgorod went from this settlement.  The geographical location of the site can be considered an additional argument.  It stood on the Baltic-Volga route and was considered at that time to be a fairly large trade-craft and military-administrative center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Principality of Novgorod land" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579826.jpg" width="472"></div>

Novgorod was completely wooden.  It was located on two sides of the river, which was quite unique, since usually the settlements were on a hill and on one bank.  The first residents built their houses near the water, but not close to it, due to fairly frequent floods.  The streets of the city were built perpendicular to Volkhov.  A little later they were connected by ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù lanes that ran parallel to the river.  The Kremlin walls rose from the left bank.  At that time it was much smaller than the one that stands in Novgorod now.  On the other side in the Slovenian village there were estates and a princely court. </p><h2>  Russian annals </h2><p>  The Principality of Novgorod is mentioned in the records quite a bit.  However, this little information is of particular value.  The annals dated 882 tell of <span>Prince Oleg</span> ‚Äôs <span>campaign in Kiev</span> from Novgorod.  As a result, two East Slavic large tribes united: the Polyans and the Ilmen Slavs.  It is from that time that the history of the Old Russian State begins.  Records of the year 912 indicate that the Principality of Novgorod paid the Scandinavians 300 hryvnias a year for peacekeeping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novgorod and Vladimir Suzdal principality" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579825.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Records of other peoples </h2><p>  The Principality of Novgorod is also mentioned in the Byzantine chronicles.  So, for example, Emperor Constantine VII wrote about Russes in the 10th century.  The Scandinavian sagas also featured the Novgorod Principality.  The earliest legends have appeared since the reign of the sons of Svyatoslav.  After his death, a struggle for power broke out between his two sons Oleg and Yaropolk.  In 977, a battle took place.  As a result, Yaropolk defeated Oleg‚Äôs troops and became the Grand Duke, planting his posadniks in Novgorod.  There was a third brother.  But fearing to be killed, Vladimir fled to Scandinavia.  However, his absence was relatively short-lived.  In 980, he returned to the Novgorod principality with hired Vikings.  Then he defeated the posadniks and moved to Kiev.  There Vladimir overthrew Yaropolk from the throne and became the Prince of Kiev. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of the Novgorod principality" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579824.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Religion </h2><p>  The characteristic of the Novgorod principality will be incomplete, if not to speak about the significance of faith in the life of the people.  In 989, a baptism occurred.  At first it was in Kiev, and then in Novgorod.  Power increased at the expense of the Christian religion and its monotheism.  Church organization was built on a hierarchical basis.  It has become a powerful tool for the development of Russian statehood.  In the year of baptism, Joachim Korsunyanin (Byzantine priest) was sent to Novgorod.  But I must say that Christianity did not immediately take root.  Many residents were in no hurry to part with the faith of their ancestors.  According to archaeological excavations, many pagan rites survived until the 11-13th centuries.  And, for example, Maslenitsa is celebrated today.  Although this holiday is given a somewhat Christian coloring. </p><h2>  Activities of Yaroslav </h2><p>  After Vladimir became prince of Kiev, he sent his son Vysheslav to Novgorod, and after his death, Yaroslav.  The name of the latter is an attempt to get rid of the influence of Kiev.  So, in 1014, Yaroslav refused to pay tribute.  Vladimir, learning about this, began to assemble a squad, but in the course of preparation he suddenly died.  Svyatopolk the Accursed ascended the throne.  He killed his brothers: Svyatoslav Drevlyansky and subsequently numbered Saints Gleb and Boris.  Yaroslav was in a rather difficult position.  On the one hand, he was absolutely not opposed to seizing power in Kiev.  But on the other - his squad was not strong enough.  Then he decided to address the Novgorodians with a speech.  Yaroslav called on the people to capture Kiev, thus returning to himself everything that had been selected as tribute.  Residents agreed, and after some time in the battle of Lubech, Svyatopolk was defeated and fled to Poland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="development of the Novgorod principality" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579823.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <h2>  Further developments </h2><p>  In 1018, together with the squad of Boleslav (his father-in-law and the King of Poland), Svyatopolk returned to Russia.  In the battle, they defeated thoroughly Yaroslav (he fled with four combatants from the field).  He wanted to go to Novgorod, and then planned to move to Scandinavia.  But the inhabitants did not let him do it.  They chopped down all the rooks, raised money and a new army, enabling the prince to continue to fight.  At this time, confident that he was firmly enough on the throne, Svyatopolk quarreled with the Polish king.  Deprived of support, he lost the battle in Alta.  After the battle, Yaroslav released the Novgorodians home, giving them special letters - "Truth" and "Charter."  According to them they had to live.  Over the next decades, the Principality of Novgorod also depended on Kiev.  First, as governor, Yaroslav sent his son Ilya.  Then he sent Vladimir, who in 1044 laid the fortress.  The following year, at his command, the construction of a new stone cathedral was started instead of the wooden Sophia Cathedral (which burned down).  Since that time, this temple has symbolized Novgorod spirituality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="princes of the Novgorod principality" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/579822.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <h2>  Political system </h2><p>  It took shape gradually.  There are two periods in history.  In the first there was a feudal republic, where the prince ruled.  And in the second, the administration belonged to the oligarchy.  During the first period in the Principality of Novgorod there were all the main bodies of state power.  Higher institutions were considered the Boyar Council and the Council.  The executive power was vested in the thousand and princely courts, the Posadnik, the elders, volostel and the volostel governors.  Veche was of particular importance.  It was considered the supreme power and possessed more power here than in other principalities.  Veche resolved issues of domestic and foreign policy character, expelled or elected the ruler, Posad and other officials.  It was also the highest court.  Another body was the Council of Boyars.  The whole city management system was concentrated in this body.  The Council was attended by: eminent boyars, elders, thousands, posadniks, archbishop and prince.  The power of the ruler himself was significantly limited in functions and scope, but at the same time, of course, he occupied a leading place in the governing bodies.  First, the candidacy of the future prince was discussed at the Council of Boyars.  After that, he was invited to sign a contract of deed.  It regulated the legal and state status and duties of the authorities in relation to the ruler.  The prince lived with his court in the suburbs of Novgorod.  The ruler had no right to legislate, proclaim war or peace.  Together with the posadnik, the prince commanded an army.  Existing restrictions did not allow the rulers to gain a foothold in the city and put them in a controlled position. </p>
