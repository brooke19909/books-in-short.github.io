  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Video Programs: An Overview of the Best</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It would seem that choosing a program for video communication over the Internet is not a problem.  But as soon as it comes to some additional functionality like recording a conversation, streaming or adding a dozen interlocutors to the conference, problems begin, as well as the search for software that meets such requests. </p><p>  There are a lot of programs on a PC for video communication on the Web, and all of them are attractive in their own way, promise the user wide functionality, stable operation and a lot of additional chips.  But in a good half of such utilities, auxiliary, and sometimes even key features are implemented, as they say, for show.  So choosing a decent video calling program for a computer or smartphone is quite difficult. </p><p>  The choice is further complicated by the fact that it is very difficult to please each user, and especially the advanced one.  One video-communication program, for example, has a well-implemented streaming function on YouTube, but it has terribly shown itself in a screen demonstration.  The venerable developers prefer to concentrate on more versatile products that can do almost everything.  While others devote time to specialized software designed to perform some specific tasks. </p><p>  We will try to understand this issue and designate the best video communication programs that have distinguished themselves by their quality component, effective work and a large number of positive feedback from users.  All the software described below can be downloaded on the official resources of the developers, there, as a rule, there are instructions, manuals and other educational information.  So there should not be problems with testing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Skype </h2><p>  Today, Skype is one of the <span>most popular programs</span> for video communications.  Its popularity is largely due to the fact that he became one of the first video messengers for the PC and is almost a synonym for this type of communication. </p><div class="photo" data-original="neurogadget.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="skype program" class="if uuid-2661676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2661676.jpg"></div><p>  The product is distributed free of charge and it‚Äôs not necessary to get acquainted with the instructions for work, because the program interface is simple and intuitive.  Even a novice in this business will deal with him.  In addition, the program for video communications has received an intelligent master assistant who will guide you through all the vicious places of the utility. </p><p>  But here it is necessary to clarify that only calls to a computer or mobile device where Skype is already installed are free.  Recently, they have not taken money for group video conferences either.  True, with some restrictions: no more than ten hours a day and 100 hours a month.  It is also worth noting that Skype is teeming with advertising, which you can disable by buying a paid subscription. </p><h2>  Features of the video messenger </h2><p>  In the latest versions of the video communications program, support for high resolution in the spread is implemented - 1280 by 720. Users have repeatedly criticized Skype for their ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù image, and the developer finally listened to them, making the necessary changes.  Naturally, for such a resolution, you will need the appropriate equipment that supports HD-sweep. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.skype.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skype video calling" class="if uuid-2661677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2661677.jpg"></div><p>  Voice or video recording is possible, but only after installing certain plugins.  The developers officially approved the third-party plug-in products Amolto <span>Call Recorder,</span> CallTrunk and Pamela.  So problems with recording content, as a rule, do not arise. </p><p>  Also pleasing are the system requirements of Skype.  For the application to work correctly, a simple dual-core processor, 2 GB of RAM and an Internet channel at a speed of 512 Kbps are enough. </p><h2>  Viber </h2><p>  The product has gained wildly popularity over the past few years.  The application may not be so in demand among PC users, but a good half of the owners of mobile gadgets consider Viber the best video communication program for Android.  In general, a large half of those who sit behind the monitor screen install this product just to call friends and acquaintances on smartphones and tablets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viber.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="viber for pc" class="if uuid-2661678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2661678.jpg"></div><p>  Also, this video calling program for the phone perfectly proved to be a simple messenger.  Using it, you can send not only standard messages, but also pictures, videos and other content that cannot be sent by ordinary SMS-kami. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Product Highlights </h2><p>  As for video conferencing, here such functionality is not provided in principle.  The program interface itself is simple, dealing with it will not be difficult.  Especially on the official website of the developer there is a detailed instruction in both text and video format. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vtv24h.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="viber for android" class="if uuid-2661679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2661679.jpg"></div><p>  Users, in particular the owners of mobile gadgets, are very positive about Viber and its capabilities.  Of course, it could not do without the ubiquitous advertising, but it is not as aggressive as in the same Skype, and does not pop up at every step. </p><h2>  Hangouts </h2><p>  Surely someone else remembers and, perhaps, even still uses the clumsy and working through time messenger Google Talk.  Hangouts is its successor and, as expected, serious work on bugs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thedroidguy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="google video messenger" class="if uuid-2661680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2661680.jpg"></div><p>  PC owners can safely use the product through a web interface with plugins installed.  Chromium users have this opportunity immediately.  Just log in to your Gmail account. </p><p>  You can start work directly from the mail client or from the Google Plus service.  The product allows you to organize a video conference for no more than ten interlocutors, keep some notes during a conversation, show a screen, and also stream to YouTube.  The program has a lot of functions, so the first one can be confusing.  Fortunately, there is an intelligent master assistant who will save you from familiarizing yourself with an impressive manual, and will guide you through the main tools in the shortest possible time. </p><p>  Users mostly respond positively to this video messenger, especially those with the main mail registered in the Gmail service.  Some communication problems on PCs with mobile platforms do occur, but this is only a rare exception than the rule.  And the reason for this, as a rule, is the excess of browser plug-ins on the desktop. </p><h2>  ooVoo </h2><p>  The program may not be as popular as the products described above, but the reason for this is not its functionality and effectiveness.  If we compare this software with Skype, then here we see almost a twin, in no way inferior to the untwisted product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oovoo.en.softonic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="oovoo program" class="if uuid-2661681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2661681.jpg"></div><p>  The program offers the user the organization of sensible video chat for 12 people and voice calls for three people.  It is also worth noting the presence of a built-in function for recording telephone conversations or video. </p><p>  The product performed very well on mobile devices.  The only opportunity to switch between interlocutors is what it costs.  The quality of the picture did not disappoint.  Full HD resolution at the output is pleasing to the eye and allows you to properly consider the details, which is especially important for those who often use the screen demonstration. </p><h2>  Program features </h2><p>  As such, the restrictions for ordinary consumers are invisible, but advanced users can get rid of them through a paid subscription.  The product is in many ways good and even surpasses its older brother Skype in some respects, but the developer pays too little attention to the promotion of the project, so some users have never heard of ooVoo at all. </p><p>  Consumers are very positive about this program.  She is in many ways good and has enviable functionality.  In addition, as such, the entry threshold is practically absent here: the interface is very simple and understandable, anyone can figure it out.  Yes, and competent instructions, on the official website of the developer, are enough.  So there should not be problems with development. </p><h2>  ICQ </h2><p>  The good old ‚ÄúICQ‚Äù is still in use and is not inferior to beginners.  Over the past few years, the program has changed several hosts, and the latter literally gave new life to the project.  The engine was updated, as a result of which full-fledged support for both voice and video communications was implemented, which was earlier more likely for show. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="icq video calling" class="if uuid-2661684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2661684.jpg"></div><p>  The program interface has been significantly simplified, a good half of the tool is, so to speak, in an intuitive zone.  So the entry threshold has fallen almost to zero.  It is also worth noting that the video sequence is in resolution of 640 by 480 pixels.  For ordinary video calls, this is more than enough, but computers, alas, are no longer there to demonstrate the screen. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the program </h2><p>  Nevertheless, the product‚Äôs undemanding system resources, a free distribution license and the absence of aggressive advertising made it very popular.  In addition, the brand name of the past ‚ÄúAsek‚Äù remained here - icons, emoticons, emoji and other decorations delight with its variety and accessibility. </p><p>  Users mostly respond positively about this messenger and do not note any critical flaws.  ‚ÄúICQ‚Äù has become noticeably more beautiful, more functional and more stable than previous generations, and albeit slowly, but still gaining its former popularity. </p>
