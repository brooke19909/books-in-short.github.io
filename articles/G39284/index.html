That is, purely theoretically it can be calculated that events of such a plan are arranged only in even years.  And if in 2014 the Olympics was winter, then the next, already summer, will be held in 2016.

They are painted in yellow, blue, black, red and green. </p><p>  First of all, we note that the rings of the Olympic Games symbolize the five continents of the planet: America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania.  Why is it so, because the globe consists of six?  The fact is that the Antarctic and the Arctic, due to their uninhabitation, were not taken into account when developing the symbol. </p><p>  Ah these rings of the Olympic Games!  What they mean was invented a little later.  Today, even schoolchildren can talk about the fact that every part of the world is associated with its own specific color scheme.

Their arrangement is a bit similar to the traditional one due to the fact that the first, third and fifth of them were raised compared to the second and fourth. </p><p>  Secondly, both the rings and the eagle holding them were made in black and white.  In subsequent years, the monochrome version of the logo of the Olympic Games was used quite often, but the location was no longer changed. </p><p>  In 1960, in Italy, artists made a <span>symbol of the Olympic</span> Games - rings - voluminous.  It was made in gray.  The rings were located under the Roman she-wolf, who, according to legend, nourished Romulus and Remus, who founded Rome.  By the way, in that year a new tradition was introduced - to hang medals on the neck of athletes. </p><p>  The Mexicans, who hosted the Games in 1968, approached the creation of the Olympic logo no less creatively.  This time, as a symbol of the Olympic Games, the rings were inscribed in the inscription "Mexico City-68" and highlighted in color.  The lower rings were part of the figure 68. </p><h2>  Section 5.

    <p>  A small technical incident with rings occurred at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in 2014 in Sochi (Russia). </p><p>  According to the plan, during the show, large snowflakes hanging over the Fisht Stadium were to be transformed into Olympic rings.  But only four were revealed.  One ring remained hanging a snowflake. </p><p>  However, Russian viewers did not see this hitch, as the organizers a little earlier than the rest understood what was happening, and broadcasted footage from the rehearsal. </p><p>  During the closing of the Olympic Games, this incident with an unopened ring was ironically beaten.  At the beginning of the ceremony, the participants in the show formed a composition with five rings and one snowflake, which after a few seconds quickly opened. </p><h2>  Section 6.

The Olympic flame is a symbol of purity, the struggle for victory and self-improvement.  It was first lit in 1928.  The torch for the transfer of the torch to the city where the Game is held, began to be held in 1936. </li><li>  <em>Medals.</em>  For the first place, the athlete is awarded a gold medal, for the second - silver, for the third - bronze.  They are awarded to winners after the competition at a special ceremony. </li><li>  <em>The motto</em> "Citius, Altius, Fortius" can be translated into Russian as "Faster, Higher, Stronger."  For the first time, these words were said by priest Henri Martin Didon during the opening of a college sporting event.  Coubertin thought that this phrase perfectly reflects the essence of the Olympic Games. </li><li>  <em>The oath</em> according to which the participants of the Games must respect and abide by the established rules.  Its text was written by Pierre de Coubertin and first sounded in 1920. </li><li>  <em>The Olympic principle was</em> also defined by Pierre de Coubertin in 1896.  It says that in the Olympics, as in life, the main thing is not victory, but participation. </li><li>  <em>The opening ceremony of the games</em> is the most solemn part.  It hosts a parade of athletes from all countries participating in competitions.  The first is the Greek team, then the teams of countries according to the alphabet, and the last is the team of the country organizing the Games. </li></ul><h2>  Section 7.

    <p>  On the logos of the Olympic Games, the year is usually written in four or two digits (Athens 2004 or Barcelona 92).  In the entire history of the Games, only once in 1960 in Rome was the year written in five letters (MCMLX). </p><p>  During the Great Depression in 1932, the Brazilian government did not find the money to send its delegation to the Los Angeles Olympic Games.  As a result, 82 Brazilian athletes were put on a ship with coffee in order to bring them to America with the proceeds.  When the ship arrived at the port of San Pedro, its leaders demanded to pay one dollar for each person who went ashore.  Only those who had a chance to get a medal were lowered from the ship.  He then went to San Francisco to sell coffee and was able to drop a few more athletes, but 15 athletes returned back to Brazil. </p><p>  In 1956, the Summer Olympics was held in Melbourne, which could not accept some sports.  Australian quarantine regulations prohibited the import of horses, and equestrian competitions had to be held in Stockholm. </p><h2>  Section 8. Let's look into the future </h2>
