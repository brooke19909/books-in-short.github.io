Probably, there is not a single Russian who did not rest or at least did not know about Lazarevsky, a small microdistrict of the city of Sochi.  And if you are already thinking about relaxing in this wonderful resort, then read on soon!  This article will help you find out about the most popular Lazarev <span>resorts and pensions and</span> choose the most comfortable option. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.9150254" data-lng="39.33339169999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/8/1/1681.png"></div><h2>  Pensions on the coast </h2><p>  Pension "Grenada" - in Lazarevsky, perhaps the most famous.  What does it attract tourists with? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotel-elizabeth.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The main promenade of Lazarevsky" class="if uuid-2342445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2342445.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps the main plus of this guesthouse is its own beach, to which guests of Grenada can get by free shuttle service.  The beach is clean, spacious and everyone will find something to their liking: there is a rental of jet skis, hydrobikes and aquabikes.  Near the boarding house there are a dolphinarium, an aquarium, an aqua park, a market, a central square and an embankment.  In addition, guests are provided with a wide range of services included in the price of the ticket: billiards room, tennis court, library, sports grounds and gym. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel is suitable for both business people and families with children: Grenada has a fully-equipped conference room with 200 seats, and for the smallest, animators work every day, there are playgrounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otelyug.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="central Street" class="if uuid-2342461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2342461.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel "Surf" </h2><p>  For tourists with children, this wonderful hotel is located on the first line from the sea.  The hotel provides babysitting services and a children's animator, which, of course, can help to fully enjoy the rest of both parents and children.  It is also important that smoking is prohibited throughout the hotel.  Pets are also allowed.  The hotel's beach is equipped with a pier, so you can enjoy boat trips.  A professional beauty salon, three restaurants, <span>Lazarevsky park of culture and rest</span> and even the largest Ferris wheel in Russia - all this and much more is within walking distance of the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Priboy in Lazarevsky" class="if uuid-2342457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2342457.jpg"></div><h2>  Pensions in Lazarevsky "All inclusive" </h2><p>  Prometheus Club, one of the largest guest houses in Lazarevsky, was the first in Russia to introduce the All Inclusive catering system, but this is far from the only advantage of the hotel.  The boarding house has a large number of pools, including a heated indoor pool, a children's outdoor heated pool with sea water and hydromassage.  A variety of wellness and spa treatments, a climbing wall, an amusement park, group aerobics classes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The beach adjacent to the hotel has everything you need for diving, boat trips and other water activities, such as a catamaran, parachute and bananas.  This is by no means a complete list of what boarding house guests can enjoy. </p><h2>  Pension "Veya" in Lazarevsky </h2><p>  Pension "Veya" is located in a unique environmentally friendly area near the city of Sochi, or rather, in a small place <span>Anchor Slit.</span>  <span>This</span> family-friendly <span>guesthouse is</span> perfect for a quiet and measured vacation with children.  On the territory there are new buildings, completely surrounded by greenery and orchard.  It is also worth noting the fact that near the boarding house lies the mouth of the river, in which children often swim and fish. </p><p>  The local service is at a very good level.  The boarding house is equipped with several pools, sun loungers and umbrellas, the territory has its own playground, ample parking for cars, as well as a relaxation area in the garden.  Men and women can regularly visit the gym and perform exercises on various muscle groups.  For entertainment, there are billiards, sports fields and tennis tables. </p><p>  The beach is within walking distance from the boarding house, the estimated time spent by vacationers is 10-15 minutes.  Tourists also enjoy regular transportation to and from the beach. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Turquoise" </h2><p>  Among the many Lazarevsky sanatoriums and boarding houses, it is impossible not to pay attention to Biryuza, since the location of this hotel can be called ideal.  "Turquoise" is located between the ridges of the Caucasus Mountains and the Black Sea, to which hotel residents can walk in less than 10 minutes.  This is a real Black Sea health resort, because it is here that you can attend sessions of laser therapy, phototherapy, magnetotherapy and even inhalation.  Group exercises on exercise therapy and aerobics are held. </p><p>  Great for relaxing with a course of wellness treatments.  Adults and children will be delighted. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Odyssey" </h2><p>  Another wonderful Lazarev pension.  People who relaxed here celebrate excellent food, because among the proposed variety, everyone will find something to their taste.  However, the hotel is not very suitable for families with children, since there is only 1 children's pool for entertainment for younger children.  But adults will certainly appreciate the availability of computers in the rooms, the pedestrian availability of a pebble beach, an indoor pool, a gym, medical procedures and much more.  The sanatorium is located in the middle of the park, and the air in it is even considered healing during the flowering of some plants.  Near the sanatorium there are several restaurants and a bar, so you are sure to find something to do for a romantic southern evening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--e1agiku.xn--d1acj3b" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium Odyssey in Lazarevsky" class="if uuid-2342453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2342453.jpg"></div><h2>  Sanatorium "Moneron" </h2><p>  Moneron is a slightly more economical option.  The resort is located on the third coastline.  However, the main thing at Moneron is not the beach and not the entertainment, but the treatment.  The main areas are skin diseases, as well as diseases of the genitourinary system and musculoskeletal system.  Nevertheless, for leisure, the hotel has everything you need: billiards, tennis, a disco, chess and a sauna.  Guests of the sanatorium can choose among a huge list of services and procedures, including the most unusual ones.  For example, pearl baths, thalassotherapy and even aeroionophytotherapy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn----7sbbd2c2afpc1g.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Sea coast" class="if uuid-2342450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2342450.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, in Lazarevsky you can find a boarding house for every taste and budget, because the variety is really huge.  Well, we were happy to tell you about the most interesting and popular places in Lazarevsky, among which you will definitely find what suits you. </p>
