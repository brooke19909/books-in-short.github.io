    <h2>  By car </h2><p>  Traveling Moscow - St. Petersburg by car is best done in the summer and on May holidays, if the weather is favorable for walking.  The road along the Leningrad highway from the capital to St. Petersburg takes about 10 hours.  If you want to overcome the path quickly and without problems, it is better to hit the road at night. </p><p>  It is best to pre-book apartments on a specialized site.  You can rent housing directly at the <span>Moscow station,</span> where the owners offer it directly.  The latter option is suitable for trips on weekdays, but on holidays it will be quite difficult to find a decent apartment in this way. </p><h2>  What to see along the road </h2><p>  <span>The M10 highway</span> passes through the territory of four regions: Moscow, Tver, Novgorod and Leningrad.  Along the way, the car passes through the cities of Klin, Solnechnogorsk and Vyshny Volochek. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the way, you can admire the beauties of the Russian forest and visit interesting places where you can relax, eat and see sights, such as the Valdai Heights, Novgorod Sophia Cathedral, <span>Goat Museums in Tver</span> and bells in Valdai, the Tsarskoye Selo historical reserve in Pushkin, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Difficulties on the road </h2><p>  The hardest part for motorists is in Vyshny Volochyok.  During the day you can find yourself in a huge traffic jam, the reason for the formation of which are large wagons.  Another place where you can easily get stuck is located 150 km from Moscow. </p><p>  The rest of the route is easy enough, despite the traffic and the presence of a huge amount of freight transport.  At the same time, it is not recommended to forget about caution and exercise increased care. </p><p>  First of all, you should fix all the car‚Äôs problems so that you don‚Äôt have to stand in the ‚Äúclean field‚Äù for hours waiting for help, as there are very few technical assistance stations on the M10 highway.  In addition, traffic rules should be strictly observed, and if it is a night trip, stock up on a collection of driving music or ask fellow travelers to chat with the driver, replacing each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
