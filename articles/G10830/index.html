And many manufacturers of equipment are trying to create some special devices for the implementation of the task.  Conventional vacuum cleaners have been replaced by mini-robots.  For example, Irobot Roomba 880. Reviews about this product are gaining momentum every day.  And so now we have to figure out what constitutes this miracle of technology.  Maybe this is really a good item?  Or is it better to use the most ordinary vacuum cleaner for now? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irobot roomba 880 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116165.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  General views </h2><p>  To begin with, it‚Äôs worth figuring out what we will deal with.  The Irobot Roomba 880 robot vacuum cleaner, reviews of which will be presented to our attention, is a completely new word in cleaning.  A wonderful gift for housewives and mothers with young children. </p><p>  Why?  The thing is that this creation is a round compact vacuum cleaner with automatic control.  In other words, automatic.  A silent device that rides on the floor and cleans.  In any case, this is how Irobot Roomba 880 can be generally characterized. Reviews about these products leave mixed reviews.  But this was to be expected.  After all, such innovations are always skeptical.  Is a small robot capable of handling house cleaning !? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Control </h2><p>  If you believe the numerous opinions about the device, then yes, it is.  Our today's technology can really clean the room.  But how?  Manufacturers assure - Irobot Roomba 880, reviews of which are left mixed, will do everything himself.  You only need to set the cleaning settings. </p><p>  Consumers are generally satisfied with the management.  There are two options: either use a special remote control, or configure settings based on the device.  In the first case, you will have to control the Irobot Roomba 880 yourself.  Like a <span>typewriter on the radio.</span>  In the second - to leave the robot at the so-called base and go about their business.  He will independently carry out cleaning, according to the parameters set.  And this, of course, pleases many.  It turns out that now you don‚Äôt have to waste time cleaning! </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  For its capabilities, the Irobot Roomba 880 reviews also earns quite positive.  We can‚Äôt say that they are beautiful, but they cannot be called terrible either.  What can this device do? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="robot vacuum cleaner irobot roomba 880 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116164.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Of course, clean.  Room cleaning is the main task of the robot.  This fact pleases buyers.  Especially those who have small children.  This device, according to consumers, greatly simplifies life. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next opportunity is to independently overcome obstacles.  If during operation the vacuum cleaner stumbles on furniture, it will go round it without assistance.  And he will continue cleaning.  Also quite an interesting feature that delights the public. </p><p>  In addition, many buyers claim that the main difference between this robot and a conventional vacuum cleaner (if you do not take into account the examples already given) is the presence of a digital indicator of the fullness of the dust bag.  That is, the device will inform you that it needs cleaning.  As practice shows, this process must be carried out every 2-3 months on average. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  What features does the Irobot Roomba 880 robot vacuum cleaner have in general?  It‚Äôs good when you already have a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe technique.  But without characteristics, it makes no sense.  Perhaps it is much easier to purchase a conventional vacuum cleaner? </p><p>  Buyers note that in terms of specifications, the Irobot Roomba 880, reviews of which are left quite often, is really worthy of attention.  As already mentioned, he has a remote control.  In addition, in this miracle of technology there is a dry cleaning mode, a fine filter and <span>ultrasonic sensors.</span>  Also, the robot is equipped with a side brush, which provides a full cleaning process. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner irobot roomba 880 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116166.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the robot vacuum cleaner is charging for about 180 minutes.  And with all this, it works on the battery for about 1.5 hours.  Irobot Roomba 880 customer reviews in this regard are already mixed.  On the one hand, the specified battery life is enough for cleaning.  But on the other hand, not everyone believes that one and a half hours can cope with this process.  However, this feature does not spoil the overall impression of the device. </p><p>  Also, the robot vacuum cleaner has a work timer, programming by day of the week and a cleaning time limit.  This means that you yourself can set the duration of the process.  After the specified time, the device will return to the base for recharging.  All this causes great delight among buyers. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the scope of delivery of the device.  The Irobot Roomba 880, reviews and specifications of which are presented in the article, is a completely new gadget.  And few people know in what configuration it should be delivered. </p><p>  In the box with the device, as users note, you will find: </p><ul><li>  a robot; </li><li>  charging base; </li><li>  <span>power cable</span> ; </li><li>  remote control with 2 batteries; </li><li>  quick start guide; </li><li>  complete user manual; </li><li>  filter element (it is spare); </li><li>  2 virtual walls; </li><li>  2 sets of batteries. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irobot roomba 880 customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116167.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  In principle, that‚Äôs all.  So far, there have been no violations in picking when making purchases.  Nevertheless, consumers are advised to always check for the presence of certain elements during a transaction.  Just in case.  By the way, Irobot Roomba 880 has instructions in Russian.  And it is included in the package.  It pleases Russian buyers.  You won‚Äôt have to figure out how to use the device for a long time. </p><h2>  How to use </h2><p>  Do not forget that the ease of handling this or that technique makes it very popular.  And in our case this is really so.  Irobot Roomba 880 user manual and reviews only please.  There is nothing complicated in controlling a robot. </p><p>  What should be done?  Insert the batteries into the remote control, turn on the charging base in the outlet.  Place it so that it is convenient for the robot to start cleaning from the selected point.  Now just put the Irobot Roomba 880 on the base and press the power button.  Wait for the device to charge.  Although at this time you can set the cleaning parameters.  Consumers say that it‚Äôs worth turning to a robot (there are suitable buttons on it), as well as to the charging base itself. </p><p>  Select the necessary parameters, save them and wait for the device to charge.  After this happens, the robot will start working according to the set cleaning settings.  That's all - the problems are solved.  Such ease of use forces buyers to leave only positive reviews about the Irobot Roomba 880. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  But, nevertheless, there are negative points that consumers note.  There are not many of them, but they have a place to be.  And some are able to simply push away from buying this equipment. </p><p>  For example, despite the fact that the Irobot Roomba 880 has a simple user manual, and the robot itself surprises with its capabilities and characteristics, the audience remains unhappy with it.  And the reason for all this is the overpriced cost of a vacuum cleaner.  Yes, this is a completely new word in cleaning, but still, for most buyers, this moment is not fun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irobot roomba 880 reviews and specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116168.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On average, the Irobot Roomba 880 vacuum cleaner, reviews of which are often encouraging, will cost us 40-50 thousand rubles.  Frankly, it is very expensive.  Unfortunately, our robot has no analogues today.  Unless an ordinary vacuum cleaner.  So you have to either put up with the huge cost, or use outdated methods of cleaning the premises.  But maybe it makes sense to give such money for a technique that will greatly facilitate life?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  Quality of work </h2><p>  And the main role here is played by the quality of cleaning.  In this sense, the robot vacuum cleaner Irobot Roomba 880 reviews from its customers makes quite mixed.  It is extremely difficult to understand how this device copes with its task. </p><p>  Why is this so?  The whole problem is what most buyers say - the product perfectly cleans smooth surfaces.  For example, linoleum or laminate.  The tile also lends itself well to dry cleaning carried out by Irobot Roomba 880. But this robot does not clean very well carpet surfaces.  This is what many consumers emphasize.  Indeed, in most apartments you have to devote a huge proportion of your time to cleaning rugs and carpets. </p><p>  However, sometimes you can find reviews that claim that Irobot Roomba even works great on carpeted surfaces.  What is there to believe?  Your intuition.  In most cases, our vacuum cleaner does not really do very well with carpet cleaning.  Especially when you consider the high cost of the device.  If your home has almost no carpeting, then it‚Äôs really worth considering buying a robot vacuum cleaner.  Otherwise, buyers are advised to refrain from this step. </p><p>  Another drawback of the device is the small cord for recharging.  If you choose work "from the network", then the cleaning area will be terribly limited.  This does not suit many, because manufacturers promise that the whole house will be cleaned quickly and without problems.  And short wires do not give such an opportunity. </p><h2>  What good </h2><p>  But not in vain, after all, the Irobot Roomba 880 robot vacuum cleaner reviews it makes good in large quantities, right?  So, there is something in this device that attracts customers.  In addition to ease of handling and automatic cleaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irobot roomba 880 instruction in Russian" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116169.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Indeed, there are such moments.  Customers are pleased that cleaning will not be so noisy now.  After all, the vacuum cleaner works not only automatically, but also silently.  A huge plus for which you really sometimes have to pay. </p><p>  In addition, many claim that it is very interesting for them to monitor how the device is cleaned.  It makes circular motions and moves randomly.  With all this, collecting all the garbage. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the Irobot Roomba 880 is a great assistant in cleaning non-carpet coatings.  On all surfaces, all dust and all debris will be cleaned efficiently and quickly.  Of course, this attracts consumers.  Plus, when cleaning, dust will not spread around the house.  All this thanks to the special filters available in the work. </p><h2>  Instead of a brush </h2><p>  Irobot Roomba 880, the reviews and specifications of which were presented to our attention today, has another feature.  She pleases many pet owners.  Despite the fact that the robot as a whole does not clean carpets in a very high quality, it copes with the wool of our smaller brothers with a bang. </p><p>  And this, of course, attracts the public.  In particular, as already mentioned, mothers with young children.  Often Irobot Roomba 880 is used as a device for cleaning wool and dust.  Yes, a little expensive, but in the case when children have a tendency to allergies, it's worth it.  It is possible to clean furniture and floors from wool.  Just make sure that the device does not fall from a height. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Irobot Roomba 880 reviews get mostly good.  Like any device, it has its own disadvantages and advantages.  In general, buyers are satisfied with the work of the robot.  True, it often breaks down (especially with a daily continuous program).  Correct the situation quickly in the service center.  Frequent damage is another point that repels buyers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irobot roomba 880 instruction manual" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1116170.jpg"></div>
