A computer chair is no exception.  Armrests and seats are especially affected.  The upholstery becomes dirty and torn, and now the thing that is still good in functionality becomes unpresentable.  However, you should not immediately run to the store for a new one, because you can hide external flaws using a cover on a computer chair.  Even a novice craftswoman can sew such a wrap with her own hands, if she uses the step-by-step guide presented below. </p><h2>  Why do I need a cover? </h2><p>  Using a cape will help not only hide upholstery defects.  The cover protects the new chair from dirt and damage.  This is especially true in homes where there are small children and animals.  The cover is easy to remove and wash, unlike upholstery.  In addition, the use of a wrap will help to fit an office chair in almost any interior.  A cover on a leather computer chair will make its operation more comfortable, especially in the summer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marcusredden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a cover on a computer chair" class="if uuid-3229165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3229165.jpg"></div><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  Before you start sewing covers on a computer chair, you need to prepare materials and tools.  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  A cut of fabric. </li><li>  Threads in tone of material and contrast for sweeping. </li><li>  Centimeter tape, chalk or pencil, scissors, pins. </li><li>  Tracing paper or unnecessary fabric for the manufacture of patterns. </li><li>  Linen elastic or zipper. </li><li>  Sewing machine, overlock. </li></ul><h2>  How to choose and calculate the amount of tissue? </h2><p>  In addition to an attractive appearance, the material for the cover must meet a number of criteria: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  density (so that the old upholstery does not shine through). </li><li>  resistance to abrasion (for long-term operation). </li><li>  ease of cleaning. </li></ul><p>  The most popular options: flock, chenille, microfiber.  They are combined, that is, they combine natural and synthetic fibers.  This allows you to achieve high performance while maintaining the positive properties of natural materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moskoophoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself computer case" class="if uuid-3229161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3229161.jpg"></div><p>  The amount of fabric needed to sew a cover on a computer chair depends on the model of the chair and the type of cape: the latter will cover only the upholstery or the entire structure.  In the first case, you will need a minimum amount of material, which is easy to calculate by measuring the length, width of the back and seat.  To the results you need to add 10 cm to the overlap, 2 cm to the elastic and 1 cm to the hem.  That is, the resulting measurements need to be increased in length and width by 26 cm. </p><p>  If the cover will cover parts of the computer chair completely, the amount of fabric will double. </p><h2>  Cape Cover </h2><p>  Sewing a cover on a computer chair of this type is very easy, even a beginner will cope with the work.  The model fits rectangular office chairs, where the back is connected to the seat.  The cloak will turn out whole, which at times simplifies the sewing and processing of the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="studebakerhardtop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="case for computer leather chair" class="if uuid-3229167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3229167.jpg"></div><p>  To calculate the amount of fabric, you need to take two lengths of the back, one and a half seats and add 2 cm to the hem.  When measuring the width, the thickness of the chair must be taken into account. </p><p>  A piece of fabric is laid out upside down on a computer chair, bending to the back of the back and under the seat.  The material is fixed to the upholstery with pins so that it does not move, and it is swept or chipped directly on the chair, taking into account bends.  Next, the cover is removed and the seams are sewn.  The edges are machined. </p><p>  So that the fabric on the back of the back and under the seat does not puff, but lies tightly, gum is sewn along the edge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a cover on a computer chair" class="if uuid-3229163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3229163.jpg"></div><p>  Cape on the computer chair is ready.  Now you can put it on and enjoy the work of your own hands. </p><h2>  Sewing a simple cover with elastic bands </h2><p>  This model is suitable for office chairs, where the back and seat are divided and have a rounded shape.  Best of all, a stretch cover for a computer chair will lie if you sew it from an elastic material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rubber case" class="if uuid-3228057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3228057.jpg"></div><p>  The work begins with securing a piece of fabric with pins on a chair seat.  To the cape lay evenly and not puffed, you need to pull the material.  A piece of chalk outlines the detail around the perimeter.  The workpiece is removed and laid out on a flat surface.  The resulting perimeter should be increased by the thickness of the seat of the chair and add 6 cm to the overlap, elastic and processing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="computer chair cover pattern" class="if uuid-3229162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3229162.jpg"></div><p>  Now the thing is small: cut the workpiece and make a tunnel for the gum.  If the material crumbles, it is necessary to overcast the edge with an overlock or zigzag stitch.  Then it is tucked a half centimeter and a line is laid.  In the part where the seat is fastened with a permanent contact, leave 2-3 cm for the convenience of retracting the gum.  At the final stage, using a safety pin, an elastic tape is placed in the formed tunnel, the edges are tied. </p><p>  Done!  Now the product can be tried on.  The cape on the back is sewn in the same way. </p><h2>  Zipper case </h2><p>  This model is somewhat more difficult to manufacture, but it looks neater due to darts. </p><p>  Work begins with the construction of a pattern cover for a computer chair.  Unfortunately, there is no universal scheme, because each model of an office chair has features. </p><p>  Tracing paper or a piece of unnecessary tissue is fixed on the chair seat with pins and circled with a pencil.  In the process, folds are formed so that the material lies as tightly and evenly as possible.  In these places there will be tucks.  The resulting perimeter must be increased by 1 cm for seams.  The pattern of the upper part of the seat is ready.  From the bottom, everything is somewhat more complicated, because you need to provide a hole for attaching the legs, permanent contact and the armrests of the chair. </p><p>  To do this, copy the pattern of the top of the seat and transfer the location of the details to it.  The middle of the holes for the armrests connect a straight line.  They also do this with a permanent contact and a chair leg.  Thus, three parts of the bottom of the seat turned out, which will be connected by lightning to each other.  The elements must be separated, leaving a hole for the leg of the chair, and enlarged around the perimeter by 1 cm for seams.  The bottom pattern is ready. </p><p>  The blank for the back is made in a manner similar to the top of the seat.  It will take two identical parts. </p><p>  Now you need to measure the perimeter and thickness of the seat.  This will be a strip going along the edge of the product.  It can be from the same fabric as the main parts, or create contrast.  To the width of the tape add 2 cm to the seams.  A similar detail will be needed for the back of the chair. </p><p>  So, all the elements of the pattern are ready.  You can proceed to the next stage of work. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  The fabric selected for sewing a cover for a computer chair with your own hands is laid upside down on a flat surface and the pattern details are fixed on it with pins.  Elements are chalked and then cut out.  The edges of the parts are treated with an overlock or sewn in a zigzag so that the fabric does not crumble. </p><p>  Next, the elements are swept away and tried on on a computer chair.  The strip of fabric that runs along the perimeter must be cut to leave holes for the armrests and the permanent contact.  At this stage, you can adjust the tucks so that the cover lies more evenly.  Details of the lower part of the seat do not need to be swept together; zippers will be sewn there.  Having achieved a perfect fit, the seams are sewn on a typewriter.  Part of the side seam on the back is left free for lightning. </p><p>  To make the cover look neater, the seams are wrapped in a strip running along the perimeter of the chair and an extra line is laid.  Now they will not bend and puff. </p><p>  Now you need to sew the zipper: a long one in the cape for the back (from the permanent contact to the middle of the side part) and three short ones connecting the parts of the bottom of the seat. </p><p>  A self-made case for a computer chair is ready.  It will look great in the interior and protect furniture dirt and damage. </p><p>  According to the above technology, you can sew a cover for a computer chair from old jeans.  In order to make parts for the back and seat, you need to first unfold the trousers and connect the parts so that a canvas is obtained that corresponds to the length and width of the elements of the office chair.  This is an easy option. </p><p>  To make a denim cover more original, you can use the patchwork technique.  In this case, the strength of the cape will increase. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs not difficult to sew a cover for a computer chair with your own hands.  And the tips of experienced craftswomen gathered below will make the process even easier and more enjoyable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tibet-bazaar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cover for computer chair" class="if uuid-3229166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/3229166.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Before transferring the details of the pattern to the fabric, the latter must be washed in accordance with the recommendations for care.  This is necessary so that the material shrinks.  If the finished cover sits, it will not be possible to pull it onto the chair. </li><li>  When laying out the details of the pattern, the direction of the weft and warp threads must be observed.  So the product will look neater and will not warp after washing. </li><li>  In order not to get confused during operation, it is recommended that the product details be signed with chalk from the inside out. </li><li>  Symmetrical pattern elements are folded in half to reveal skews. </li><li>  Inexperienced craftswomen are recommended to first try to sew a cover of unnecessary fabric, and only then switch to expensive materials. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To update the interior and bring a bit of originality into it, it is not necessary to buy new furniture.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to ‚Äúdress up‚Äù her.  A computer chair is no exception.  The cover, in addition to changing the appearance, will help protect the upholstery from dirt and mechanical damage.  Sewing a cloak on an office chair is quite simple, even a novice craftswoman will cope with the work.  And the above master classes and tips of experienced seamstresses will help in the work. </p>
