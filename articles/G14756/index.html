    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not only positive, but also negative comments were awarded to the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya Hotel.  Reviews about this institution are characterized by the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  it‚Äôs unpleasant that if you didn‚Äôt pay for the minibar immediately, it‚Äôs simply closed (you won‚Äôt even be able to use it like a refrigerator); </li><li>  booking a double room, you will still receive cosmetic and hygiene items for one (you have to ask for the second set); </li><li>  inflated cost of living and related services; </li><li>  the railway passes nearby, and therefore in the morning you will be awakened by the noise of passing electric trains (double-glazed windows do not save); </li><li>  only one employee works at the reception, which may result in a queue; </li><li>  the price of breakfast is too high; </li><li>  the number of towels does not meet the standards, which is unacceptable for a hotel of such a high category; </li><li>  no confectionery at breakfast; </li><li>  the tables in the restaurant are too close; </li><li>  Birthday parties who stay at the hotel are not given a compliment. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you want to immerse yourself in an atmosphere of luxury and comfort, then the Leningradskaya Hotel is ideal for you.  Here, modern <span>service standards</span> and the best traditions of Stalinist architecture are organically interwoven.  The interior of the rooms is not only beautiful, but also very thought out, which makes the guests stay especially comfortable.  Guests also note the good quality of breakfast.  Another undoubted advantage of the hotel is its location in the central part of the city near two metro stations.  An undoubted plus is the ability to bring your pet to the hotel. </p><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings of the hotel, it is worth noting its incomplete compliance with the five-star status.  This is manifested in the lack of towels and cosmetic sets, in the lines that are collected at the reception, as well as in the restaurant during breakfast.  At the same time, prices for accommodation and related services are clearly overpriced.  Nevertheless, if you want to feel the atmosphere of a historical building, as well as get to know Moscow and its main attractions closer, then this accommodation option is just perfect for you. </p>
