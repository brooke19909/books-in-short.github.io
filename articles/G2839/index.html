Making a profit is the main goal of creating both banks and commercial enterprises. </p><p>  The following types of <span>enterprise profits are</span> functionally interconnected: net, gross, from sales, ‚Äúpre-tax‚Äù profit, from banking operations, profit from ordinary activities. </p><p>  The main factors affecting an increase in an enterprise‚Äôs profits are many factors, and the distribution and <span>calculation of an</span> enterprise‚Äôs <span>profits</span> seems to be the most complicated procedure for managing it.  The problem of competent <span>distribution of profits is</span> most acute for many enterprises in modern market conditions. </p><p>  The types of profit of the enterprise are considered as an important indicator of all its activities, and not only in the case of calculating its absolute value, but also taking into account the ways in which the profit was obtained. </p><p>  All types of enterprise profits are sources of development of any bank or enterprise, sources of improving the welfare of all its participants, both founders and employees, the basis of their resource base.  For example, the sources of banking resources are considered types of profit, enterprises, in the field of passive operations.  All these operations are quite diverse, and therefore, in their implementation, various types of resources are formed: own and attracted. </p><p>  Taking into account the constant increase in resource requirements for the implementation of both state programs and for satisfying customer needs for resources, an increase in the volume of the resource base of an enterprise or bank should be carried out by: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - active work to preserve the created consumer and customer base; </p><p>  - the formation of a positive image of a reliable bank or company with solid founders; </p><p>  - attracting new legal entities to cooperation; </p><p>  - identification of production and commercial relations (cash flows); </p><p>  - accumulation of information about resource-intensive competing enterprises; </p><p>  - attracting deposits (for both ruble and foreign currency) in long-term deposits of both large customers and non-customers of the bank; </p><p>  - more active attraction of funds of enterprises and banks by selling securities (bills, <span>certificates of deposit)</span> ; </p><p>  - constantly activated work with private deposits; </p><p>  - Entering new markets to search for strategic investors. </p><p>  A very important indicator affecting profit is the level <span>of cash flow management of a</span> bank or enterprise.  Its level provides the degree of self-growth of profit and capital of a business entity. </p><p>  It is very important to consider time and risk factors when moving cash flows.  Here the fundamental <span>properties of money</span> and the probability of losing part of the actual or planned cash associated with the amount of the positive difference between the cash flows find their expression. </p><p>  In connection with the concept of time, risk, and profitability, when considering the parameters of cash flow, the liquidity factor should be highlighted.  It is liquidity that is called upon, by organizing an appropriate flow structure in time, to limit the corresponding risks and thereby allow the company to receive a higher level of income. </p><p>  Cash flow is capable of generating an economic effect, therefore it is very important to consider time and risk factors when moving cash flows.
