It turns out that it is not necessary to convene a lot of guests - there is an easier way to cheer up.  It is enough to update the interior with the right decorations.  One way to do this is to use an LED curtain, which will create a festive atmosphere in an apartment or a private house, and will help you forget about the winter blues.  What it is today will be discussed. </p><h2>  What is a play light and how to use it </h2><p>  <span>The LED curtain garland is</span> only partly those lights that we used to hang on the Christmas tree.  In fact, this is a whole system of wires with bulbs, which can be compared with a continuous blanket.  If we draw analogies, then the product looks like a seine (the fishermen will understand).  The main supply wire is stretched from above, from which branches hang down, strewn with LEDs.  Their length can be the same or different - it does not matter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="clipgoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fringe on the eaves - it is very beautiful" class="if uuid-2985393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985393.jpg"></div><p>  <span>LED curtains are used</span> for decorating walls, door or window openings.  Depending on the model, they can have different widths and lengths.  The choice of size will depend on the intended application of the product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They are also used to decorate building facades.  Garlands designed for outdoor use are protected from wind, rain, snow and dust.  The cost of such curtains is higher than their interior varieties.  If you try and make imagination, you can make a real fairy-tale palace out of an ordinary country house, sparkling with multi-colored precious stones. </p><h2>  Criteria for choosing LED curtains </h2><p>  The main thing you should pay attention to when choosing such a product is the protection class (for the street version, special marking is affixed), width and length.  This will determine where the curtain can be positioned and how functional it will be.  It is also important to have a node such as a controller.  Its absence in the LED curtain circuit will cause the garland to light constantly, without changing modes and in one color.  But if you need to save, this is just the option that will save money, the cost of such products is much lower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="If you cover the garland with tulle, the lights become brighter" class="if uuid-2985386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985386.jpg"></div><p>  More expensive models can consist of many separate screens, united by a common controller.  At the same time, for each of the LED curtains for the street, you can set a specific program without leaving your home.  But such garlands are bought quite rarely due to the high cost.  It‚Äôs easier to buy each separately with its own controller. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are many reviews of LED curtains on the Web.  Most buyers are satisfied with the purchase.  The only exceptions are users who have purchased garlands from the category of Chinese cheap consumer goods or handicraft production. </p><h2>  Garland forms offered by the manufacturer in the Russian market </h2><p>  Today, various curtains are issued for the design of interiors and facades.  In addition, any form proposed by the manufacturer can be modified, depending on the method of application.  Interestingly, even the simplest LED curtain on the window can radically transform the apartment.  And here, too, everything will depend on the glow mode.  This can be a simple flicker or running downward, as if dropping droplets, lights.  Consider the most common forms of such products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=": https://www.banggood.com/3M3M-304-LED-Window-Icicl"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pergola barely covered by an LED curtain" class="if uuid-2985365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985365.jpg"></div><h2>  The most popular garland is ‚Äúrain‚Äù </h2><p>  The simplest form, in which all the "tails" extending from the main wire, have the same length.  It can reach 10 m, and the number of LEDs on the ‚Äústring‚Äù is 2,500. At first glance it seems that working with such a garland will be difficult, but this is not so.  Each thread can be disconnected from the main wire.  To do this, special connectors are provided on such LED curtains.  In addition, in this way, several main wires can be connected if the width of the garland is not enough. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="_InIPgKqjsM" data-url="https://youtu.be/_InIPgKqjsM" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/2/9/1/12291.jpg"></div><h2>  "Fringe" and its differences from the "rain" </h2><p>  The arrangement of the garland is identical to the previous version, however, the length of the threads here is not the same - they differ from each other.  Thus, when it is placed, for example, along the cornice, a pronounced uneven edge is obtained.  With the right choice of mode, you can achieve an amazing result - as if blue-white drops of melt water are rolling down uneven icicles.  Although such garlands look good in a static glow, without a controller. </p><p>  If there is a spruce in the courtyard of a private house, then such a fringe will be a wonderful decoration for a green beauty.  With insufficient length, such an LED curtain can be extended by attaching another main cord to one main cord.  It is noteworthy that even when switching several garlands into one, you can not be afraid for the state of the network - the power of the LEDs is minimal, which means that there will be no big load on the connection point. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cambodiagateway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="So the room can be given a festive look" class="if uuid-2985394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985394.jpg"></div><h2>  An interesting form of "melting icicles" </h2><p>  Here, the LEDs are clad in a transparent cone-shaped rod.  The program is set in such a way that white and blue lights seem to flow down the glass, creating a complete, real impression of melting.  This garland looks especially amazing in extreme frost. </p><p>  In fact, any form of such products can be applied in its own way, creating a unique building facade.  One - a good solution seems to be to place a luminous decor only on the ledges of the building, while others cover the house with garlands, like a web - this is a matter of taste.  In any case, such scenery will look great, creating a festive atmosphere. </p><h2>  Benefits of LED Curtains </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but there are no shortcomings in such garlands.  As for the benefits, among them it can be noted: </p><ul><li>  Low power consumption without loss of luminous flux. </li><li>  Wide range of applications - the curtain can be used both indoors and outdoors. </li><li>  Durability.  On average, such garlands easily cross the line of 50,000 hours of continuous operation. </li><li>  Electrical safety - LEDs operate on a voltage of 12 V. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="odmornadrini.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The more often the lights, the denser the curtain" class="if uuid-2985381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2985381.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  LED curtains are a really convenient and not too expensive way to decorate both the interior and the exterior.  Thanks to such garlands, you can decorate any items without much labor.  And who knows, maybe the owner will not want to remove them from the facade of the building after the New Year holidays.  If you choose a quality product, it will survive the summer without any problems and will be able to please those passing by next winter. </p>
