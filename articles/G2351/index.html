    <h2>  For what purposes can individuals open accounts? </h2><p>  Depending on the banking program and its intended purpose, available accounts for individuals are conventionally divided into four main types: </p><ul><li>  settlement; </li><li>  current; </li><li>  cumulative or deposit; </li><li>  card. </li></ul><h2>  Settlement accounts in Sberbank </h2><p>  As a rule, a current account is opened by private individuals for the purpose of their further participation in deposit programs in the bank, as well as if necessary.  For example, a powerful argument for this action is to receive a salary, pension or social allowance.  We will answer below on how to open an account with Sberbank for a private person for <span>bank transfer</span> . </p><h2>  Current and card accounts in Sberbank </h2><p>  A current or ‚Äúworking‚Äù account is usually used to carry out the necessary operations (send or receive money) and store personal finances. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Card accounts are conventionally divided into two types: </p><ul><li>  debit </li><li>  credit. </li></ul><p>  If you have no idea how to open an account with Sberbank for a private person for retirement and what type of card account to choose, pay attention to debit ones.  These accounts are designed specifically for a wide variety of payments, including pensions, salaries, social benefits and alimony.  When you issue a debit account, you become the owner of a plastic card.  In the future, you can withdraw money from it in cash and make purchases within the amount on your account. </p><p>  A credit card has a certain limit and allows the customer to make purchases within this amount.  At the same time, you will also have to pay a percentage to the bank for using credit funds.  Accordingly, a new loan can be taken with full repayment of the previous one. </p>

    <h2>  Savings or deposit accounts </h2><p>  Special attention is paid, perhaps, to accumulative and deposit accounts.  They will suit you if you decide to receive information on how to open an account with Sberbank for a private person in foreign currency and accumulate money at the same time.  Deposit accounts are of two types: </p><ul><li>  savings; </li><li>  cumulative. </li></ul><p>  The meaning of opening such accounts is as follows: you deposit a certain amount of money into the account and expect a certain time;  during the period of storing your money in the bank, an accumulation of interest occurs, which can be withdrawn either at the end of the contract or to do this as necessary, for example, monthly (quarterly). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to open an account in Sberbank for a private person? </h2><p>  To open a current account with Sberbank of Russia, you need to contact the representatives of the credit institution with a passport and a small amount for the down payment.  For example, when choosing the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù deposit program, a bank client will be asked to write an application and deposit at least 1000 rubles, 100 $ or 100 ‚Ç¨. </p><p>  However, before opening an account with Sberbank to an individual at interest, it is necessary to carefully study the conditions of the bank's existing programs.  For example, the same Save deposit is opened in national and foreign currencies for a period of one month to three years.  It does not provide for partial withdrawal and replenishment, but assumes a monthly capitalization of interest. </p><h2>  How <span>to open a bank account</span> for a pension? </h2><p>  For example, when contacting Sberbank, you decided to open a card account and receive a ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù or ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù card.  What is needed for its design and receipt?  In order to get this card and open an account, you need to contact any Sberbank branch at your place of residence, write an application and enter your passport details, TIN code and pension certificate into it.  At the same time, in the corresponding column, you must enter information about the Pension Fund, which calculates your pension.  Then you should give the application form to the representative of the bank and wait for its consideration from one to two days.  After this period, an account will be opened and a card will be issued to you or refusal to do so. </p><p>  In the case of a positive response and receipt of the card, you only need to take the necessary details of Sberbank (r / s, MFIs) and take them to your Pension Fund.  Later, you can easily receive a pension at the nearest ATMs of the bank. </p>

    <p>  Note: if you decided to create your own account in your name, then for the implementation of the plan you need to be present in person at the execution of all documents.  If you plan to make an account, for example, with your child or other closest relative, friend, colleague, then it makes sense to you first find out how to open an account with Sberbank for a private person to another person.  We will talk about this a bit later. </p><h2>  Are there benefits for retirees when opening deposits? </h2><p>  According to the current banking regulations, certain loyalty programs work for retirement age depositors.  For example, at the opening of the ‚ÄúReplenish‚Äù or ‚ÄúSave‚Äù deposit, pensioners will receive the maximum allowable interest rate. </p><h2>  Is it difficult to open accounts in order to accumulate interest? </h2><p>  Do you want to open an account with Sberbank and save, for example, for your child‚Äôs education?  Then it is worth considering the savings programs that are widely represented in Sberbank.  For example, your choice fell on the indefinite deposit ‚ÄúDemand for Sberbank of Russia‚Äù.  How to open it? </p><p>  You can open such a deposit in national and foreign currency by passport and in any bank branch.  The exception is <span>deposits opened</span> in rare types of currency.  To open accounts in this case, it is necessary to specify in advance the list of branches that provide such a service.  The remaining investors need to draw up an agreement with the bank, where they indicate the following: </p><ul><li>  amount and currency of investment; </li><li>  investment period; </li><li>  expiration date of the investment; </li><li>  deposit and account operations on deposit; </li><li>  Minimum deposit amount for a cash deposit; </li><li>  frequency of additional contributions; </li><li>  size of fireproof residue; </li><li>  frequency of interest payments; </li><li>  FULL NAME; </li><li>  address and contact details. </li></ul><p>  Opening a deposit account is also possible with the help of ATMs, terminals and other services with remote servicing.  We will tell further about whether and how to open an account with Sberbank for a private person in a different name. </p>

    <h2>  Is it possible to open a deposit in someone else's name? </h2><p>  Opening an account and depositing into someone else's name is allowed.  For example, you decide to give a contribution to your spouse.  In this case, you need to come to any bank branch, and then draw up an agreement by presenting your passport.  You will also need to specify the following: </p><ul><li>  Name of the third party; </li><li>  date and year of birth; </li><li>  citizenship availability; </li><li>  contact address of registration; </li><li>  a variety of the third party document with its details. </li></ul><p>  If you don‚Äôt know <span>how to open an account</span> in Sberbank for a private person without his presence, we will help you figure it out. </p><h2>  Is it possible to open an account with a third party, but without his presence? </h2><p>  Without the presence of a third party, you can open a deposit.  This is done by analogy with the previous design option.  The only thing is that if the opening of the account is performed by the secretary or accountant of the enterprise, then in addition to the above documents he needs to present a notarized power of attorney.  For example, if a foreign citizen plans to open an account with Sberbank not personally, but through an intermediary, then he must provide the bank with a power of attorney signed either by a notary or a consul. </p>

    <p>  How many deposits can one person make?  An individual living in the territory of the Russian Federation has the full right to open an unlimited number of deposits, if desired. </p><h2>  How to open an account in foreign currency? </h2><p>  Most deposits and accounts work in two directions - foreign and domestic currency.
