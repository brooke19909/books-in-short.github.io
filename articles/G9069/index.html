Despite this, it has successfully oppressed the technological giants present in Russia and other CIS countries for decades.  What is the secret of such success? </p><p>  Not the least role in what made Huawei models so famous and in demand was the quality of the products.  The phones sold under their logo have all the necessary qualities of a successful product: exquisite design, powerful stuffing, optimized software and, of course, low price, which is typical for many devices from China. </p><p>  The hero of today's review will be the model Huawei U8860 Honor.  It is not new, it was launched on the market in 2011.  Despite this, even today, the device seems quite consistent with the requirements of customers and does not lag behind advanced devices.

    <p>  When the device was released for sale, it was positioned as a very powerful and fast smartphone at an affordable price.  At least for Chinese developers, the Huawei U8860 Honor was a real flagship - smart, functional and attractive just by all criteria.  As it turns out later, the company is trying to make each of its models as such.  Perhaps this is the secret to her success.  In parallel, competing with Samsung, HTC and others, the Chinese did not forget about the low price of their phones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, Huawei U8860 Honour at the time of the start of sales cost only 14 thousand rubles. </p><p>  But we will pass from the general description of the model to a more specific characteristic of its functions. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Before looking at the device, take a look at the kit that comes with it.  Let's face it, the Chinese have always cared about their customers in terms of the availability of accessories.  Inexpensive devices from the Middle Kingdom often provide a headset, protective films, cases.  This is not that original or unusual, but leaves a good impression on the buyer. </p><p>  In the case of the Huawei Honor U8860, everything is quite modest.  The device comes in a box with headphones, instructions, a battery, as well as a charger and a USB cable. </p><h2>  Design and appearance </h2>

    <p>  By tradition, we begin the review of the phone directly with its appearance.  In this regard, the Honor 3 model does not really have much to boast about.  The device is made in a traditional rectangular shape and has smooth corners.  Around the phone‚Äôs perimeter you can see a silver border - this is a decorative line that visually separates the device‚Äôs screen.  True, from the point of view of practicality, developers could make claims.  Reviews indicate that this line is scratched very easily, while it is very noticeable and can thus spoil the appearance of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The back cover of the phone is made in glossy texture.  This model came out when it was not as banal a move as it can be described today.  Therefore, in general, the phone looks pretty, although there is nothing unusual in it. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  Under the display of the Huawei U8860 Honor there are physical control buttons.  There are four of them (whereas, by tradition, there are three on all Android smartphones).  Unusual is the search button.  In addition to these, there are other gadget controls, in particular the power button of the device (on the upper edge of the device), as well as the swing to change the sound volume of the model. </p>

    <p>  In all other respects, the device is not much different from other similar smartphones.  At the bottom there is a connector for the charger, above the screen you can see the eye of the proximity sensor and the front camera;  On the rear panel are the main camera and flash.  The headset plugs into the jack on the upper edge near the power button. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The model Huawei Honor U8860 (the characteristics confirm this information) 4-inch display that runs on TFT-LCD technology.  This means that the phone is able to display a lot of colors (about 16 million), be moderately bright and colorful, but it loses saturation when the screen is tilted.  So, if the viewing angle changes, you can see the full clarification of the picture.  In this regard, of course, the device loses to competitors with an LCD display. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The screen resolution is 480 by 854 pixels, due to which the graininess is almost invisible here.  The model supports up to 2 simultaneous taps. </p><p>  For additional protection of the display, the Huawei U8860 Honor Black model is equipped with a special layer of glass that sticks on top of the screen.  It resists a significant part of household scratches, chips and other damage that may occur during everyday use of the phone.  However, you should not rely on him.  As the reviews show, even the protective glass can be damaged.  The best way to protect the model remains the film on the screen. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  In 2011, when the model was introduced, a question arose for manufacturers of Android phones regarding the duration of their devices.  Users even then noticed the low autonomy of many devices on this operating system. </p><p>  Saying anything specific about the Huawei Honor U8860 is difficult.  This model does not have official technical specifications regarding the duration of the work.  At the level of private reviews, it was found that in continuous conversation mode the device can work for about 7 hours, while listening to music - 25, and video - about 8 hours. </p><p>  The indicators are quite decent.  With them, the device could work in normal mode for two days.  In principle, even active users of the Huawei Honor U8860, Android fans, should be enough. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  As already noted, two cameras are installed on the smartphone at once - front and main - cameras.  Of course, the first one has significantly less capabilities than the main one, however, accurate data on it could not be found.  The rear camera has a resolution of 8 megapixels and is equipped with a flash.  Due to this, the pictures are obtained of mediocre quality (despite the high and promising parameter - 8 megapixels).  Huawei U8860 Honor is able to shoot in detail and beautifully, but for this you need to try. </p>

    <p>  The ‚Äúautofocus‚Äù function is present, but in general, with the camera pointing at the subject, everything is quite bad.  The smartphone does not have an option that allows you to focus on the object after clicking on the screen.  Because of this, in order to switch the attention of the camera, it is necessary to take it aside and direct it to the subject of photography again.  This, as you know, is extremely inconvenient. </p><p>  The device is capable of creating videos in fairly good quality. </p><p>  The only thing openly complaining about in reviews is the quality of sound received by the camera.  It is terrible and is transmitted at the lowest bitrate. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The model is based on the Quallcomm MSM8255 in the modification of "Turbo".  At a clock frequency of 1.4 GHz, the model shows fairly good results.  For example, they are noticeable when you open the phone menu, when performing various operations with the device.  Everything happens very smoothly and measuredly, no ‚Äútwitches‚Äù characteristic of Android-devices were noticed.  In this regard, working with the model is pleasant. </p>

    <p>  The Adreno 205 graphics accelerator common on other touch models is also installed here. This module allows you to run colorful games and applications at high settings. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The phone has 512 megabytes of RAM.  As you can see, this is quite enough for the phone to work without freezes and delays.  The physical memory here is about 4 GB.  Of these, only 1 GB is allocated for applications.  However, the device supports memory cards, so you should not worry about the lack of space for multimedia files.  If you believe the reviews, the mobile device is capable of reading cards up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Traditionally, the device supports several communication formats.  As a rule, they are typical.  And the Huawei Honor 3 U8860 (the smartphone we describe) is no exception. </p><p>  These formats include regular GSM networks, Bluetooth for sending and receiving files, Wi-Fi for working with high-speed wireless Internet connection.  The device also has a GSP module based on GLONASS cards.  When using a headset used as an antenna, the phone is capable of playing FM radio. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  According to the technical specification, the model operates on the basis of Android 2.3.6.  However, it should be understood that 3-4 years have passed since the device was launched for sale, and developers could adapt one of the following OS versions for this model.  For example, there were rumors about the introduction of Android 4.0 on this device.  It may well be that they were justified.  However, given that updates often lead to even more problems, it is difficult to say how the Huawei Honor U8860 will behave in the future. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As you know, the best way to find out information about the operation of a device is to study reviews about it and recommendations.  As you know, from the moment the model was launched for sale, a lot of its characteristics from buyers appeared.  Therefore, to find out what this smartphone is, it will not be difficult for us. </p><p>  Here, for example, from the reviews it becomes clear that most of the advantages and advantages of the model described above disappear after a year and a half of the smartphone‚Äôs operation.  This feature is indicated by many people.  The problem is this: if at first the model can be called ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, then over time the device gives all the worst performance results.  The menu starts to ‚Äúglitch‚Äù, the camera does not open, calls automatically fall off - there are a lot of troubles.  Therefore, the vast majority of those who comment on the device recommend using it no longer than a year.  Otherwise, the user will have to face a lot of problems based on errors of the system and the hardware platform in particular. </p><p>  Regarding the appearance of the problem, as such, are absent.  The only thing there are comments about the pseudo-metallic frame around the screen.  According to reviews, it peels off quickly enough, after which plastic is exposed on it.  It looks very cheap. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What can be said about this device?  It has a lot of advantages, especially those that are declared by the manufacturer in the technical specifications.  This is a strong battery, a balanced processor, a high-quality camera and so on.  In practice, if you believe the reviews, you should expect some insidiousness from the smartphone, a sharp change in work style.  Already in the near future, it is peeling off, becoming ugly.  The operating system begins to ‚Äúglitch‚Äù greatly, independently carry out some kind of actions beyond the control of a person, for example, automatically hang up during a conversation.  Therefore, this should be taken into account if you liked the model and would like to purchase it. </p>
