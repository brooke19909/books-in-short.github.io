The intrigue is that from the old things that every housewife probably has, you can create something cozy and beautiful for your own home.  We will talk about rugs from old T-shirts, sweaters, dresses, tights and even rugs and blankets. </p><h2>  The brighter the better </h2><p>  To make a handmade miracle pleasing to the eye and valiantly serve the joy of the whole family, we suggest creating it from wicker braids. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pigtail Carpet" class="if uuid-2404487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2404487.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, knit things into strips, this material is more convenient to use and quite durable in operation.  Almost a timeless option will be such a mat from nylon tights.  We form three balls of the same size from knitted strips, sew them together and begin weaving the braid.  The size of the carpet directly depends on the length of the obtained braid.  In this technique, colorful, bright colors look great.  When the braid weaving ends, we take a round base and, starting from the center, "lay" the workpiece with a snail, fixing each circle with glue or a strong thread with a needle.  You can work without a foundation, but then the wrong side of the rug will not look very aesthetically pleasing.  In the end, you should carefully hide the ‚Äútail‚Äù of the braid, fixing it under the last circle, it is he who has the habit of sticking out during the use of the product.  Making such a do-it-yourself rug is shown in the photo, we have described all the important points above.  It's done - time to praise yourself! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidepatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Braid rug" class="if uuid-2404491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2404491.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make rugs with your own hands in the "grandmother" technique </h2><p>  Another, perhaps the most common way of making shredded rugs is the technique of our grandmothers.  They knew a lot about households and did not throw out a single piece of cloth, not even the smallest one.  You can take any things of different colors and types of fabric.  Even if the edges of the flaps ‚Äúcrumble‚Äù a little - it does not matter, after several washings of the carpet they will finally leave the product.  There are several options for the shape and methods of stacking parts.  Pay attention to the first photo: the carpet is sewn from square blanks folded diagonally in a triangle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Carpet in grandmother's technique" class="if uuid-2404511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2404511.jpg"></div><p>  You can work in this technique both manually and on a sewing machine.  For large sizes, it is advisable to stop on the machine method.  If you want to make, for example, a doormat for children with your own hands - this is ideal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Walkthrough </h2><p>  The essence of the work is as follows: </p><p>  Step number 1.  We cut a lot of square details. </p><p>  Step number 2.  Determine the shape of the carpet - cut out the base of dense rigid fabric (circle, oval, square, rectangle). </p><p>  Step number 3.  We work from the edge - to the center.  To the very edge of our base we attach blanks folded in a triangle diagonally, and, slightly overlapping the details on top of each other, we sew in a circle. </p><p>  Step number 4.  When the outer circle is finished, we retreat no more than one and a half centimeter from it and again perform the same actions. </p><p>  Step number 5.  The medium-sized rug consists of 15 circles and several thousand shreds.  The splendor of the mat depends on the frequency of laying parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marrietta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shred rug" class="if uuid-2404700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2404700.jpg"></div><p>  Replacing the blank squares with stripes or circles, you can do an exclusive and very stylish thing, diversifying the interior and delighting your beloved. </p><p>  If the shreds-blanks are folded in various ways, then masterpieces of textile art are obtained. </p><p>  Such carpets are very popular with young children.  For a long time, a child can sort out pieces of fabric of various colors and fingers with his fingers, which contributes to the development of fine motor skills, color perception, enriches sensory perception. </p><h2>  Very fluffy rugs </h2><p>  Now let's look at how to make a do-it-yourself rug step by step from strips of fabric and building mesh.  For convenience, you need to arm yourself with a crochet hook or similar tool. </p><p>  Step 1. Cut a lot of stripes about 3 cm into 15-20 cm (it is better to use knitted T-shirts, old fleece clothes, sweaters and so on).  The height of the "pile" of the rug depends on the length of the strips. </p><p>  Stage 2. We stretch a strip into the mesh hole, with a hook we stick it out of the neighboring cell and tie it to a knot. </p><p>  Step 3. Repeat this manipulation many times until the grid is completely filled.  This is a very time-consuming process, but the result is worth it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diynetwork.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Striped carpet" class="if uuid-2404485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2404485.jpg"></div><p>  Such a do-it-yourself rug is suitable for the bathroom and as a bedside option in the nursery and in the living room - by the fireplace.  It looks great, plus everything - it is quite tenacious. </p><h2>  The mat can be knitted </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted rug" class="if uuid-2404842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2404842.jpg"></div><p>  For those who knit, there is a great option to create a do-it-yourself rug from old things, using this skill.  The preparatory process is still the same: we cut things into thin long strips and, stitching them together, form a ball.  Such a rug fits in with a single crochet column, although maybe your imagination and experience will choose other options. </p><h2>  Non-standard weaving methods </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself rug can be done using improvised means.  In the next video, the master uses a rectangular metal basket as a frame (like those that serve as inventory in a supermarket).  The idea is simply amazing, and the result is completely different from all previous options. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="-GXZSwWy-YQ" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GXZSwWy-YQ" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/3/6/3/2363.jpg"></div><p>  If you still have a question, is it difficult to make a do-it-yourself rug from old things, then we answer unequivocally - no! </p><h2>  Jeans in business! </h2><p>  Well, what about without them ?!  In the classic version, we could offer you to sew a rug from jeans squares without cutting edges, which, no doubt, looks very impressive.  Denim will fit perfectly into all of the above methods: shreds, knitting, rug using mesh.  But the most stunning and, perhaps, futuristic option is to sew a rug from pockets from old jeans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rug" class="if uuid-2405037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2405037.jpg"></div><p>  Stylish, isn't it?  Any teenager will be delighted with such a gift.  As an alternative to sewing, you can perform such an interior item using a rigid base and an adhesive gun.  The material is very durable, which is a big plus.  Combining various shades of denim, you can achieve a fantastic result. </p><h2>  Soft rug made of ... stones </h2><p>  The apotheosis of our article will be a rug of stones.  Not real (although this also happens, for example, at the entrance to the house).  We will talk about making rugs made of pebbles piled from wool or felt.  In our realities, it is not always easy to get the above-mentioned material, and the price of felting wool can ruin all the creative impulses in the bud, so we offer a more budget option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinepattern.top" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wool Stones" class="if uuid-2404503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2404503.jpg"></div><p>  Making such a carpet, or rather its double, is possible from old rugs, blankets, and fleece items.  First you need to cut round blanks of various sizes: very large, medium, small and very tiny.  It is advisable to use fabric shades that are close in color.  Manually, using a needle and thread, we form round and oval pebbles from the blanks.  Adhering to perfectly even forms is optional, but rather the opposite.  In the process, you will understand that filler for such elements is practically not required due to the density of the material itself. </p><p>  When a certain amount of ‚Äúpseudo-stones‚Äù is typed, you can start laying out the carpet pattern on the base (a piece of felt, a construction sealant, or something similar).  At this stage, it will become clear how many elements are needed, what shape and size they should be.  When the "puzzle" has developed, it will be possible to fix each pebble with glue or thread with a needle.  You can make such a rug in a few evenings, and it will be a long time to serve and delight your home. </p><h2>  It would be a desire and fantasy </h2><p>  In this article, there are enough options for creating do-it-yourself rugs with photos and videos so that the reader has a desire to make such a cozy gift to himself or to his relatives.  If desired, you can combine several techniques, experiment with materials and forms.  True professionalism comes with experience.  Perhaps making rugs will become your hobby, or maybe a profession.  Go for it, create, break stereotypes and cross borders.  I wish you creative success! </p>
