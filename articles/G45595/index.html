Thanks to her, the city is divided into two parts.  On the north side it is framed by the Royal Canal, on the south - the Grand.  Bridges, <span>canals, rivers</span> give Dublin a certain charm and picturesqueness. </p><p>  The capital of Ireland is considered the largest port in the country and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã115 km2.  According to the census, which </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of ireland" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/38899.jpg" width="500"></div>  took place in 2006, a little more than a million people live here.  The first historical mention of this place dates back to 140 A.D.  in the works of the ancient Greek ethnographer Ptolemy.  The appearance of the city is associated with the union of two settlements - Oak and Lynn, which were founded in the 9th century by the Vikings.  However, thanks to <span>archaeological excavations, it was</span> established that more than five thousand years ago, the inhabitants of this region were engaged in agriculture and fishing.  After the Norman conquest, the city became the capital of Ireland.
