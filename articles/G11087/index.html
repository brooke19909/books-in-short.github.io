    <h2>  Miracles exist </h2><p>  Holidays in Palau are very popular all over the world, although, unfortunately, in our country this direction is not too developed.  Travelers have long appreciated this paradise, which is almost unaffected by human activity!  This wonderful land abounds with marine life.  About 1.5 thousand exotic fish found a home here.  Unhurried turtles, of which there are many, do not notice anything around.  And nowhere else on the planet you will see more than 700 varieties of anemones and corals.  <span>The islands of the archipelago</span> officially won the title of one of the natural underwater wonders of our Earth!  This rating is made by CEDAM specialists.  So you do not have to be bored.  Holidays on the islands are a real adventure with a dive into the underwater depths, excursions, walks in the rainforests and, of course, swimming in the turquoise waters of the ocean. </p><h2>  Beach lovers </h2><p>  If you prefer to soak up the snow-white sand and plunge into the clear coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean, the luxurious country of Palau is perfect for you.  The island is completely buried in magnificent greenery: palm trees bend over the water, forming a cozy shade, and exotic flowers and plants help to feel in real paradise wilds.  The beaches are very clean and well maintained, most hotels have their own territories where no one will bother you.  The whiteness of the sand is simply amazing: it seems to glow and radiate heat.  The waters off the coast are very warm and clean.  If you want to see the underwater inhabitants, you just have to bend over the water - and under your feet there will appear a real world where fish scurry about and wonderful corals grow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the territory of the islands is quite small, the country of Palau, whose hotels can be put on a par with the most luxurious in the world, has created an excellent infrastructure for travelers.  Cozy and comfortable hotels are equipped with everything necessary.  And if you want to enjoy the natural beauty, you will be offered a luxurious bungalow overlooking the ocean or a picturesque rainforest. </p><p>  Of course, it is difficult to call such a vacation economical, but the islands of Palau (tourist reviews confirm this) will present unforgettable adventures for everyone.  Anyone will find something to their liking: contemplating the wonders of the wild can be easily combined with a relaxing dinner in a chic restaurant, and the souvenirs that you purchase in shopping centers and local shops will allow you to awaken pleasant memories of a chic vacation. </p><h2>  The fate of the state </h2><p>  The history of the archipelago is somewhat unique: the islands were able to avoid early conquests and assimilation with the invaders.  Until the sixteenth century, no one even knew where Palau was.  The Spaniards, who clung to its shores, were absolutely not interested in this territory and safely left it, leaving the Aborigines alone with nature.  And the first contact with civilized Europeans occurred at the end of the 18th century, and that was only because of the collapse of an English vessel near the shores of the island of Ulong.  Civilization grossly broke into the ancient structure of life of local inhabitants, and already at the end of the 19th century the territories moved to Germany.  The First World War changed the course of history - the Japanese came to the islands, and then the Americans became entrenched here.  Nowadays, the territory has received the status of a republic, the new capital of Palau is the city of Melekeok. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Paradise for divers </h2><p>  Holidays in Palau will be a real discovery for diving enthusiasts.  The best dive bases have been created here, both for professionals and beginners.  The number of specialized items is more than 70 units.  <span>Coral reefs,</span> dizzy steep walls and rocks, caves with incredible stalactites and blue ‚Äúholes‚Äù - all this can be seen in the underwater world of the archipelago.  These waters are called the most attractive for diving in the entire Pacific Ocean: there are excursions in shallow water, but you can see exotic inhabitants and at impressive depths.  Specialists have developed several types of dives for divers: </p><ul><li>  Almost vertical walls of coral reef.  There is a very strong current, but you can admire the numerous giant schools of fish, see barracudas and even sharks. </li><li>  Tour of the inner lagoons - here you can admire the unique gardens of hard and soft corals.  Nowhere but in Palau, on the world map you will not find such a fantastic corner with "living" plants that amaze the imagination with their size and many shades. </li><li>  You can see a real maritime museum of <span>sunken ships</span> and guns of World War II.  These communities have not been intimidating for a long time, they have become a haven for many inhabitants who feel themselves to be their full owners. </li><li>  Programs that only Palau can offer are: a Candelabra cave, blue ‚Äúholes‚Äù and, of course, a striking jellyfish lake. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Climate of the archipelago </h2><p>  The climate is subequatorial and equatorial, warm and humid.  The main inconvenience is showers, which begin as suddenly as they end.  They do not bring much coolness, but, on the contrary, make the air stuffy.  Winds and rains are mainly observed in the summer, but from July to the end of October tropical cyclones rage on the islands, comparable in strength to hurricanes.  The rest of the year, the weather favors both outdoor activities (diving) and swimming on numerous beaches.  Palau (reviews of tourists confirm this) is most convenient to visit during the period from October to June.  The temperature at this time averages + 25-28 <sup></sup>  during the day and approximately + 24-26 <sup></sup>  at night.  Water in the ocean warms up to an average of + 26-27 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><h2>  How to get to the archipelago </h2><p>  How to get to Palau?  Despite the fact that the islands are located in the depths of the Pacific Ocean, you can fly there by regular comfortable flights from (via) Seoul, the capital of South Korea, or through Manila (Philippines).  The flight does not take much time, and in just a few hours you will be met by the hospitable country of Palau.  The airport (international) is located about 4 km from the city of Koror and is called "Koror Roman Tmetuchil". </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Both the underwater world and terrestrial ecosystems are amazingly diverse.  Well, where else can you see numerous fish of unimaginable color and impressive coral sharks?  Sea snakes curl in the water, and giant mollusks and nautiluses rest at the very bottom.  But the coast of the archipelago is densely populated by crocodiles, lizards, monkeys and monitor lizards.  The magnificent birds, of which there are more than 30 species, delight with their singing, day and night.  No poisonous insects or animals are found in Palau.  Here you can admire exotic plants, magnificent mangrove rainforests and coconut groves. </p><h2>  Babeltuan Island </h2><p>  Almost 90% of the entire territory of the state falls on the island of Babeltuan.  The local population, like hundreds of years ago, lives in small villages, between which snakes of ancient stone paths stretch.  On the slopes of the island you can see the unique mysterious pyramids and terraces.  They were erected in the hundredth years of our era.  The north of the territory is known for huge basalt monoliths.  According to legend, they served as a support for the divine "buy".  Such constructions were in every village; tribe members gathered there to communicate with the gods. </p><p>  The state of Palau moved its capital to the city of Melekeok, which is also located on Babeltown.  Only 1.5 thousand people live in the city, and all the rest are still farming in small villages.  In the capital, you can admire the Capitol building or go to the famous Ngardok Lake.  It is the largest freshwater reservoir in the region. </p>

    <h2>  Archipelago Units </h2><p>  Rock Island is an amazing variety of landscapes and landscapes: natural beaches, grottoes, underground canals, caves and even stone canyons.  The main attraction is the salty Lake Medusa - this natural masterpiece resembles a unique fairy-tale organism, which is in constant motion due to the huge number of jellyfish.  And on the island of Ulong you can admire the ancient petroglyphs.  Having been on Angaur, be sure to visit the green ponds that formed on the site of abandoned phosphate mines.  These unique lakes have become the habitat of crocodiles. </p><p>  Monkeys, of which there are many, live only in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMicronesia.  The fact is that a very long time ago the Germans brought them, and the pets fled and successfully bred.  But if you want to visit the most secluded corner of our planet and the country of Palau, Kayangel Island is such a place.  Here you will not see airports and noisy cars, and the lack of a telephone and the Internet will help to abstract from the whole world.  The unique products of local artisans are of high quality and will become real souvenirs that will replenish any collection. </p><h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  If you find a moment between a relaxing swim in the ocean and an exciting scuba dive, you can head to the Palau National Museum.  It is located on the island of Koror.  There you can admire an interesting ethnographic exposition: beads, jewelry, money from natural shells, sea charts from cords and sticks, ancient buildings made of straw and wood. </p><p>  In addition to the amazing underwater <span>kingdom of wildlife,</span> one of the main attractions of Palau (tourist reviews confirm this) are relics that have remained since the Second World War.  History buffs will be able to see planes and other military equipment that is overgrown with vines and grass, in dense groves and on the ocean floor. </p>
