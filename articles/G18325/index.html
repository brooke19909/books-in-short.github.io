  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a sword out of paper in traveling conditions, using newspapers or wrapping paper</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The wonderful summer time is approaching - the time of summer seasons, relaxation in villages or in nature, trips on vacation.  And if even for adults this period brings great joy and a lot of new experiences, then what can we say about children! </p><p>  With what delight the kids run barefoot along the sandy paths, brandishing a toy sword!  And these loud cries of victory over the defeated enemy?  After all, in the village or in nature you do not need to restrain yourself, looking back at the neighbors living behind a thin wall. </p><p>  But what if the little sword broke on vacation with a little samurai, or even worse - my mother simply forgot to put it in her luggage?  There really is nothing left but to make a sword yourself.  You can choose twigs as a material, you can make a weapon from a small plastic pipe cut, or you can cut a blade out of cardboard and paste it with foil.  Some even make a whip up a sword from a piece of the board using a conventional saw and wrap the handle with adhesive tape. </p><p>  However, when playing with such weapons, very often a variety of injuries occur in children.  And, as you know, while in nature, adults do not always manage to be close to their offspring.  Therefore, it is worth thinking about other, safer for children material from which to try to build weapons. </p><p>  Particularly creative parents share their skills on <span>how to make a sword out of paper.</span>  And even though it sounds pretty weird, but it does!  Regular newspapers can serve as excellent source material for this toy.  You can use simple sheets for printing on an A4 printer.  But then, unfortunately, the sword will turn out pretty small, just not even a sword, but a dagger.  By the way, if you are lucky enough to get hold of wrapping paper or postal paper, then this is even better, since making a sword out of paper will be more dense and strong. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Multiple layers of paper should be stacked.  Best of all is a product from sheets of the same format.  But if the material is selected in different sizes, it will be better if you trim it with a sharp knife or razor.  In the event that adjustment is not possible, try to fold the paper with an even edge from at least one corner - from the other, uneven, you have to make a handle. </p><p>  If you use newspapers, then they will need at least 6 pieces.  How to make a sword out of paper?  Not so difficult, but still, besides paper, the master will still need a little patience, foil or silver-colored paper and electrical tape or tape. </p><p>  We lay the paper in an even pile and begin to fold it from the corner.  To make this process faster and the layers to be even, you can use a flat strip of cardboard, the width of which will be equal to the width of the blade of the future sword.  The cardboard must be positioned so that it does not protrude from under the newspaper. </p><p>  When the whole stack turns into one strip, with the adhesive tape from the very edge - the tip and in the middle of the blade, wrap the received part for fixing.  If necessary, you can do this several times in different places. </p><p>  Since you really want to <span>make a sword</span> with your own hands extremely similar to the real one, that is, with a flickering metal shine blade, you can camouflage the ‚Äúblade‚Äù.  To do this, foil or silver paper should be glued to a band of newspapers.  One edge of the obtained part should be left without pasting - about 12 centimeters - for the handle. </p><p>  Of course, if the sword is made far from civilization, then you can do without pasting: the imagination of the child is limitless!  For him, the fact that adults are engaged in something unusual is important already, and precisely in order to make it, the little man, more interesting and more fun.  And about how to make a sword out of paper - glued or not - he does not even think at that moment. </p><p>  So, having folded in this way a strip of newspapers measuring 15 cm X 1 cm, we also fasten it with a tape.  This will be the boundary between the blade and the handle.  Having placed this small strip at a distance of 12 cm from the non-glued edge perpendicular to the blade, we also fasten it with a tape. </p><p>  Now you can wrap the hilt of the sword with electrical tape for beauty.  All!  The sword for the little samurai is ready for battle. </p>
