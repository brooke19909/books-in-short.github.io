    <h2>  First research </h2><p>  So why is it impossible to reproduce in space?  The first studies were conducted back in the days of the USSR.  The first participants in the experiments were rats.  It so happened that these animals became pioneers.  Rats that became pregnant in space gave rise to viable offspring.  However, adults died very quickly after the cubs were born.  Returning to Earth, the cubs experienced certain difficulties.  First of all, the cubs could not move normally, since they were formed in zero gravity. </p><p>  Many animals have traveled to space.  It just so happened that monkeys and dogs saw our planet from orbit much earlier than humans.  The French sent even cats into space.  The first animals that circled the moon were turtles. </p><p>  All experiments were conducted to get answers to many questions.  And this concerned not only the possibility of flying in zero gravity.  The experiments were supposed to answer the question of why reproduction in space is impossible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Radiation in space </h2><p>  NASA experts conducted many tests and proved that it is impossible to reproduce in space.  Animals that were conceived in zero gravity, not only could not move normally, they were unable to give birth to offspring.  This proved that dreams of settling and conquering distant planets will remain dreams until mankind invents anti-radiation protection for spaceships. </p>

    <p>  Studies have shown that proton particles constantly affect the human body in space.  It was noted that radiation is capable of ‚Äústerilizing‚Äù embryos conceived outside the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.  The future generation will be simply incapable of breeding. </p><h2>  What will happen to children conceived in space </h2><p>  Scientists have concluded that a girl who was conceived in space, in the ovaries, all eggs die while still immature.  But they are formed in the fetus already in the fifth month of pregnancy.  This fact saddens.  In other words, such girls will be simply barren.  In addition, radiation in space significantly affects the quality of sperm.  It was noted that radiation and high-energy particles severely damage sperm.  As a result of such changes in space, children with genetic defects can be conceived.  That is why reproduction in space is impossible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hazardous particles and emissions </h2><p>  In the space of the vast Universe there are a large number of damaging factors.  Among them, it is worth highlighting <span>cosmic radiation</span> that comes from various sources, as well as particles that fly from the Sun.  Probably, many people know that high-energy protons, as well as heavier ions, which can easily damage DNA, spread in space outside the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.  Alas, even modern technologies do not allow creating a spacecraft that would protect the human body from the negative effects of various radiation and particles. </p><p>  Scientists say that any expedition to the depths of the universe will end at the very beginning.  Reproduction in space is simply not possible until there is special <span>protection against radiation.</span>  Perhaps in the future such technologies will appear.  In the meantime, the DNA necessary for the development of cells of the human body is very sensitive to radiation, which is located in outer space.  Animal experiments have shown that offspring conceived outside the earth's atmosphere are devoid of live eggs.  Their destruction occurs in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy. </p>
