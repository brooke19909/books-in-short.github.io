This science includes a lot of directions.  A geologist is a person studying the bowels of the earth. </p><h2>  The origin of the term "geology" </h2><p>  From Greek, the word "geology" is translated as "earth" and "doctrine."  Initially, the word "geology" - the science of the laws and rules of the earth - was opposed to the word "theology" - the science of spiritual life. </p><p>  When this word appeared, there is no exact date.  Some believe that this term appeared in 1603, and was used by the Italian scientist Ulysse Aldrovandi.  Others believe that the word was introduced in 1657 by a Norwegian scientist and person studying the bowels of the earth, Mikkel Pederson Esholt, then in 1778 it was used by Jean Andre Delyuk.  The word finally came into use in 1779 thanks to Horace Benedict de Saussure. </p><p>  Historically, the term "geognosy" was also used, it was proposed by German geologists G. F√ºssel and A.G.  Werner.  At the end of the XIX century, the term went out of use. </p>

    <h2>  Sections of geology </h2><p>  Geology is a historical science.  One of its main tasks is to determine the sequence of geological events.  Geological research is divided into three main areas: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Descriptive geology - studies the location, composition, shape and size of the geological body, rocks and minerals, as well as the sequence of occurrence of rocks. </li><li>  Dynamic geology - deals with the evolution of geological processes - the destruction of rocks, transport, accumulation of sediments, the <span>movement of the earth's crust,</span> volcanic eruptions, earthquakes. </li><li>  Historical geology - studies the sequence of processes of the geological past. </li></ol><p>  Each of the directions adheres to its principles and research methods.  With the advent of new knowledge, the sections of geology expand, the main sciences today are the following sciences: </p><ol><li>  Earth crust science. </li><li>  The sciences of modern geological processes. </li><li>  The sciences of the historical sequence of geological processes. </li><li>  Applied disciplines. </li><li>  Regional geology. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sections of geology" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32577/757734.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Profession geologist </h2><p>  Often this profession is associated with the romance of travel, bonfires and bearded musicians, but this is only one of its many facets.  A person studying the bowels of the earth has knowledge according to the section in which he works.  The place of work depends on the geology section and the tasks set.  It can be an expedition - the study of the subject in the field.  This may be the creation of projects or research projects - analysis of the information received in the office.  For an oil geologist, work involves finding oil or gas fields.  A volcanologist is a specialist who studies the activity of volcanoes.  What is a search geologist looking for?  He is mainly interested in minerals and minerals.  In construction, knowledge of engineering geology is needed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Geology in Russia </h2><p>  Since ancient times, ore miners and ore miners worked in the Urals and Altai.  They were engaged in the search and mining of iron and copper ores, gems and other minerals. </p><p>  Lomonosov was a man studying the bowels of the earth; he laid the foundations for the development of geology in Russia, thereby avoiding the mistakes of Western European scientists. </p><p>  In the XIX century, the development of mining business began, material was needed for processing.  To this end, exploration work has begun in the Urals, in Eastern Siberia and the Caucasus.  In the course of geological work in Transcaucasia, <span>oil,</span> iron, copper, lead, silver, mineral water sources were discovered. </p><p>  The development of the fuel industry contributed to detailed exploration in the Donetsk basin. </p><p>  Russian geologists, unlike Western European ones, independently came to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe formation of gold placers.  Their place of formation is associated with the destruction of gold veins. </p><p>  <span>Exploration work</span> in the European part of the country has provided a lot of information and material for a new understanding in the structure of the Russian Plain. </p><p>  Based on topographic maps, the first geological maps began to be created.  At the end of the 18th century, the first petrographic map was created. </p><p>  In 1882, the Geological Committee was established.  A detailed study of the Russian Plain began.  In the course of this work, a new direction in geology appeared - paleogeography - a science that studies the physical and climatic situation of the geological past. </p><p>  Work was underway to study deserts, Siberia and Central Asia. </p>

    <h2>  Geology in the Soviet Union </h2><p>  In the era of the Soviet period, the geology of the USSR was dynamically developed and significantly enriched.  After the October Revolution, geological surveys covered more than 35% of the country's territory.  By 1945, it already covered 66% of the state. </p><p>  Expeditions were organized to the <span>Kola Peninsula, the</span> Taimyr Peninsula, the <span>Polar Urals,</span> to the Pechora Basin, Gorny Altai and other areas. </p><p>  A deposit of potash salts of Solikamsk and Bereznyakov was discovered - one of the largest deposits in the world. </p><p>  The search and exploration of oil fields on the territory between the Volga and the Urals began.  Deep drilling gave fountains of oil. </p><p>  Along with <span>mining engineers</span> , geologists of various specialties appear who are engaged in the study of the earth's crust. </p>

    <p>  What is a geologist looking for today?  Almost all major deposits are discovered and explored.  The processes taking place in the bowels of the earth continue to be studied and enrich knowledge of geology.  Answers to many questions have been received, while there are no other answers yet.  For a long period of time, a person studying the bowels of the earth has been gathering information, but new answers raise only new questions. </p>
