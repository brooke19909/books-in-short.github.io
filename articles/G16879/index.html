This is a famous actress Natalia Fisson.  In her life there was a place of love, joy, success.  But a bereavement awaited Natalia in 2014.  This winter, her beloved husband died, with whom she went a long life.  The role of the wife of a famous director, perhaps, was central to her life.  And she, thanks to her energy and cheerfulness, was for Vadim Fisson a support in the difficult moments of his life. </p>

    <h2>  Granite science </h2><p>  Fisson Natalia Vladimirovna was born in Leningrad.  This happened on May 11, 1964. In order to develop her skills, she studied a lot, and graduated not only from the institute in Leningrad, but also from the Brodway Dance Center in America in 1996, and the 1997 Clown School Fillip Golie in England.  In addition, she received a diploma at the Institute of Humanistic Psychology in Denmark, which gave her the opportunity to teach at trainings and courses that develop leadership qualities in a person.  She also teaches women to be stylish, move well and control their emotions at Self-Made Style School. </p><h2>  Not only theater </h2><p>  Of course, all that she received from training was useful to her in her career.  She played her first role in 1990 in the play of her husband, entitled "Bullshit."  At the same time, Natalia began acting in films.  In the first half of the nineties, she had already shown herself in several television tapes.  Among them, “I trust you”, “Nicotine”, “Dance of Death”, “Strange Men of Semenova Ekaterina”  The main role in the last film brought her popularity and the Lenfilm film studio award, which is called "For the best acting work."  Then her talent was noticed and invited to perform in the German circus Pomp Duck and Circumstance.  After she worked in it for two years, she received an invitation from the circus Du Du Soleil.  But Natalia Fisson rejected the tempting offer and returned to St. Petersburg. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Favorite work </h2><p>  The spouses came to grips with their brainchild - the Comic-Trust Theater.  In 1996, the composition of the theater was updated.  One of his performances was "Bullshit", in which, of course, Fisson Natalia played the main role.

Among them are “White Story”, as well as “Anthony and Cleopatra”, “Second Hand”, “SPAM for the Fuhrer”.  The Comic-Trust group occupies its own special niche in the theater world.  The genre of his productions can not even determine the actors themselves.  But the recognition of "Comic Trust" received worldwide.  What they try to convey to the audience with the help of humor is understandable to the audience of all countries in which they visited on tour.  And there are a lot of them.  These are England, Switzerland and Denmark, South Korea and Finland, Georgia, Turkey and others. </p><h2>  Honorary Work </h2><p>  Over the entire period of its existence, the theater has received many awards and not only in our country.

    <p>  Together with her husband, Natalia participated in the charity event “Theater - an accessible environment”, hosted the television program “Energetic People”, in which they talked about the problems of people with disabilities and said that they should not be pitied, but it was worth arranging our lives so that they became accessible to the same as healthy people.  In 2007, she starred in the film "On Stage" by the English director Robertson along with other movie stars.  A lot of things in life have been successful for this woman, and, probably, good luck awaits her, although with the passing of her beloved spouse, the light in her soul went out, illuminating the path of the actress for many years. </p>
