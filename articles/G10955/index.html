This policy must be purchased by each vehicle owner.  Of course, if the contract is urgently needed and there is no desire to argue with a representative of the insurance company, then you can agree to the terms of the company and buy all the additional services. </p><p>  If you do not want to overpay, then you can use the following algorithm.

    <h2>  Quick CTP </h2><p>  Today, in order to purchase an insurance policy, it is not necessary to go to the insurance company personally, since you can buy it through the Internet.  This service is provided by the leader of insurance - LLC Rosgosstrakh company.  To buy a policy, you must go to the official website and visit the section "CTP". </p><p>  First of all, car insurance is calculated.  The cost depends on: type of vehicle, registration of the owner, power, age and length of service of drivers.  Also, do not forget about the discount that every driver earns for a trouble-free ride.  According to the current law, each driver receives a 5% discount for each year without accidents.  The discount is cumulative, and upon reaching 50% does not increase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the calculation, it is necessary to fill out all the necessary information, indicate the terms and make a payment.  In this case, car insurance is issued without <span>life insurance.</span>  If desired, this policy can also be bought on the site for an additional fee. </p><h2>  CTP in the insurance company "Rosgosstrakh" </h2>

This is the only insurer that has a large branch network, so there will be no problems with choosing an office.

    <p>  Rosgosstrakh insurance is issued for the car only if the following documents are available: </p><ul><li><p>  originals of passports of the insured and the owner; </p></li><li><p>  documents for the vehicle: Title or certificate of registration; </p></li><li><p>  driver's license of all drivers (it is allowed to enter 5 drivers in the insurance policy); </p></li><li><p>  diagnostic card if the car is more than three years old. </p></li></ul><p>  Based on the documents, the representative of the insurance company will make a preliminary calculation and announce the size of the insurance premium.  Only after the consent of the insured will the CTP policy be issued. </p><h2>  Additional insurance </h2><p>  When issuing a compulsory MTPL insurance policy, all insurance companies are literally forced to purchase a life insurance policy.  If you think carefully, this is a very profitable type of insurance for a minimal fee.  Thanks to this policy, you can count on decent compensation in the event of an insured event. </p><p>  On average, 8-13 thousand rubles are car insurance.  The cost of additional health insurance is only 1-2 thousand rubles.  It turns out that each driver buys an expensive policy and insures other participants in an accident, but does not care about his health.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to think carefully about whether to purchase an additional insurance product in order to protect yourself from an accident. </p><h2>  Tricks of insurance companies </h2><p>  Many insurance companies, to take out insurance with additional services, go for little tricks.  One of them is the refusal of instant clearance.  Customers who do not want to overpay should provide a car for visual inspection and sign up in the queue for registration. </p>

    <p>  Some companies immediately voice to the client that registration will only be with additional services.  If the client refuses, the representative of the insurance company settles and announces that the discounts are not checked on a single PCA basis, and therefore it will not be possible to draw up an agreement. </p><p>  It turns out that the CTP policy is not so simple.  Car insurance is a legal requirement that forces many drivers to go through a complicated registration process. </p><h2>  Proper insurance </h2>
