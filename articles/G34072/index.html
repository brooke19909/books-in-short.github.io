But the main question that many could not answer for themselves - is it worth taking a mortgage - is still waiting for an objective assessment of the situation.  We‚Äôll turn for it not to bank experts, not to citizens who have been refused or approved, after which circumstances suddenly changed for the worse.  Each of these people cannot give an objective answer.  Let us turn to people who deal with a mortgage every day, and not only are aware of all its advantages, but also face difficulties in processing and paying off debt. </p><p>  Such a person is a mortgage broker or a specialist in mortgage lending.  He will not give an unambiguous answer to our question - is it worth taking a mortgage - but will tell you in which situations it is and in which it is not. </p><p>  Let's start with the most pleasant situation, which is rare in our country.  People take a mortgage if they don‚Äôt have their own housing, and the income allows them to repay monthly payments in the amount of 15 to 20 thousand rubles without affecting the family budget.  This is an ideal borrower for the bank, and it occurs once per 100 clients (if not less). </p><p>  Is it worth taking a mortgage if there is no housing, but you are doing very well with a rent of 9-10 thousand rubles, but no more?  The monthly loan payments will be about the same if you take a one-room apartment in a new house (the developer or investor - the main thing is that it be a legal entity).  This is the most profitable option for a mortgage program.  If you are a bachelor, or a young couple, or an <span>incomplete family</span> with one child - a mortgage is a better option for you than renting an apartment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mortgages are also taken to improve their living conditions, to move to another district or city.  In this case, you do not need a large amount of money, you only need the difference between the cost of the apartment sold and the acquired one (as a rule, this amount is 300 thousand rubles).  And you can well do with a large non-mortgage loan.  Although the rates on such a loan are higher, the repayment period is much shorter and less than the requirements for the borrower. </p><p>  Getting a mortgage in a bank is not easy.  To do this, you need a whole list of documents, a lot of patience and time.  The bank denies a mortgage quite often.  And the main reasons for the refusal are a bad credit history, criminal record, lack of income, which you could at least somehow confirm.  But there are more loyal programs.  For example, Zapsibkombank provides a mortgage even if there is a bad history, but provided that the delinquencies did not exceed more than 1 month, and did not exceed more than 5. </p><p>  You should not take a mortgage if serious changes are foreseen in your life: retirement, divorce, job change, waiting for an addition to your family.  And also if your source of income is unreliable: if it is lost, there will be delays in payments, and subsequently you may lose the apartment you bought.  Then you will be left with nothing. </p><p>  If after what has been said, you still could not determine whether it is worth taking a mortgage, then it is worth consulting with a specialist. </p><p>  In the cities of our country, many brokerage houses are open, almost every real estate agency has specialists in mortgage lending.  Mortgage consultation is usually free.  But if you do not trust intermediaries, then you can always contact a bank employee in the mortgage department.  But you should not be limited to consultation in only one bank.  For a complete picture, it is better to go around all the offices in your city, and possibly in the regional center of your region.  Only then will you find out if the mortgage is right for you and whether it will be given to you.  It is always better to know than to regret that you missed an opportunity. </p>
