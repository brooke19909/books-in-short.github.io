In recent years, the infrastructure of Russian sea resorts has undergone a number of significant changes: new hotels have been rebuilt, many new entertainments have appeared, all the beaches are now equipped with lifeguards, locker rooms and even showers, which makes them as comfortable as possible.  Russian resorts are increasingly choosing for themselves families with small children, not ready for long and tiring flights.  Rest on the territory of Russia allows you to independently decide on how you will get to the resort, where to live, how to organize your leisure.  Accordingly, there is an opportunity to save. </p><p>  Lazarevskoye is an excellent resort on the Black Sea, where neither children nor adults will be bored.  We suggest you take a closer look at it if you plan your trip in the summer.  There are enough chic hotels, there are more affordable options, tourists with limited means can settle in the private sector.  Guesthouse "Salang" (Lazarevskoye) managed to gain a huge number of negative and sometimes terrifying reviews.  What living conditions can he offer?  Why did modern tourists so dislike him? </p>

    <h2>  About the guest house </h2><p>  So, the guest house "Salang" (Lazarevskoye) is located in the resort village near the main attractions - water park and dolphinarium.  In walking distance there is a good beach, the central for the resort - "Cote d'Azur".  This option attracts potential tourists and vacationers with a good location and, most importantly, affordable accommodation prices.  The hotel is really well located: shops, market, attractions, entertainment and, most importantly, the beach, are literally within walking distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  Hotel "Salang" (Guesthouse 1 *, Lazarevskoye) is small, only 36 rooms.  Tourists are invited to choose rooms of various categories: </p><ul><li>  "Standard" - rooms are designed for two and three people. </li><li>  Superior - Room for four people. </li><li>  "Suite" - two-room suite with a view of the coast. </li></ul><p>  Settlement is fast enough, but vacationers advise potential tourists to the Salang Hotel (Sochi, Lazarevskoye) to be extremely attentive.  Quite often, the staff settles tourists in the first available room, which may not correspond to the description and what the tourist is counting on.  Of course, hardly anyone wants to spoil their vacation on the first day, but in any case, the staff must place guests in the hotel that they have booked and pre-paid.  That is why you should be extremely persistent and ask to settle you in the number that you managed to pay. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  It is difficult to expect from the hotel, which does not have any category, something surprising and special.  Of course, going to the sea, we do not plan to spend at the hotel, in particular in the room, a lot of time, we are interested in the sea, beach and resort infrastructure.  Nevertheless, every tourist wants to get a small but clean comfortable room in a quiet area, equipped with a private bathroom with hot water and all necessary bath accessories.  What can the guest house "Salang" (Lazarevskoye) offer to vacationers? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rooms are very small and simple in their arrangement.  If you are used to relaxing in luxury Turkish hotels with a huge surrounding area, you will experience complete disappointment from what you see.  All that is in the rooms is a TV, a mini fridge, an old air conditioning and a bathroom.  ‚ÄúSalang‚Äù (a hotel in Lazarevsky), unfortunately, cannot be called a great option for accommodation, especially in the case of young children.  The equipment is not just old, but very old, in some rooms the air conditioning just doesn‚Äôt work, the visit of the invited specialist does not save the situation.  Vacationers have to spend the night and relax in the suffocating heat. </p>

    <p>  Furniture - minimum, for a family of three there is only one bedside table.  It‚Äôs good that there are enough beds, however, nobody heard about comfort here.  A wardrobe obviously survived a lot of guests, so many vacationers do not risk putting their things in it, they store them in a suitcase.  If you are counting on a modern interior, new cosmetic repairs, the Salang Hotel (Lazarevskoye) is definitely not suitable for you.  Reviews of tourists emphasize that the rooms have not been renovated for a long time, in some places the wallpaper leaves the walls in whole layers, the furniture is old, dry, the condition of the plumbing is poor.  Now for the bathroom.  To wash here without shoes is simply impossible, tourists will not see a set of towels - at best they will give one towel in spots and holes for the whole family. </p><p>  Most of the rooms overlook the wall of the neighboring building, hoping for a beautiful view from the window and the opportunity to enjoy the sound of the surf is definitely not worth it.  By the way, the balcony is common for all vacationers at the Salang Hotel (Lazarevskoye), divided into small zones by insignificant partitions. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has a small shop where you can purchase a minimal set of products.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are held in a small dining room, and check-in at the reception at the entrance to the Salang Guest House 1 * (Lazarevskoye). </p><p>  All vacationers can spend time in the sauna, take a steam bath in excellent company.  For entertainment, the hotel can offer only table tennis and rental of sports equipment.  This is actually not necessary, because the beach has enough entertainment for every taste. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  For an additional fee, you can purchase three meals a day at the hotel.  If you trust the reviews of real vacationers, the condition of the products leaves much to be desired.  There is a complete feeling that tourists are fed stale food, and they cook absolutely not tasty.  Here you will never see fresh bread, pastries, aromatic coffee and especially fruit.  Definitely not worth taking meals, it is better to eat in local cafes and restaurants - there are plenty of them here. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The reception is open around the clock, all vacationers can contact the staff on any matter of interest to them.  "Salang" is a hotel in Lazarevsky that offers good service.  Shuttle services to the airport or train station can be arranged for an extra charge.  At the reception you can get acquainted with the resort's rich excursion program, choose something optimal for yourself.  So, for example, almost all tourists do not deny themselves pleasure and go for jipping - entertainment full of drive, risk and unforgettable emotions. </p>

    <p>  Now, with regard to room service at the Salang Hotel (Sochi, Lazarevskoye).  Many tourists describe the horror that they see in the room during check-in.  There is a complete feeling that no one is cleaning the rooms after the departed guests and certainly does not prepare them for a new arrival, which is simply outrageous.  No one is cleaning the room on schedule.  Moreover, vacationers will have to "catch" the cleaners and ask them to tidy up the room. </p><p>  The hotel has wireless Internet, but do not flatter yourself about the speed of the signal: it is barely enough to exchange messages on social networks.  It‚Äôs stupid to expect that you, as a tourist, will get Internet access in your room - you have to go to the hotel‚Äôs first floor to the information desk, and there you‚Äôll try to catch the signal. </p>

    <h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  There is a beach within a 10-minute walk of the hotel, but there are no complaints about it: cleanliness, developed infrastructure, gentle entry into the water.  Of course, a lot of vacationers gather here in the season, of course, but you can always find a more secluded place if you walk along the coast. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Hotel "Salang" 1 * (Russia, Lazarevskoye) is definitely not suitable for those tourists and vacationers who count on excellent service, room service, as well as comfort.  The hotel is hardly suitable for an overnight stay, and then with varying degrees of success.  Do not overpay for meals, it is better to have breakfast, lunch and dinner in local cafes and restaurants.  You should not choose this hotel for families with small children: unsanitary conditions, dirt and not the best living conditions are definitely not suitable for you. </p>
