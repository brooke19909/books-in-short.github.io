Mobile phones perform a huge number of tasks and cope with all everyday problems. </p><p>  Going on vacation, many do not even take a laptop or camera with them, because all this fits in a compact, but still small phone.  But some are still trying to avoid photos on the phone, because they believe that the quality of the pictures leaves much to be desired.  In fact, you need to figure out how to configure the camera on the phone. </p><h2>  Market situation </h2><p>  Previously, the phone‚Äôs camera was considered rather mediocre, so users rarely used it.  Only in extreme cases in order to capture some moments of his life.  But the pictures went very badly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gearpatrol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camera setup" class="if uuid-2807706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807706.jpg"></div><p>  With the development of the photo industry and the new capabilities of smartphones, it turned out that flagships can more than replace SLR cameras and ordinary ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù.  But with budget smartphones, the situation is somewhat different. </p><p>  Most Chinese models have powerful camera modules, but not all can produce high-quality images.  But the point is not in the manufacturer‚Äôs modifications.  The problem rather lies in the fact that many do not understand how to configure the camera on the phone.  If ‚Äúthe pants interfere with the bad dancer,‚Äù then an inexperienced photographer will not be able to cope with a professional camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Buying a brand new smartphone, most users pay attention to the appearance of the device and the ‚Äútalking‚Äù parameters.  What is meant?  Stores, creating advertising for some phone models, often create a certain image for the device. </p><p>  For example, a smartphone can become a camera phone, despite its mediocre camera features.  Advertising also praises the presence of 3 GB of RAM in the device, while this parameter is considered not an advantage, but a necessity. </p><p>  As a result, the budget phone can be so praised that after the purchase the user will be disappointed without receiving the proper result from the pictures or model performance. </p><h2>  Smartphone selection </h2><p>  In order to figure out how to configure the camera on the phone, you need to evaluate the real capabilities of the device.  More recently, models with a 5 megapixel main camera were considered popular.  The phone seemed to make beautiful and high-quality images. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.softpedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to set up a camera?" class="if uuid-2807708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807708.jpg"></div><p>  But technology is moving forward.  Now a budget smartphone for 200-250 dollars, this is about 14 - 17 thousand rubles., It offers a 13 megapixel camera.  Although the catch now is different: flagships for $ 1,000 (69 thousand rubles) can also have similar indicators of the camera module.  This suggests the idea that these megapixels are very important, which are touted by shops and advertisements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fact is that it is best to pay attention to other characteristics of the lens.  For example, on aperture values.  The smaller this value, the better the image will be even in the evening.  It is also important to have a variety of "chips" that help improve the picture: stabilization, noise reduction, autofocus, extended color range, etc. </p><p>  The more such technologies the camera module has, the less you will have to figure out how to configure the camera on the phone. </p><h2>  Preparing for a photo </h2><p>  But first you need to understand that not only the camera setup, but also the preparation for the photo plays a huge role.  It is important to do a little preparation. </p><p>  For starters, it‚Äôs best to wipe the lens.  This part of the camera can often suffer from fogging or pollution.  Therefore, it is better to immediately wipe the module with a special cloth so that there is no blur in the picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="basic settings" class="if uuid-2807709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807709.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to figure out the right angle.  Not everyone understands that the composition and other "tricks" of photographers often affect the quality of the picture.  Remember that it is undesirable to shoot against the sun.  It is better to remove all unnecessary objects that could ruin the frame. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Despite Instagram fashion taking selfies everywhere and everywhere, most beautiful accounts of this resource are kept with the help of professional cameras.  This once again proves that the front camera can be used only in the case of group photos and some spontaneous moments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rest is better to take pictures on the main module.  To do this, of course, you will have to ask for help from others or get a tripod. </p><p>  Using digital zoom is not recommended.  It is rarely used in professional photography, although the quality of the equipment there allows it to be done.  But the smartphone does very poorly with the approximation.  It loses stabilization, autofocus, which makes the image blurry and grainy. </p><h2>  Basic settings </h2><p>  How to set up a camera on an Android phone?  It‚Äôs worth noting that the full range of settings is available both in the ‚ÄúCamera‚Äù system application and in third-party applications that can be installed from Google Play. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.technobuffalo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camera modules" class="if uuid-2807711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807711.jpg"></div><p>  The main settings are located behind the gear icon.  Here you can adjust the image and video sizes, shooting frequency, image quality, adjust the grid, level, set the date or location.  You can also choose a location for storing photos, adjust sound and control gestures. </p><p>  If you look in your smartphone, you may not find some options.  It all depends on the model.  But it is precisely all of the above options that are available in this submenu. </p><h2>  Manual settings </h2><p>  How to configure the camera on the phone?  Of course, it all depends on individual needs.  But most users recommend using manual settings. </p><p>  Depending on the version of the operating system, certain shooting modes and options will be available to you.  Among the modes you can find "Manual". </p><p>  A line appears at the bottom of the screen where you can adjust a number of parameters.  For example, here you can configure the ISO.  This parameter is responsible for photosensitivity.  He has several indicators, as well as an automatic mode of operation.  The parameter is best adjusted in case of poor lighting, in another situation, its automatic adjustment is suitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lowyat.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manual settings" class="if uuid-2807712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807712.jpg"></div><p>  You can immediately choose the shutter speed.  This parameter delays the open iris for the specified time.  The longer this takes place, the more light will fall on the matrix.  It is necessary to monitor the overexposure.  Excerpts are usually taken during night or evening shooting. </p><p>  Display exposure with plus and minus icon.  The parameter helps to adjust the brightness or darkness of the frame.  White balance allows you to adjust the cool or warm tint of the picture.  Here you can adjust the saturation, contrast of the picture. </p><p>  Some people find it best to use HDR on how to set up the camera on the phone well.  This function, on the one hand, can really make a beautiful shot, and on the other, it is not always applicable.  HDR creates several frames with different exposures, and then combines everything into one photo, which is devoid of darkened or illuminated areas.  The function is best suited for landscape photography. </p><h2>  Camera modes </h2><p>  How to set up a camera in a Samsung phone?  As with any other model that runs on Android, it‚Äôs easy to do this.  It is only necessary to deal with the above parameters and experiment. </p><p>  You can also try using photography modes.  One of the most popular nowadays is Makeup or Beauty Shooting.  This is a mode that smoothes the skin, enlarges the eyes, applies makeup and does everything to improve the portrait picture.  Many people call this feature "mobile photoshop." </p><p>  There is also the option of using panoramas for landscapes.  The mode creates several pictures, combining them into one wide frame.  Slow motion speaks for itself.  It is possible to create a gif animation or blur the background. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mode selection" class="if uuid-2807713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807713.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphone camera setup </h2><p>  How to set up a camera on a ZTE phone?  As mentioned earlier, in general, the setting on different models is practically the same.  But the difference can be noticed if a camera phone came into your hands.  Typically, in such models, in which the emphasis is on the camera module, the menu is expanded, and a huge number of technologies allows you to create colorful pictures. </p><p>  But the above parameters are also saved, which means they can be configured.  The main thing is to deal with the purpose of each, and then experiment to understand the principle of creating photos on a smartphone. </p>
