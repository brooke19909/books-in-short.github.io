The main advantage of the complex, which is mentioned by all tourists, is its incredibly convenient location.  The hotel building, on the one hand, is located in the historical center of the city, and on the other - surrounded by a park area.  The windows overlook Moskovsky Prospekt.  Despite the fact that the complex is located in the central part of the city, it is still a bit far from the roadway, so guests of the establishment have the opportunity to relax.  At the same time, a metro station is located very close to the hotel.  Convenient transportation to the city guests is very important.  Firstly, it allows you to quickly get to the station or airport, and secondly, there is no problem in getting to anywhere in the city.  According to the guests of the complex, it is incredibly convenient in terms of the accessibility of key places in St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="original sokos hotel olympia garden reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2198556.jpg"></div>
