  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Basic laws of chemistry</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Our modern life is unthinkable without the use of many useful products in everyday life, from detergent powders and deodorants to chemical additives in food products.  All the comfort of modern man has become possible in many respects thanks to the achievements of the chemical industry, which over the past 100 years has taken a huge step forward.  The basic laws of chemistry, which were discovered and formulated over the past 3 centuries, formed the basis of many experiments and practical experiments that brought positive results. </p><p>  So, what is chemistry and what is its main task at the moment?  In general, chemistry is the science of substances, their laws and transformations, depending on the properties of the environment.  The basic laws of chemistry are based on knowledge of the properties of the surrounding world, or rather, the properties of various objects of animate and inanimate nature, as a result of which, with a certain technology, a completely new substance with unique chemical properties can be obtained from a certain technology. </p><p>  Today, over 100 thousand organic and about 5 million inorganic compounds are known that are actively used to create a wide variety of substances and preparations.  Thanks to the achievement of scientific and technological progress and the latest computer technologies, in addition to chemistry, related scientific disciplines such as biochemistry and pharmaceuticals have appeared, thanks to which there is an active work on the creation of new drugs and vaccines for dangerous diseases. </p><p>  The basic laws of chemistry include the main postulate - all substances existing on earth can be converted into others, which will differ from the previous ones in properties, composition, structure and appearance.  It is noteworthy that in this science, practical experiments and experiments are extremely important, because after theoretical development and the development of new formulas of <span>chemicals,</span> only a practical result can determine whether this achievement will be implemented in everyday life. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The basic laws and concepts of chemistry include atomic-molecular theory, which tells us that all substances on earth are composed of molecules and atoms that form specific crystal lattices.  In turn, an atom also has in its composition the smallest particles - electrons, which revolve around its nucleus in analogy to our solar system.  After the discovery of the atomic structure, many scientists came to the interesting conclusion that space is strikingly similar to the molecular structure of substances. </p><p>  In addition to the structure itself, the basic laws of chemistry tell us that the nucleus of an atom can have a positive or negative charge, which directly affects the properties of a substance.  Moreover, as a result of experiments, it became clear that a person with the help of various manipulations can change the level of charge of the atom, achieving as a result of changes in the properties of certain substances. </p><p>  Chemistry is a complex science, for the comprehension of the laws of which it may take a lifetime.  Today, many leading scientists are working in this area who are developing new substances and mixtures, thanks to which many of the problems of mankind can be solved.  The most complicated molecular formulas and equations allow preliminary calculations of the composition of the future substance, which requires in-depth knowledge and an <span>analytical</span> <span>mindset</span> from chemical industry workers <span>.</span> </p><p>  If we talk about ordinary citizens, then the basic concepts and laws of chemistry should be known to every person, since this will be of great help to him even in everyday life.  That is why, no matter how we relate to chemistry, its foundations should always be known to modern and civilized people. </p>
