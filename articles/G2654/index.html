    <p>  There is a legend that tells that Andrew the First-Called (apostle) with the preaching of the gospel reached the far north (Valaam Island), where he established a stone cross.  And the founders of the monastic brotherhood are the reverends Herman and Sergius, monks who arrived on the lands of Ladoga in the 10th century from Greece. </p><p>  It should be noted that Valaam was once one of the largest printing centers in Russia.  The monastery suffered the most difficult times from the historical 1917. </p><p>  In the 1950s, disabled war veterans, mentally retarded and tuberculosis patients were settled in the monastery and monastery buildings.  In 1984, the House of Disabled People was closed, and in the 90s the monastery was assigned to the Russian Orthodox Church.  Now it is a monument of world significance. </p><h2>  Valaam Island: attractions, features </h2><p>  The waterway to the island along Ladoga reveals the splendor of the local nature: soft waves of the lake, a breeze, numerous gulls, granite shores with pine groves.  Here you can find a real spiritual refuge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the Valaam archipelago" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1177121.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The entire Valaam archipelago is an amazing historical and natural attraction.  For the most part, tourists come here as pilgrims or as part of tourist groups.  There are independent travelers. </p><p>  In Valaam, there are more than 200 permanent residents, most of them monks. </p><p>  In addition to the monastery, there is also the village of Valaam and a small military base.  For some reason, the relationship between monks and secular islanders is complex, as in Solovki.  On the island, orders are established by church authorities. </p><p>  In the cathedral there is an opportunity to hear the famous church Valaam singing, actively reviving recently. </p><p>  The most impressive and oldest attraction is the monastery of A. Svirsky on about.  Holy 8 kilometers from the monastery.  Almost all the monasteries on the islands attract tourists with their diversity. </p><p>  There are places for those interested in military history.  In the south of.  Balaam preserved the remains of the military facilities of <span>the Mannerheim line.</span> </p><p>  Holidays on the Valaam archipelago - one of the most beautiful, calm and romantic. </p><h2>  The origin of the name of the island </h2><p>  Most likely, the name of the island comes from the Finno-Ugric language "Valamo", which means "high, mountainous land."  And this corresponds to the appearance of the numerous <span>islands of the archipelago.</span> </p><p>  Russian monks considered this name consonant with the name of one of the biblical prophets of Balaam. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For many centuries, when the monastery was the sole owner, the Valaam archipelago gradually turned into a large unified architectural and natural complex. </p><p>  Throughout its history, chapels, churches, monasteries and various outbuildings were built here.  Roads were laid, bridges between the islands were built, beautiful gardens were grown and trees planted. </p><p>  Valaam is one of 4 ‚Äúmonastic republics‚Äù existing around the world (2 of them Meteora and Athos in Greece and 2 in Russia - Solovki and Valaam).  But unlike Solovetsky, whose owner is a museum-reserve, on about.  The Balaam monastic tradition has been revived almost completely. </p>
