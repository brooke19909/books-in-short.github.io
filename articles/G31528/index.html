This is not surprising, because sometimes it is necessary to purchase a product or thing for the home very quickly (within a few days, and sometimes hours).  In this case, it makes no sense to contact the bank for cash, as usually applications for such loans are considered on the order of a week, or even more. </p>

    <p>  But what to do in this situation?  Issue a credit card with an instant decision of the bank, which will be issued directly immediately in its branch.  Thanks to this, a huge amount of time can be saved, because in this case applications are considered from 15 minutes to 1 hour.  After that, the client receives a standard registered QC, which is made directly at the bank branch.  However, it is worth considering that there are certain conditions that a potential borrower must meet. </p><h2>  Features of obtaining a credit card with a passport with an instant decision </h2><p>  To get the coveted plastic, a person must be at least 21 years old at the time of application.  In this case, most often it is required to additionally provide a certificate in the form of 2 personal income tax and confirm your work experience, which is at least six months at the last job. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, some credit institutions have special programs that allow the issuance of a credit card with an instant decision without inquiries.  This usually applies to those who are already a client of the bank.  New customers are required to provide a full package of documents.  For example, you can apply for a Sberbank credit card with an instant decision if a person already has an account with this financial institution. </p><p>  There are also a number of other banks where you can get plastic without additional documents: Otkrytie, Home Credit, Renaissance Credit and many others.  In some organizations, it is additionally required to confirm their solvency, but in certain situations it is possible to provide documents for a car or apartment, thanks to which a bank employee will be sure that in case of non-payment of a loan a person will be able to recover funds in court. </p>

    <p>  However, it should be borne in mind that when you make a QC, you should not count on a reduced credit rate.  As a rule, in any bank, there is a certain grace period during which you can pay the debt without any commission.  As practice shows, few people manage to cope with this.  After the end of this interest-free period, the interest rate on the loan increases markedly, and in this case it is much more profitable to take a consumer target loan than to draw up a card.  Therefore, it all depends on the specific situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Credit Card with Instant Bank Solution: Benefits </h2><p>  Products of this type have several advantages.  First of all, this is a grace period, which was mentioned earlier.  In different banks, it ranges from 30 to 100 days.  During this time, the client can return the previously taken funds to the account without any problems, without paying any interest at all. </p><p>  Keep in mind that money on the card will always be more secure than if the borrower receives it in cash.  Among other things, thanks to QC, it is much more convenient to receive funds while abroad.  In this case, the optimal exchange rate is selected, so that a person loses much less money. </p>

    <p>  Instant credit cards are also issued online.  Consider in which organizations you can issue a similar QC. </p><h2>  "Renaissance Credit" </h2><p>  To get a standard card, it is enough to personally go to the bank branch and provide only one document - a passport.  Immediately after receiving a response on an application, a citizen can receive up to 300 thousand rubles.  <span>The grace period</span> during which you can use the finances of the bank without any fees is 55 days.  After this period, the interest rate rises to 24.9% or 37%, depending on the specific situation: the amount of money borrowed, and many other factors. </p><p>  When issuing a credit card with an instant decision, its annual service will cost 590 rubles.  It is also worth considering that in this case you will have to pay a commission of 2.9% for each cash withdrawal. </p>

    <p>  This credit institution may receive a loan for persons older than 24 years </p><h2>  Touch Bank </h2><p>  This credit institution has a cash back system.  You can receive money on a plastic carrier with one document.  Additional certificates from the place of work in the confirmation of solvency and other documents do not need to be provided. </p><p>  At the same time, in this bank you can get a credit card with an instant decision, on which there will be up to 1 million rubles.  If about 50 thousand rubles remain on the QC, then nothing needs to be paid for the annual service.  The same conditions are provided for those customers who spend about 30 thousand rubles a month. </p><p>  The grace period for using credit funds is 61 days.  After this time, the interest rate is calculated individually.  It can be from 15.9% to 36.9%.  It should be borne in mind that withdrawing cash through an ATM will be unprofitable, since the commission will be 4.9% of each operation. </p><p>  According to the terms of the bank, people from the age of 21 can get a credit card with instant decision. </p><h2>  Raiffeisen Bank </h2><p>  This financial institution also provides similar services.  The grace period, as in many other banks, is 50 days.  After that, the interest rate increases.  You can reduce it to 24% if you provide a certificate of income.  It is also worth considering that the annual maintenance of plastic will be 750 rubles. </p>

    <p>  The maximum loan limit is 150 thousand rubles.  If we talk about the conditions of the bank, then it is worth paying attention to a certain age limit.  Women can apply for a loan between the ages of 21 and 55, and men under 60. </p><h2>  OTP Bank </h2><p>  And in this financial organization, you can also get a credit card with an instant decision.  The cost of its maintenance will be 600 rubles per year.  Some customers prefer to draw up a gold card.  Its annual maintenance will cost 1800 rubles. </p><p>  The interest-free period is 65 days.  The interest rate depends on cash operations.  It‚Äôs best not to withdraw cash through an ATM, as this is not profitable.  If exclusively non-cash transactions are made, then 23.9% will have to be paid.  In this case, the client can count on a loan of up to 750 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews of borrowers </h2><p>  Those people who are not the first time dealing with credit organizations can give some useful tips.  First of all, according to the feedback of borrowers, it is recommended to draw up a QC in the bank where the person is constantly being serviced.  As a rule, in such credit organizations there are always preferential programs for ‚Äútheir‚Äù clients, this also applies to credit cards. </p>

    <p>  In addition, in banks in which people are constantly served, you do not need to provide additional documents.  As a rule, only a passport is sufficient.  If we talk about the best banks and minimum interest rates, then most users recommend contacting Sberbank or other financial organizations that have been in this field for years. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Credit cards have a lot of advantages.  But you need to understand that the percentage of overpayment in this case is much higher.  Such carriers are beneficial only if a person can actually pay off credit debt during the grace period.  In other situations, it is much wiser to get standard loans and wait a while. </p>
