They are familiar with its mode of operation, but they have information that sometimes you can start shopping earlier.  Many users leave feedback that they arrive by 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning.  Some sellers begin work at this time and they are available to purchase goods at a reduced price.  To find inexpensive goods, buyers are guided by a sign with the name "Vostochny", since it is here in the morning that you can buy goods very inexpensively. </p><div class="photo" data-original="socmedia.enisey.tv" data-author=": " data-source="https://socmedia.enisey.tv/news/post-2140/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Market entry" class="if uuid-2232518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/2232518.jpg"></div><p>  The KrasTETs market itself starts operating at 9.45.  Since that time, many consumers can also be found on the market, since in the ranks there are quite a lot of things at reasonable prices.  This market, according to reviews, is one of the most frequent places for shopping with most citizens and visitors.  Those purchases that people did not make on the open market, they often continue in closed pavilions.  Therefore, many note a rather convenient location of outlets next to each other.  There are those buyers who go only to shopping centers from the moment they appear.  Therefore, their feedback on the market is not always positive.  But at the same time, the number of people wishing to visit these shopping arcades does not decrease. </p><h2>  Trading rows of the KrasTETs market </h2><p>  Many buyers are eager to visit the malls also for the reason that you can buy good copies of famous things here.  Market "KrasTETs" (Krasnoyarsk) is one of the famous outlets in the city.  It combines several platforms where it is available to buy a wide variety of products.  Shopping malls occupy a fairly large area in the open air.  Nearby, customers can visit the shopping center with the name "KrasTETs".  In open pavilions, not only Russian citizens often work, but also Chinese, and representatives of nationalities of other countries.  But they most often understand buyers, so they can tell you about the price and the right size.  Sellers do not mind bargaining, since any market in principle implies the possibility of bidding.  Therefore, the marketplace does not lose its popularity now. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ngs24.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://ngs24.ru/news/72987/view/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Market sellers" class="if uuid-2230631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/2230631.jpg"></div><h2>  What will happen to the market? </h2><p>  The KrasTETs market in Krasnoyarsk continues to operate.  Several years ago, information appeared that it could be closed.  But then a clarification was received that reconstruction could occur on the territory.  The appearance of the KrasTETs shopping center is to some extent an update and improvement of the terms of trade in this place.  It is also planned the possible construction of an underpass or bridge, which will make the movement of pedestrians more comfortable. </p>
