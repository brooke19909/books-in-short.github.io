    <h2>  Car tax </h2><p>  First, find out what the transport tax is all about.  It is always important to know and understand what you are paying for.  This payment applies only to owners of vehicles equipped with motor engines.  Paid to the regional treasury of the state for registration with the traffic police.  And annually. </p><p>  It turns out that the transport tax is an individual payment for each subject of the Russian Federation.  It is calculated using simple formulas.  Every citizen can check the tax on the car.  There are many options for this.  But first, you need to understand how much to pay. </p><h2>  How to count? </h2><p>  Road car tax is crucial.  Without paying it, you will not be able to drive a vehicle.  So, you should worry about its payment in advance.  How much will the car tax be in one case or another?  It is impossible to answer unequivocally.  As already mentioned, this is a regional payment.  Each city of the Russian Federation has its own standards.  But knowing the main components, you can easily calculate the exact amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="find out car tax" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201330.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How?  You will need to know the tax rate in your city.  It makes up the road tax on the car.  For cars, trucks and other cars, it is individual.  You will also have to take into account engine power (in horsepower), tenure and date of issue of the car.  The cost will also not be superfluous.  After all, there is a so-called increasing coefficient.  It is needed when the average price of transport (passenger) is at least 3,000,000 rubles. </p><p>  What's next?  The standard formula that helps you find out how much to pay (car tax) is multiplying the rate by the amount of horsepower in the engine.  If the vehicle is owned for less than a year, then the amount received is additionally multiplied with the quotient from dividing the number of months of ownership by 12. </p><p>  Do you have a luxury and expensive car?  In this case, you need to multiply the standard formula by the increasing factor.  And when exactly the same transport is owned less than 12 months, the second proposed option is multiplied by the ‚Äúincrease‚Äù.  That's all.  Now you know how you can calculate the amount due.  What about debt verification?  You can find out the tax on the car, as already mentioned, by several methods. </p><h2>  STSI and tax </h2><p>  The first way - a personal appeal to the traffic police or tax authorities in your city.  Here you will need a TCP (if there is no payment), as well as a passport (civilian) and TIN.  This data will help you learn about your debt. </p><p>  It is enough to come to the appropriate department, inform about your intentions and present all the necessary documents.  After some time, they will tell you how much you have to pay and how long.  Sometimes you can ask for a hand payment.  Actually, if you lost the previous account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car road tax" class="if" height="195" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201329.jpg" width="600"></div>

But, nevertheless, these options are not in special demand.  After all, if you are thinking about where to check the tax on the car, you can use the Internet.  This is a modern solution to the problem. </p><h2>  Receipt </h2><p>  But before this, take your time.  You can check the tax on the car and the old "old-fashioned" way.  Which one?  Just wait until the next tax alert comes to your mailing address.  It will definitely have a receipt for payment. </p><p>  This document displays the amount of tax, as well as your debt.  Just remember: the longer you wait, the higher the debt.  Fines grow daily.  Therefore, many citizens do not like this method.  So, you can use other methods. </p><h2>  Government services </h2><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter, we are interested in the tax on old cars or on new ones.  The fact remains - in all cases, debt is recognized by the same principles.  For example, a modern approach to solving the problem is an appeal to the "State Services" portal.  It is here that with the help of a profile you can not only find out the tax on the car, but also pay it.  It is also possible to draw up some documents online. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to check car tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201328.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What do you need to verify debt?  Firstly, a working account and authorization.  As soon as you go through it, search for "debt-transport tax." </p><p>  Secondly, you need your TIN.  Or personal passport details.  Select the exact payment search method in the list that appears (the second option is more convenient) and complete the request.  That's all the problems are solved.  The screen displays the amount of the debt and the penalties currently assigned to you.  Now you can pay. </p><h2>  Payment of public services </h2><p>  The next resource that can help you find out the tax on the car is the service "Payment of public services."  Here you can not only see it, but also pay with a credit card.  Registration is not needed, so the portal is in great demand. </p><p>  Go to it, and then in the search bar, type "debt, transport tax" or "transport tax".  Next, you will need to select "By TIN" (search for the debtor).  Enter your details in the window that appears and click on the operation button. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much car tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201327.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After a few seconds, information about your debt will appear on the screen.  Here you will see not only the tax assessed for payment, but also the size of the fine, as well as the penalty.  Next, you will be available to make a payment.  If you wish, you can immediately implement the idea and print a <span>receipt of payment</span> directly from the site <span>.</span>  True, here you must write the bank details of your card. </p><h2>  Tax website </h2><p>  It is no secret to anyone that in Russia the tax authorities have a single site that provides all the interesting and important information.  Here you can contact the tax authority in your city or see all your debts. </p><p>  How it's done?  You can check the car tax by selecting the item "Individuals - checking debts" on the official site "tax.ru".  Attention: the inscriptions may differ, but their meaning does not change.  Next, enter your details.  For example, TIN.  Or data about your car.  You can do with simple passport data, but this is not recommended. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much to pay tax for a car" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1201326.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It's all.  To accomplish this task, you will have to bring a payment (optional), passport, bank card (or cash), TIN, certificate of ownership (preferably, especially when contacting the tax office), TCP.  As soon as you make the payment, save the receipt.  It may come in handy for you in the future.  On average, such a document needs to be stored for 3-5 years.  Henceforth, try to pay taxes on the car as soon as possible.  Otherwise, you can find many problems.  An exception is made by citizens related to beneficiaries.  In each region they are installed individually.  The exact information will be provided by your <span>tax office.</span> </p>
