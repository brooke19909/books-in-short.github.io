These include a whole series of devices that are related by the name Classic.  Among them is the subject of our review today - ‚ÄúNokia 2700‚Äù, a photo of which you can see in this article.  Many drew attention to it.  Apparently, the design was simply copied by the developers from the 6700 model. A similar trend was noticed not only by the Finnish manufacturer.  The same can be said about Motorola. </p><h2>  About design copying </h2>

    <p>  Have you ever noticed the actors who are standing at the corresponding buildings in Moscow, outwardly copying Stalin or Lenin?  These actors are accessible and popular, you can take pictures with them, but they have never had excessive popularity, no, and most likely will not.  Here the same thing can be said about the younger models of mobile phones that get their own design, as they say, by inheritance.  We can say that the main apparatus, which gives rise to such a peculiar subline, ensures the demand for the younger generation of devices.  But he himself will never be obscured by them, no matter how many they are. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Options ‚ÄúNokia 2700‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  The manual, as always, is the main component of the package.  Together with it, the composition of the documentation is completed by a <span>warranty card</span> for a period of up to one year (factory).  If desired, in the mobile phone salon it will be possible to issue a company guarantee, which will extend the term by one more year.  In addition to documents, the device itself includes a device, a lithium-ion battery for it (with a capacity of 1050 milliamps per hour), a memory card with a capacity of 1 gigabyte (MicroSD standard), a wired stereo headset of good quality, and a standard charger. </p><h2>  Design, appearance </h2>

    <p>  ‚ÄúNokia 2700‚Äù, reviews of which you can find at the end of the article, is nothing more than the most ordinary candy bar.  The mass of the device is 85 grams with the corresponding dimensions: 109.2 mm in height, 46 mm in width and 14 mm in thickness.  The case does not have right angles.  All of them are neatly smoothed for the convenience of using the phone.  As mentioned earlier, the shape of the case was copied from the older model.  That is why the bottom case is narrower than the top, but at the same time the device fits perfectly in the hand and is in a reliable condition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A few words about specific dimensions and carrying </h2>

    <p>  Made ‚ÄúNokia 2700‚Äù, the repair of which can be carried out using a warranty card, made of plastic.  There are elements disguised as chrome.  However, in fact, these inserts are nothing more than ordinary repainted matte plastic.  The Nokia 2700 phone comes in the market of mobile devices only in one color design.  This, of course, is a classic black color. </p><p>  There are several modifications to this model.  For example, 2730. It has an advanced filling that allows you to use the phone in third-generation cellular networks.  By the way, this phone is made in a different color scheme. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rear panel </h2>

    <p>  What can we see from the back?  Here we have the main camera module.  It has a resolution of 2 megapixels.  The camera eye is made of the same chromed plastic as similar inserts in other locations.  Below you can see the corporate inscription, as well as a decorative insert.  For the sound speaker, the engineers decided to make a special hole.  It is located even lower.  The grate was bent outward.  Why so?  Well, in any case, there were practical reasons for this.  The fact is that the device, if it lies on the table with a speaker, will work stably in this regard, since the element itself does not overlap the surface.  Consequently, sound waves propagate, we can say, in the normal mode. </p><h2>  Top end </h2>

    <p>  It accommodates all the connectors that are designed to use the communication capabilities.  This is a two-millimeter socket in which the charger is connected.  There is also a 3.5 mm standard connector.  It is designed to integrate a wired stereo headset, which can be used to play multimedia files through the player or to use the built-in analog FM radio.  Of course, you can‚Äôt count on impeccable sound quality.  However, if earlier you used a cheap Chinese player for these purposes, then you will certainly be happy with a decent alternative.  Well, the microSD connector, which is necessary for synchronization with a personal computer or laptop, completes this whole composition. </p><h2>  Right end, left end </h2><p>  Here we have only a slot in which you can integrate an external microSD memory card.  Like the MicroUSB port, it is covered with a protective plug made of plastic.  On the opposite side there is only a hole that can be used to thread a cord or strap there. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  At first glance, it may seem that the display is protected by glass.  This is another camouflage trick.  In fact, the protection is represented by ordinary plastic.  Immediately it should be noted its low quality and suitability for those functions that engineers assigned to it.  Plastic is very quickly able to collect just a huge amount of dust and dirt.  That is why the user is required to constantly monitor the external state of the screen and regularly engage in cleaning it.  At the top of the front panel we can see a hole.  There is a conversational speaker.  If you compare it with the corresponding element in Samsung Corby, then the first one wins definitely.  In general, the speaker is quite strong and high quality.  The microphone is located somewhere under the keyboard, between the numbers 6 and 3. It would seem that the engineers did not choose the best location.  However, it was repeatedly confirmed that even after such a peculiar focus, the quality of voice transmission in no way changed and did not suffer. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNokia 2700‚Äù: specifications </h2><p>  For the exchange of multimedia data in a wireless mode, a bluetooth function is provided.  There is a built-in email client.  It is possible to synchronize with a personal computer or laptop via the MicroUSB port.  The diagonal of the display is 2 inches, despite the fact that the resolution is 320 by 240 pixels.  Everything is standard, as usual.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using TFT technology.  There is no problem with color rendering at this level, but viewing angles, of course, suffer. </p><p>  The camera has a resolution of 2 megapixels.  There is a video recording function.  It is shot at a resolution of 176 by 144, while images are 1920 by 1080 pixels.  The frame rate for movie shooting is 15 frames per second.  Built-in memory - only at around 64 megabytes.  At the same time, the device supports embedding external drives up to 2 GB in volume.  Not impressive and a set of multimedia features. </p><p>  The software has an integrated audio and video player.  You can set your own ringtones and ringtones to the call, but they must first be converted to mp3 format.  To use an analog FM radio, you need to connect a wired stereo headset.  For this, a 3.5 mm standard jack is provided.  You can record using the built-in voice recorder. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Currently, the cost of this phone is two thousand rubles.  And what can the reviews of those who purchased the model tell us?  Poor viewing angles are immediately recorded in the flaws.  Although color reproduction is good, but only in conditions of optimal illumination.  In other words, the picture will mercilessly fade in the sun.  The model of competitors represented by other companies has a lot.  The same ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù.  The disadvantages also include not very high-quality manufacturing materials. </p><p>  The phone does not perform special functions, it just looks like an ordinary ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  There are no special music keys.  The display is small in size.  There are no volume keys.  Among the advantages are not the worst design, loud speaker, tangible vibrating alert.  Well, perhaps, ergonomics.  The composition closes with good communication quality, traditional for devices of the Finnish manufacturer. </p>
