    <p>  Going to the village of Betta (boarding house "South"), be sure to visit the Safari Park, dolphinarium, oceanarium or water park.  Here, exciting trips in jeeps to dolmens and Plisetsk waterfalls are organized.  These places are fraught with many mysteries and bewitching beauty.  In the center of Gelendzhik night bars are open for young people. </p><h2>  Digest </h2><p>  Words of gratitude sound from tourists to the administration of this complex.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased with the delicious food, well-maintained rooms and a friendly atmosphere.  I especially liked the sea, located within walking distance.  The beach is clean, the water is warm, the waves are small.  Shady pine trees, fragrant firs and <span>magnolia flowers are all around.</span>  It was not in vain that he won the fame of the most hospitable <span>resort of Krasnodar Krai</span> (Betta).  Yuzhny is a boarding house that does not overestimate the prices of the services provided.  He is constantly ennobled and takes care of the guests. </p>
