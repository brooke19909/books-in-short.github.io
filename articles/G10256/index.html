How to get and replenish a Corn credit card?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A good analogue of a bank loan at the time of making overseas trips can serve as a credit card.  If you repay the debt in a timely manner, then you can use the money an unlimited number of times.  Previously, they were only issued by banks.  Today in Russia, Euroset and Svyaznoy offer to issue such a plastic payment instrument.  You will learn more about what kind of "Corn" card, which bank serves it, from this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank does the corn service" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/756659.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Decor </h2><p>  You can purchase a card through a branch of Euroset, Svyaznoy, or in the pharmacies Doctor Stoletov.  For registration you only need a passport and money.  Two types of cards are in circulation: regular and World.  The first one costs 200 rubles and allows you to accumulate 1% of all purchases.  World is issued free of charge, but you need to immediately transfer 3000 rubles to the balance.  and spend them.  Holders of these cards will be able to accumulate 1.5% of each purchase.  Through the pharmacy network of Doctor Stoletov, you can get only a regular card. </p><p>  The procedure takes 5 minutes.  Immediately after its completion, an SMS with a code word arrives on the user's phone.  It must be used for all calls to the Call Center, including to obtain a PIN code.  The card is not registered.  It can be taken abroad.  But it is possible that there will be problems with settlements in local stores.  Therefore, it is worth pre-ordering registered plastic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank does the corn service" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/756661.jpg" width="600"></div>

Already having it in hand, you can apply for a credit limit.  Each of the 5 financial institutions in Russia has its own terms of service for such a product as the Corn Card.  Which bank is better, each client determines independently. </p><h2>  Bonuses </h2><p>  Cards work like other credit cards.  Money can be withdrawn in cash at ATMs, transferred to other accounts, and paid by bank transfer of purchases on the Internet and at points of sale.  Among the additional features there is a bonus account: 1-1.5% of all cash costs are converted into special points.  They can then be used to pay for goods in stores: 10 bonuses = 1 ruble.  Regardless of which bank serves the "Corn" card, points can only be used at the points where they were accumulated.  These are Euroset, Svyaznoy, Perekrestok, a network of Stoletov pharmacies and TNK refueling stations. </p>

    <p>  Feedback on the "Corn" bonus card confirms that such a scheme is not entirely convenient.  Not all customers monthly buy goods in stores of the hundredth connection.  Experts recommend using bonuses in pharmacies or saving them for a whole year, and then refuel 2-3 times for free. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Money transaction </h2><p>  One of the disadvantages of this type of card is the limited methods of replenishment of the account.  Balance money can only be credited with a personal presence at the Euroset, Svyaznoy or TNK filling stations.  Users can transfer funds to each other through the "My Account".  Here you can also attach another card issued by Mastercard and transfer funds from it instantly.  Without commissions, transactions are made only from Sberbank and Tinkoff plastic payment instruments.  Here's how to apply for and replenish a Corn credit card. </p><h2>  Withdraw funds </h2><p>  Corn is not an ordinary card.  To withdraw funds from it without a commission, you must use the loan repayment function through the "My Account" section of the "New Payment" menu.  There you must indicate the number of another Mastercard debit card and transfer money to it already. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to draw up and replenish a credit card corn" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/756663.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Terms of financial organizations </h2><p>  You can connect a credit limit to the Corn debit card.  But since stores alone cannot provide loans, partner banks and <span>microfinance organizations</span> were involved for these purposes <span>.</span>  Let us consider in more detail their conditions.  Regardless of which bank serves the "Corn" card, they have almost the same requirements for customers: </p><ul><li>  citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  availability of a job and permanent income; </li><li>  borrower age - from 21-25 to 57-64 years. </li><li>  To apply for a loan, you must provide a second identification document. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="review of bonus card corn" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/756665.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Home Credit Bank provides customers with a credit line for a period of 6 to 36 months in a maximum amount of 50 thousand rubles.  at a rate of 46.9% per annum.  At Alfa Bank, a loan of 40 thousand rubles.  can be obtained for one year at 44% per annum.  Service fee is much higher than with standard cards.  In addition, the bank meticulously checks the documents and does not always approve applications.  If a refusal has come, and you still need to draw up a card, you can apply to MIGCREDIT.  Organizations provide a loan of 20 thousand rubles.  for a period of 4-24 weeks, provided that the account is replenished every 2 weeks.  This scheme is not beneficial to every client.  Especially when you consider that the interest rate in such institutions is 2 times higher than the banking one. </p><h2>  Other offers </h2><p>  Tinkoff Bank offers its customers more interesting conditions: </p><ul><li>  interest rate: from 28.9 to 36.9%; </li><li>  limit - 300 thousand rubles; </li><li>  grace period - 55 days from the date of the first withdrawal; </li><li>  service fee - not charged; </li><li>  cash withdrawal: 1% of the amount, minimum 100 rubles .; </li><li>  penalties in case of delay in payment: 0.2% of the amount for each day, a one-time commission - 590 rubles .; </li><li>  minimum monthly payment - 6% of the debt amount. </li></ul><p>  Which bank serves the Corn card on similar terms?  The Renaissance.  The credit limit and grace period in this organization are similar to the previous one.  The difference lies in the interest rate (24-79.9%), cash withdrawal fees (3-4%) and higher penalties.  For violation of the terms of payment, the client will have to pay 20% of the debt amount.  The minimum monthly payment under the terms of the program is 5%, but not less than 600 rubles.  For the activation of SMS-informing services for a year you will have to pay 750 rubles. </p><h2>  Conversion </h2><p>  We should also discuss the payment of goods in foreign currency.  Regardless of which bank serves the Corn card, the currency will be converted twice at the Central Bank rate.  The first is on the day of purchase.  The amount of goods +2% will be blocked on the account.  When paying for services in foreign currency, money is not always debited from the account on the day of purchase.  Most often, a foreign bank needs 2-3 days to confirm the transaction.  Therefore, the second conversion of funds will occur at the time of debit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="then for a corn card which bank serves it" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/756664.jpg" width="364"></div>

    <h2>  Example </h2><p>  The man paid for goods worth $ 100.  On this day, the course was 35 rubles.  The account will be blocked: 100 x 35 + 2% = 3570 rubles.  After 48 hours, a confirmation came from a foreign bank.  The Central Bank rate on this day is already 35.1 rubles.  It will be debited from the account: 35.1 x 100 = 3510 rubles.  The difference is 60 rubles.  will be refunded to the account.  Many credit cards work under this scheme, including the Corn card.  Which bank serves the client is not important in this case.  The charge-off procedure is the same. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card corn which bank is better" class="if" height="193" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/756660.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The second nuance: regardless of the currency in which the value of the goods is indicated, rubles will be debited from the account after preliminary conversion to dollars or euros. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Russians have the opportunity to purchase goods on credit, without waiting for a salary and without saving money for a long period of time.  For these purposes, a special card "Corn" is provided.  Which bank serves it in Russia?  Alfa-Bank, Renaissance, Tinkoff, Home Credit.  The client can independently choose any of them.  The product has several advantages: a small package of documents, an application can be made online, the minimum requirements for borrowers.  But to insure their risks, banks provided for higher interest rates for servicing cards and penalties for violation of the terms of repayment of debt. </p>
