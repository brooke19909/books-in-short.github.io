In size, it takes the second place among all the inland waters of this country.  Throughout the day, Alakol’s waters change their color several times.  In the morning, the lake pleases the eye with delicate turquoise, and at the end of the day, azure tones predominate.  Changing the color palette is also influenced by weather conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Geographic data </h2><p>  Most travelers know exactly where Alakol Lake is located - next to the Celestial Empire, at the intersection of the borders of two regions - East Kazakhstan and Almaty.  The pond covers an area of ​​2700 km <sup>2</sup> and lies at an altitude of 347 meters above sea level.  The depth of the lake is 50 meters and the length is 102 kilometers.  Width reaches 54 kilometers.  Alakol's water warms up to 24-26 degrees, and it tastes like sea water - the same salty. </p><p>  The reservoir has undeniable medicinal properties, because its waters contain all the elements of the periodic table.  The only exception is iodine - it is not observed in the waves of Alakol.  Doctors recommend relaxing on the lake to those who suffer from skin diseases, diseases of the musculoskeletal system, and disorders of the nervous system.  And, of course, here you can strengthen the general condition of the body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Other healing properties of the lake </h2><p>  Alakol Lake, in addition to the above, has a number of useful properties.  Ancient legends tell that the reservoir has a miraculous power that relieves fatigue and irritation, removes pain in the joints, brings peace and good mood.  Alakol was famous for its healing waters in the distant past.  And today, his fame continues to spread throughout the world.  The great conqueror Genghis Khan, along with the Tumen, stopped in this area to heal the wounds received in the battles.  After several centuries, astronauts came here, so that the waters of Alakol cleaned them of radiation exposure.  Underground sources feed the lake and have a beneficial effect on the human body. </p><p>  Men benefit more from treatment with Alakol waters than women.  Nevertheless, despite gender differences, one can get rid of psoriasis, urticaria, eczema, neurodermatitis, respiratory ailments, osteochondrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and radiculitis. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to your destination </h2><p>  You can get to Lake Alakol in different ways.  One of them is air travel.  So, first you need to fly to a city called Semey, and from there you need to take a bus or car to the Semipalatinsk coast.  If you want to get to the Almaty coast, you will have to go here from Taldykorgan or from Almaty itself, buying tickets to the village of Koktum.  People who do not like flights can also use rail.  In this case, the train will take you to Semey, and there you need to take a taxi or transfer to the bus, and after a short bus trip, Lake Alakol will open its arms to you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The first person to explore Alakol Lake (photos of this natural object are presented in the article) was G. Karelin - a famous traveler and natural scientist.  In 1840, he visited the Balkhash-Alakol basin, located at the foot of the Dzungarian Alatau.  After a short amount of time, L. Schrenk, an equally famous traveler, showed interest in this area.  He was the first to measure the area of ​​a natural reservoir.  The academician wrote that it is equal to 1700 km <sup>2</sup> .  In 1862, these data were refuted by <span>A. Golubev.</span>  His research showed that the water surface area increased, and the length of the reservoir was 70 km, and the width was 40. </p><p>  In 1931, these figures increased even further: to 75 and 48 kilometers, respectively, while the depth was four meters.  These measurements were made by B. Terletsky.  Exactly 20 years later, V. Kurdyukov began to study the water body.  His data were as follows: the depth of the lake is 90 km, the width is 50 km, and the depth is 34 m. Over the past few years, the area of ​​Alakol has increased even more. </p>

    <h2>  Some more facts </h2><p>  Some sources claim that in ancient times, Lake Alakol had a completely different name - Gurgen-Nor.  From Mongolian it is translated as “Lake of Bridges”.  Probably, a long time ago, the land that shared the chain of lakes was somewhat reminiscent of bridges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Not a single river flows from Alakol itself.  But then small water streams flow into it: Zhamanty, Urjar, Tasty, Zhamanutkol, Khatinsu and Emel.  Many of them dry out during the summer.  The remaining streams remain “alive” due to the fact that, going down from the Dzungarian Alatau, they go into the underground bowels and continue to flow there.  And they flow into Alakol already as powerful rivers. </p><h2>  Aigerim </h2>

    <p>  Kazakhstan, Lake Alakol in particular, is a place that has all the conditions for a comfortable stay of tourists.  In this area there are a huge variety of boarding houses and tourist centers.  But the Aigerim holiday home is the most successful.  It is located in that part of the lake, which is located on the side of the East Kazakhstan region (Urjar district).  This is a fairly large area with an area of ​​six hectares.  There is the necessary infrastructure and hotel rooms for every taste and budget. </p><p>  For those visitors who want to save some money, the administration offers standard economy class rooms, and people who are not used to saving can settle down in one of the wooden houses. </p><p>  What does Lake Alakol offer travelers?  Recreation facilities (“Aigerim” in particular) have a paid car parking (if you arrived by your own vehicle), playgrounds (if you are on vacation with children), entertainment complexes with billiards, shooting gallery and tennis.  To diversify the vacation of its customers, the management every day organizes dances with live music, concerts with the participation of local pop stars, and KVN competitions.

    <h2>  Lake Attractions </h2><p>  Alakol is a lake (the map is shown just above), which has one unique attraction.  We are talking about the reservoir Zhalanashkol.  This is a single system.  Its waves, like the waters of Alakol, are known for their healing qualities.  And if Variegated Lake heals male ailments more, then Zhalanashkol is more able to help women.  Local healing mud cures infertility, helps to restore peace of mind, solve many women's problems and contribute to the acquisition of psychological stability.  The healing features of both reservoirs are best studied.  Scientists are also well aware of the diseases that these sources help get rid of.  In some holiday homes located on this territory, tourists can ask for a list indicating all the ailments that can be cured with the help of the waters of these miraculous lakes. </p><h2>  Some more recreation centers </h2><p>  Alakol is also unique in that it is the only body of water on the entire planet where there is a black beach.  The coast consists of well-rounded gravel and pebbles.  The weather on Lake Alakol contributes to a favorable rest: in the summer, the water here warms up to 20-25 degrees.  And in its composition, it resembles the Dead and Black Sea.  In addition to the recreation center “Aigerim”, on the lake there are also such wonderful complexes as “Zhalyn”, “Pelican”, “Dorozhnik”, “Barlyk Arasan” and other institutions. </p>

    <h2>  Barlyk Arasan </h2><p>  Separately, I would like to talk a little about this place.  After all, this is probably the only complex on Lake Alakol that treats dyskinesia of the gallbladder and biliary tract, pleurisy, neurodermatitis, chronic pancreatitis and gastritis, <span>seborrheic eczema</span> and other similar diseases. </p><p>  The resort is located in the southern part of the Semipalatinsk region, in the Barlyk valley.  Lake Alakol itself is located 20 kilometers from the base.  This is the only holiday home on this coast.  An important role in the healing process is played by such natural factors as clean air, picturesque landscape, steppe forbs, bathing in the bitterly salty lake Alakol.  Walking in the area strengthens the immune system, energizes vacationers with positive energy and provides an opportunity to get real pleasure from everything you see. </p><p>  Visit these unique places and see for yourself that this is truly a beautiful corner! </p>
