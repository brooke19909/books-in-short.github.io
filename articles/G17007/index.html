    <h2>  Impressions of tourists about the hotel, its room stock and location </h2><p>  According to travelers, Mirador 3 * is located on a quiet and calm street, so here you can safely relax away from city noise.  The center of Rimini is only two bus stops from the hotel.  So you can easily reach it on foot, making a pleasant short walk.  In addition, the hotel is very close to the beach - about a hundred meters. </p><p>  The hotel "Mirador", according to our compatriots, is quite compact.  So, you will not find huge halls and spacious apartments here, because this is still not a luxury hotel.  But this hotel is very cozy, and there is enough space in it for comfortable accommodation of all guests.  The hotel has a restaurant and bar.  Wi-Fi is free in the lobby and some of the rooms.  The reception desk here, by the way, works around the clock. </p><p>  As for the rooms of Hotel Mirador 3 *, then, according to tourists, they are very clean and comfortable.  It is noticeable that recently a repair was made.  Furniture and appliances here, of course, are not new, but everything is in good working order.  The rooms have a refrigerator, TV (though without Russian channels), a hairdryer, a safe (free, unlike most other hotels), air conditioning (open from 7 pm to 6 am), a furnished balcony.  Some rooms have an electric kettle.  If necessary, at the reception you can ask for an iron (free).  There are a lot of sockets in the room, so there will be no difficulties with charging phones and electronic gadgets.  In a small bathroom, in addition to the basic plumbing, even a bidet fits.  Hot water, according to the guests, is always there.  A small minus for those who come here from November to March will be the fact that the rooms at this time are quite cool, as they are not heated.  However, this feature is characteristic not only for Mirador, but also for many Italian hotels.  Therefore, if you are used to spending the night in a warm room (even subject to the availability of blankets), it is better to choose a warm season for travel. </p><p>  As for cleaning in this hotel, it is carried out very high quality and daily.  Towels are renewed every other day, and linen once a week.  Maids also regularly replenish toilet paper and soap. </p>

    <h2>  Comments of tourists about food at the Mirador Hotel </h2><p>  Most travelers staying at the Mirador Hotel (Rimini) opted for the half-board option (breakfast and dinner).  According to our compatriots, breakfast at the hotel can not be called particularly hearty and varied.  However, this fact is the norm for budget hotels in Europe.  So, in the morning, guests at the restaurant are offered bakery products, butter, jam, dry cereal, tea, coffee and fruit.  As for dinners, most tourists consider them quite worthy.  So, the daily menu includes salad, soup, pasta, fish or meat dishes, as well as fruits as a dessert. </p><p>  In addition, there is a supermarket near the hotel where you can buy almost any product of your choice.  There is where to store them, since there are refrigerators in the rooms of Mirador.  If you do not plan to eat at the hotel, then you can have lunch and dinner at any of the local restaurants and cafes, of which there are a great many in Rimini.  By the way, experienced travelers are sure to recommend to all tourists traveling to Italy not to indulge in pleasure and try the local pizza and pasta.  According to our compatriots, these dishes here are almost everywhere perfectly cooked. </p><h2>  The opinion of the guests about the hotel staff </h2><p>  The vast majority of our compatriots were very satisfied with the staff of the Mirador (Rivazzurra) 3 * hotel.  According to them, all the staff here are friendly, friendly and always happy to help.  If upon arrival at the hotel you are not comfortable with the proposed room, then inform the reception at this and, if there are free rooms, you will be relocated to the best room without any problems.  Also, if you return to the hotel in the evening after a hectic day of excursion and are late for dinner, you will be delivered food directly to the room.  The same is with breakfast.  So if you plan to go on an early excursion, you can ask for breakfast to be prepared early.  Hotel staff never refuse guests such requests.  In addition, our compatriots were pleasantly surprised by the fact that part of the hotel staff speaks Russian.  This is very convenient, because you don‚Äôt have to remember the course of the school English program.  So, the employees of Mirador will be happy to tell you everything in Russian, answer questions, give a map of Rimini and advise the most interesting places to visit. </p>
