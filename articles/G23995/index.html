His story began five thousand years BC.  e.  At that time, the first inhabitants settled on a hillside, which is now known as Alcudia.  To this day, the city remains attractive to tourists.  Its stunning beauty and sights are no less interesting than a resort holiday on the coast.  It is about the beautiful city of Elche in Spain that will be discussed in our article. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  In the fifth century BC, settlers founded the first town, which was called Iliki.  And to this day, locals sometimes call it Ilisitano.  Later, Elche (Spain) became a Roman colony.  In those days, the city flourished, taking an active part in trade with neighboring villages.  The close proximity to the coast made it possible for citizens to trade with other countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldeasyguides.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo Elche Spain" class="if uuid-2910199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2910199.jpg"></div><p>  During the reign of Elche, Muslims built irrigation canals.  However, such improvements did not save the city from decline.  Gradually, he lost his significance.  In 1250, King Alfonso of Castile recaptured Elche from the Muslims and drove them away.  Since among the exiles there were artisans and rural workers, the city was on the brink of ruin.  The situation was further exacerbated in the thirteenth century.  For the next two centuries, the city survived solely through the cultivation of almonds, oranges and footwear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1871, the city of Elche in Spain, King Amadeus I gave the status of a city.  Already at the end of the nineteenth century, jute fiber and shoe factories began to appear here.  At the same time, infrastructure began to develop, a railway appeared.  A very difficult period for the city was the beginning of the twentieth century.  The civil war brought famine and devastation.  The situation began to improve only in the middle of the century.  To this day, tourism and the footwear industry dominate in Elche (Spain). </p><p>  Despite the fact that at present there are not many archaeological and architectural monuments in the city, it is very interesting.  There is something to see here. </p><h2>  Palm grove </h2><p>  The main attraction of Elche (Spain) is the famous palm grove.  It is considered the largest in Europe.  The natural site has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Initially, the grove was planted by the Moors for the sake of receiving dates.  This brought a steady income.  Currently, the grove has more than 170,000 palm trees.  An interesting fact is that the age of some trees reaches 200 years.  The height of palm trees is from thirty to forty meters.  In the forest, special paths for tourists are designed, recreation areas and ponds with lush vegetation are equipped. </p><p>  Experts suggest that the Phoenicians brought palm trees to Elche, but Arabs began to cultivate and grow plants.  Palm became the first tree that a man began to grow for his own benefit.  Plants gave people not only food, but also building materials.  The palm juice inside the trees makes them resistant to the effects of fire.  Plants are very convenient for cultivation, because they are unpretentious. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="aete.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Elche Spain" class="if uuid-2910194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2910194.jpg"></div><p>  Among the palm wealth of Elche (Spain) there is the Priest's Garden, which was named after Jos√© Castagno Sanchez.  He was the owner of the garden until 1918.  The size of the grove is not so large and reaches 13 km.  sq.  A thousand palm trees grow in it, the age of some of them reaches 300 years.  In addition, pomegranates, oranges, lemons, Chinese dates, carob, jujube grow in the garden. </p><p>  The pride of the park is the Royal Palm, which was named after Empress Sisi.  Now the tree is 165 years old. </p><h2>  Church of St. Mary </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Elche (Spain) it is worth highlighting the Church of St. Mary.  The temple is located on the very spot where in Muslim times the main mosque was located.  On its ruins was built the first Catholic church, made in the Gothic style.  In 1492, a new building was rebuilt, which was washed away by heavy rains.  The latest version of the structure is a combination of elements of different styles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alicantetoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Elche Outlet Spain" class="if uuid-2910200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2910200.jpg"></div><p>  It is believed that the Ascension to the Virgin Mary took place here.  This event became the basis for the appearance of an important city holiday, which became a symbol of Elche. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The temple has a bell tower, which you can climb to admire the palm grove and cityscape. </p><h2>  "Lady of Elche" </h2><p>  A mystery called ‚ÄúThe Lady of Elche‚Äù (Spain) is inextricably linked with the history of the city.  An amazing monument of ancientiberian culture was found in 1897 in the suburbs.  It is made in the form of an unusual bust of a girl.  Experts suggest that the monument was made in the fourth century BC.  e.  An unusual hairstyle of a girl and a headdress attracts attention to the bust.  A hole was made at the back of the monument for some purpose.  The bust was exhibited in the Louvre, where it made a real scientific sensation.  In 1941, ‚ÄúThe Girl from Elche‚Äù returned to the vastness of Spain, once in the Madrid Museum ‚ÄúPrado‚Äù.  Currently, the bust is in the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.spain-holiday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Elche Spain Attractions" class="if uuid-2910192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2910192.jpg"></div><p>  But on the streets and squares of the city, tourists can see copies of the famous sculpture.  Small figurines are sold as souvenirs for guests. </p><h2>  Altamira Palace </h2><p>  What to see in Elche (Spain)?  One of the outstanding attractions of the city is the Altamira Palace.  Locals still remember that a weaving factory once worked within the walls of the building.  The palace has recently been completely renovated.  Now it is one of the best preserved fortresses in the entire province of Alicante. </p><p>  The construction of the architectural complex was carried out in several stages.  The first dates from the 11th-13th centuries, when Muslims dominated the city.  From that time to the present, fragments of the city wall, part of residential buildings, gates, drainage canals and the main tower of the palace have survived. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.topschoolinspain.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Elche spain reviews" class="if uuid-2910202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2910202.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the palace was continued in the 15-16 centuries.  It was at this time that the building acquired its current appearance.  And only in the eighteenth century the manor house was built in the form of a polygon.  In the eighteenth century, the building was a prison, which functioned until 1959.  Later, the castle housed the workshops of a weaving factory.  Later, the palace passed into the jurisdiction of the city council, thanks to the efforts of which restoration work was started.  After repair, the Archaeological Museum was located in the walls of the palace. </p><h2>  Archaeological area </h2><p>  A few kilometers from the center of Elche is the archaeological zone of La Alcudia.
