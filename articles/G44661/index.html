Tens of thousands of tourists come here from all over the world every year.  This island is very popular among domestic travelers.  Three-star hotels are in the greatest demand here.  This is not surprising, because 3-star <span>Rhodes hotels</span> may well compete with Turkish or Egyptian four-star establishments. </p><p>  Today we want to familiarize you with one of the hotels of this category.  It is called Loutanis 3 * (located in the town of Kolimbia).  In the article we describe what is offered to guests here, as well as what impression was left on our compatriots from the rest in this hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel in question is located in a place called Kolymbia.  It should be noted that this settlement is changing right before our eyes.  So, a few years ago, he was an ordinary small fishing village.  Now Kolymbia is gradually turning into a fashionable resort area.  Here hotels of various levels of stardom are being built, restaurants are being built, etc.  In addition, Kolymbia boasts an excellent beach, the road to which passes through a picturesque eucalyptus grove. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the nearby interesting places, here you can distinguish the small village of Archangelos, which has long been famous for its ceramic products and carpets, as well as the Valley of the Seven Springs (a picturesque area with a beautiful lake and its sources). </p><p>  You can travel around Kolymbia by bus.  The stop is just a hundred meters from the Loutanis Hotel.  The distance from Hotel Loutanis 3 * to Rhodes is 25 kilometers.  The hotel is 35 kilometers away from the airport.  So it will take you less than an hour to arrive at the air harbor on your way to the hotel. </p><p>  Since tourists mostly come to Greece mainly for a beach holiday, when choosing a hotel for living, people are guided by their proximity to the sea.  As for the hotel in question, the nearest beach is 600 meters away.  Thus, you can reach the sea in just 10-15 minutes at a leisurely pace. </p>

    <h2>  Loutanis 3 * (Rhodes, Kolymbia): description and photos of the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel complex first opened its doors almost a quarter century ago, in 1990. In 2010, a global reconstruction was carried out here, so today Lautanis is a fairly modern and comfortable hotel.  Guests are invited to stay in one of 127 rooms located in four two-story buildings.  The number of rooms here is represented by standard, as well as family comfortable and equipped with all necessary apartments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel has a restaurant and bar.  Food is organized on an all-inclusive basis.  The hotel complex has a swimming pool with a section for children and a sun terrace.  Hotel Loutanis 3 * is perfect for families with children and older tourists, as well as young people looking for fun and vivid experiences. </p><h2>  Posting Rules </h2><p>  Like many other hotels, Lautanis has a set time for check-in for both guests and guests.  So, check-in of travelers in rooms of the type booked by them is carried out after two in the afternoon.  However, this does not mean at all that if you arrive at the hotel much earlier than the indicated time, you will have to spend several hours near your own suitcases in the lobby.  The administration of Loutanis Hotel 3 * (Rhodes, Kolymbia) always tries to meet the guests and does everything possible to accommodate travelers immediately after their arrival.  However, at the peak of the tourist season, this is not always possible due to the 100% fullness of the hotel complex.  In this case, you will be asked to leave your things in the luggage room and go for lunch, take a swim in the pool or take a walk around the area. </p><p>  On the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated until 12 noon.  Then you need to pay for the entire stay (if you have not previously paid the full cost of travel to a travel agency) and for using additional services.  You can pay at the reception both in cash and with <span>Visa and Mastercard</span> cards <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Loutanis 3 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  In order for tourists planning to stay during their <span>holidays in Rhodes</span> in this hotel to have a more complete impression of him, we give generalized comments from our compatriots who spent their holidays here.  In general, the Russians considered this hotel to be a good one, maximally corresponding to the declared level of stardom.  If you consider yourself an unassuming tourist, then you will surely like it here.  But we suggest paying attention to details. </p><p>  Most of all our compatriots were pleased with the location of the hotel.  So, from here you can very quickly get to the mass of <span>attractions of Rhodes.</span>  In this case, it is not necessary to book an excursion.  Simply rent a car, take a taxi or public transport. </p><p>  The remoteness of the hotel from the beach also confused few people, as a bus takes the guests to the sea.  So if you do not want to go to the beach on foot, then you can get to it completely free.  However, experienced tourists recommend, if possible, not to be late by the time of departure of the bus, since he will not wait. </p><p>  As for the rooms, they seemed to travelers quite acceptable.  Some guests considered the rooms cramped, but this did not cause any problems.  Since the hotel is not new, there are some interruptions in the operation of a particular technique.  However, contacting the administrator will allow you to solve any problem as soon as possible.  Some of our compatriots were a little embarrassed by the lack of channels in Russian, but, according to them, during a vacation it is quite possible to do without watching TV. </p><p>  As is the case with many other hotels, the issue of food caused the most controversial comments.  So, someone found the food quite acceptable, and the choice of dishes sufficient.  According to tourists who adhere to this point of view, there is always enough food (meat, chicken, seafood), and it was simply impossible to stay hungry.  Another group of travelers assures that the choice of dishes is poor for a three-star hotel. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that most of our compatriots staying at Lautanis were satisfied with the choice of a hotel for their holidays in Rhodes.  In their opinion, the hotel is consistent with the declared three stars and the cost of living.  They advise this hotel to tourists who want to economically and comfortably relax on the Greek island of Rhodes. </p>
