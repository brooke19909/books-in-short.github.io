    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  <span>The children's railway</span> in Moscow was built by pioneers.  Its design began at the end of 1935, and two years later more than two kilometers of the railway were built.  During the May holidays of 1937, the most significant event occurred - the launch of two trains.  Initially, they had the name: VL-1 (in honor of Vladimir Lenin) and IS-1 (in honor of Joseph Stalin). </p>

    <p>  During the war period, the children's road was removed and hidden, it was restored by students only after a grand victory.  The total distance of the path today is 3.8 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Subsequent reconstruction </h2><p>  For 50 years, various improvements have been made to this project so that the children's railway in Moscow is as close as possible in reality: </p><ul><li>  In 1957, new wagons were ordered from Poland.  The old IS-1 was decommissioned.  Instead, they put a new diesel locomotive TU2-078. </li><li>  Until 1963, the attraction worked only in the summer mode, but after the introduction of some adjustments, it began to work all year round. </li><li>  In 1971, a major overhaul was carried out, and in 1972 the road received a new steam locomotive TU2-129. </li><li>  Since 1982, wagons of the PV40 passenger steam locomotive, which are used today, were replaced by the old ones. </li><li>  The last time on this road was overhauled in 2005, during which all the main roads were replaced. </li></ul><p>  The children's railway, the photo of which is presented in our article, is successfully working today. </p>

    <p>  The local administration is very sensitive to this attraction.  And annually, work is carried out here that supports its functioning. </p><h2>  Features of traffic </h2><p>  The described railway is intended for the transport of small children.  In summer, two steam locomotives run here, each of which has six wagons attached.  Initially, only three stations were created to stop, namely: "School", "Youth" and "Pioneer".  On each of them there are special entertainments for a different age category.  Not so long ago, in 2006, a new stop appeared - "Children's". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  An amazing feature of this road is that all organizational work is carried out by schoolchildren, whose age is from 11 to 17 years.  They drive vehicles, sell tickets, carry out repairs and perform other important tasks.  Previously, they are trained in specialized circles of young railway workers. </p><h2>  Timetable </h2><p>  There is a very convenient schedule for the children's railway.  But keep in mind that transporting children here is only possible under favorable weather conditions.  During heavy rain or at a temperature of about 30 ¬∞ C, the road is closed. </p><p>  It works only four days a week (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday).  Opening hours from 10:00 to 18:00.  However, before you go on a trip, you should first call and find out about the movement of trains on a certain day.  For example, as already mentioned, passengers may not be carried due to weather conditions.  In addition, sanitary work can be carried out here once a month. </p><h2>  About the fare </h2><p>  The ticket price for a children's railway depends on how old the passenger is.  So, children are considered to be from 2 to 10 years old.  The ticket price for this category is only 120 rubles.  An adult will need to pay 160 rubles.  Kids up to two years old can travel accompanied by a parent for free. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The most famous children's railway in Moscow, is located approximately 40 kilometers from the capital of Russia.  You can get to the village of Kratovo, where the educational buildings are located, from the Kazan station on the train number 6620, 6222 or 6106. You can also get to this place by car.  However, it is worth considering that near the station of the children's railway there is a very small parking lot, which is almost always crowded with cars. </p><p>  We should also talk about the area on which the popular attraction is located.  There is a lot of vegetation around, which makes the surrounding air unusually fresh.  In addition, an excellent clean pond is located on the territory of the entertainment complex, the beauty of which simply cannot leave you indifferent. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that at the stations there are a large number of attractions for children designed for the youngest guests - these are colorful children's towns, slides and swings.  You can also rent cars here.  Parents can wait for their kids on cozy benches. </p>
