    <h2>  Deep sea </h2><p>  Phuket Island is a mecca for diving enthusiasts.  The sea surrounding the island is inhabited by a rich and diverse underwater world.  There are also some wrecks near the island.  It is here that you can feel like a real explorer of the deep sea.  From the Phulin Resort 3 * hotel (Phuket), reviews of which are very positive, excursions are organized to the <span>Similan Islands, the islands of</span> Koh Tachai and Koh Bon, to the Richelieu rock, where whale sharks and stingrays are circling, as well as to the Cruise Cruise ship, which lies at a depth of 30 meters. </p><h2>  Architectural masterpieces </h2><p>  Thailand is a country of temple Buddhist architecture.  Guests of the Phulin Resort 3 * hotel will be offered trips to the Tiger Temple, Wat Sirey Temple, which are located nearby.  All temples necessarily have their own legend and their own history, which are associated with the island and with Buddhist beliefs and ideas about life.  It is also worth visiting the local mining museums and Tai Hua, and on the way to learn a lot of interesting things about the history and traditions of Thai culture from a guided tour. </p>

    <h2>  Snow-white Karon </h2><p>  The beach closest to the hotel is Karon.  As the guests of the island say, neither Patong nor Kate can compare with the purity of water and the snow-white sand on Karon.  The beach can be reached by shuttle, which runs from the hotel to the beach and back, or you can take a leisurely walk along the green streets along endless benches with local souvenirs, pharmacies and clothing stores. </p><p>  On the way to the hotel, we recommend choosing a local restaurant and a snack.  Here guests are always welcome, and the menu is very diverse.  You definitely need to try fresh seafood, which will be cooked right here, in front of visitors, and traditional <span>Thai dishes that</span> combine the seemingly most incompatible tastes.  They are both sweet and salty, sour and spicy. </p>
