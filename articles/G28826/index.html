    <p>  In the Lyubertsy district, the settlement of Kraskovo, the village of Marusino, a block of three-story apartment buildings ‚ÄúMaloye Pavlino‚Äù was built.  The distance from the Moscow Ring Road is only 10 km, which makes housing here popular.  Like many other low-rise residential complexes <span>near Moscow,</span> in this everything is designed so as to create the most convenient space for families with children. </p><p>  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã4.3 hectares 17 residential buildings with a standard and improved layout have been erected, there is all the necessary infrastructure and high-quality landscaping of the surrounding area has been completed.  According to customer reviews, one can find decent economy-class housing here, while all the necessary social structures and institutions will be within walking distance. </p><h2>  "Joy" </h2><p>  ZhK Otrada is located in the Krasnogorsk district, 3 km from Pyatnitskoye Shosse metro station.  The club-type residential quarter consists of 4-5-story houses, which are distinguished by improved finishes and interesting planning decisions.  According to those who have already purchased an apartment here, this is an ideal place, as there are forest parks around the housing estate, the Sinichka River flows nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the end of 2016, it is planned to commission the third phase of the LCD.

    <p>  According to the project of Otrada residential complex, an underground parking for 560 places will be built here.  In the immediate vicinity are numerous shops, cafes, large institutions.  Many buyers focus on the fact that they gave preference to this residential complex due to the environmental component of this territory and the absence of noise from the highway. </p><h2>  Rublevsky suburb </h2><p>  In the Krasnogorsk district, the Rublevskoye Suburb complex is located.  Many say that they would like to live in such an autonomous and completely closed from outsiders, mini-city. </p><p>  Among the advantages of choosing an apartment here, many buyers note the prestige of the location, favorable environmental conditions, unique infrastructure and affordable prices even for business-class apartments, which not all low-rise residential complexes in the Moscow region can boast of. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Among the minuses, those who have already bought housing here note limited bandwidth, which makes the accessibility of the named place worse.  But, having bought an apartment here, you get the opportunity to live in a modern building with high-quality engineering systems and developed infrastructure. </p><p>  For example, the underground parking in the LCD is thought out to the smallest and is located underground, which saves space and keeps the air clean.  The territory of the complex is well-maintained and clean, it is possible to use the free space for arranging recreation areas here.  The complex has kindergartens and schools, a medical center, shops, an entertainment complex, a sports center and a kids club, and much, much more. </p><h2>  "New Landmarks" </h2><p>  LCD "New Landmarks" is a unique <span>residential complex</span> in which the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe most open space is realized: all sections are fenced from each other only by a low forged fence.  Six hectares of territory are reserved for parks, playgrounds for children, and for many this is the main parameter when choosing an apartment. </p><p>  The low-rise complex was built on the basis of wood-frame technology or monolithic-brick, and buyers have the opportunity to choose it.  You can buy housing here under the mortgage programs of various banks.  You can get to the village in the urban district of Mytishchi by Altufevskoe highway - it is located only 2 km from the Moscow Ring Road. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  If we analyze the reviews about the residential complex ‚ÄúNew Veshki‚Äù, then we can conclude that among the positive aspects, buyers primarily note a well-developed infrastructure - there are kindergartens and schools near the complex.  Secondly, a convenient location: you can enter the village from the Moscow Ring Road.  Thirdly, buyers consider the use of modern construction technologies a positive side.  But among the minuses, the emphasis is on insufficient landscaping. </p><h2>  ZaMitino </h2><p>  On Pyatnitskoye Shosse (11 km), just 10 km from MKAD, there is Zamitino residential complex.  This is a modern <span>residential complex,</span> built in an ecologically safe zone and located in the immediate vicinity of Moscow.  Well-developed infrastructure, the availability of sports grounds, cozy alleys, beautiful landscaping - all this cannot be appreciated, especially if you are tired of the city. </p><p>  The project was built using modern construction technology using a ceramic block for arranging walls and ceilings.  Facing of buildings is made of imported bricks, due to which the architectural appearance of the building resembles classic English castles. </p>

    <p>  Many people preferred the apartments of the ZaMitino residential complex due to the high-quality equipment of the buildings and the round-the-clock dispatch service.  Probably, it is modernity and safety that are the main parameters that, as positive, attract the attention of buyers. </p><h2>  "District" </h2>

    <p>  Special attention is given to the Zarechye business-class residential complex located in Zvenigorod.  A good location, environmental friendliness, lack of industrial enterprises nearby is what attracts the attention of buyers to this LCD. </p><p>  As they say, developers have done everything to live here as comfortable and cozy as possible.  For example, with a small number of storeys (up to 6), you can get to the apartment by elevator.  The residential complex ‚ÄúZarechye‚Äù also presupposes a free layout, which is also very convenient - there is an opportunity to equip housing in accordance with your own preferences. </p><h2>  Marusino-2 </h2><p>  In the Lyubertsy district, in the village of Marusino, a 5-storey residential complex "Marusino-2" is located.  The distance from the Moscow Ring Road is only 9 km.  On the fenced area there are several five-story buildings, apartments in which are already fully finished, that is, you can call in and live.  However, many buyers who are "being led" to the opportunity to enter the purchased apartment immediately, note that the "Marusino-2" with a fine finish of the problem. </p><p>  In many reviews, there is an emphasis on the curvature of walls and floors, windows that do not open, leaking roofs, and many other unpleasant moments.  So not all low-rise residential complexes in the immediate Moscow region are pleasing in quality.  And some also talk about the failure of planning decisions, which is why the rooms are very small. </p><h2>  Sacramento </h2>

    <p>  If you like low-rise buildings, pay attention to the Sacramento residential complex, which is located on the 13th km of the Gorky Highway, in Balashikha.  The distance from the Moscow Ring Road is about 14 km. </p><p>  Sacramento is a low-rise complex that offers affordable housing in a promising and popular format today.  Each house is built on the basis of modern technology so that each tenant has a minimum number of neighbors.  Surrounded by forests, <span>comfortable apartments, the</span> presence of a kindergarten, cafe and other institutions - this complex is ideal for family living. </p><p>  When choosing low-rise new buildings near Moscow, pay attention to construction technology and decoration.  So, for example, in the Sacramento residential complex, each house is built using warm, seamless technology, which guarantees excellent heat-shielding properties of the rooms. </p><h2>  "Prominent" </h2><p>  If you want to buy housing in a new microdistrict, then pay attention to the LCD "Vidny".  As buyers note, among the advantages of buying an apartment here, it is possible to note a fenced area, competent architectural and planning organization, a beautiful and spacious pedestrian boulevard and squares, and a recreation area. </p><h2>  Andersen </h2><p>  <span>Low-rise construction</span> in the Moscow region is underway at an active pace.  For example, the Andersen complex is located 11 km from the capital along the Kaluga Highway.  It was built as part of the integrated development of the territory with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 20 hectares.  You can enjoy your vacation in the spacious public area. </p><p>  In addition, developers have focused on suburban recreation: the distance from the apartments to the floodplain of the Desna River is some 50 m. And also around is a forest that is protected from deforestation.  Among the advantages of buying apartments here are the optimal planning decisions, quality materials, cozy areas and a variety of areas of apartments. </p>

    <p>  Thus, we can conclude that low-rise buildings in the suburbs are becoming increasingly popular.  The format of houses from 2-5 floors seems to many to be compact and more comfortable, especially if they are built near Moscow, in the lap of nature. </p><p>  Low-rise buildings are in great demand, and therefore developers will strive to satisfy this demand and offer more and more comfortable and profitable housing. </p>
