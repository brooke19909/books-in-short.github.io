It is very popular among guests with children.  Comfortable rooms, a warm atmosphere and good service make your stay a pleasant one. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Themis Beach Hotel 4 * is located eight kilometers from the famous <span>Heraklion</span> International <span>Airport,</span> in the resort town of Kokkini Hani.  The complex is located right on the coast.  It was built in 1980 and has since been successfully hosting guests within its walls.  In 2000, the hotel was completely renovated.  A hundred meters away is a stop. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Themis Beach Hotel 4 *, as we already wrote, is located in the village of Kokkini Hani.  Currently, this small village in Crete is considered a resort.  It is located east of Heraklion.  From Kokkini Hani fifteen kilometers to the capital of the island.  That is why the road to Nikos Kazantzakis Airport does not take much time.  Not so long ago, the village was an ordinary fishing village, in which there was an inn for farmers transporting products for the capital's markets.  And today it is a quite successful resort with a well-developed infrastructure.  The village got its present name thanks to the innkeeper, who built his establishment in this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="themis beach hotel 4" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1469158.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the evenings, guests can enjoy music shows and entertainment. </p><h2>  Rest for children </h2><p>  Themis <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Crete), the</span> photo of which is given in the article, positions itself as a hotel for families with children.  Therefore, the presence of animation is a prerequisite.  The hotel has a children's club with a team of animators, there is a pool for kids and a playground for games with slides and swings. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  What is good about Themis Beach Hotel 4 * <span>(Crete)?</span>  <span>Guest</span> reviews are delighted with the hotel's beach.  The hotel complex is located right on the beach.  There is a narrow road between them and the beach, which ends in a dead end in the hotel area.  Therefore, it is almost impossible to meet a car here.  Having passed the road, you find yourself on a beautiful sandy beach.  There are sunbeds and umbrellas on it.  Unfortunately, they are paid.  However, no one will mind if you sit on your towel directly in the sand.  Sunset at sea is gentle and comfortable for children, and the water is always clean.  Calmness is rare.  More often there are waves, but not strong ones.  It is very interesting to jump on them with children. </p><h2>  Trips and excursions </h2><p>  Tourists should understand that when you buy a trip to Themis Beach Hotel 4 *, Crete (tours do not include sightseeing programs for local attractions), you should definitely think about a cultural holiday program in advance, that is, consider what is worth seeing in Crete.  This wonderful island is full of interesting and beautiful places. </p>

    <p>  Of course, you can book excursions at the hotel, but they are quite expensive in Crete.  Each will cost at least 30 euros per person.  It is much easier to rent a car for a few days and travel the whole island on it.  This is what all knowledgeable tourists do.  I would like to note that vacationers who plan to spend time not only on the beach, but also see the sights, will not be disappointed.  The fact is that in the vicinity of Kokkini Hani there are many interesting places.  Near the resort, archaeological excavations are underway, during their investigation the Minoan house was found with all the utensils, which have been perfectly preserved to this day.  Scientists suggest that such a large and rich dwelling once belonged to the priestess. </p><p>  Anapolis Village is a short drive from Kokkini Hani.  It has a wonderful water park called WaterCity.  If you want to have fun and have fun with your whole family, then you definitely need to visit this wonderful place.  The water park has 34 attractions.  In the southeast of Anapolis there is an old monastery of St. John the Evangelist.  Outwardly, it looks more like a fortress than the dwelling of monks.  Such a powerful structure was necessary to protect against pirate raids.  Not far from Hokkini Hani is the famous Cretan Aquarium, which contains a rich collection of marine inhabitants of the Mediterranean Sea.  It accepts guests only from May to September. </p><p>  From Kokkini Hani, you can even take a bus to Agios Nicholas and Heraklion to see the sights there.  By renting a car, you can generally go around the whole island.  Among tourists, trips to the Lassithi Plateau, to the Palace of Knossos, the cave of Zeus, Spinalonga, <span>Balos Bay</span> and to the island of Gramvousa are especially popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="themis beach hotel 4 crete tours" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1469193.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since Heraklion and its port are quite close to Kokkini Hani, you can easily take a boat trip to Santorini - the most popular and famous island of Greece.  Relaxing in Themis Beach Hotel 4 *, you can order an individual tour.  Its main feature will be that together with the guide you will determine the travel plan and the list of attractions that you would like to see.  The guide will devote time only to you all day.  Of course, such a trip will cost you more, but there will be much more impressions from it. </p><h2>  Themis Beach Hotel 4 * (Crete): tourist reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of vacationers.  Is Themis Beach Hotel 4 * really so good?  Room reservation in the complex is carried out in advance, especially if you want to get a room with a sea view.  Getting to the hotel is very easy.  Check-in takes place quite quickly, no one makes you wait until 12.00, even if you arrived much earlier.  Tourists note the courtesy and friendliness of the staff.  It is worth noting that very responsive people live in Crete who are always ready to help if you explain the essence of your problem to them. </p><p>  The rooms in the complex are small, but they have everything you need, plumbing works fine.  The hotel itself is not new, there is absolutely no chic and gloss.  It is a budget option for an inexpensive vacation.  The rooms also need renovation, but they are clean and well maintained.  Maids are cleaning every day.  Vacationers do not advise them to leave a tip, since their presence in no way affects the quality of cleaning.  Towels are changed daily.  Unfortunately, the hotel does not have slippers and bathrobes, and from cosmetics there is only soap and shampoo.  The hotel itself has a fairly simple design, there are no beautiful interiors.  Everything is done in a concise and modest style.  Even the lobby is not at all impressive. </p>

    <p>  The main restaurant offers its guests good food.  The food is always served very tasty and varied.  The dishes of European and Italian cuisine prevail.  Near the hotel there are a large number of local restaurants, they can always have a good and inexpensive meal.  The bars on site throughout the day offer refreshing drinks and various snacks. </p><p>  The beach of the hotel is very nice and really clean.  Of course, paying two euros a day for a sunbed is expensive, so our compatriots, as a rule, relax on free sun loungers near the pool, and then go swimming in the sea.  Since the hotel is located on the shore, go to the water no more than three minutes.  In the season it is very warm, children swimming is a pleasure. </p><p>  The hotel has one significant drawback - it is the Internet.  Wi-Fi not working in rooms.  You can use it only in the lobby, and even then when there are few people, because during peak hours the Internet simply does not attract so many users. </p><h2>  Cultural program </h2><p>  The children's animation is just great.  Kids are hard to pick up from the club, they really like it there.  Adult animators who attract guests to daytime sports events also work well.  And in the evenings, entertainment programs await tourists in the amphitheater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="themis beach hotel 4 standard" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1469184.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Kokkini Hani is a small village, but it has good infrastructure.  There are two large supermarkets, many cafes and restaurants.  In the evening there is where to go on the promenade if you are not interested in the entertainment program at the hotel. </p><p>  Tourists are certainly advised to visit the most interesting places in the village and its environs, as well as a trip to Heraklion.  Crete has many historical and beautiful places.  To see them, it is best to rent a car.  This will significantly reduce your time, and reduce the cost of excursions.  It is imperative to visit the water park and the aquarium.  These institutions cause complete delight not only in children, but also in adults. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The hotel is highly recommended for families with children.  However, it should be emphasized that it is suitable for those tourists who do not make high demands.  But as a budget option, it is quite good.  Here you will not see new flat-screen TVs or beautiful interiors, but you are provided with fun leisure, a nice beach, a warm sea and fascinating excursions. </p>
