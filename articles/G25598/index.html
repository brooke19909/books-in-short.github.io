The most popular among customers is the possibility of processing a deposit or the so-called bank deposit.  Thanks to this option, every citizen of the Russian Federation can earn additional money only on the fact that he keeps finances in the account of the banking structure.  In fact, customers receive extra interest simply because they are the owners of the account to which the money comes.  No additional manipulations are needed for this. </p>

    <p>  Another important fact is that the state of the Russian Federation provides insurance of savings in the amount of 700 thousand rubles.  This means that in a situation where the bank does not fulfill its obligations, deposits will be returned to the owners within a specific amount at the expense of the authorities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, for many it is a huge plus that VTB 24 ATMs are available in any region of the country. </p><h2>  Ease of use of VTB 24 products </h2><p>  And if we talk about programs and benefits for pensioners, then it is worth considering some interesting points.  First of all, a citizen of the Russian Federation does not have to leave home in order to perform certain transactions on the account.  This is important for senior citizens, for whom every trip to the street is fraught with many difficulties. </p><p>  You can manage your accounts via the Internet while sitting at home.  In addition, in your personal account on the official website of the bank you can track all operations performed, as well as specify exactly what account balance is presently present on the deposit and what is the amount of interest for its use.  This option is very convenient. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth noting that ruble and foreign currency deposits in VTB 24 for pensioners can be inscribed in a will.  In this case, the relatives of the depositor will be able to inherit and receive interest that accrued on the deposit.  Pensioners also have access to power of attorney, so they can also save themselves from going to bank branches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to choose the right deposits at VTB 24 Bank for pensioners </h2><p>  Elderly people are not always able to immediately navigate the many programs of financial organizations.  First of all, it is worth deciding on the currency for the deposit.  By and large, each tariff has its own savings options in rubles, dollars and euros.  Therefore, here you can act on the basis of your own preferences. </p><p>  Also worth paying attention to the deadline.  For example, if it is at least 3 months, then some tariffs may not be suitable.  It is also worth approximating the amount of placement on deposits in VTB 24 for pensioners.  If it is from 100 to 200 thousand rubles, then it is most profitable to make a deposit via the Internet. </p><h2>  How to open a deposit </h2><p>  Today, in order to draw it up, you can contact the bank in person or fill out an appropriate application via the Internet.  In the first case, it is necessary to prepare a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and additionally check with a bank employee by phone or via the Internet which documents are required today for a deposit. </p><p>  After that, you need to fill out the appropriate application and conclude an agreement directly in the bank branch itself.  At the next stage, it will be possible to deposit the required amount through the cashier.  If registration is carried out via the Internet, a term deposit will be available for pensioners in VTB 24.  It is very comfortable. </p>

    <p>  Being on the bank‚Äôs page, just go to the ‚ÄúDeposits‚Äù tab, familiarize yourself with the proposed conditions and confirm your readiness to open a deposit.  After that, it will be possible to transfer money to an open account through an existing card from another current account. </p><p>  To date, deposit rates for pensioners at VTB 24 differ depending on the chosen tariff plan. </p><h2>  "Comfortable" </h2><p>  This type of contribution has several advantages.  First of all, it is worth paying attention to the fact that a pensioner will be able to withdraw funds at any time convenient for him.  At the same time, interest is recalculated taking into account the rate of 0.60%.  If the funds are withdrawn on demand, the percentage rises to 0.1%. </p><p>  It is also possible to use cash without losing any interest.  In this case, we are talking about the fact that the client must withdraw at least 15 thousand rubles.  However, the total amount should not exceed the minimum balance. </p><p>  Also, this type of deposits for pensioners in VTB 24 implies the use of capitalization.  This means that the total amount of interest will be added to the deposit. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that funds must be deposited to the account no later than 1 day before the agreed deadline.  To extend the deposit, you can independently visit a bank branch, perform this procedure online or draw up a power of attorney for another citizen.  Also, the extension can be carried out automatically, but not more than 2 times. </p>

    <h2>  "Cumulative" </h2><p>  In this case, the benefit for the citizen is that the interest rate will increase every time after the next installment.  At the same time, rather flexible terms of the deposit are provided, thanks to which you can choose a certain date when the deposit will be closed. </p><p>  What are the interest rates on deposits for pensioners in VTB 24 in this case?  The interest rate is 0.60% per annum of the total deposit amount.  However, it is worth paying attention to the fact that in this case the possibility of withdrawing cash is not provided.  This means that in order to receive money, you will first have to completely close the deposit.  In this case, interest will be recalculated in accordance with the rate of 0.6%. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúProfitable‚Äù </h2><p>  This type of contribution is not in vain called.  It has an increased monthly percentage.  However, in this case there is no possibility of withdrawals and contributions.  The only program that is available to customers is capitalization and the ability to use the amount of monthly interest. </p><p>  In this case, it is much more convenient to open a deposit in the Internet bank, since when registering online, special bonuses and programs are provided.  In this case, the minimum amount will be significantly less than the amount that will need to be paid when visiting the physical department of VTB 24. </p><h2>  Good for retirees </h2><p>  Of course, this category of people is most often interested in similar offers from banks, as this is a real opportunity to get a significant addition to the accrued pension. </p>

    <p>  In this case, VTB 24 has many advantages, as people are confident that their money is stored in a safe place.  In addition, clients of advanced age can receive interest on a deposit at any convenient time.  At the same time, certain conditions of the contract are available for pensioners to choose from, which will depend on several indicators. </p><p>  First of all, a bank employee will pay attention to the amount of the deposit.  And also take into account the period during which a deposit account is open. </p><p>  When making deposits at VTB 24 for pensioners, the frequency of interest accrual is also important.  If an elderly person knows how to use the Internet, then he can get an additional amount of benefits, because today when using the official site customers lose much less money on additional commissions.  In addition, it will be possible to constantly monitor movements on deposits, interest and other indicators. </p><h2>  Interest Rate Features </h2><p>  Before signing the contract, the pensioner is recommended to familiarize himself with its terms.  The contract should contain the current interest rates, therefore, before going to the branch of a financial organization, it is recommended to study in detail the information on current rates.  Thanks to these data, you can make a choice in favor of a particular offer and get a lot more money for opening and using a deposit. </p><h2>  Features of the power of attorney </h2><p>  Attracting third parties is very important for senior citizens.  In this case, they do not have to visit the bank branches on their own or try to understand all the intricacies of using the Internet.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the trustee has the full right to deposit funds or withdraw funds from accounts.  In addition, a third party has the authority to close the deposit.  It also has the right to reissue a deposit. </p>

    <h2>  Promotions and offers in 2017 </h2><p>  If we talk about the current preferential conditions of VTB 24, it is worth paying attention to the fact that customers are invited to issue an additional premium debit card.  It has many advantages.  Firstly, the client can charge cash on the balance up to 7%.  Secondly, after opening the card, the cash back program begins to operate.  Thanks to this, the client will receive up to 5% of purchases made.  Card service is free. </p>
