  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to order call details: options and procedures</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, almost all people have mobile phones, smartphones.  However, not all users are aware of what convenient services, options and functions their mobile operator provides.  One of them is bill detailing.  Let's look at what kind of function it is, why it is needed and how to order details of calls and SMS messages. </p><h2>  Why do you need granularity? </h2><p>  Detailing an account is a convenient feature that is implemented by each mobile operator.  Using it you can: </p><ol><li>  Control your expenses. </li><li>  Find out where the money disappears from the balance.  Their disappearance may be due to the inclusion of an unwanted subscription, option, or with a banal operator error.  Detailing always allows you to find out the exact reason for the loss of funds from the balance. </li></ol><p>  Detailing calls and SMS by number sometimes helps to prove your innocence in any crime or blame another person for illegal actions.  Such cases are often the case when the listing of calls and SMS-messages becomes weighty evidence in court. </p><div class="photo" data-original="help.taxreliefcenter.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is detailing by mobile phone number" class="if uuid-3215479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3215479.jpg"></div><h2>  Tele2: order in your account </h2><p>  If you are a Tele2 subscriber, go to the mobile operator‚Äôs website and enter your personal account using a phone number and a one-time code or password.  Click on the ‚ÄúExpenses‚Äù button, which is located in the top menu.  Next, a page will open where the basic information on expenses for the current month will be presented.  If necessary, you can look at any other month.  But it is important to remember that in your personal account information is shown only for the last six months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the block of general expenses on the page you will see the button "Order details of" Tele2 ".  You will receive detailed information about both calls and SMS messages if you press the button.  When you do this, a form will appear in which you need to indicate the period of interest.  It can be a day, a month or a more significant period (but not more than 6 months).  Enter your email address and click the button confirming the order.  Money from your balance sheet will not be debited from you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Detailing on &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-3215466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3215466.jpg"></div><h2>  Details of ordering details in MTS </h2><p>  MTS subscribers can order bill details in exactly the same way as described above.  If you are just a subscriber of this mobile operator, go to your personal account from the official website.  Click on ‚ÄúCosts‚Äù and on ‚ÄúOrder Report‚Äù.  Indicate the period that interests you, enter the mailbox address and click "Submit".  MTS has one rule: subscribers by e-mail can order details for a maximum of the last 3 months. </p><p>  The mobile operator also has a special service that provides details.  However, the information is not sent for any long period of time, but only for the current day, starting from 00:00 hours and ending with the moment of the request.  This service is called "Costs for today."  She is free.  To use the service, send a request * 152 * 1 #.  In a few seconds or minutes, you will no longer think about how to order detailed calls and messages at MTS, because you will receive a response message with the costs.  All expenses are grouped, so it is convenient to analyze the information provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Note to Megafon subscribers </h2><p>  The mobile operator Megafon offers its subscribers several types of detail: </p><ol><li>  One-time - in one day or several days.  The period of interest the subscriber can choose only from the last 6 months. </li><li>  Periodic.  Sent for a calendar month on an ongoing basis. </li><li>  Monthly invoice.  It is a brief summary of payments and charges for the calendar month. </li></ol><p>  How to order call details at Megafon?  This is done in your account.  If a subscriber orders only one report for the current day, then there will be no deductions from the balance.  If the second report of the day is ordered, then the mobile phone bill will decrease by 10 rubles.  For periodic detailing, a fee of 90 rubles is set. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lockerdome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Order an expense report online" class="if uuid-3215468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3215468.jpg"></div><h2>  Detailing in your Beeline account </h2><p>  How to order detailed calls and SMS on Beeline via the Internet is a frequently asked question, because many people are connected to this particular mobile operator.  So, the order of the expense report is available in your account.  The following conditions are established: </p><ul><li>  service cost - 0 rubles; </li><li>  the subscriber of the prepaid settlement system can order details for any of the last 8 months; </li><li>  subscribers of the postpaid payment system can get detailed information for any of the last 6 months. </li></ul><p>  In your personal account, each subscriber is invited to choose the most convenient version of the report.  Detailing can be presented online.  This means that the report can be opened in the browser for viewing a few seconds after the order.  There is also the option of receiving a document in .pdf or .xlsx format.  It can simply be saved to a computer or sent to a personal email. </p><h2>  Service "Easy control" from "Beeline" </h2><p>  Specifically, so that subscribers can receive details directly to the phone, the Beeline mobile operator created the Easy Control service.  She is free.  In order to use it, you need to dial * 122 # on the phone. </p><p>  The report after sending the request is sent in the form of an SMS message with the last five write-offs.  The service can be used a limited number of times per day - no more than 10. </p><div class="photo" data-original="girlguyz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Account Detailing Service" class="if uuid-3215469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3215469.jpg"></div><h2>  Detailing order via mobile applications </h2><p>  Absolutely all operators have mobile applications.  This is a program designed for smartphones, tablets.  They are available for download on the App Store and on Google Play. </p><p>  Mobile applications have all the functions of your personal account, which means that they have the function of generating an expense report.  How to order details of calls and messages?  To do this, go to the "Costs" or "Finance" section.  Each application has its own section.  Subscribers order reports by e-mail.  In the Beeline application, in addition, people are invited to view online.  The order of details in the mobile application is free. </p><h2>  Contacting the salons of communication </h2><p>  For receiving details by number, the subscriber can contact the communication salon of his mobile operator.  Printouts are always provided in paper format.  A plus of contacting a communication salon is that specialists can make the details more significant than the one offered in your personal account.  Minus - for detailing in paper format you have to pay.  Prices are recommended to check with the mobile operator. </p><p>  The owner of the telephone number must always contact for details.  You must have a passport on hand.  It is allowed to provide a report to an authorized person.  Documents required to obtain a printout - passport and notarized power of attorney of the owner of the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="itarifs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Getting details in the communication salon" class="if uuid-3215470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3215470.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it possible to get details by another number? </h2><p>  Often people think about how to order call details for another number.  A similar question arises in different situations.  For example, with the help of detailing, girls want to check on their boyfriend and find out if he is talking with someone. </p><p>  It is not possible to order details by another number without the owner‚Äôs knowledge.  All the information indicated in the reports is considered personal.  It is not subject to disclosure.  If you accidentally stumble on the Internet on ads in which people write about the possibility of providing printouts by someone else's number, do not believe them.  These are scammers who simply extort money.  Mobile operators do not provide details to unauthorized persons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ethnokongress.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Documents Required to Get Details" class="if uuid-3215474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3215474.jpg"></div><p>  How to order details of calls, SMS messages and Internet traffic is not such a difficult question.  To get a report, it is best to use either your personal account or the mobile application of a specific mobile operator. </p>
