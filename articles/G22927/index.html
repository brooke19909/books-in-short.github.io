  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting for newborns envelope and bonnet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All adults prepare for the joyful event of birth in the child's family in advance.  The female half of relatives begins ahead of time to acquire small cute clothes, to sew and <span>knit blouses,</span> pants, hats and other necessary children's things.  Indeed, this activity itself - knitting for newborns - is so fascinating and interesting that it is simply impossible to stop!  It seems to bring us back to a wonderful time of childhood, when we enthusiastically engaged in the manufacture of clothing for our beloved dolls.  And now the process is repeating itself.  Only the doll will already be alive and very - very beloved! </p><p>  The simplest is knitting an envelope for a sleeveless newborn.  For its manufacture, it is enough to tie an even cloth with a width of 70 cm and a length of 40 cm. The only difficulty is the design of the front fastener.  To do this, you need to arrange the same strips along the edges of the panel along the length of the envelope with a pattern of "elastic" - strips.  On one of the strips you will need to make holes for the buttons. </p><p>  To make loops, you need to knit two loops at the same distance from each other and immediately make a crochet - you get a small hole.  After the panel is ready, it is folded along the length, having a fastener in front, the bottom of the product and shoulders are sewn together, buttons are sewn.  Now you need to make a hood. </p><p>  The hood can also be tied with one cloth, folded in half and then connected so that a ‚Äúbag‚Äù is obtained.  This hood is also sewn to the neck of the main envelope.  But you can use another scheme for the hood.  For example, it is quite appropriate to use a knitting cap for a newborn.  After making it from the same yarn as the envelope itself, you should sew it in the neck. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cap is knitted according to the pattern of the heel of the toe.  Who does not know: they begin to knit according to the volume of the head from the face.  That is, the measurement of the initial row goes through the forehead under the chin.  After knitting reaches a level at which the ears hide under a knitted fabric, you should begin to draw out a cap rounding on the head.  To do this, all the loops are divided into three parts, and knitting is performed only in the middle third of the row.  Each row (middle third) ends in the fact that from the lateral third of the row not participating in knitting, the loop is removed on the main knitting needle and knitted together with the last loop of the working part of the row. </p><p>  Gradually, all the loops from the side thirds will leave, and only the loops of the middle third will remain.  If the cap is intended to serve as the hood of the envelope, then they should be closed, since knitting is finished, and sew a hat on the envelope. </p><p>  If the cap is planned to be used as an independent headdress, then you should dial additional loops on the knitting needle on both sides, lying on one straight line with the knitting needle, on which there are still working loops.  This will be the bottom of the bonnet.  To make out the bottom of the cap you need the ‚Äúgum‚Äù pattern. </p><p>  You can make an envelope with sleeves sewn to it.  In general, knitting for newborns involves minimizing the use of seams and fasteners, because the baby‚Äôs body is so tender and sensitive!  Therefore, some craftswomen resort to knitting children's clothes from the neck - this allows knitting for newborns without stitching individual parts. </p><p>  Very serious attention should be paid to the choice of yarn for the baby.  Too fluffy hair can cause allergies, natural wool can prick.  Therefore, the best thing for making outerwear, for example, an envelope, is to buy synthetic yarn and make a flannel case inside the product. </p><p>  Interesting knitting for newborns, made using various applications, embroideries and jacquard patterns for children.  Craftswomen make whole pictures on children's things using images of famous cartoon characters. </p>
