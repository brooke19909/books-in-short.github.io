They can be worn at any time of the year when it is cool.  This applies to late autumn, and early spring, and to cold winters.  How does the knitting of the clamp happen, we learn from the article. </p><h2>  We knit and wear </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, it is absolutely not necessary to knit such a scarf on your own.  You can simply purchase it in a store where models of different colors and styles are provided to the attention of buyers. </p><p>  And yet, some women want to at least sometimes be a home needlewoman, so that knitting a yoke with a knitting needle brings not only a new thing to the wardrobe, but also the pleasure that the accessory is hand-made.  Indeed, such an act is very correct, because creating on your own, there is an opportunity to satisfy your taste and even express yourself. </p><h2>  Wear correctly </h2><p>  Knitting scarf-snoods clamps is carried out in three ways: </p><ol><li>  A strip stitched at the very end of the work. </li></ol>

    <p>  3. Seamless collar - when knitting, circular knitting needles are used. </p><p>  So, knitting a scarf-collar behind.  Now one question remains: how to wear it properly.  Such a fashionable modern accessory should be combined with the color of a bag or shoe.  Almost all things can be worn with him: skirts of various styles, familiar jeans, and even classic trousers.  With all things, the clamps will look very harmonious. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Clamps can be decorated with beads, brooches, sequins.  And potential buyers can only choose what they like. </p><h2>  Important differences </h2><p>  At first glance at such scarves, it seems that they look exactly the same, no different, in fact, no different.  But is it really so?  The most important hallmark is size.  There are scarves that are usually worn for a couple of revolutions.  The first revolution pounces on the head, but the second - on the neck.  There is an option in which only one girth is provided, if the size of the scarf does not make it possible to do it differently. </p>

    <p>  But in single-turn options there are differences.  The knitter knits her product as a simple straight scarf, and after the end of work she sews it with a knitted seam into a ring.  If the seam is not welcome, then you need to knit a scarf-yoke round.  When using the first method, you can choose both the short and long sides of the scarf. </p><p>  And the threads that are supposed to knit such a scarf come in different compositions.  You can choose thick and soft yarn, from which you will get a relief pattern with braids.  If you take a mohair, it will make a spider web.  For some models, choose a jacquard technique in a circle.  In this case, the clamp is obtained without the wrong stripes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knit for men </h2><p>  Knitting a collar, intended for representatives of a strong half of humanity, is now quite a fashionable occupation.  On guys, such products look very impressive thanks to the laconic coloring and simple patterns. </p><p>  Those who consider themselves minimalists prefer these scarves for simplicity and ease of use.  Those who consider themselves to be modern men will never refuse such an accessory.  Indeed, in a sense, this is a prestigious thing, allowing you to notice that its owner keeps up to date. </p>

We need knitting needles number six and seven for work, yarn should have about 300 g. 180 needles are knitted on knitting needles No. 6 (circular), a marker must be put at the end of the row.  Now knitting can be knitted and knitted in a circle.  On such knitting needles, six rows must be knitted, constantly alternating: a series of purl stitches, a number of facial loops.

    <p>  Knit one row with the front loops.  Next, knitting needles No. 7 come on. One row is knitted on them.  Now the scarf can be knitted according to any chosen pattern to the height that is needed.  Even rows should be knitted strictly according to the pattern. </p><p>  Next, knit one row with facial loops using knitting needles No. 7. Change to knitting needles No. 6 and knit a row with facial loops.  The six rows that go afterwards need to be knitted, doing one at a time - a row of facial and a row of purl stitches (this is a garter stitch).  Now you need to close the loop.  The scarf is ready. </p><h2>  For lovely ladies ... </h2><p>  Knitting a yoke for girls and women involves an almost endless selection of a variety of patterns and, in fact, knitting options.  Here is one of them.  To work, the craftswoman will need 50 g of yarn and circular knitting needles No. 5 (their length should be one hundred centimeters). </p>

    <p>  All the rest of the work consists of knitting rows to the width that the craftswoman needs. </p><h2>  Beginner Knitters </h2><p>  Not all ladies picking up knitting needles are skilled craftsmen with significant experience.  But they will also want to join modern fashion, decorating themselves with the now fashionable accessory.  Knitting a collar, a description of which will be given below, will take literally several days, and the work will not be difficult. </p><p>  Such a collar is knitted with a viscous garter because the pattern is simple, and ductility is increased.  The upper part of the pipe will fit snugly to the woman‚Äôs neck, and the rest of it will fan-shaped on her shoulders. </p><p>  After the set of loops is completed, you can start knitting the first row.  Edge loops are marked separately.  They should be knitted very carefully so that later, at the end of the work, do not trim the edges of the snud.  When the band of the garter stitch has already been completed, you need to leave the last loop and knit it inside out. </p>

    <p>  Now the product must be turned and removed on the right knitting needle of the first loop without knitting.  Continue to work.  Knit the last loop the same way - the wrong one.  After the product is tied to the required length (everyone here can choose what they need for themselves), close the loops as follows: pull the next loop through the one that is on the spoke. </p><p>  This illustrative example shows that knitting collars can be quite simple.  The job description will give a detailed explanation of how and what to do.  And in the end, you get a beautiful and convenient accessory to any outerwear. </p><h2>  Knit for children </h2><p>  How to knit a clamp with knitting needles?  The knitting pattern of such a scarf for children is very simple.  A beginner knitter can handle it.  In addition, such a scarf will even be useful: if the child is a fidget, he will not be able to take it off himself, therefore, it will be protected from cold winds.  And if mom knits such a collar in the colors that the baby loves, for him it will be a great gift.  By the way, not all kids love pompons and ties.  In case of a collar these problems will not arise. </p><p>  If we consider a snudik with a girth of 72 cm and a height of 23, then only one hundred grams of yarn consisting of viscose, merino wool and polyamide, circular knitting needles No. 5.5 and 6 (their length should be forty centimeters) will be required to work. </p><p>  The gum to which the part of the scarf will be connected is the most common - in turn, you need to knit a pair of facial and as many purl ones.  The outline of the main pattern is also uncomplicated. </p><ul><li>  First row: five front loops, one wrong side;  so knit to the end. </li><li>  Second: everything is the same, only you need to shift one loop to the right, that is, from the beginning of the row it will be like this - four faces, wrong side, five faces, wrong side, face. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Third row: again we shift by one eyelet: three facial, wrong side, five facial, wrong side, a pair of facial. </li><li>  Fourth: two facial, one wrong side, five facial, one wrong side, three facial. </li><li>  Fifth: facial, wrong side, five facial, wrong side, four facial. </li><li>  Sixth row (last): wrong side, five facial, wrong side and five facial. </li></ul><p>  In this pattern, the number of stitches is a multiple of six.  Repeat the first to sixth round of knitting all the time.  One hundred loops are typed on circular knitting needles number 5.5, locked in a ring and the beginning of the circular row is marked.  Next, you need to knit three centimeters with an elastic band, and in the last row evenly add two loops.  A total of one hundred and two loops. </p><p>  We pass to the circular knitting needles at number 6. Work continues with a diagonal pattern.  So you need to do seventeen rapports.  After knitting twenty centimeters from the initial row, again go to the previous circular knitting needles and knit with an elastic band.
