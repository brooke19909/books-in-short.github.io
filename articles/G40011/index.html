  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yarn "Pehorka children's novelty": reviews, description, characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When knitting, about 50% success depends on the choice of yarn.  It affects not only the functional characteristics of the finished product, but also its appearance.  Also, the process of obtaining initial knitting skills depends on the choice of yarn.  At the same time, it should have several mandatory qualities, including low cost.  According to customer reviews, "Children's Novelty" from "Pehorka" has all the necessary properties. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  LLC <span>Pekhorsky Textile</span> has been operating since 1996 on the basis of the Cloth Factory, built in 1905 on the banks of the Pekhorka River near Moscow.  This Russian manufacturer during its existence more than once was awarded the diploma "100 best goods of Russia".  The products are certified and meet international quality standards. </p><p>  The assortment of this company includes more than 90 types of yarn for hand knitting.  In addition, Pehor Textile LLC produces yarn for mechanical knitting and kits for creativity.  These products are sold in Russia, the CIS countries, and also supplied to Europe, America and China. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Yarn "Children's novelty" is available in skeins of 50 g.  The length of the thread is 200 meters.  Buyers note that the yarn consists of a tight, but not tight weave of three threads, poorly divided into components, so that it does not delaminate during the knitting process.  Products from this material, according to the manufacturer, are light, soft, voluminous, do not cause allergies, are easily washed and dry quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, according to reviews, Pekhorka children's novelty yarn does not quite match the declared parameters.  With free knitting, the fabric is really soft, but the same wool blend makes the products much more tender.  But even before such yarn, Children's News has an advantage - it is not prickly. </p><p>  The color palette is quite extensive and has more than 30 shades.  Here you can find both bright and pastel colors, as well as melange dyeing of the thread. </p><h2>  Composition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Label Baby New" class="if uuid-3209304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3209304.jpg"></div><p>  This yarn is synthetic.  It contains 100% high volume acrylic.  Due to this, it is hypoallergenic, holds its shape well, does not sit down during washing at high temperature.  In addition, this guarantees the durability of the paint.  Yarn "Pehorka children's novelty", according to reviews, does not fade and does not fade, maintaining its original colors even after prolonged use.  This allows you to create bright products by combining threads of various colors. </p><h2>  Knitting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Canvas. Yarn &quot;Children's novelty&quot;" class="if uuid-3209300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3209300.jpg"></div><p>  On the packaging, the manufacturer indicates not only the color and footage, but also the recommended tool number, in this case, it is knitting needles No. 3, as well as the number of loops and rows in one square decimeter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, according to the reviews of experienced needlewomen, the canvas made of <span>yarn "Pekhorka is a</span> children's novelty" turns out to be loose and not accurate on such knitting needles, the size of one loop is 4 * 4.5 mm.  Therefore, they advise using knitting needles No. 2-2.5 or a hook 1.75-2. </p><p>  The thread itself is quite voluminous, but thin, stretches a little, which facilitates knitting of complex patterns, but at the same time the finished product holds its shape and the shape of the pattern well, even if it is in 3D technique. </p><p>  The yarn, thanks to its synthetic composition, easily glides over the knitting needle and hook, so knitting from it quickly and easily.  Together with low cost, this material is ideal for beginner needlewomen. </p><p>  However, according to numerous reviews, "Pecherka children's novelty" has a significant drawback - it creaks in all conditions: in a skein, in the process of knitting, in the finished product.  Most washing conditioners cannot cope with creaking, so the process of wearing the product may not be very comfortable. </p><h2>  Care and maintenance </h2><p>  Caring for things made of such yarn is quite easy.  Thanks to the synthetic composition, even stubborn stains from berries or tea are washed off from products, things quickly dry and do not deform.  According to reviews, after washing "Pecherka children's novelty" practically does not roll up, which allows for a long time to maintain the original appearance of the thing.  In the wet state, the canvas stretches slightly under its own weight, but after drying it easily takes its original shape. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Clothes for Pekhorka dolls" class="if uuid-3209301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3209301.jpg"></div><p>  Like any other type of yarn, the "Children's novelty" of the Pekhorka factory has certain advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>  From the pros: </p><ul><li>  not expensive; </li><li>  easy to purchase even in small cities; </li><li>  extensive color gamut; </li><li>  persistent dyes; </li><li>  does not cause allergies; </li><li>  glides well on tools; </li><li>  maintains the shape of patterns, including 3D; </li><li>  it easily dissolves, after the thread becomes a little thinner, but this is not noticeable in the canvas. </li><li>  products are not deformed; </li><li>  unpretentious in leaving; </li><li>  practically does not roll; </li><li>  dries quickly; </li><li>  easy to wash. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  100% synthetic; </li><li>  creaks; </li><li>  colors in different batches can vary significantly; </li><li>  thickenings of a thread come across (interspersing of not twisted raw materials in the general weaving of a thread); </li><li>  when knitting less than No. 3, the fabric becomes quite stiff; </li><li>  twisting of the skein does not allow to get the second end of the thread to knit in two threads from one ball. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarn Pehorca" class="if uuid-3209302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3209302.jpg"></div><p>  In connection with all the characteristics of this yarn, "Pehorka children's novelty" in the reviews, experienced craftsmen recommend for making slippers, toys, rugs, rugs, scarves, clothes for dolls and other decorative elements.  But to use it for knitting children's, especially underwear, things are extremely undesirable.  Despite this, this yarn received among the needlewomen a solid four with a plus. </p>
