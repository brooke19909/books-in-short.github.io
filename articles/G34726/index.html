    <h2>  Who should be classified as federal civil servants? </h2><p>  Before considering various aspects of the pension issue, it would be advisable to give a definition of the category being studied.  So, pensions to federal civil servants are nothing other than payments that are sent to members of society as a result of their long-term labor activity exclusively in positions related to the state federal service.  It is important to add that the amount of this kind of pension provision depends on the duration of the corresponding labor in the public service.  In another way, this category is called seniority. <strong></strong></p><p>  <span>The assignment of pensions to</span> federal civil servants takes place when all circumstances can be correlated with three legislative acts.  Among them are the following laws: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Federal Law ‚ÄúConcerning the Civil Service‚Äù. </li><li>  Federal Law ‚ÄúRegarding Insurance Pensions‚Äù. </li><li>  Federal Law ‚ÄúOn State Pension Provision‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  Who should be attributed to state federal employees?  So, under a federal civil servant it is necessary to consider a citizen carrying out activities of a professional orientation at the post of the federal civil service and receiving a monetary reward for this from the money of the federal budget. </p><p>  What are the conditions for granting a pension to a federal civil servant?  You need to know that not every public sector employee is considered a civil servant.  Those are those who carry out managerial and imperative-administrative functions.  In addition, pensions to federal state <span>civil servants</span> are also <span>granted to employees of the</span> state executive bodies. </p>

    <h2>  Retirement Benefit Terms </h2><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that absolutely all the features and characteristics of the federal service are determined by means of basic legislative acts.  As noted, we are talking about the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn State Pension Provision‚Äù and the Federal Law ‚ÄúConcerning the Civil Service of the Russian Federation.‚Äù What are the specific factors for the appointment of the pension category in question? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that the opportunity to provide a pensioner for citizens arises exclusively in certain circumstances, including the onset of old age, disability or death.  As you can see, these conditions do not depend on the will of the citizen.  Long-service pensions by a federal civil servant are established if the following factors exist simultaneously: </p><ul><li>  The experience of the state federal service, one way or another, should equal or exceed fifteen years. </li><li>  The dismissal of a civil servant must occur on certain grounds. </li></ul><p>  Why can they fire a civil servant?  After dismissal, pensions are granted to federal civil servants when one of the following reasons accompanies the above circumstances: </p><ul><li>  Reduction of <span>state employees</span> or liquidation of state federal authorities. </li><li>  Dismissal from public office due to the termination of a person‚Äôs own powers. </li><li>  The age of civil servants reaching the maximum age possible for their professional activities (it is important to recall that the length of service for a federal state civil servant is twelve years). </li><li>  The dismissal of a state employee due to poor health, which, one way or another, is an obstacle to the continuation of his service in a public post. </li><li>  Dismissal of a state employee of his own free will, the reason for which is, as a rule, retirement. </li></ul><p>  It is important to note that pensions are awarded to federal civil servants only when the following condition is met: a person is obliged to work at a position related to the federal public service for at least twelve months before retiring.  By the way, the above rule does not apply to those dismissed due to the liquidation of a public authority or reduction of staff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Pension Rules 2017 </h2><p>  How is pension calculated by a federal civil servant in 2017?  It is important to note that on May 11, 2016, the State Duma of the Russian Federation adopted a law during the third reading.  In accordance with the new legislative act, the retirement age of civil servants has increased to 63 years for women and to 65 years for men. </p><p>  Interestingly, the increase in the age of pension provision by the state is carried out gradually.  Thus, starting in 2017, it has been growing by six months annually.  This will continue until the end result is achieved.  It is assumed that the maximum indicators will take place in 2026 for men, and for women only in 2032.  In addition, receiving a pension by a federal civil servant for seniority is only possible after working out a period of twenty years (previously a fifteen-year bar was set).  What advantages does the Russian Government see in raising the age of pensions?  Among them are the following items: </p><ul><li>  Retention of qualified personnel.  The fact is that today it is extremely difficult to find such because of the annual decrease in the number of able-bodied people. </li><li>  Substantial savings in terms of cash. </li></ul><p>  The ex-Minister of Finance of Russia, <span>Alexei Kudrin,</span> has repeatedly stated that this innovation will necessarily be followed by an increase in age in relation to retirement due to old age of an insurance nature for ordinary people (currently it is 55 and 60 years old).  Nevertheless, today it is not known about the specific level of raising and the issue of equalizing the retirement age between women and men. </p><p>  These issues have been discussed in the Government for a long time.  So, the adoption of the above measures is expected from 2019, that is, after the presidential elections scheduled for March 2018. </p>

    <h2>  Pension plan value </h2><p>  The size of pensions by federal civil servants today is established through article fourteen of the Federal Legislative Act ‚ÄúConcerning State Provision of Pensions in Russia‚Äù dated December 15, 2001.  So, the categories of citizens considered in the article establish a state benefit for the development of years, taking into account the length of service of 15 years, which was relevant in 2016.  As it turned out, this bar has increased to 20 years since 2017. </p><p>  It should be noted that pension coverage depends on what the salaries of federal civil servants were.  Thus, the calculation of pensions is carried out in the amount of 45 percent of the average salary of a federal employee for a month.  Naturally, in this case there are deductions of insurance coverage in connection with old age or disability, basic (fixed) payments to the insurance (labor) pension, as well as certain increases that are established in accordance with the Federal Legislative Act ‚ÄúOn Insurance Pensions‚Äù.  It is important to note that a pension increase by a federal civil servant is carried out for each subsequent year of service in respect of service in a public position over fifteen years by three percent. </p><h2>  How is experience calculated? </h2><p>  The Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Pensions of Civil Servants‚Äù stipulates that the length of service in a public position is nothing more than the total length of the stages of the implementation of labor activity.  By the way, this also includes other types of activities, which, one way or another, are taken into account when determining the possibility of pension provision for civil servants, as well as when calculating the amount of pension payments. </p><p>  So, in the case of awarding pension payments for the length of service for the number of years in the length of service in a public position, it is necessary to include the stages of working activity in civil service positions and other positions determined by the President of Russia.  For example, the class rank of a federal state civil servant. </p><p>  If, in determining the pension payment, which is provided for by the Federal Legislative Act ‚ÄúOn the State Provision of Pensions for Citizens,‚Äù a length of service of a specific duration is required, it, one way or another, includes the stages of labor, as well as other activities useful for certain social categories and society as a whole, which are counted in the length of insurance.  The latter is necessary for the appointment of a pension, which is provided for by the Federal Legislative Act ‚ÄúConcerning Insurance Pensions‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Calculation of the amount of pension provision </h2><p>  All types of pensions are endowed with the appropriate procedure for calculating the value for federal civil servants for long service.  This procedure is established through the Federal legislative act ‚ÄúOn state pension provision in Russia‚Äù.  So, the formula corresponding to the above law is defined as follows:  = (45%  - ) + 3%  √ó .  It contains the following indicators: </p><ul><li>  P - the specific amount of pension payments for the development of the number of years. </li><li>  SZ - average salary. </li><li>  JV - a specific amount of insurance coverage in connection with old age (disability), as well as a fixed pension payment. </li><li>  Cent - work experience exceeding fifteen years. </li></ul><p>  It is important to note that the total amount of pensions and insurance pensions due to old age (disability), fixed payments to pensions and their increases cannot exceed 75 percent of monthly wages in the average value for a civil servant.  This provision is determined by article twenty-one of the Federal Legislative Act under number 166. It is necessary to supplement: when the working out of years is enough to assign the state pension benefit, then it is calculated on the basis of the average salary for the last twelve months of service. </p><h2>  Calculation Example </h2><p>  For example, a certain citizen carries out labor activities as a federal employee.  So, in April 2015, he is assigned an insurance (labor) pension payment in connection with the onset of old age.  Its size is 7,197 rubles.  The length of service in this case is twenty-six years.  The average monthly salary of a citizen is 16 706 rubles.  It is necessary to determine the amount of state pension payments for the production of years that are due to the employee. </p><p>  So, the size of the state subsidy of the state federal employee is equal to 45 percent of the average monthly salary in the case of service experience of at least fifteen years.  In addition, it increases by three percent with each year of labor, which exceeds the necessary, but not more than 75 percent.  So: </p><ul><li>  The number of full years of work is above the norm: St = 26-15 = 11. </li><li>  Average wage: NW = 16,706. </li><li>  The amount of the insurance (labor) pension payment: SP = 7 197. </li></ul><p>  It is necessary to calculate the amount of pension provision by the state for the development of the years of a certain citizen according to the formula given in the previous chapters: P = (0.45 √ó 16706 - 7197) + 0.03 √ó 16706 √ó 11 = 5833.68.  Thus, such a civil servant is assigned monthly pension payments from the federal state budget in the amount of 5,833.68 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  The issue of pension increases </h2><p>  It is important to note that for some categories of citizens the state is given the opportunity to award an insurance pension in connection with the onset of old age ahead of schedule.  These include people living in areas of the Far North and in the territory equated to the North, as well as citizens who have previously worked in the areas presented.  It must be added that in relation to these persons, an increase in the fixed pension payment is made, which serves as an addition to the insurance pension in accordance with the district coefficient established by the Government of Russia depending on the place of residence (for absolutely the entire period of stay in this territory). </p><p>  In the event a citizen leaves the above areas for another place of residence, the amount of state pension security is calculated without taking into account the coefficient. </p>

    <h2>  Retirement Benefit Indexing </h2><p>  Pensions by federal government employees are indexed in special cases.  So, the awarding of pensions by the state for the length of service, recalculation of its value and the transition from one type of pension to another are made in accordance with the application of the citizen.  These operations are carried out regardless of the time period after the opportunity to carry out the procedure.  The exception in this case is only pension social payments by the state on disability.  So, recalculation of the size of state subsidies in connection with the length of service is carried out in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  Change in the size of labor (insurance) benefits due to old age (disability). </li><li>  Increasing the length of public service. </li><li>  Centralized increase in remuneration of public servants in cash. </li></ul><p>  In other cases, there is a transition from one type of subsidy to another in accordance with state pension provision.  In addition, state long-term pension payments are indexed by a centralized increase in the content of federal civil servants in the monetary plan in the manner established by the Government of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Types of pensions and the right to receive them </h2><p>  As it turned out, the following types are distinguished today: </p><ul><li>  For the length of service. </li><li>  By disability. </li><li>  By old age. </li><li>  Social retirement benefits. </li></ul><p>  Who is entitled to receive the pension category considered in the article?  Civil servants with 15.5 years of work experience (innovation in 2017), who have been paid pension by the state for seniority, are entitled to receive part of the old-age insurance (labor) pension upon their request and upon reaching a specific age pension payments for the development, based on the aggregate system of individual coefficients of pension nature, for at least 12 months of labor activity after determining subsidies in connection with the generation of years. </p><p>  It was previously mentioned that after the establishment of the new legislative act, starting from 2017, for the receipt of pension payments for men, the age category should be 60.5 years, and for women - 55.5 years.  The following items are included in the insurance (labor) experience: </p><ul><li>  Temporary periods of work that are provided for in Article 11 of the legislative act ‚ÄúOn Insurance Pensions‚Äù. </li><li>  This includes labor activity, which is taken into account in the process of calculating the length of service of the civil service for awarding one or another subsidy for working out years under article 19 of the Federal Legislative Act of December 15, 2001 ‚ÄúOn State Pension Provision in the Russian Federation‚Äù. </li><li>  Stages of labor activity, taken into account for the appointment of insurance (labor) pension coverage by age, to which the payment for the length of service is established. </li></ul><h2>  Pension issue </h2><p>  It is important to note that a citizen of the Russian Federation without the time frame has the right to apply for the appointment (award) of pension payments immediately after the right to them arises.                .  ,      ,        . ,             ,        .    ,   ,        .  ,         . </p><p>  ,                     ,        . </p><p>  ,           1   ,      ,      ,      .           : </p><ul><li>  (  ). </li><li>          . </li><li>         . </li><li>         (),    . </li><li>     . </li><li>        . </li><li>   . </li></ul>
