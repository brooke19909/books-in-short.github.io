The economy of this state grew and developed.  And it is impossible to find another ancient country that would exist for such a long time. </p><p>  Good living conditions for people, rich in minerals of the earth and poultry farming - this is what constituted the economic basis of Ancient Egypt.  They were later joined by craft and trade.  But the pursuit of stability significantly slowed down the development, although it was too rapid for that time. </p><h2>  Favorable conditions for economic growth </h2><p>  Most often, Ancient Egypt is used as an example of a typical <span>ancient society</span> .  Its economy developed thanks to a favorable location.  The Nile provided all the opportunities for people to live since the ancient stone era.  The waters of the river carried mineral and plant sludge.  Therefore, in this territory there have always been fertile soils, they did not have to be further cultivated. </p>

In this regard, the fauna of the Nile Valley was much richer.  In addition, directly living conditions favored the population.  So cattle breeding was born.  And fertile soils allowed the development of agriculture.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Egyptians learn quickly, they cast tools and weapons from copper before the rest.  However, this is not the main reason for the development of the economy.  The fact is that the Nile is filled and smaller according to the seasons.  Therefore, with a minimum of effort, the Egyptians were able to develop their own <span>irrigation system.</span>  They dig up pools where water accumulates during the flood of the Nile.  And then use it when watering. </p><h2>  The emergence of a civilized society and its impact on the economy </h2><p>  The ancient country existed for almost 3,000 years, and throughout history, of course, it experienced many changes.  The birth of civilization began in Upper Egypt.  After it gradually spread to the north.  By 3000 BC  e.  Egypt occupied the entire Nile Valley.  Around this river the life of the population was concentrated. </p>

Rich in land, the ability to use modern at that time ways to control water, surplus agricultural products - all this served as the reasons for growth.  The funds received from trading activities were used to build a unique architecture for that time.  Temples and pyramids still excite minds.  Scientists still cannot understand how the ancient civilization built them.

For example, a group of mercenaries could independently seize land.  Then she transferred them to public use, for which each warrior received a reward. </p><p>  The achievements of civilization are many, ranging from the invention of writing to the judicial system. </p><h2>  Features of the economy </h2><p>  Thanks to <span>irrigation farming,</span> Egypt managed to achieve development unprecedented for that time.  In addition, the population is engaged in craftsmanship; a large number of various practical devices are being created.  It should be noted the presence of jewelry.  Not all wore them, but were made by ordinary artisans. </p>

There was no slavery as such.  If a person did something bad or did not benefit the country, then he was responsible.  The judicial system and responsibility for its work rested with the pharaoh and the elite.

    <p>  Science is also developing.  Scientists create writing, study astrology, thanks to which they manage to make a calendar.  There are also mathematical and medical notes found during excavations. </p><p>  The features of the economy of Ancient Egypt were that the population was divided into estates.  Each structure of society, like peasants, priests, or artisans, did its specific work.  Thus, each economic function in the civilization system was carried out. </p><h2>  The impact of army equipment on the economy </h2><p>  Every country needs protection.  In particular, such a developed civilization as Ancient Egypt.  The economy of this state withstood much without the help of the army.  The pharaoh himself made sure that her equipment was maximum for that time.  In the battles, bows, spears, shields, and special protective mobile structures made of a wooden frame and a stretched animal skin were used. </p>

Its content is focused on protection from enemy invaders, and there were many.  Therefore, the economy developed stably, as artisans, merchants, traders, agricultural workers and all the rest were not disturbed by the enemies.  No one dared to attack such a powerful civilization.

    <h2>  Politics and Economics </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that eastern despotism defines all of Ancient Egypt.  Economics and politics are inextricably linked, and this applies not only to antiquity.  Therefore, the country's authorities and elite are forced to take extreme measures in order to ensure maximum stability.  And not only the defense of the army and free trade are involved in this. </p>

All products and products made by people are strictly regulated.  Therefore, stability is observed, since no one can afford to go beyond what is permitted.  Communities are very significant, no family can live without them.  The reverse situation is also observed.

    <p>  The craving for stability significantly slowed down the development of the economy.  If in the beginning it grew rapidly, now it stood still.  But even despite this, in comparison with neighboring states, Egypt was very developed. </p><h2>  Trade Features </h2><p>  In practice, the center through which caravan routes constantly followed was Ancient Egypt.  Trade here has been steadily developing, both domestically and abroad.  Various products were transported by people on the Nile, so it was cheaper to deliver them to the right place.  Inside the country, cities exchanged different goods among themselves, since there was no monetary policy then.  Subsequently, the first currency equivalent appears - deben.  It was a little copper, which was the whole system for assessing the value of the goods. </p>

The rulers of the countries were presented with various gifts, to which they answered the same.  That is, there is an exchange without price categories.

    <p>  After the advent of the monetary system, entire expeditions to the south are created in order to obtain unique goods.  These are ivory, ostrich feathers and gold.  The presence of such products brought Egypt to the top of the trade chain, which gave it a political and economic advantage in the Middle East. </p><h2>  Characteristic features of the Egyptian economic development model </h2><p>  If we consider Ancient Egypt as an eastern development model, its economy and economy will be determined by the following factors: </p><ol><li>  The moral lack of slavery.  Many believe that slaves worked for the pharaoh, built him pyramids and cultivated his lands.  In fact, free people also worked, and they did it as a tax to the state. </li><li>  The land was not private.  She completely belonged to the state.  However, the harvest was taken from it not only by the power elite, but also by ordinary workers. </li><li>  The state was equated with despotism.  It was called the society of eastern slavery, but only because the subjects did not have rights before the pharaoh and the elite. </li><li>  Community resilience.  Riots and riots were very rare, and in some places they were completely absent. </li></ol><p>  All these factors had a positive impact on the country's economy; they favored its development. </p><h2>  Prosperity of egypt </h2><p>  The basis of the economy was agriculture, more specifically, agriculture.  Various cultures were grown.  On arable land, tools were used, but they were primitive.  At first they were made of silicon, then replaced with metal ones. </p><p>  Pastures and territories for their arrangement were not enough, so cattle breeding was limited.  However, it also influenced the development of the economy of Ancient Egypt.  The population bred those animals that felt quite comfortable in stall conditions. </p>

Tools were made from copper and lead, and bronze was used in the manufacture of weapons and jewelry.  Iron appears later.  But it was considered as a precious metal.

    <p>  The craft is also developing.  There is an opportunity for scientific research.  Since economic development reaches its peak quite early, this contributes to the growth of trade. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, there is no more developed ancient state than Ancient Egypt.  His economy grew slowly due to a good economy, favorable conditions, fertile land and, of course, politics.  Despite the fact that the government headed by the pharaoh chose a dictatorship, people felt quite well in the country.  Most of them were free, but they were obliged to pay tribute to the state with physical assistance.  However, thanks to this, temples and pyramids were erected along the Nile - unique at that time buildings, lands were cultivated every year, goods for trade were found.  No other civilization could boast the same set of tools for growth and development. </p>
