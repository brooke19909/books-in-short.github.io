    <p>  If you arrive at Sheremetyevo, hotels near the airport will be the best option for a short rest between flights. </p><h2>  Choose a transit hotel </h2><p>  Moscow is a major transport hub, so residents of small Russian cities most often travel through the capital.  In anticipation of the next flight, the passenger can spend from 2-3 hours to a day.  Of course, duty-free shopping is fascinating, but it‚Äôs much nicer to take a shower and relax a bit on a comfortable bed. </p><p>  Previously, the minimum requirements were imposed on transit hotels, but today the situation has changed.  Almost the main thing is wireless Internet and its good speed, because some passengers are accustomed to working literally ‚Äúon the go‚Äù.  In addition, the presence of a fitness center equipped with a pool and a sauna plays an important role for guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About the five most popular hotels near Sheremetyevo Airport (services, prices and reviews) read in our review. </p><h2>  Sheraton </h2><p>  One of the best is the Sheraton Hotel (Sheremetyevo Airport).  The hotel is 800 meters from the air harbor, but the noise from the aircraft, thanks to soundproof windows, does not bother guests at all. </p><p>  The hotel complex is surrounded by forest, in the surrounding area there is a picturesque pond and lawn, pedestrian paths and gazebos. </p><p>  A free shuttle bus runs between the hotel and the airport. </p><p>  Sheraton offers its guests classic rooms (from 5,000 rubles), club (from 6,000 rubles), Junior Junior Suite (from 8,000 rubles), Corner Suite (from 11,000 rubles) and Studio Suite (from 11,000 rubles). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park inn" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1083050.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Additionally, the hotel at the Sheremetyevo Airport introduced the ‚Äúdaily use of the room‚Äù service (from 8:00 to 20:00), the cost of which is 4,700 rubles. </p><p>  At the disposal of guests: an exclusive Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed, a marble countertop in the bathroom and a <span>rain shower,</span> branded cosmetics, bathrobes and slippers, an iron with an ironing board, a hairdryer, a safe, a minibar, mineral water, a tea set and a coffee machine. </p><p>  The price of the reservation also includes access to the health complex, where there is a gym, jacuzzi, heated pool, Turkish hammam and sauna. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Travelers find Sheraton a great place to relax between flights.  Cleanliness, comfort, nice design of rooms, the possibility of visiting fitness, airport shuttle, high quality service and great beds. </p><p>  Of the minuses, guests most often call the quality and taste of dishes, as well as prices in the restaurants of The Voyager and East 37. Not at the highest level, according to the guests, the work of maids who forget about the second set of toiletries or do not clean the room at all . </p><h2>  Novotel </h2><p>  In relation to the railway station, Novotel is the nearest hotel at Sheremetyevo Airport. </p><p>  The four-star hotel is ideal for tourist and corporate groups, as well as individual travelers and families with children. </p><p>  Three room categories are available for booking: </p><p>  - standard (from 5530 rubles); </p><p>  - improved (from 7200 rubles); </p><p>  - lux (from 10 000 rubles). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sheremetyevo Airport Moscow" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1083047.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the Novotel hotel offers accommodation for children (up to 16 years old) in the same room with their parents (grandparents) at no extra charge. </p><p>  Modern design, hairdryer, safe, workplace, air conditioning, Wi-Fi, cosmetic products and manual temperature control - all the conditions for fruitful work and comfortable rest after the flight are created here. </p><p>  The hotel has two restaurants, a swimming pool and hammam, a fitness center and six conference rooms. </p><p>  For the youngest guests, there are game areas, special gifts, a children's menu and late check-out if there are free rooms (until 17:00). </p><h2>  Travelers opinion </h2><p>  An ideal transit option, according to many travelers.  Almost everyone likes this particular hotel.  <span>Sheremetyevo</span> Airport <span>(Moscow)</span> is located in one of the busiest destinations, so it is best to travel by aeroexpress.  The station is within walking distance of Novotel, and the city center is 35 minutes away. </p><p>  The undoubted advantage is the availability of a free transfer to the terminals.  Room facilities correspond to the "four stars" of the hotel.  In the lobby on the ground floor there is a kiosk for self-check-in for flights, as well as large screens with information about the airport schedule. </p><p>  A slight inconvenience to the residents of the first floors brings noise from the restaurant and bar. </p><h2>  Park inn </h2><p>  The Park Inn Hotel has 297 comfortable rooms, a 24-hour bar and restaurant, modern conference rooms and meeting rooms, secure parking and a free shuttle to the Sheremetyevo air harbor. </p><p>  Room categories: </p><p>  - standard (from 4700 rubles); </p><p>  - superior (from 5000 rubles); </p><p>  - suite (from 8000 rubles). </p><p>  It offers: air conditioning, <span>telephone, satellite</span> TV, hairdryer, wireless internet, work desk and mineral water.  Ironing board and iron are available upon request. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has rooms for guests with disabilities, equipped with special handrails in the bathroom, a mobile shower, and a special emergency warning system. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Accommodation at the Park Inn leaves a pleasant impression on travelers.  Good condition of rooms, delicious food and unobtrusive service - all this fully meets the needs of transit passengers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel Novotel" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1083049.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, a few comments were still found.  Firstly, in winter, the hotel rooms are not very comfortable temperature.  Secondly, shuttle drivers sometimes forget about night flights, and guests have to wait a long time. </p><h2>  Capsule hotel </h2><p>  The most unusual hotel at Sheremetyevo Airport is the ‚ÄúAir Express‚Äù.  It is located in Terminal E. </p><p>  The concept of a capsule hotel is not an ordinary decision.  However, the new format allows you to combine the availability of hotel services and comfort in a confined space. </p><p>  The minimum rate is three hours for single occupancy (2250 rubles) and four hours for double occupancy (2890 or 3060 rubles).  This time is enough to tidy yourself up before an important meeting or relax a bit after a long flight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sheraton Sheremetyevo Airport" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1083048.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A five-star hotel is definitely not worth expecting from a capsule hotel.  Everything here is as simple and functional as possible.  Travelers note poor soundproofing and the small size of the rooms, but even such conditions are much better than the airport lounge.  The main advantage of the hotel is its location in the terminal, there is no need to leave the airport. </p><h2>  Skypoint </h2><p>  SkyPoint is no less popular hotel at the Sheremetyevo airport, which, incidentally, is considered one of the most budgetary in the vicinity. </p><p>  The modern hotel offers 225 rooms of three categories for booking: </p><p>  - economy (room without a window, from 2700 rubles); </p><p>  - standard (from 3510 rubles); </p><p>  - business (from 5310 rubles). </p><p>  For guests there is a wellness complex, which includes a gym, sauna and pool with relaxation area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheremetyevo hotels near the airport" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1083046.jpg" width="400"></div>
