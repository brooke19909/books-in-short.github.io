Thanks to this simple device, you can prove your innocence in an accident in case of a contentious situation.  It will be useful to use video recording when communicating with traffic police officers, especially when the latter behave in bad faith. </p><p>  DVRs are now on the market with a huge number of models.  They differ in various functionality, the quality of the video being shot, the presence of a night mode of operation, and, accordingly, the price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="delonevtebe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Front view" class="if uuid-2353327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2353327.jpg"></div><p>  In the review, the budget representative of the family of registrars called Ritmix AVR 330 will be examined in detail. It is distinguished by a very low price, and it attracts many drivers in the first place.  But is the device high enough?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Scope of delivery DVR </h2><p>  Ritmix AVR 330 comes in a small rectangular box made in green colors.  On the cover there is an image of the device.  Also on the package you can find information about the main parameters of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="correct.shop.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The appearance of the box" class="if uuid-2353359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2353359.jpg"></div><p>  The package contents of the device are as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the device itself; </li><li>  accumulator battery; </li><li>  power supply for connection to the cigarette lighter; </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  set for mounting on a windshield with a suction cup; </li><li>  user manual for the DVR Ritmix AVR 330. </li></ul><p>  The delivery set is usual for a gadget of this level, they didn‚Äôt put anything unusual in the box. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.click-plus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recorder Package" class="if uuid-2353325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2353325.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, the length of the wire going from the gadget to the power adapter should be noted.  It is more than 3 meters, which will allow you to freely hide the cable behind the panels of the inner lining of the car. </p><h2>  Appearance and Ergonomics </h2><p>  The Ritmix AVR 330 enclosure has a specific elongated shape.  The lens is located on the short edge of the device.  To the left and right of the eye of the optical module there are three infrared LEDs designed to improve the quality of video shooting in the dark.  On the opposite short end are the buttons for turning on and starting the recording process.  On the right long side of the Ritmix AVR 330 there is a micro-SD card slot, covered with a rubber plug, and a connector for connecting external power from the cigarette lighter. </p><p>  A USB socket is placed on the left end, which is closed by a cover.  Almost the entire upper part of the Ritmix AVR 330 is hidden under a removable panel, under which you can find the battery of the device.  There is also a device speaker and a nut soldered into the body, designed to screw on the mounting bracket.  The bottom of the gadget is equipped with a hinged panel with an integrated LCD display.  Also at the bottom there is a microphone for recording sound.  The screen is equipped with a swivel mechanism.  Under the display there are four buttons that are responsible for managing the registrar. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vstroyka-solo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open screen view" class="if uuid-2353346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2353346.jpg"></div><p>  The mount bracket on the windshield allows you to quickly deploy the lens of the device on the side window of the car to record a conversation with the traffic police inspector. </p><p>  In general, the ergonomic data of this unit is not bad.  The location of the controls is convenient.  The only drawback is the mechanism for attaching the device to the bracket.  To take the device with you, you have to unscrew it, you won‚Äôt be able to quickly remove it. </p><h2>  Gadget Technical Parameters </h2><p>  Here are the main parameters of the Ritmix AVR 330: </p><ul><li>  display with a TFT-matrix; </li><li>  the maximum shooting resolution is 1280 x 960 pixels (this corresponds to HD) at a frequency of 30 frames per second; </li><li>  viewing angle - 120 ¬∞; </li><li>  2.4-inch LCD screen </li><li>  removable battery with a capacity of 600 mAh; </li><li>  support for the use of micro-SD memory cards up to 32 GB (it is advisable to choose a speed class of at least 10); </li><li>  motion sensor that automatically starts recording video when the situation changes in the radius of the lens; </li><li>  G-sensor; </li><li>  USB port with the ability to connect to a personal computer for firmware Ritmix AVR 330; </li><li>  the presence of infrared illumination for shooting in the dark; </li><li>  dimensions: length - 105 mm;  width - 60 mm;  thickness - 30 mm; </li><li>  registrar weight - 125 grams. </li></ul><p>  It is impossible to name the characteristics of the device outstanding, but for this cost more was not expected. </p><h2>  Key Features </h2><p>  Let's analyze the functionality of the Ritmix AVR 330. The list of its features is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Actually, shooting video in HD resolution; </li><li>  the ability to select the size of the movie in minutes; </li><li>  setting the recording cycle (the oldest clips are deleted, new ones are written in their place); </li><li>  automatic start of the device when the ignition of the car; </li><li>  the use of night mode (shooting in the dark); </li><li>  2.4-inch flip-up display with swivel mechanism; </li><li>  use of a motion sensor. </li></ul><h2>  Video Quality </h2><p>  Now let's see what the Ritmix recorder can offer the user in terms of shooting video: </p><ol><li>  Day mode in clear weather.  In this case, given the price of the gadget, everything looks more or less decent.  The picture, of course, cannot boast of sharpness, but the registration signs of passing and oncoming can be viewed at a remote distance. </li><li>  <span>Shooting during the day in cloudy weather or rain.</span>  <span>In such a situation, the picture quality sharply decreases.</span>  <span>Sharpness is low.</span>  <span>Car numbers of other road users can be viewed in the video only at the maximum approximation to them.</span> </li><li>  <span>Night mode in the city by the light of lanterns.</span>  <span>The quality of the recorded video is at a low level.</span>  <span>It is almost impossible to discern the registration marks of other cars when watching a video.</span>  <span>Infrared illumination exacerbates the situation, reflected in the windshield of the car.</span> </li><li>  <span>Night shooting in the country.</span>  <span>It is not possible to parse anything on video under this option of weather conditions.</span>  <span>Cars look like shapeless, smeared objects.</span> </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.contragento.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bracket device" class="if uuid-2353367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2353367.jpg"></div><h2>  Registrar user reviews </h2><p>  The reviews of the Ritmix AVR 330 on the Internet are very controversial.  For convenience, the disadvantages and advantages of the gadget will be summarized in two lists. </p><p>  Advantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  low cost; </li><li>  convenient bracket with a rotary mechanism; </li><li>  An interesting implementation of the reclining display; </li><li>  removable battery; </li><li>  quite detailed instructions Ritmix AVR 330; </li><li>  small size of video files; </li><li>  the presence of a G-sensor. </li></ul><p>  Cons of the device: </p><ul><li>  low quality of the recorded video; </li><li>  poor implementation of night infrared illumination; </li><li>  a big pause at the beginning of recording a new file; </li><li>  unstable software; </li><li>  simple design, quality and reliability of materials is not the highest; </li><li>  small viewing angle. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="newauction.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recorder packaging with device" class="if uuid-2353351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60925/2353351.jpg"></div><h2>  Eventually </h2><p>  The main advantage of this device can be called its cost.  According to other criteria, the hero of the review was not impressed.  It can be recommended for drivers who are very limited in material means and who travel mainly during the day in sunny weather.  At night, the recorder does not cope with its direct duties, despite the presence of six infrared LEDs. </p>
