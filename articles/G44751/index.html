Today, almost every girl has all kinds of sets, full of different colors, as well as additional accessories and a variety of machines.  But what to hide - a lot of young people also succumbed to a newfangled hobby.  <span>What can be made of rubber bands?</span>  Anything from a simple bracelet to a sophisticated swimsuit or dress.  And how important are beautiful belts for lovely ladies, and maybe a convenient and beautiful handbag?  It is about the bags that will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  How to weave a bag out of rubber bands </h2><p>  Before starting weaving, it is worth preparing a working material.  Having decided on the color, you need to stock up with the right amount of rubber bands, in extreme cases, use those that will be as close as possible to the shade of the already existing ones.  If weaving is carried out using a machine - to prepare it (universal in three rows is best), and also not to forget about hooks - some elements of weaving without them will be difficult to do.  The required hook numbers are 3-4.  Of course, the bag will need to be decorated - for this, beads, bugles, small trinkets and even thin chains are suitable - all of which you can make a small jewelry that will not be too heavy in weight for the future bag. </p><h2>  By the way </h2><p>  Recently, weaving from gum has become quite a large-scale hobby.  If initially this business was mainly done by girls, creating single and multi-layer bracelets from multi-colored rubber bands, or competing and arguing about how to weave a doll bag out of rubber bands, then adults soon became interested in weaving.  Now it is not surprising that the fashionable bright swimsuit, long dress, hat or even sandals made of simple rubber bands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  And what key rings and toys can be created by spending quite a bit of time on them!  And the assortment of gum pleases the eye - if you want, choose ordinary and very simple round ones, if you want - in the form of quadrangular or hexagonal stars, there are even rhombuses and four-petalled flowers.  It is clear that when weaving with rubber bands with sharp corners, even the simplest weaving will look completely different - voluminous and unusual. </p><h2>  Start weaving </h2><p>  First, we will learn how to weave a bag of rubber bands on the machine.  We take the machine in three rows.  Weaving starts from the zero row, using the two extreme ones.  An elastic band is put on the right column with the edge, twisted twice, and then put on the second column in the middle.  In the same way, six elastic bands are thrown obliquely. </p>

    <p>  Next, we do the same thing, only in the opposite direction.  After we fix the edges - for this we throw the rubber bands of the zero row inward.  If the handbag should be small - five rows will suffice, if more - it is worth weaving at least eight.  After all the rows are ready, the first two gum of the second row are thrown on the very first column.  We continue weaving to the last gum on the column of the lower row.  Then a hook is used - it must be inserted through the four elastic bands of the first column and two rubber bands placed over it - this will be the handle bag.  At the end, the handle is attached to the back side of the bag.  An ordinary plastic clip is used for this, if desired, you can fix the handle with a double clip. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We try without a machine </h2><p>  Now we learn how to weave a bag of gum without a machine.  This method is even much simpler than the previous one.  You need to get used to the machine, get comfortable, so that the rubber bands do not slip at a certain moment.  And weaving without a machine is the same as weaving a bag of rubber bands on a hook. </p>

    <p>  First you need to double throw the elastic on the hook, twisting its base.  It is better to weave the bottom with double elastic bands - they are also put on and slip into the previous one - and so there are ten links.  Throwing two loose straps on the hook, grab the next pair through four rows - another ten links.  Further weaving continues in a circle, each link is necessarily brought to the end of the row.  Each time the last loop should be drawn through the rest.  There should be 24 loops along the perimeter of the bottom, consisting of three rows.  Weaving continues in the same way as before, in a circle.  Finishing the row, the next one starts with a new iris.  The handle is made in a similar way, fixed on the second side of the product. </p><h2>  And that's not it </h2><p>  There is another way that we will talk about right now.  How to <span>weave a bag</span> of rubber bands on a slingshot? </p><p>  To do this, we still need a hook and elastic bands in two colors.  The elastic is thrown on the right column and twisted four times.  Then eight pairs of elastic bands are thrown - double ones are put on both columns, and the very first one is thrown in the middle.  For each next pair, rubber bands are thrown off the bottom column.  Now we throw a pair of a different color, then they are thrown from the left column to the right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We hook the hook into the fourth loop of the resulting chain, throw a pair of rubber bands of the first color on it and stretch it through the loop.  The ends of the elastic bands come together and put on the left column.  A pair of elastic bands of the second color are thrown on both columns, elastic bands are thrown off from the left column.  Another pair of rubber bands of the second color - we drop them on a pair of rubber bands from the posts. </p><p>  We repeat, put on a couple more and throw off all the rubber bands (except the last ones) from both columns.  Next, we drop the gum from the left column to the right, and start the hook in the third loop.  Next, the process is repeated until the first loop. </p><p>  At the end, a handle weaves, fixed on the side with a clip.  Of course, it is more reliable to attach the handle with the help of another rubber band - making an inconspicuous knot, or a bunch in the form of an original bow. </p>

    <h2>  Puppet size turns into ... </h2><p>  In the previous example, we looked at a model that is ideal for dolls - now we know how to weave a small bag of rubber bands.  The number of initial pairs of elastic bands can be increased.  Instead of eight, take ten, twenty, thirty.  The work will be more painstaking, but the result is completely different - in this way we will learn how to weave a large bag of rubber bands. </p><p>  If one or two plastic clips are enough to fasten the handle of small models, then thin metal (or the same plastic) rings are better for large ones.  Do not forget about jewelry - the simpler the weaving, the tighter the loops will be tightened, which means that the accessory can be more significant.  If you use openwork weaving, then the decoration should not be very massive - a string with beads or a multi-stage rain from glass beads is suitable for this. </p>

    <h2>  What you need to know more </h2><p>  It is very important to take not only the weaving process with full responsibility, but also the immediate preparation.  One can only guess about the quality of gum for weaving, however, choosing a material through a transparent bag you can consider how thin or thick the base of the gum is.  It is important to remember that too thin can tear both during operation and when already woven into the main product.  It will be a pity if you have to dissolve several rows due to a torn rubber band.  The thicker the gum base, the stronger it will be when weaving.  It is worth paying attention to the color - too bright elastic bands quickly fade in the sun, becoming faded and completely inconspicuous.  Therefore, it is better to adhere to a calm color scheme. </p>

    <h2>  Working together </h2><p>  The process of creating any product is very exciting and useful.  If the child works together with an adult, this will help him to become accustomed to perseverance, develop hand motility, and learn to invent new options for combining colors.  It‚Äôs quite easy to figure out how to weave a bag out of rubber bands.  An ideal option would be if mom would weave a large handbag, and the daughter would weave the same - but smaller.  According to psychologists, such joint classes help bring children and parents together, build trusting relationships between them, and also avoid stressful situations when a child working alone does not succeed.  In addition, the resulting bag models can be elevated to a number of <span>family heirlooms.</span> </p><h2>  Jewelry </h2><p>  Now it is worth paying attention to jewelry.  If we figured out how to weave a bag from gum, then it‚Äôs worth spending a little more time on jewelry.  It is important to remember that accessories that are too heavy will burden the product.  If the knitting is loose, then a large decoration will pull the loops down, spoiling not only the bag itself, but also its appearance.  It is better to refuse bows - in extreme cases, you can weave a small bow from the same rubber bands.  The ideal option would be small flowers from three twisted elastic bands, scattered on the sides of the product, either in a chaotic order, or in a certain symmetry. </p><p>  For decoration, you can use decorative buttons, or small beads.  The multi-color of the bag itself will become a good decoration - in this case, you can experiment with different shades, or you can make the product in one scale, and the bag handle in three or four shades. </p>

    <h2>  Exclusive </h2><p>  Just as weaving a bag out of rubber bands, you can weave a purse, a cover for a mobile phone, a purse, a card holder - anything.  Probably, it is worth recalling that such things will not be designed for constant wear - as a result, the gum will fray and the product will become worthless.  Any such craft will be regarded more as a souvenir.  Therefore, you can approach the modeling of ideas from a creative side. </p><p>  You can make a whole gift set, create a bracelet, handbag, belt in one style, you can even ring.  And for doll friends you can open a whole catwalk - from openwork boots on slender legs to elegant evening dresses with ruffles and falling flounces.  Alternatively, you can use the repetition of one picture on several models - made in the same color scheme with the same pattern, they will certainly look not only stylish and beautiful, but also fashionable, relevant and modern. </p>
