    <p>  The cliffs breaking off into the glossy sea abyss with small terraces, the irregular rows of snow-white villas, as well as the sea and the sky merging into one whole - this is the picture before one sees one who falls into Sorrento (Italy).  Photos of beautiful landscapes are presented in this article.  The natural diversity and amazing beauty of the area attract a huge number of tourists from all over the planet. </p><h2>  Vietri sul Mare </h2><p>  For many centuries, locals have been manufacturing tiles for cladding and ceramic products.  Although, of course, basically this is not what attracts vacationers to the Amalfi coast.  Many are also interested in the history and architecture of Vietri sul Mare. </p><p>  In the palace of Karozino, located on Umberto I Ave., the Museum of Fine Arts named after  Manuel Cargaleiro is a master of ceramics and an artist from Portugal, who put a lot of effort into creating this exhibition complex.  Here are the works of the author himself, made in Vietri sul Mare, and the works of other foreign and Italian masters.  In Vietnam, ceramic manufacturing is a large industrial sector, the symbol of which is the Solimene Palace of Ceramics.  This landmark factory, which is lined with narrow clay pipes by Paolo Solleri. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Santa Trinita Abbey </h2><p>  The building of this church was erected in the XI century, after which it was expanded and rebuilt in the XIII and XIV centuries.  This church is one of the most famous in Sorrento, Italy (photo in the article below), it is located between the Santa Trinita bridge and Tornabuoni street.  Andrei Pisano was supposedly the author of the project for the restructuring of the old Benedictine monastery that had previously stood here.  It is worth noting that the interior of the church is as harsh as its facade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amalfi coast" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/552898.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Various archaeological finds, marble sculptures, Roman sarcophagi, paintings by Giovanni Francesco Penny, Andrea da Salerno and others are exhibited in this house today.  Of particular interest is the map of the 15th century, silverware, and the 11th-century ivory case.  Thumbnails and incunabula of the 9th-16th centuries remained in the library, and valuable copies of the times of the Normans and Lombards remained in the archive. </p><h2>  Cava de tirreni </h2><p>  The city in 1058 was transferred to the ownership of the abbey of Santa Trinita.  Over the centuries, he played a major role in trade relations with the Kingdom of Naples through numerous tax breaks and a monopoly on the sale of silk tapestries. </p><p>  Today, the Amalfi coast also attracts many tourists with this city, which has retained its original plan.  A distinctive feature of Cava de Tirreni are streets with small porticoes.  In the remaining southern cities, similar architecture is not found anywhere else.  A typical example are Skachchaventi galleries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cetara </h2><p>  It offers stunning views of Salerno, there is also the opportunity to see the picturesque town of sailors and fishermen, which is considered a port - Santa Trinita.

    <h2>  Majori </h2><p>  By the length of the beaches and the number of interesting buildings, Maiori can be called one of the most popular resorts of the entire Amalfi <span>coast (Italy).</span>  A photo of the city is presented in this article.  It is located in the bay and is a modern village with developed infrastructure.  The city was rebuilt after a flood that occurred in 1954. </p><p>  Santa Maria a Mare is an elevated church.  It is decorated with a dome of majolica, in addition, there is a bell tower of the XVIII century.  In the XII century, the first building was made, over the centuries, the appearance has undergone various changes.  The space of the church is divided into 3 naves.  The <span>coffered ceiling of the</span> 16th century is especially interesting.  In this place you can admire the image of the Madonna and Child with the main altar.  In the museum of church art organized in crypt, there are works of the 12th-18th centuries, 15th century alabaster stucco molding is of particular interest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Santa Maria de Olearia </h2><p>  Arriving on the Amalfi Coast, special attention should be paid to this abbey.  The town of Erki appeared around the <span>Benedictine monastery.</span>  From the observation deck, an amazing view of Cape Campanella opens from here, you can also admire Capri.  On the way from Erka you can see the remains of the Benedictine complex.  They are right in the rock.  There are also 3 temples here.  The oldest is decorated with frescoes.  Disputes are ongoing regarding the date of its creation (X-XI century).  The main chapel was built in the second half of the XII century.  The chapel of San Nicolas was erected at the beginning of the same century; unique decorative frescoes have been preserved on its walls and arches. </p><h2>  Minori </h2><p>  Medieval polycentrism, which is characteristic of the Amalfi coast (Italy), allowed the city of Minori to retain the relics of St. Trofimena.  Probably, it was due to ancient religious traditions that the main rites of Holy Week were preserved, when processions with hymns are held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amalfi coast reviews" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/552900.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This city is much smaller than neighboring Majori.  Here is the basilica of Santa Trofimena, which was built in the XI-XII centuries and rebuilt after seven hundred years.  Here is a converted crypt in the 18th century with the urn of the patroness of this city.  In the west is a Roman villa of the 1st century.  BC.  It probably belonged to one of the court of the emperor.  In the center is a swimming pool.  Triclinium divides the dwelling into 2 parts, in one of them there are terms. </p><h2>  Ravello </h2><p>  The town is far from the coastal bustle, as you can see by looking at the Amalfi coast on a map of Italy.  It is distinguished by an amazing calm, spreading over the magnificent gardens, streets and buildings of Sicily.  In the XIII century, the city occupied the main positions in trade with Sicily and the East, while its population exceeded the current one by fifteen times. </p><h2>  Cathedral in Ravello </h2><p>  On the central square  Vescovado by order of Orso Papirio in 1086-1087 a cathedral was built.  It was supposed to visually resemble the abbey of Monte Cassino.  After some time (in the XVIII century) it was rebuilt in the Baroque style.  In 1786, the portico was dismantled, from which today there are only 4 columns, which were previously located in front of the facade.  Marble architraves are original.  They are borrowed from various ancient buildings.  The bronze door was donated by one merchant from Ravello.  It is worth noting that this is the work of the famous Barisano da Trani.  On one of the door leaves you can see the year of its creation - the 1179th. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amalfi coast tours" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/552901.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Surely you have no doubt that the Amalfi coast on the map of Italy occupies an important place.  We continue to consider the beauty of Ravello further.  Near the church there is a bell tower of the 13th century with interwoven arches and bifors.  Its <span>inner space is</span> divided by pilasters and columns into 3 naves.  During the Renaissance, the transept stucco molding was redone, and the vaults were abolished.  A pulpit is located along the nave on the left (1330) - this is the only example of Byzantine architecture left in Italy. </p><h2>  Audience Oscar Niemeira </h2><p>  It is located in a very favorable location.  The audience was created in 2010 according to the project of a little-known Brazilian architect.  It hosts concerts of the annual music festival. </p><h2>  Atrani </h2><p>  Arriving on the Amalfi Coast (the map is presented in this article), you should definitely visit Atrani.  Here the road goes a little upward, sometimes even leads along the terraces of the houses.  The overpass was created specifically because of the small areas.  This is a real barrier between the sea and the city.  The city is located on rocky steep slopes, it is intersected by numerous ladders, paths, viaducts that stretch over white houses, variegated kitchen gardens and gardens. </p><h2>  Amalfi </h2><p>  In 977, an Arab traveler described this settlement as the most prosperous, noble, abundant and wealthy city in the region.  Today, all that could be preserved from the greatness of those years is a symbol of Italy, the fame of which has spread to the whole world. </p><p>  The mesmerizing beauty of the Mediterranean nature and mild climate along with the interweaving of white houses and streets climbing on the cliffs of Lattari, the bright blue sea, well-kept gardens and terraces, green islands of vegetation - these are all Amalfi. </p><h2>  Coast </h2><p>  No wonder the Amalfi Coast (Italy) is so popular among tourists.  Many admire this place.  Amalfi reliably protects the tower - it is a defensive system that was erected in the sixteenth century along the south coast.  Opposite the hotel is the Luna Hotel, which occupies the territory of the monastery of San Francesco. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amalfi Coast Attractions" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/552902.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the beginning of the western part of this coast is an arsenal.  Two naves were preserved from it, covered by lancet <span>cross vaults.</span>  On a rocky cliff is the historic Capuchin Hotel, which was organized at the 13th-century convent of San Pietro della Canonica. </p><h2>  Patio Paradiso </h2><p>  Paradiso is a courtyard that played the role of a cemetery in 1266-1268.  for famous residents of the city.  For this, the main part of the left side of the Crucifixion Church was dismantled.  The courtyard is surrounded by a peristyle of elegant <span>lancet arches</span> supporting double columns.  It is worth considering carefully the sculptures of various times.  Judging by the reviews, such masterpieces of art leave a lasting impression. </p><h2>  Emerald Grotto </h2><p>  Today, many who come to the Amalfi Coast are very interested in the sights of the region.  The so-called emerald grotto deserves special attention.  A special shade in which the rays are colored, refracting under the rocks in the water, has led to the appearance of a greenish color of the reservoir.  The presence of stalagmites at the bottom of the grotto indicates that it was previously dry.  Due to seismic activity, water began to flow here, completely flooding it. </p><h2>  Crucifix Chapel </h2><p>  Arriving on the Amalfi Coast, the photo of which is presented in this article, many begin to explore its truly unique sights.  So, the old cathedral, built in the X century by the Duke Manson I, can be reached from the cemetery of Paradiso.  The Diocesan Museum is located in this place, where a miter of the 13th century, silver items from the Baroque and Gothic era, medieval and Roman marble items are exhibited.  You can get into the crypt from the old cathedral.  It was built in the 17th century.  By age, this building corresponds to the cathedral located in Salerno: the altar is considered the work of the famous Domenico Fontana, the murals are Vincenzo de Pino, the statue of St. Andrew is Michelangelo Naccherino, in addition, the figures of St. Lorenzo and Stefan were made by Pietro Bernini. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amalfi coast photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/552903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Positano </h2><p>  In the sixties of the last century, it was the most popular and fashionable place on the coast.  It is worth noting that since those years of its charm, it has not lost.  This slightly arrogant city is entangled in a network of narrow streets with shops, cafes and restaurants, an atelier of artists.  Mediterranean snow-white houses are buried in dense greenery.  Their shape resembles a cube, and arches with arches and loggias overlook the seashore. </p><p>  Very popular beaches stretch along the entire coast: La Porta, Fornillo, Arienzo and Chumichello; in the caves of the rocks you can find the remains of the oldest first settlements.  For example, objects from the Mesolithic and Paleolithic period were found in a grotto called La Porta. </p><h2>  Praiano </h2><p>  Today, tours to the Amalfi Coast are becoming more popular.  In Praiano, fishermen's houses are located along the entire ridge of Sant'Angelo, and Cape Sottile goes into the sea.  In addition to the church of San Luca with the works of Giovanni Bernardo Lama, this village attracts another place - Marina di Praia - a small quiet beach. </p><p>  Vettika Maggiore is a town that belongs to Praiano.  It is also famous for its beach.  The Church of San Gennaro is decorated with majolica.  It is framed inside the paintings of the XVI-XVII centuries.  The terrace area, partially lined with majolica, offers amazing views of Positano. </p><h2>  Tour Italy </h2><p>  Traditional excursions from Positano include trips to the towns of Montepertuso and Nocella.  The latter is a very picturesque village, which can be reached on foot from Positano through narrow descents and paths (it offers stunning views). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amalfi coast italy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/552904.jpg" width="600"></div>
