    <h2>  The Importance of Communicating with Animals </h2><p>  At a time when children are sitting at a computer no less than their parents working and having rest there, it is incredibly important to arrange such holidays of contact with wildlife to your family, to remember that there are a lot of beautiful and worthy attention besides concrete walls around. </p><p>  Arriving at the shopping center "Newton", which is located at Krasnoyarsk, st.  Partizan Zheleznyak, 17th, 3rd floor, from 10 am to 9 pm, you can see the miracle of wildlife with your own eyes.  The employees of the complex not only look after the order and animals around the clock, but also provide the guests with all the necessary information that interests them. </p><h2>  Kindness and compassion </h2><p>  You can contact all the animals, but the administration of the institution is against violence against them, so if you can see that the animal is tired, has not slept or feels bad, for some time it eliminates the need to communicate with people.  So visitors only play with fun and active pets. </p><p>  Animals really often manifest themselves in this way, thanks to first-class care and reverent care of the owners.  A local nosha named Dobby welcomes guests with a warm welcome, which people often scratch their backs, which causes a wave of pleasure.  These animals were collected from various parts of the Russian Federation.  For example, there are home-made foxes here.  They were brought from the genetic institute in Novosibirsk. </p>
