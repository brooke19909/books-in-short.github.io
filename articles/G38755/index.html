Its length is about 250 meters.  The beach is equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, sand and pebble coating is quite convenient for relaxation.  Small pebbles are observed at the edge of the sea.  Entering the water is quite gentle and comfortable.

The name of the resort is translated as ‚Äúfine sand‚Äù.  Incekum is considered a family resort, thanks to the convenient gently sloping coast.  In addition, the region is suitable for those who suffer from pulmonary diseases.  The resort is surrounded by pine forests that make the air so healing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In recent years, the resort's infrastructure has expanded greatly, new shops, bars, cafes and restaurants have appeared.  Many hotels in the village have a long history, but they are regularly updated.  The resort is equipped with a beautiful promenade, which is a favorite place for walks of all guests.  The holiday season in Incekum begins in April and ends at the end of October.  But many complexes do not close in the winter, offering incredibly low prices for vacations, thus attracting the British and Germans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya Ozkaymak Incekum Hotel 5" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2004588.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the only drawback of the resort is its considerable distance from Antalya Airport.  Transfer takes from two to three hours.  This is not very convenient, especially after the flight. </p><p>  Incekum has an arcuate wide coast, which is divided into separate bays.  Clean beaches are covered with golden sand.  Their length is about two kilometers.  Thanks to the cleanliness of coastal waters and beaches, the resort is considered one of the best in all of Antalya. </p><p>  Incekum is a small village with shops and cafes, but there are no attractions.  If you want to see something interesting, then you should go to Alanya or Side. </p><h2>  Reviews about Ozkaymak Incekum Hotel 5 * </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, we turn to the reviews of tourists who have already rested in it.  It is worth noting that the Ozkaymak Incekum Hotel 5 * (photo is given in the article) receives quite contradictory ratings.  Someone considers the hotel - a great place to relax, while others say that the institution frankly does not reach the five-star status.  It‚Äôs difficult to judge who is right, but still we‚Äôll analyze the guest reviews. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the coast, and therefore the beach is within easy reach.  A large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is covered with greenery - citrus trees, palm trees and flowers.  And around there are coniferous forests.  The air here is just wonderful and healing.  The entire hotel area is very well maintained, clean, and is the pride of the establishment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ozkaymak incekum hotel 5 turkey alanya incekum" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2004598.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex consists of two interconnected buildings.  According to tourists, the rooms are quite good and clean.  Most of them go to the coast.  And the other part is on the courtyard and the roadway, so vacationers still recommend booking rooms overlooking the coast, otherwise night noise may bother. </p><p>  Standard apartments are not very large, but comfortable.  But family rooms are more spacious.  All apartments have balconies with a table and two chairs.  The rooms have air conditioning, but the inconvenience is that they are connected to a single system, and therefore tourists themselves are not able to regulate the temperature.  This point causes a lot of complaints from the guests, because the level of temperature comfort for all people is different.  Windows save the situation, it is especially good if your room faces the sea, then you are guaranteed freshness and comfortable coolness.  By the way, air conditioning does not work around the clock, as a rule, it is turned on at certain hours.  Therefore, at night you may well wake up from stuffiness. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel‚Äôs room capacity is tired, there are noticeable shortcomings, especially with regard to mini-bathtubs, the plumbing of which needs to be replaced.  In addition, the five-star hotel should have bathrobes and slippers, but in this case they are absent.  The rest of the rooms are quite acceptable for living.  Despite all the nuances, they are maintained in good condition and clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel ozkaymak incekum hotel 5" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2004601.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for cleaning, far from all guests of the establishment are satisfied with its quality.  Diametrically opposed reviews give reason to think that nevertheless there is a human factor and not all personnel are responsible for their duties.  In general, cleaning is carried out daily, but sometimes superficially.  Therefore, it is not necessary to count on rubbing a mirror or bringing a towel from the balcony.  But very happy with good and clean bedding, which is changed regularly.  The hotel decided to leave a tip, this is evidenced by numerous reviews, but the presence of a monetary reward does not always affect the quality of service. </p><p>  In general, tourists believe that in the rooms you can relax quite comfortably, if you do not focus on some of the shortcomings. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Food is an important component of a good vacation for most holidaymakers.  Like it or not, but no one wants to suffer in a foreign country from an upset stomach.  It is for this reason that many are very sensitive to the issue of nutrition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ozkaymak world incekum hotel 5 alanya" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2004596.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel operates under the concept of "all inclusive" and "ultra all inclusive."  Many people prefer the second option, since it implies the ability to take drinks - tea, coffee, cola, sprite and phantom, diluted powder juices, cocktails and local alcohol. </p><p>  The main restaurant of the hotel is spacious and cozy, however, being late to the beginning of the meal, you can search for clean appliances for a long time.  Local waiters, like maids, like tips.  So, by offering a cash bonus, you can always be guaranteed to have a served table. </p><p>  As for the choice of dishes, there are a lot of them at the buffet.  Of meat, chicken is generally preferred in different designs; beef is rarely served.  A good selection of salads and vegetables, all kinds of snacks.  But the assortment of fruits is small.  Also on the tables there are pastries and desserts.  In general, the food is good, but there are no frills here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ozkaymak incekum hotel 5 pics" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2004614.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Good snacks can be ordered at the bars.  The quality of cocktails depends on the bartender on duty. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Tours in Ozkaymak Incekum Hotel 5 * have been popular with our tourists for many years, despite the shortcomings.  First of all, this is due to the fact that the hotel has staff who speak Russian or English.  And many workers in general are from the post-Soviet countries.  Therefore, there simply cannot be a language barrier here. </p><p>  The hotel has good animation.  Especially good events are held for children.  Russian-speaking activists skillfully lure children into all kinds of games and undertakings.  For adults, guests can exercise in the mornings, and later in the large pool you can do water aerobics or attend yoga classes.  And in the evenings, the program of events begins with a mini-disco for kids, after which adult programs are held in the amphitheater.  A disco is held later, but there are not many tourists there.  In general, the animation is not intrusive at all, some tourists even think that there are few events.  But children's animators skillfully get along with the kids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ozkaymak incekum hotel 5 tours" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2004613.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has two outdoor pools and one indoor.  Ponds are equipped with recreation areas with sun loungers, which are not enough for all tourists.  Because of this, in the early morning, vacationers try to take their place with towels.  The hotel has a massage parlor and hammam, which you can always visit.  There is a bus stop near the exit of the complex, from here you can easily get to Alanya if you want to see something interesting.  In addition, shops and cafes are located very close by. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  The Ozkaymak Incekum Hotel 5 * hotel (reviews confirm this) has a very convenient location.  Its main advantage is that it is located directly on the coast, so there is no need to make long walks to the beach under the scorching sun.  The wide coast is very convenient for relaxation.  There are sunbeds and sunbeds on the beach.  A gentle entry into the sea is covered with small pebbles, if you swim further, then there are large boulders that absolutely do not interfere with swimming.  In general, the coast is just made for relaxation.  Yes, and kids here are comfortable swimming.  On the beach there are traditional sea attractions in the form of scooters and bananas, and restless animators offer to join the team and play volleyball. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In general, we can say that the hotel makes a very good impression, although it has a number of disadvantages that are associated primarily with the staff of the institution.  The rest of the complex on the beach is worthy of the attention of tourists.  Of course, it cannot be classified as a luxury hotel, but at the same time, it fully corresponds to the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio.  Among vacationers there are tourists who are not the first time visiting this complex, considering it a good option for relaxing in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAlanya.  Local beaches and picturesque forests approaching the sea are worthy of the attention of vacationers.  Not all Turkish resorts can boast of such beautiful nature. </p>
