And one of those is President 4 *.  Majorca receives tens of thousands of tourists every year, and many decide to stay there.  Well, therefore, it is necessary to tell in more detail about what the hotel offers its guests. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a very good location is the hotel HSM President 4 *.  Mallorca is Spain's largest island by area.  There is a picturesque and beautiful village called Puerto de Alcudia.  It is located in the northern part of the island.  This is where the hotel is located.  It is only 15 meters from the beach.  The hotel accepts guests from May to October. </p>

    <p>  Near the building there is a picturesque forest, and literally a couple of meters away - a small bay.  The village center is a 10-minute walk away.  It takes about an hour to reach Palma (a major tourist center and the main port of the Balearic Islands).  The airport is far away - 70 kilometers from the village.  But then the planes do not interfere with their takeoffs and landings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is a bus stop next to the hotel, so you can leave almost anywhere. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Now in more detail about what services are offered in President 4 * (Mallorca).  Wi-Fi in public areas is free, and you need to pay extra for in-room internet.  An office building with fax and photocopy machines, as well as dry cleaning and car rental are located in the hotel building.  True, there are no parking lots in the complex. </p><p>  The registration desk here works round the clock, so check-in can be carried out not at 14:00, as according to the rules, but earlier.  But this must be negotiated.  The administration will meet the guests if, by the time they arrive, the room will be free from previous guests, and the staff will have time to prepare it and put it in order. </p><p>  If people gather somewhere for the whole day (for an excursion, for example), they can go to the reception the day before and order lunches with them.  By the way, the staff speaks not only Spanish, but also German and English.  It is worth taking a phrase book with you to better explain if you have problems with languages. </p>

    <h2>  Standard 2-bed rooms </h2><p>  President Majorca 4 * (Spain, Mallorca) has apartments of various categories.  However, it is worth telling more about each of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most budget option (and, accordingly, the most popular) is the 2-seater standards, whose area is 22 square meters.  m. Inside there are two single beds, which are shifted tightly to each other, so it seems that this is one bed.  The interior is pleasant, the floor is parquet, there is nothing superfluous inside.  There is a balcony, plasma TV, powerful air conditioning, dressing room.  Naturally, the room has a plumbing unit with a bath, toilet and toiletries.  A fridge, hairdryer and telephone with safe are also included. </p><p>  7 days with breakfast will cost two guests about 42,000 rubles.  If you order the all-inclusive service, you will have to pay about 63 thousand rubles.  This is a better option.  The restaurant and bar serves good, quality food and drinks.  And besides, few people want to look for a cafe in the vicinity of the hot sun, where they could have a bite.  And so everything is nearby. </p><h2>  Improved options </h2><p>  The HSM President 4 * (Mallorca, Alcudia) has an even more expensive 2-bed apartment.  Conditions - all the same, only from the furnished balcony guests enjoy amazing sea views.  For this you need to overpay.

    <h2>  About staying at the hotel </h2><p>  In HMS President Hotel 4 * (Mallorca) you can stay with children of any age.  If the baby is not two years old, then specially for him they will put a cot in the room, and it will be free.  Need an extra bed for someone older?  Then you will have to pay 50% of the total cost of living for this service.  But if the child is younger than 12. Do guests have an older child?  Or did a third older guest come with them?  In these cases, it will be necessary to pay 85% of the total cost of living per person. </p><p>  If an extra bed or crib is needed, you must inform the property in advance.  The administration must send a response to the guests. </p><p>  By the way, only persons over 16 years old are allowed into the SPA center, which the President 4 * hotel has (Mallorca).  And you also need to bring a bathing cap and slippers with you. </p><p>  Upon check-in, guests are required to present an identity card and a credit card, the details of which were indicated at the time of making the remote booking.  The hotel accepts only two options - this is ‚ÄúMaster Card‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù. </p><h2>  Hotel guests </h2><p>  <span>HSM President Hotel</span> 4 * <span>(Mallorca)</span> gets a variety of <span>reviews</span> .  But most of them are positive.  First of all, tourists talk about the location.  The hotel was successfully located - in a quiet location, from where you can reach the city center by bus, which takes guests directly from the hotel.  True, you need to remember that during the siesta they do not go. </p><p>  If the trip is scheduled for the high season (that is, for the summer), you need to be prepared for the fact that you will have to take sun loungers on the beach in the morning.  You can, of course, spread a towel and lie down like that.  But <span>note</span> this fact is worth <span>accepting</span> . </p><p>  The beach is small but clean, the entrance to the sea is comfortable, sandy.  Still there is clear water, dirty it does not happen even after a storm.  And all because the beach is protected by the bay that surrounds it.  Therefore, there are no waves here.  The only minus of the beach is the lack of a shower.  But the hotel is a minute's walk from the sea, so you can put up with this shortcoming. </p>

    <h2>  About staff </h2><p>  Important for many tourists who want to come here, is how well trained the staff working in President 4 * (Mallorca) are.  Reviews allow you to understand this. </p><p>  Clean well, regularly change towels.  Two large ones per person are provided, and another as many small ones for arms and legs.  Dressing gowns are also given out here, but a deposit of 10 euros must be paid for them at the reception.  The same goes for <span>beach towels.</span>  Issued immediately - no waiting.  Shampoos, body milk, soap, gels - all this is in every bathroom, regularly replenish supplies. </p><p>  The waiters in restaurants work quickly, the service is good, decent, the same can be said about the bar.  However, at the height of the season, it‚Äôs all the same, as they say, ‚Äúthere are not enough hands‚Äù.  But this is bearable.  If you want more space in every sense of the word, you should go here in May.  Or, even better, in October.  Fortunately, the climate here is good, you can swim in the sea with comfort even during these months. </p><h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  People leaving <span>reviews</span> about the HSM President 4 * hotel <span>(Mallorca)</span> often give good advice or indicate what other tourists going here should pay attention to. </p><p>  So, it is worth knowing that the restaurant has self-service in terms of drinks.  There are large vessels with beer, sangria, wine and more.  If a person did not order ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù, then any drink costs 3 euros.  But, as observant visitors assure, no one controls who poured how much and what, so they write out an account for 3 y.  e. per person.  If "all inclusive", then you can drink everything in any quantity. </p><p>  It is worth noting that for very young children there is no food in the restaurant.  We need to take this into account people who decided to go here with the kids.  You will have to look for either a solution or another hotel. </p><p>  There is one drawback - they do not offer tea and coffee at dinner.  This is unusual for people who come from Russia.  After all, here we can say traditional drinks.  And in the restaurant at dinner you have to drink cakes, pastries, rolls and other delicious sweets with water or juices.  You can try to take hot tea with you. </p>

    <h2>  Who should go </h2><p>  And finally, a few words about who the President Majorca 4 * hotel is intended for (Spain, Mallorca).  If you believe the reviews and the description, then this is a hotel for young people, single tourists and those who want to spend their long-awaited vacation in a quiet place.  Compared to other noisy resorts, where dozens or even hundreds of thousands of tourists come every year, it is really quite quiet here. </p><p>  By the way, there are few Russians here, which plays into the hands of people who want a break from their home and everything that is there.  The main contingent is visitors from Germany and the Poles. </p><p>  In general, if you want to have a good time, enjoying a sea holiday and good food, you should go here. </p>
