Based on the definition, we can understand that this concept is inextricably linked with society.  Let's analyze it in more detail. </p><h2>  How social studies connect personality and society </h2><p>  In all the various interpretations of the <span>concept of "personality"</span> is common.  It turns out that the main thing with which it is inextricably linked is the collective.  That is, in social science, a personality is <span>a human</span> individual endowed with a system of socially significant traits.  But is it possible to combine these concepts? </p>

    <h2>  Difference from the individual </h2><p>  The individual is a separate <span>member of society.</span>  Like an ant in an anthill.  It is enough to get into a crowded transport, as we will see dozens of individuals.  In other words, this is a concept that is used to designate an individual in society, about which we do not know what features, talents, qualities, etc. </p><p>  In social science, a person is something more, since this term also implies special properties of a person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social studies personality and society" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1349263.jpg" width="600"></div>

But confuse it with the concept of individuality is not worth it.  The last term focuses on the characteristics of a person, his unique qualities, which are in no way connected with society. </p><p>  To make it clearer, we give an example.  A person very well draws volumetric pictures with a pencil.  His work is unique.  No one can repeat them.  The master himself does not understand why this is happening.  He has a sense of style, beauty, which he cannot explain.  Talented creative people usually associate this with a divine, supernatural gift.  Of course, we will not delve into theology and explain it.  It is in this case that we are dealing with individuality - an excellent master. </p><p>  You can say about one that he sings beautifully, the other is a good artist, etc. All of them are bright individuals.  Each in its own way.  It‚Äôs good to draw, to speak beautifully, to quickly solve mathematical formulas - all these are traits that belong to the individual. </p><p>  And in social science, personality is a social, social concept.  This is an individual who is endowed with certain qualities, but they appear in the collective.  For example, a person always asserts his rights.  He is not used to losing and goes all the way.  Everyone around him says that this is hopeless.  None of this will work out.  But man is sure.  This is precisely what is a vivid manifestation of the term "personality."  That is, these are the features that appear in the team. </p><p>  Here we come to another concept that social science emphasizes - a "strong personality." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The concept of a strong personality </h2><p>  The previous example showed that a person is able to go to the end in a certain situation and not be afraid to challenge the system.  It is in this that the definition of <span>‚Äústrong personality‚Äù</span> is expressed <span>.</span> </p><p>  The main difference of such people is that they develop special rules of behavior in complex, non-standard situations, where the majority would simply give up and back down.  By the way, the latter is also a manifestation of personality, character.  But you cannot call such people strong. </p><p>  Strong personalities most often go into politics, sports, and business.  They, as a rule, find themselves in leading social roles.  And since there is always competition, envy, malice in the world, such people are not afraid, challenging others. </p>

    <h2>  Distinctive features of a strong personality </h2><p>  A strong personality is distinguished by: </p><ul><li>  Willingness to fight, to defend their rights and interests. </li><li>  Purposefulness, the desire to develop and go only forward.  And when one goal is achieved, always set another - higher. </li><li>  Lack of fear of difficulties, as well as immunity to failure. </li></ul><p>  All this has a social personality.  Social studies connect this concept with the collective. </p><p>  But not every action of one person in relation to another reveals the essence of the described concept.  For example, a collision of two motorcycles.  This also happens in society, but vehicle owners are just individuals.  With the same blow, one of them turned out to be stronger and escaped with a slight bruise.  Another was more seriously injured.  And this distinguishes them as individuals. </p><p>  In social science, a person is when a person influences another through his actions.  For example, one motorcyclist sued in an accident.  This is what characterizes him as a person. </p><p>  In each profession and social role, you can distinguish <span>strong people.</span>  There is a saying: "It‚Äôs not a place that colors a person, but a person‚Äôs place."  This is not said about the external data of the latter, but about the behavior and special properties of a social nature.  Thinking, experiencing, suffering, making plans, learning, setting goals - all these are manifestations of the concept of "personality." </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Thus, the concepts that operate in social science become clear: man, personality, <span>individual, individuality.</span>  All of this is not the same thing.  Each definition has its own scope.  It would seem that each is both a person and an individuality.  Nevertheless, they are clearly delineated.  The latter only has an indirect relationship with society, since individuality is not directly dependent on society.  Although society can affect its development.  The concept of personality is impossible without a collective, society. </p>
