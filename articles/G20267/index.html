What was the name of the first Soviet color TV?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern life is impossible to imagine without a TV.  It is hard to believe that once there was no television at all.  The first broadcast image at a distance appeared in the distant 1880s, and televisions were then electromechanical.  And only in 1907 did the method of electric image transmission appear, and in 1932, the Americans invented electronic television.  Soon after the appearance of the first black and white models, scientists developed the first color television.  Black and white tones did not allow to fully enjoy the beauty of the outside world.  Our ancestors installed a three-color film in front of the TV screen, thereby trying to diversify the color gamut of the image. </p><h2></h2><h2>  First patented project </h2>

He managed at the end of 1899 to obtain a patent for an authentic multi-colored television system.  This system was an analogue of today.  Over the course of history, about twenty-five color rendering projects put forward by various inventors have been known.  Alexander Polumordvinov proposed the theory of three-component multi-colored vision.  This theory of color perception was called Lomonosov-Jung-Helmgonz.

    <p>  To get the image, two disks were used.  They rotated at different speeds parallel to each other.  In the first disk, slots were made along radius lines, that is, from the center to the edge, and in the second disk, slots were cut in the form of a logarithmic spiral.  The number of slots was a multiple of three. </p><p>  When the slots on both disks intersected, a diamond-shaped hole was obtained, which was a deploying element during the rotation of the disks.  To obtain the image signal, the slots were sequentially closed by light filters.  They were purple, green and red.  Using a selenium photocell, light that seeped through a diamond-shaped hole was converted into an electrical signal.  Between the visual projection of the transmitted image and the photocell at each time interval there was one hole that was closed by a color filter of any color.  At the moment when the hole went beyond the image frame, the next hole was shifted from the opposite side, which was offset by a distance equal to the width of the gap.  This hole was closed by another filter of a different color. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2></h2><h2>  We find out when the first color TV appeared </h2>

Finding out which first color television appeared in the world should be addressed in the fifties, when in the USA RCA released the first color-broadcast television CBS RX-40, which had a mechanical scan.  The screen was 14 by 10 cm in size, in front of it was a disk with light filters, which had a synchronized electric motor.  But the image quality was very poor.  In Russia, the first color television was released in 1954 in the city of Leningrad.  The name of that model is Rainbow.  The advantage of the Soviet TV was that the spinning disk was hidden in the casing.  Also, the television receiver had an external magnifying lens made of plastic, which was filled with distilled water.

    <h2></h2><h2>  Electronic Scan Development </h2><p>  In 1950, a kinescope was developed with three electron guns located at an angle of 120 degrees relative to each other.  Such a television had an electronic scan and a mask tube, covered with a mosaic phosphor.  Three beams emerged from the three cathodes (guns) and were collected in a ‚Äúmask‚Äù.  Then the rays hit the screen and the segments glowed in green, red and blue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2></h2><h2>  Period westinghouse </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when the first color tv appeared" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/346399.jpg?1393785021610" width="500"></div></h2><p>  According to this principle, in 1954, Westinghouse released the first color TV and introduced it for sale as the model H840SK15.  But of the five hundred issued, they sold only thirty in a month, most of them remained unsold.  Such failure was explained by a high price - 1295 US dollars, in translation into today's money - 11,200 dollars.  Even the advertising company, which was supposed to provoke a strong desire to purchase the world's first color TV, did not help.  Also, the first color TV was not needed due to irrelevance, because most of the programs were shown in black and white. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The second brand of TV </h2><p>  The RCA CT-100, released in April 1954, was more popular.  It was the first serial color TV.  Its screen was 12 inches.  5,000 TVs were sold for $ 1,000.  A few weeks later, the same company RCA released a TV with a screen of 15 inches.  Later models were presented with 19 - and 20-inch screens. </p>

The color television market was expanding and now, finding out when color televisions appeared, some historians call different dates.  But the fact remains - new functions appeared in them, opportunities changed.  General Electric sold 15-inch televisions for $ 1,000, and Sylvania for 1,150. Some firms leased televisions.  For example, Emerson for the first month of rent took two hundred dollars, and the subsequent cost only 75 dollars.  Then there was a price of $ 795 for a model with a diagonal of 21 inches.  And by the end of 1957, one hundred and fifty thousand color televisions were sold.  In the sixties, many TV models were developed, among which were the Rainbow and Temp.  In the early seventies, the number of color broadcasts in the United States increased, the cost of televisions decreased significantly.  In 1967, the first color transmission of the SECAM standard appeared in the USSR, and the first Soviet color television appeared on store shelves, it was called Rubin-401.  It was completely Soviet-made.

    <p>  Earlier, in February 1957, the Council of Ministers decided that in 1958 broadcasting should begin on a joint system.  At Shabolovka in November 1958, the OSTS-2 was manufactured.  And in January 1960, she began to broadcast regularly on the NTSC system.  At that time, only two factories were engaged in the production of television sets.  This is the Leningrad plant them.  Kozitsky - "Rainbow" and the radio factory in Moscow - "Temp-22".  Televisions have not yet been on sale, although 4,000 have been released. </p><h2></h2><h2>  First color broadcast </h2><p>  The first color broadcast of the wide broadcast took place in 1967 on November 7 thanks to the concluded <span>agreement on cooperation between the</span> USSR and France.  The French system was called SECAM.  The brand of the first color TV was also French - KFT. </p><p>  In <span>1967,</span> the "Rubin-714" appeared, which turned out to be the most popular at that time, since the screen diagonal was already 61 cm. </p><p>  For a long period, color TVs were sold at a lower price to provide customers with the opportunity to get color TV at an affordable price and appreciate its benefits. </p>

The most dangerous and powerful part was installed on the right - a scan unit with high-voltage lamps and a <span>horizontal transformer.</span>  The TV took a meter range.  To receive decimeter channels, a prefix was released, which converted the channels into one of the meter ones.

Lamps were no longer used.  Televisions were becoming smaller and larger technology.  Now manufacturers represent a huge number of TVs of different sizes.
