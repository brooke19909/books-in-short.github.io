There are a lot of ideas.  For example, you can make beautiful <span>Christmas trees with your own hands</span> from threads.  Making such a thing is easy.  You will not need any special fixtures and materials.  Everyone needs everything in the house.  The process of making this souvenir is very simple and exciting.  Even a child will be happy to take part in this. </p><h2>  How to make a Christmas tree from threads </h2><p>  Such crafts are the simplest from the point of view of manufacture.  You will need the following materials: </p><ul><li>  whatman; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  <span>PVA glue</span> ; </li><li>  <span>cling film</span> or any other; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  needle. </li></ul><p>  There are two manufacturing techniques for these facilities.  They are similar in the sequence of actions, but in one case, a film and a needle are required, and in the other, no.  Which method to choose depends on the materials at hand.  If the child will make a Christmas tree, it is better to do without a needle (or take a plastic one). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself Christmas trees" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/672332.jpg" width="207"></div>

    <h2>  Master class: Christmas tree made of threads </h2><p>  The manufacturing process consists of the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Prepare the base in the form of a cone from whatman using scissors and glue.  You can use the finished frame by buying cardboard caps for the holiday. </li><li>  Wrap the surface with foil or bag so that the minimum number of folds is obtained.  This operation can be omitted, but then removing the product from the base will be a little more difficult. </li><li>  Win the threads on the cone, pre-lubricating them with glue.  To facilitate the work, you can thread a needle with a twisted thread through a hole made in a tube of glue.  After passing through such a system, the threads are ready for use.  The yarn is usually wound up in a chaotic manner.  It is quite possible to entrust the child.  Work is best done from the bottom up.  Do not try to use a lot of yarn.  Better when the tree remains openwork. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class a tree of thread" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/672334.jpg" width="334"></div></li><li>  When the threads are wound, you need to leave the product for a while (for drying). </li><li>  Carefully remove the cardboard backing. </li></ol><p>  Your souvenir is ready.  Do-it-yourself Christmas trees from threads can be made in different sizes: from 5-10 cm to meter decorations of the room.  The color scheme is applied both traditional (green shades of one tone) and decorative (red, white, alternating circles of several colors).  Do not be afraid to experiment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to decorate a souvenir made </h2><p>  When your tree of threads is ready, it can be left or decorated with various elements.  Usually use the following options: </p><ul><li>  an asterisk or ball on the top (plastic, paper); </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  sequins; </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  bows; </li><li>  snowflakes </li><li>  tinsel; </li><li>  the rain. </li></ul><p>  Now you know how to make a Christmas tree from threads and how to decorate it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a christmas tree from threads" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/672319.jpg" width="374"></div>  It is worth showing imagination and using any improvised materials for decoration.  Depending on the size of the souvenir, colored cereals, beads, buttons, cones, and candies may be suitable.  The main thing is not to overload the tree.  The openwork product is not intended for a large number of heavy decor.

    <h2>  Balls and plot compositions </h2><p>  A Christmas tree made of threads can be decorated with balls made in the same way.  Balloons are used as the basis for them, which, after the glue dries, are pierced with a needle and removed. </p><p>  If a large Christmas tree is made to decorate the interior, you can supplement it with other similar objects: a snowman, stylized Santa Claus and Snow Maiden.  The combination of different colors and textures will create a spectacular stylish decor. </p><h2>  How to make a souvenir lamp </h2><p>  Christmas trees made of threads (their photos are presented in the review) are used to decorate the interior as lampshades for nightlights.  They create fancy shadows from the openwork structure and look very unusual, stylish and romantic.  There is nothing complicated in creating such a thing.  You just need to pick up a small lamp.  Having bought the base, calculate the required diameter of the base of the Christmas tree, take measurements and proceed to create the lampshade using the technology described above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tree of thread" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/672316.jpg" width="236"></div>

A large assortment of this product is offered in the yarn store not only in terms of quality and color, but also the texture of the future product.  Try to make Christmas trees with your own hands from threads of different types.  Original, and most importantly, "weed" looks very natural and natural. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree made of thread photo" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/672352.jpg" width="337"></div>

    <p>  It is worth saying that in this case, the threads should be wound on the base with clear horizontal rows or in a spiral.  If you make this process chaotically, the Christmas tree of thread-grass will be disheveled.  However, if you want to surprise the audience, then you can experiment.  For example, try to make such a souvenir from yarn, which consists of several multi-colored threads.  Combining them with "weed", you can get original effects. </p><h2>  Striped Christmas Tree </h2><p>  In addition to the above, other decorative yarns are also sold, for example, made in the form of ribbons.  They can resemble lace, frills, sewing.  From the edges, such tapes have a thread with loops, which are used to connect the yarn into a single fabric.  How to make a Christmas tree of thread strips?  Yes, very simple.  It will be enough for you to stick such thread-strips on the base, which does not need to be removed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself Christmas trees" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/672337.jpg" width="296"></div>
