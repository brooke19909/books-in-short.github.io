    <h2>  How to save photos from iPhone via USB </h2><p>  Let's start with this question, because the answer to it is very simple.  In order to save the photos you took, you just need to connect your iPhone to the computer with the USB cable included with the phone.  The first time you connect to the computer, all the necessary drivers are automatically installed.  Next, the operating system, whether it be Windows or Mac OS, will identify your device as a removable disk, that is, as a regular flash card.  Well, then everything is simple: open a new disk on the computer and see all the photos that are in your iPhone.  Note that in this way you can only copy the photo to the iPhone or video, also taken by you on the camera, which, like the photos, is on your phone in the Camera Roll folder.  Other content from your smartphone - music, movies, documents - cannot be copied in this way! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to sync photos from iPhone via iCloud </h2><p>  A very convenient way that does not require any action from you, well, except, of course, the initial settings - this is transferring photos through Apple's cloud service - iCloud, using the "Photo Stream" function.  Thus, you can send photos both from an iPhone to a computer, and vice versa.  Before you upload photos to the iPhone and vice versa, you must, as mentioned above, configure the device accordingly. </p><h2>  Set up Photo Stream on iPhone </h2><p>  In order to allow your iPhone to transfer all photos through the "Photo Stream", enable this function.  To do this, go to "Settings", and then find the iCloud item.  Next, in the "Photo" settings, enable the corresponding switch.  Please note that photos will only be downloaded to devices with the photo stream enabled if there is a Wi-Fi connection. </p><h2>  Setting up "Photo Stream" in the computer </h2><p>  If Windows is installed on your computer, then to start working with the photo stream, install the free iCloud program from the Apple website.  Downloading and installing the program should not cause any difficulties.  After iCloud is installed, log in to the service under your Apple credentials.  It‚Äôs important that you enter the same Apple ID as on the iPhone, which is how the system identifies you.  In the program window, check the box next to "Photos" and after clicking on the "Options ..." button, specify where the "Photo Stream" will be located on the computer.  On Mac OS, things are pretty much the same.  ICloud settings can be found in the computer settings, and there, next to the "Photos" item, enable "Photo Stream".  There is no option to specify a folder due to the fact that Photo Stream uploads a photo when iPhoto is turned on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now, no matter what type of iPhone you have ‚Äî iPhone 4, 4s or iPhone 5 ‚Äî the photos you took on your device can be viewed almost immediately on your computer.  How to upload photos to iPhone?  Just drag them into the appropriate folder on your computer (Windows) or into the iPhoto window (Mac OS), and they will soon be found on your smartphone.  Note that in the same way, photos are deleted from the "Photo Stream", that is, if you delete the photo on your computer, it will disappear in the iPhone.  If you want to save it on your phone, then copy the image from the My Photo Stream folder to the Camera Roll.  Also on the computer - copy the photo to another folder if you decide to remove it from the "Photo Stream" on the iPhone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="copy photo to iphone" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/471623.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to upload photos to iPhone via iTunes </h2><p>  And one more way.  It is only suitable for downloading photos from a computer.  If you haven‚Äôt done this before, first install the free iTunes program from Apple.  This program is a must-have software for iPhone owners.  With its help, you can create backup copies of the device, as well as upload various content to it, for example, books, photos, music, ringtones, murals.  Now let's talk only about photographs.  After the program detects the iPhone connected to the computer, it will display it in the panel on the left.  In order to make any manipulations with the phone, you must select it by clicking the left mouse button.  In the central part of the program window, various information about the iPhone will immediately be visible, as well as several tabs that display its contents.  In order to upload photos to iPhone, you need to go to the "Photos" tab.  First you need to create a folder on your computer where photos will be stored for synchronization with the phone.  Download everything you want to see on your iPhone.  On the Photos tab in iTunes, check the box next to "Sync photos from ..." and specify the folder to sync.  If necessary, enable the ability to upload videos.  If necessary, you can select individual photos to be downloaded from the specified folder, if it is iPhoto on Mac OS, or subfolders. </p><p>  After you perform all the above manipulations, click "Apply" or "Synchronize" in the lower right corner of the program, wait for the process to finish and you can view the photo on the iPhone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 5 photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13354/471721.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to upload photos via the Internet to iPhone </h2><p>  There is an opportunity to download any photo or picture you like from the Internet right onto your iPhone.  Photos uploaded in this way will end up in Camera Roll on your phone.  In order to save your favorite picture, just open it in the iPhone browser, touch it and hold it for a while - about 1 second.  You will see a menu containing the "Save Image", "Copy" and "Cancel" options.  When you select the first photo will be saved. </p><p>  In addition to all of the above, there are various "cloud" services for transferring files between devices using the Web.  But we will not consider these opportunities, since the descriptions of each of them are a separate topic. </p>
