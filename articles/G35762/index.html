Now the equipment of this brand occupies a leading position in the market and is popular among Russians.  The company creates devices for everyday life, without which a modern person cannot exist.  Irons "Vitek" (reviews note that the device glides easily on the surface, quickly heats up and has a stylish modern design) - this is no exception, they have gained popularity among thousands of women. </p><h2>  Product range </h2><p>  The company in a large assortment produces Vitek irons.  Reviews indicate the versatility of these devices.  They say that this technique is affordable and, despite this, is not inferior to more expensive competitors.  So, Vitek irons are divided into several categories, these are: </p><ul><li>  appliances where the sole has a ceramic coating; </li><li>  devices with auto power off; </li><li>  products with the provided anti-scale system; </li><li>  Irons with anti-drop system; </li><li>  devices with a double sole; </li><li>  non-stick coating equipment; </li><li>  irons with a special anodized sole. </li></ul><p>  All products, regardless of category, have an affordable price and excellent quality, smooth temperature control.  They easily stroke even the most delicate things.  The degree of heating of the sole in each iron changes gradually. </p><p>  The anti-drop function prevents water from leaking out of the tank when ironing at low temperatures.  Spot steam boost makes it possible to smooth out the wrinkled fabric as much as possible.  The anti-limescale option purifies water from heavy salts due to the special <span>ion-exchange resin</span> in the filter <span>.</span>  Automatic shutdown mode makes the device as safe as possible.  He turns off the iron if it is not used for a certain time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each buyer can easily choose the most suitable model for himself.  When choosing a product, you should pay attention to the sole, which can be both ceramic and anodized.  The latter provides a smoother glide, antistatic effect, has openings for steam or contains particles of tourmaline. </p><p>  The cost of the device is influenced by the number of built-in functions, material quality, design.  There are models that allow you to steam a thing vertically.  This makes it possible to iron things on a hanger or to iron the curtains. </p><h2>  Irons "Vitek" with auto shut off </h2>

    <p>  Irons "Vitek" have proven themselves both on the positive and the negative side.  The first category of citizens note that the irons of this brand iron well underwear, easily glide over the fabric, do not leave traces and smudges.  Particularly noted are the function of vaporization and vertical steam.  They say that when smoothing too crumpled things can not do without the option of spraying. </p><p>  The undoubted advantage is called the ‚ÄúAnti-drop‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnti-droplet‚Äù and self-cleaning systems. <br>  Users indicate the versatility of the device, its affordable price and ease of care, handling. </p><h2>  Negative opinions </h2><p>  Irons "Vitek" have negative reviews.  These users report plaque on the sole of the instrument.  From their words, pollution can hardly be removed.  Quite often, the upper buttons stick to these household appliances, which leads to the failure of some functions. </p><p>  There are people who note that the Vitek irons (some reviews note the short life of these devices) do not smooth things well.  such users consider them low-power and are not advised to purchase. </p>
