But buckles with frames, handles and fasteks will be needed for those who work on backpacks and bags.  An important attribute of such products is a plastic carbine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="in.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Carabiner - loop" class="if uuid-2826973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2826973.jpg"></div><p>  Sewing accessories, successfully selected by the designer, are functional, intricate, gives the product a special style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Plastic carbines: scope </h2><p>  The plastic carabiner is given special attention, it connects two loops with a ‚Äúquick lock‚Äù.  Things are fastened to each other.  So it is possible: </p><ul><li>  snap the belt (strap) to the <span>bag, briefcase,</span> backpack, case, case; </li><li>  fix the leash on the dog‚Äôs collar, on the cat‚Äôs harness; </li><li>  connect a badge with a cord, a key with a key fob; </li><li>  fasten extra items on the outside of the backpack; </li><li>  fasten the valves and sections of the bag; </li><li>  to fix decor items in the interior. </li></ul><p>  A simple plastic mechanism is used for sewing youth and ladies' bags, stylish clothes, and backpacks.  Used in the manufacture of sports equipment, workwear.  They are also necessary for sewing repairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strayingdogblog.blogspot.com" data-author=": Laura van Zonneveld, "><img itemprop="image" alt="For a leash you need a turning carabiner" class="if uuid-2826948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2826948.jpg"></div><h2>  Plastic carabiner: design features </h2><p>  The classic design of the mechanism is simple.  These are two parts: a loop and a latch.  Managing this know-how is easy, clicks with one hand. </p><p>  Correctly selected size of the device assumes that the internal size of the eye of the carabiner corresponds to the width of the sling, belt, frame or tape. </p><p>  To fasten a briefcase or backpack on the body, fasten the inner segments of the bag, a snap hook is used.  The rectangular plastic mechanism, fastex, is brought into working position by snapping in two parts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="1lKMw713VeA" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lKMw713VeA" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/8/9/5/5/8955.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of plastic carbines </h2><p>  The main advantages of plastic carbines: </p><ul><li>  lightness, wear resistance and strength; </li><li>  small dimensions; </li><li>  simplicity and reliability of fixation, accessible even to a child; </li><li>  operating comfort: a plastic carbine will not make it harder to wear, it will not ring when moving, but it will add comfort to the process of using a backpack or bag, and will add style and originality; </li><li>  low cost; </li><li>  resistance to chemical and mechanical influences; </li><li>  retains its original color; </li><li>  Does not affect the properties and color of the fabric. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="artsshops.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple design: loop and latch" class="if uuid-2826997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2826997.jpg"></div><p>  One drawback is that plastic carabiners for backpacks and bags have low tensile strength.  They can not be seriously overloaded and used in the manufacture of sports climbing equipment.  An exception is the fittings made of high-strength polyamide. </p><h2>  Hardware made of polyamide </h2><p>  Duraflex products are characterized by high quality, lightness, wear resistance, Resistant to fracture stresses, temperature extremes, ultraviolet, severe frosts, salt water. </p><p>  Polyamide 6.6 is a very strong brand.  The material contains two components: </p><ul><li>  Acetal is a tough, tear-resistant material.  It is steady against moisture and amplitude fluctuations of temperatures.  The disadvantage is that due to stiffness it does not withstand shock impacts. </li><li>  Nylon - is lightweight, highly resistant to impact, but only at normal temperature.  30% stronger than acetal.  But it has the property of water absorption, enhancing the fragility of the material at low temperatures. <div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plastic carabiner Duraflex" class="if uuid-2827205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2827205.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  The advantages and disadvantages of acetal and nylon are mutually overlapping.  The material is durable, reliable and at the same time light.  Duraflex is not just a carabiner for bags.  Plastic, high-quality, durable, it has confidently established itself in extreme conditions and is used with pleasure by tourists. </p><h2>  Choose a carabiner </h2><p>  The main things to look for when choosing a carbine are the weight, size and features of future luggage.  Carabiners differ in many ways: </p><ol><li>  In size: large and small.  Size is determined by the length of the carabiner and the diameter of the eyelet. </li><li>  In shape: round (especially convenient for handles), oval, cone-shaped, in the shape of a triangle. </li><li>  By material: metal and plastic. </li><li>  By the method of fixation: snap classic and with twist. </li><li>  In the form of a connecting ring of a carbine: in the form of an ellipse, a triangle, in the form of a coat hanger, with a direct base. </li><li>  According to the method of connection with the base: loop, swivel (freely rotated during rotation, without tangling the mount), fastener (fastex). </li><li>  By color: white, black, beige, color.  Plastic is selected to match the product. </li><li>  By appointment: for a women‚Äôs bag, a man‚Äôs bag, for a school bag, for various backpacks, for a clutch or purse. </li></ol><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="UlFcLf7I2Hw" data-url="https://youtu.be/UlFcLf7I2Hw" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/8/9/5/3/8953.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing plastic accessories for bags and backpacks, they pay attention to quality and technical specifications.  Color and shape are not a priority in this situation.  A good plastic carabiner should be strong, light and reliable. </p>
