  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samara Region, Tolyatti and Freedom Square</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the death of the last of the Rurikovich clan, Tsar Fedor, troubled times came.  The steppes raised their heads again.  The raids on Russian cities began.  The Samara fortress could no longer adequately defend the borders, but there was no strength to create new bastions.  Only the second of the Romanov clan began again to fix the borders. </p><p>  Between Samara and Kazan there was a fortress Simbirsk.  Another 100 years passed, and closer to Samara a new fortress was laid - Stavropol.  Who knows how the history of the settlement would have developed had not been near two strong garrisons: Samara and Ulyanovsk. </p><h2>  History of Stavropol </h2><p>  It is difficult to say how the history of a provincial town could develop.  He lived his quiet peaceful life, the border moved far east and south.  The garrison was no longer needed, there was almost no industry.  The city gradually became a village and was quietly dying. </p><p>  The turbulent years and the post-war restoration of the national economy awakened him to life.  The government found the strength to return to the Leninist plan for electrifying the country.  In 1950, it was decided to build a new RES on the Volga.  Stavropol was very lucky; it turned out to be very close to the construction site and played a large role in locating builders and new plants serving the hydroelectric power station. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16" data-lng="49.40887900000007" data-lat="53.5125335"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/0/6/7/3067.png"></div><h2>  Komsomol youth </h2><p>  Komsomol members of the 50s of the XX century enthusiastically began to build a new city.  On the banks of the Volga, new industrial giants arose: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Volgocemmach. </li><li>  Synthetic rubber plant. </li><li>  Kuibyshev phosphorus. </li><li>  KuibyshevAzot. </li></ul><p>  The people dreamed of freeing themselves from hard physical labor, conquering nature, large cities with spacious squares and large areas.  The new Stavropol began to revive from Freedom Square.  In the center appeared an obelisk to the ‚ÄúFighters for Freedom‚Äù, personifying the memory of the heroes of the countrymen who died for the freedom and brotherhood of all mankind.  The boulevard adjacent to the square became Youth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chronograph.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Youth Boulevard" class="if uuid-2456813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2456813.jpg"></div><p>  In the 60s of the XX century the city was lucky a second time.  It was decided to build a joint factory with the FIAT car concern.  As was customary among the Communists, the city was renamed, named after the head of the Communists of Italy, Palmiro Tolyatti.  Already the new automobile center of the country was growing around Freedom Square in Togliatti. </p><h2>  Area Description </h2><p>  In Togliatti, Freedom Square was built according to the classical scheme of socialist classicism (Stalinist architecture): </p><ul><li>  The central place was given to the temple of culture.  At the address: Togliatti, Freedom Square, 2, there is a building built in 1958 according to the project of architect Sharonov - the Pilgrim Puppet Theater. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Freedom Square" class="if uuid-2456804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2456804.jpg"></div><ul><li>  On the right and left side of the temple of science are two symmetrical ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù: the Stavropol City Executive Committee and the Administration of the Stavropol District. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="District Administration" class="if uuid-2456811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2456811.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Designers found their place in the central square - the Saratovgiprogorselstroya branch. </li><li>  As it was then, close the square and begin Youth Residential Boulevard. </li></ul><p>  More at: Togliatti, Freedom Square, no buildings.  Cities were built in order to have a space where people can walk.  Point buildings were not perceived. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Puppet Theatre </h2><p>  The building of the architect Sharonov did not immediately become a puppet theater.  Initially, it was just a House of Culture with a hall for 400 seats.  Only in 1973, the main director Roman Renz assembled a young team that began to work professionally. </p><p>  Already the end of the year was marked by the first premiere of the play by Sapgir G.V. "You are for me."  The success was obvious.  But it took a long 10 years for the building on Freedom Square in Togliatti to become owned by the Pilgrim Puppet Theater.  A significant role belongs to the famous Sergei Obraztsov.  He repeatedly visited the city with his creative evenings and was personally acquainted with many members of the troupe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tol.arriva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Puppet Theatre" class="if uuid-2456815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2456815.jpg"></div><p>  His first director Savely Uralov did a lot for the formation of the theater.  Fortunately, he still has a worthy successor - Alexander Rosengarten.  Under him, the troupe toured extensively throughout the USSR.  In 1988, Pilgrim was recognized as one of the best in Russia.  Today, their work is worthily continued by Honored Artist of Russia Yanina Dreilich. </p><p>  Starting its history in the distant post-war years, Freedom Square in Togliatti confidently looks to the future.  Today, the local administration carefully looks after her.  After the devastation of the 90s, everything is in order.  Guests of the city should definitely visit here.  Without visiting this place it is difficult to understand the spirit of the city. </p><p>  The sights of the city also include: </p><ul><li>  Park complex of the history of technology named after K. G. Sakharov.  Here you can find samples of the weapons of world wars. </li><li>  Museum of AvtoVAZ Plant.  This, of course, is not Detroit, but it is still of interest. </li><li>  Victory Park. </li><li>  Monument to the founder of Togliatti, an outstanding scientist V.N. Tatishchev. </li><li>  <span>Togliatti Museum of Local Lore.</span> </li><li>  Art Museum. </li><li>  City Museum Complex "Heritage". </li></ul><p>  The big city has something to show. </p>
