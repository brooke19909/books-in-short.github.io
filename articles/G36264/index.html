As a rule, both children and adults adore them.  This fun entertainment, among other things, carries a considerable adrenaline rush.  And if you already have the opportunity to plunge into this sea of ​​pleasures right where you live?  Then the thought comes that truly heavenly life has come.  Well, at least for a short vacation time.  Therefore, Tunisia hotels with a water park or water slides are one of the best accommodation options in this country.  Our article will be devoted to the analysis of such hotel complexes.  Most often, the use of hotel water parks is included in the all inclusive system, which is practiced at such resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia hotels with water park all inclusive" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125714.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What are hotels with a water park and all-inclusive? </h2><p>  However, one should not imagine some grandiose structures with dozens of slides.  All these are signs of real water parks.  And in Tunisia, so called beach hotel complexes with several slides.  But do not be upset, they also bring very positive emotions to guests, especially children.  By the way, in the country there are quite rare hotels “5 stars” with a water park.  The best hotels in Tunisia (all-inclusive and water slides) are mainly “triples” and “fours”.  One of the few "fives" that have on their territory a semblance of a water park is the Holiday Village Manar, not far from Hammamet.  True, in this hotel there is only one waterslide.  But there is good infrastructure, quality services, amazing food, and indeed, the hotel itself belongs to the highest class. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia hotels with all inclusive water park susse" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125716.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sousse </h2><p>  This is not only one of the most “advanced” cities in the country with excellent tourist infrastructure.  It is also a resort where Tunisia's hotels with a water park and all-inclusive are concentrated.  Sousse boasts hotels on the first line from the sea with such services.  The “four” of the “Marhab Royal Salem” have the best reputation.  It has its own beach, many pools, varied food.  The water park in the hotel is small but cheerful, suitable for both adults and children.  A kilometer from the center of Sousse is the "three rubles" "Marabu".  It also has its own beach, landscaped area, all inclusive food and seven slides of various configurations.  The three-star Aqua Residence Hotel boasts not only a mini water park, but also the possibility of accommodating animals, which is still rare in Tunisia.  There are slides in the Coralia Club Hotel, but it should be noted that the rooms do not have a refrigerator or a TV, and instead of an air conditioner there is a ceiling fan.  But the hotel has a large park, beautiful views from the window, a huge selection of dishes in the restaurant, amazing wines, a huge number of various free services, such as: kayaks, surfing, belly dance training and more. </p><h2>  Jerba </h2><p>  An interesting Tunisian hotel with a water park and all-inclusive on this island is the Sunny Club Nereides in Midoun.  Although this hotel has only three stars on a sign, it is built in the Arab-Moorish architectural style, has comfortable spacious rooms, a large green area and four slides.  The hotel has a high rating, good reviews, great staff.  Some vacationers come here for several years in a row.  In addition, the hotel is quite budget for the price and is suitable for people with average incomes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of Tunisia all inclusive 5 stars with a water park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125719.jpg"></div>

This is the tourist center of Hammamet.  True, there are not very many hotels with slides here, and almost all of them are on the second line.  An example is “Nakhravess Hotel &amp; Spa Resort 4 *”.  It is two hundred meters from the sea and has many entertainment programs for children, including water slides.  They do not go to the main, but to the additional pool of the hotel.  In addition, the hotel buildings are surrounded by a beautiful park.  Of these hotels on the first line you can mention the "four" Paradise Palace.  True, there is only one water slide.  But the most popular among tourists is the Samira Club 4 * hotel.  True, it is located five kilometers from the center.  But the “all inclusive” works here until midnight, and besides the slides there are many more sports activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunis Hotels with Water Park or Water Slides" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125720.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Monastir </h2><p>  It is a small resort town in Tunisia.  Hotels with a water park and all-inclusive, however, are also present here.  First of all, this is a three-ruble note from Howda Golf &amp; Beach Club.  The hotel is inexpensive, designed for families with children.  The hotel has great animation, good spa and fitness centers, as well as four pretty slides.  The hotel has four pools and simply huge rooms.  Another popular hotel of this kind is the Dolphin Habib.  It is located on the first line, has its own beach, and water slides adjoin the children's pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Best all inclusive Tunisia hotels with water park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2125724.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The best hotels in Tunisia with an all-inclusive water park </h2><p>  These hotels can be safely attributed to the “four” One Resort.  The water park in the hotel is decent - as many as eight slides.  In addition, they have a different configuration.  There are slides specifically designed for children.  In addition, the hotel has entertainment programs, there are restaurants and bars with themed cuisine, children's animation, a spa and free wifi that catches throughout the territory, including in the rooms.  Still not bad hotel network "Caribbean World."  Their buildings are made in bright colors, this line is famous for excellent service, and in each of these hotels (and in Tunisia there are three: one in Monastir, the other in Ben Arous and also in Djerba) there are several pretty decent slides.  Hotels of this chain are in great demand and must be booked in advance.  We can say that Tunisia's hotels with a water park and all-inclusive are suitable for a fairly budget vacation for young people and families with older children. </p>
