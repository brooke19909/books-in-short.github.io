Optimal route </h2><p>  The complex is located on Timiryazevskaya Street, Building 1. However, for a person who is first in the city, it is not enough just to know where the Botanical Garden is located (Kiev).  How to get to the complex?  The optimal way: 62 by bus or 14 trolley from the metro station "Pechorskaya" to the stop "Botanical Garden". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scientific research </h2><p>  The National Botanical Garden (Kiev) (how to get to the complex, indicated above) is an advanced scientific organization that conducts various studies.  For example, by studying the problems of plant acclimatization, park parking and dendrology, attempts to preserve endangered and rare species, improving the selection and genetics of decorative, forage, fruit and vegetable crops, an in-depth study in the field of biotechnology of tropical and subtropical families and medical botany, and monitoring the chemical interaction of plants.  The National Botanical Garden (Kiev) pays due attention to the design and creation of parks, the study of the main aspects of phytodesign and greening of enterprises, and many other issues related to applied and theoretical botany.  The primary objective of this organization is in-depth research in the field of nature conservation and educational activities on environmental issues.  The National Botanic Garden has specialized computer databases.  A record is kept of all living plants, species that are already listed in the Red Book, and seed collections. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="botanical garden kiev work schedule" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/439851.jpg" width="550"></div>

Genetic selection made it possible to develop new varieties of flower cultures such as dahlias, chrysanthemums, irises, phloxes, asters, gladioli, peonies, clematis, lawn grass and others like them.  Relatively recently created samples fully comply with all the requirements of international standards.  Their participation in various competitions and exhibitions has been marked by numerous awards.  Also, research departments focus on plants that are not traditional crops.  They are engaged in the search, research and introduction of vegetable, feed and aromatic species that are not in this group.  As a result of their activities, it became possible to develop new varieties.  These plants were able to successfully pass numerous tests in various parts of the country. </p><h2>  The uniqueness of the exhibits </h2><p>  Long-term activities related to the introduction of plants have brought worthy results.  The Botanical Garden (Kiev) was able to create several exceptional floristic complexes, such as Crimea, <span>Central Asia,</span> Ukrainian Carpathians, Altai and Western Siberia, Steppes of Ukraine, Forests of the Plain of Ukraine, and many others.  On these objects the vegetation of certain geographical zones is recreated as close as possible.  Relief features and a landscape typical of that area are also preserved.  The arboretum occupies the first place in beauty, striking the imagination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden Kiev Address" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/439852.jpg" width="550"></div>  The collection collections of magnolia and lilac glorified not only the Botanical Garden, but also the city of Kiev itself.  The NBS of Ukraine presents exceptional collections of tropical and subtropical species.  They are located in greenhouse territories, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich exceeds 5 thousand square meters.  Among other things, there is one of the largest collections of reference herbarium and tropical orchids.  The best species of Ukrainian flora are collected there.  The collection includes varieties from Kazakhstan, Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Far East.  It is the groups from the Caucasus that are the most numerous in the whole country.  However, varieties from more distant territories are also available.  Seed collection stores more than 10 thousand samples.

    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an academic botanical garden originated in 1918.  At the same time, the National Academy of Sciences appeared.  Its organizations included the Botanical Garden (Kiev).  It was based on the <span>scientific work of</span> Lipsky Vladimir Ippolitovich.  This is an outstanding personality, traveler, florist and president of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.  It was this scientist who thoroughly took up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe botanical garden, determined its structural elements, chose the direction of development and made a significant contribution to the development of the construction plan.  Initially, it was supposed to take the Goloseevsky forest as the basis of the garden, but this scheme could not be implemented.  In 1928, Vladimir Ippolitovich settled in Odessa and there he became the head of the NBS at Odessa University. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical garden Kiev how to get" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/439854.jpg" width="455"></div>

    <h2>  Guide </h2><p>  In 1944, after the liberation of the territory of Kiev from occupation, a systematic and extensive work was launched to restore and expand the fund.  It should be said that during the war years the building was partially destroyed.  In 1944 he headed the Botanical Garden (Kiev) N. N. Grishko. During his leadership, extensive work was carried out to reconstruct the building and restore the collections.  Grodzinsky Andrey Mikhailovich became the head of the National Botanical Garden (Kiev) since 1965.  Thanks to his efforts, the development of the project reached a new level, and deepened in expanding the <span>foundations of scientific research.</span>  At the end of 1988, the case of Andrei Mikhailovich was continued by his follower Cherevchenko Tatyana Mikhailovna.  She is also his student and doctor of biological sciences.  In 2005, the head of the National Botanical Garden named after Nikolai Grishko came Zaimenko Natalia Vasilievna, who is a doctor of biological sciences, senior researcher and honored inventor of the USSR. </p>
