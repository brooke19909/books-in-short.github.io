If you are new to embroidery, it is best to start with the basics.  The material below contains the main rules of how to learn to embroider a cross. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imaginegnats.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Be careful and patient!" class="if uuid-2505504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77579/2505504.jpg"></div><p>  Let's learn the necessary tools and materials that you need and learn how to make your first seam.  It's fun, it's easy!  Believe me - in the blink of an eye you can embroider almost like a professional. </p><h2>  Accessories selection </h2><p>  For your first project, you need a minimal set of tools: light fabric, the thread needed for the picture, a bundle of needles, an embroidery hoop and scissors.  They will become a real tool in your first handicraft battle.  Learning to cross stitch from scratch step by step is impossible without a minimum set of necessary tools! </p><h2>  Your first stitch </h2><p>  Cross stitch is based on the use of one stitch.  Using the thread, we simply make an ‚ÄúX‚Äù on the fabric and finish the first stitch - just two steps.  If you want to learn how to learn to cross stitch, for beginners, step-by-step instructions will be a real salvation.  Just follow this pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesewingdirectory.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The complete process of creating a line of stitches" class="if uuid-2505508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77579/2505508.jpg"></div><p>  It is very easy to learn this seam, although there are some key tips that you need to know about right away.  For example, it is important to understand how to tighten the thread so that your seams do not loosen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  There are several important things you need to know about the material used in cross-stitch.  Aida is the most common tissue.  It is notable for its structure: this material has many tiny holes in which we insert a needle with a thread.  Aida 14, white or ivory, is the most common choice among beginners.  You can also use a plastic canvas or a blank canvas, although it is recommended that you first get used to Hades, because it is the best option for beginners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boredpanda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery your hands can do" class="if uuid-2505513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77579/2505513.jpg"></div><p>  How to learn to embroider a cross?  Be patient!  And also do not forget the needles! </p><h2>  Needles, needles, needles </h2><p>  In the list of basic supplies, you should have noticed two special tools needed for cross-stitching.  This is an embroidery hoop and needles.  While the hoop is necessary so that your work is flat and neat, and is rather an optional option, without a needle, the process, whatever one may say, will not work! </p><p>  Many beginners do not understand how many needle options are available for cross-stitching.  A tapestry needle is quite suitable for starting.  Buying a whole pack of this tool is extremely important.  Because when you embroider, you choose needles whose eye can accommodate all the threads you need. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="somethingturquoise.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Elementary seam" class="if uuid-2505506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77579/2505506.jpg"></div><p>  If you think that choosing needles will be the easiest part of cross stitching, think again. </p><p>  If you want to learn how to cross stitch from scratch, then for starters it is recommended to use a tapestry needle.  Usually size 24 or 26 (size 26 is smaller than size 24).  This type of needle has a blunt tip and a large eye.  Use size 24 for 14 fabric numbers;  use size 26 for fabrics with stitches greater than 14. </p><h2>  Threads </h2><p>  Floss is the name of embroidery silk, a thread used for cross-stitching.  They are sold in skeins (usually eight meters long) and consist of six different colors.  On the 22nd fabric, only 1 thread is usually used;  on the 11th number, aids use 3 threads for a stitch and 2 for return. </p><h2>  Reading cross stitch patterns </h2><p>  Embroidery patterns are a map of your finished project, and it is very important that you learn how to read it.  Unlike crochet, cross-stitch does not use many words in the instructions.  Instead, you can read the image on the grid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theodysseyonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross stitching is good for health" class="if uuid-2505521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77579/2505521.jpg"></div><p>  The good news is that embroidery patterns are relatively standard, so as soon as you learn how to read a picture, you can read any that you like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Embroidery hoop </h2><p>  A plastic embroidery hoop is useful for holding fabric while you work.  Nevertheless, do not forget to remove the fabric from the hoop when not embroidering - this will help prevent wrinkles at the finished work. </p><h2>  Finishing touches </h2><p>  If you want to know how to quickly learn to embroider a cross, then the secret is to really catch a fire on desire.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you need to make an original present for your mother or if you just dream of decorating the room with aesthetic work - you should really be interested in this! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.storypiece.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beginners should start with simple schemes." class="if uuid-2505530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77579/2505530.jpg"></div><p>  Choose the optimal scheme - first try to avoid complex ones, the number of colors in it should be limited to 10 (otherwise it will be difficult).  After you finish the first work, analyze the main mistakes and try to avoid them in subsequent works. </p><h2>  Tips and photos for beginners, how to learn to cross stitch </h2><p>  Start by looking for the center of the circuit.  In most samples, this is indicated by arrows or a bold line.  Then find the center of your tissue.  An easy way to do this is to fold the fabric in half vertically and "pinch" with your finger to make a small crease.  Expand the fabric, fold it in half horizontally and make another clip.  Expand again.  Two folds will mark the center of the fabric. </p><p>  Try not to tie extra knots, because they will be visible.  To start stitching, pull the threaded needle from the back of the fabric, leaving 2.5 cm of thread around the tail behind the fabric.  Sew 5-6 stitches.  Bring the extra thread back through the last 5 or 6 stitches and fasten the other short one so as not to leave a loose tip. </p><p>  There are two methods.  The first is to work with half the stitch, making only a move up (////), and then go back, making the final move down (\\\\), thereby complementing the cross.  Use this method for most lines.  The second way is to complete each X individually.  This method is recommended for vertical rows. </p><p>  It is important that all crosses intersect in the same direction.  That is, the upper thread X should always be tilted in one direction (either up or down).  It doesn‚Äôt matter in which direction they are tilted, but if they are mixed up, the finished work will look slightly careless.  Here's how to learn cross stitching! </p><div class="photo" data-original="scpbc.blog.palmbeachpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="It is interesting!" class="if uuid-2505527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77579/2505527.jpg"></div><h2>  Few secrets </h2><p>  In complex patterns, a phenomenon is common in which you need to make just a couple of stitches of one color, and then ‚Äújump‚Äù to another area.  In most cases, it is recommended to start new stitches for each new area, however, at times, you can not break the thread, but just immediately go to another part of the pattern with the same color, leaving an extra thread on the back of the fabric.  Agree, "jumping" from region to region is easier than starting and stopping from time to time. </p><p>  The main thing is to monitor the combination of color of the threads: try to break the dark threads, if in order to move to another part of the scheme, they have to be laid on top of the light.  Another thing is when you transfer the thread to another area, the distance to which is small, and at the same time, this area has already been embroidered.  Observe this rule, and you will very quickly not only know in theory how to learn to sew cross stitch beautifully, but also apply your knowledge in practice! </p><p>  Try to relax when embroidering.  Remember that stitches should lie on your fabric freely, without distorting or pulling it together. </p><h2>  When the work is done </h2><p>  The last stitch - and cheers!  The work is ready - you may think.  In theory, yes, the most difficult is already behind, but the fact that you have finished embroidering does not mean that your creation can be put on display or donated.  Do not hurry!  Be sure to rinse the cloth in cool water using a mild liquid detergent. </p><p>  Avoid high spin, try to be delicate, because the seams can easily creep!  It is better to leave the embroidery to dry on a terry towel - it absorbs excess moisture.  Be sure to straighten the work.  While it‚Äôs wet, put another cloth on top of the needlework and go over with a slightly warm iron.  Let it dry.  Then choose a frame or trim the edges as desired.  Done! </p><p>  Now you know how to learn to cross stitch.  As you can see, this is not at all difficult.  The main thing is to be patient.  Remember that embroidery has a beneficial effect on the psyche, soothes, develops fine motor skills and coordination.  And the finished work will delight the soul and eye for a long time.  So, rather, run to the nearest needlework store and get ready to conquer the world of hand-made! </p>
