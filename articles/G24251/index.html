    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel "Atlantic Marmari Beach" is located in Greece, on the island of Kos, in the town of Marmari.

You don‚Äôt have to look for a taxi for a long time - you can take it immediately near the exit from the airport. <br><br>  You can reach Kos in 25 minutes by car, taxi or local bus.  By the way, the bus stop is right next to the hotel, as is the car rental point, which is very convenient.  Excellent Greek roads will allow you to go around the entire island and make your own travel itinerary.  It is enough to take international rights with you. <br><br>  Near this Greek hotel, Atlantic Marmari Beach, there are several shops with very reasonable prices.  Both souvenirs and products are on sale.  Nearby are cafes, restaurants and even a disco.  The disco, however, does not interfere with hotel guests' sleep at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resort of Marmari is quiet and calm, it is ideal for families, especially with children.

    <h2>  Atlantica Marmari Beach Hotel 4 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Making a choice of an object for living on vacation, I want to know what impressions other tourists had.  After analyzing the ratings of the guests, we can distinguish what I liked most and what I would like to improve. </p><p>  The most appreciated was the beach at the hotel - 4.7 out of 5 points. Excellent value.  Tourists especially pay attention to the convenient entrance to the sea and the cleanliness of the beach.  The number of vacationers on the beach is comfortable, sunbeds are always available. </p><p>  The hotel infrastructure has also earned many accolades.  Guests enjoy a sense of security, landscaped grounds and convenient parking.  Room rating is also at a high level.  Tourists like quality cleaning, good air conditioning.  But not everyone liked the quality of furniture and sanitary ware - guests mention the outdated equipment of some rooms. </p><p>  Guests of Atlantica Marmari Beach Hotel 4 * reviews are almost enthusiastic for their high quality service and excellent service.  The staff is polite and competent, many like the unobtrusive and pleasant Russian-speaking guide at the hotel.  But the feedback on the work of the animation team was divided.  Some guests are delighted with the original performances and competitions, however there are those who do not share this opinion. </p><p>  Almost every review contains an extremely positive assessment of the food in the hotel.  Varied, chic, delicious - it's all about the cuisine at Atlantica Marmari Beach.  According to reviews, the restaurant offers meat and seafood dishes, fresh vegetables and fruits every day.  A lot of enthusiasm is caused by local desserts and ice cream. </p><p>  According to most vacationers, the hotel is most suitable for a leisurely family vacation with children.  You can go to this hotel with friends or a couple, but only for a measured rest, since finding nearby places for an active nightlife will be problematic. </p><p>  In general, based on reviews, the Atlantic Marmari Beach Hotel has a stable positive rating of more than 4 points, which has not changed much over the past 2 years.  Given the number of guests and the variety of tastes, this figure can be considered very worthy. </p><p>  If you are planning a relaxing holiday with your family, you will certainly enjoy Atlantica Marmari Beach.  It is so nice to relax on the perfect sandy beach to the measured sound of the sea, to taste the still unfamiliar, but incredibly delicious Greek dishes.  And to see how both adults and children jump in the waves of fun and carelessly, succumbing to the feeling of happiness and enthusiasm that there is no need to rush anywhere, that you can simply enjoy the days in beautiful Greece.  But this is what I want on vacation. </p>
