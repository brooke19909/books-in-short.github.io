  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wireless Subwoofers: Model Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The subwoofer is an <span>acoustic system</span> with the ability to reproduce low sound frequencies within 20-300 Hz.  This equipment is used at home to connect to home theaters and soundbars.  This allows you to enjoy clear and high-quality sound while watching movies, listening to music, etc. </p><p>  Initially, subwoofers were connected using a cable, but more modern models use a wireless connection. </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  If you decide to purchase a subwoofer, you should familiarize yourself with the types that you can purchase.  He is active and passive.  Active subwoofer types are usually equipped with a crossover and built-in amplifier.  Therefore, the synchronization of this equipment with other acoustic devices in the house occurs with minimal time.  Sound from active devices is significantly better in sound quality than passive devices. </p><p>  The passive home subwoofer has a serial connection to the main speakers and usually does not contain powerful amplifiers.  The main disadvantage of such equipment is the difficulty in choosing a place for its placement. </p><h2>  Type of connection and design </h2><p>  According to the type of connection, the subwoofers are divided into cable-connected and wireless. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sony.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wireless sound" class="if uuid-2504927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2504927.jpg"></div><p>  Most often, wireless subwoofers are connected via Bluetooth.  Note that for some models, such a connection is not used to broadcast sound, but to control the device settings remotely.  Moreover, such models have a wired connection.  If we take the transmission of audio signals, then it must be borne in mind that the audio quality when connecting to Bluetooth will turn out to be slightly lower than by wire.  But the absence of cables underfoot and the ability to freely move the subwoofer relative to the main signal source in most cases compensate for this drawback. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When choosing a <span>subwoofer for your home,</span> pay attention to its design.  Equipment of a similar plan is conventionally divided into phase inverter and closed types: </p><ol><li>  Enclosed subwoofers have a fully enclosed enclosure, speaker and built-in amplifier.  Such an active wireless subwoofer produces an even frequency response; it is used in music systems. </li><li>  The phase inverter subwoofers are characterized by a bright acoustic design, they reproduce more frequencies than devices in a closed case. </li></ol><h2>  Yamaha SRT-1500 </h2><p>  Soundbar with a wireless TV subwoofer that provides true 5.1 surround sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trinasty.sk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yamaha Leadership" class="if uuid-2498751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2498751.jpg"></div><p>  The elegant case of this model holds 12 speakers: </p><ul><li>  8 speakers "sound beam"; </li><li>  for playback of stereo recordings and pure transmission of dialogs - two oval low-frequency emitters; </li><li>  Two subwoofers for rich and deep bass. </li></ul><p>  Surround realistic sound is achieved thanks to the body made of MDF, and this ensures high sound quality.
