  <section class="page js-page"><h1>North Africa</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most of the entire territory of North Africa - about 8.6 million kilometers - is covered by the Sahara desert.  As you know - this is the largest arid place on Earth.  The desert territory itself is almost uninhabited.  An exception are only a few tribes of the Berbers and Tuaregs, who inhabit the same few oases. </p><p>  Historical evidence indicates that the Sahara in ancient times was quite fertile land, with forests, a variety of animals and plants.  Today, only <span>territories adjacent</span> to lakes, rivers, as well as a small narrow strip along the coast (in some places) are suitable for living. </p><p>  Despite the high daytime temperatures, desert nights are very cold.  The temperature can drop even to zero degrees. </p><p>  Precipitation in the Sahara may not be for many years.  However, torrential rains sometimes occur. </p><p>  In southern Sahara, the desert is replaced by an arid strip - the coast ("Sahel" - in Arabic, the coast) - the border of sand.  Within this territory, dry savannas and semi-deserts are located nearby.  In the Sahel region, life is almost unbearable.  Severe conditions are associated with constant drought here, which undermines the development of agriculture.  Towards <span>Central Africa,</span> from the ‚ÄúSahel‚Äù, there are subequatorial savannas in vast territories.  These places are characterized by rich vegetation, rare shrubs and trees. </p><p>  North Africa.  Characterization of States </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The countries of this part of the continent are more developed (from an economic point of view) than in other territories.  This is largely due to the immediate proximity of European countries that have a powerful economy. </p><p>  Almost all countries that includes North Africa are developing countries.  The exceptions are Mauritania and Sudan.  They are among the least developed states in the world. </p><p>  North Africa is rich in deposits of <span>natural gas</span> and oil.  They are located in the territories of Libya and Algeria.  The economy of Tunisia is considered the most competitive and diversified throughout the continent.  Rich in North Africa and phosphate deposits.  In deposits located in the territory of Morocco, active production is underway.  Phosphorites are used in the manufacture of fertilizers.  Many foreign companies are involved in the development of industry in this part of the continent.  Gradually, North Africa becomes a tourist area. </p><p>  To the north of <span>the Sahara desert,</span> residents preach Islam and speak Arabic.  The peoples of North Africa are diverse.  A huge number of tribes live south of the desert.  They speak different languages, practice different faiths, and have different traditions.  In some countries of North Africa, one of the European languages ‚Äã‚Äãis used as the official language.  This, in some cases, creates certain inconveniences in communication between nationalities within the continent.  For example, in some states, the official language is French. </p><p>  This diversity of peoples of North Africa often provokes <span>ethnic conflicts.</span>  The feuds lead to a significant decline in living standards and the economy. </p><p>  For tourists, lovers of the Moorish-Berber atmosphere, North Africa is an ideal place.  The territory includes Mediterranean beaches, wide, with <span>white sand.</span>  The most famous tourist countries are Tunisia and Egypt.  In North Africa, there are a lot of historical monuments (ancient Egyptian, Roman, Phoenician). </p><p>  North African dishes include, among other things, without fail two components - aromatic seasonings and hot pepper. </p>
