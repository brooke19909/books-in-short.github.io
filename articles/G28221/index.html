    <p>  Syanovsky caves arose around the 17th century, were most actively used in the 19th and 20th centuries, after which they were closed.  The entrance to them was bombarded and closed for access until enthusiasts excavated it.  Not so long ago, the main vertical entrance and some horizontal tunnels were strengthened in the caves.  The main manholes and passages are located at a depth of 25 meters.  The total length of the tunnels is about 19 km. </p><p>  When planning a descent to Syanovsky caves, it should be taken into account that the air temperature inside does not exceed 7-10 degrees with a relative humidity of about 80%.  Indices of radiation background inside do not exceed the norm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Throughout the year, many people visit Syanovsky caves, tours of which can be an interesting and exciting way to spend a day off.

It is better to choose clothes from technological materials.  For each member of the expedition you must take a card.  Also a prerequisite is the presence of two flashlights for each person.  When traveling underground you should not disperse, it is better to stick together and explore the caves in good company. </p>
