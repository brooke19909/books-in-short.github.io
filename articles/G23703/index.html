However, half a century ago it was here that another sight was opened and landscaped, which is now proud of all of Abkhazia.  New Athos cave has become as popular among tourists and world famous as <span>Lake Ritsa</span> or the above-mentioned monastery in New Athos. </p><h2>  The legend of the "bottomless pit" </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia New Athos cave" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1048132.jpg"></div>  Locals while walking around the surroundings of their native city for a long time noticed a large well on one of the slopes of the <span>Iverskaya Mountain.</span>  The failure of the people began to be called the "bottomless pit", and the most incredible legends began to compose its origin.  This place literally attracted the inhabitants of New Athos.  And not only mysticism was sought by people who were keen on the ‚ÄúEndless Pit‚Äù.  At that time, small caves had already been discovered, the natural entrances to which looked similar.  But this well seemed too dark and bottomless.  Nevertheless, the idea to solve the riddle of failure did not haunt the local resident Givi Smyr.  In 1961, he assembled an expedition, which included Arsen Okrodzhanashvili, Zurab Tintilozov and Boris Gergedava.  The speleological detachment began to descend, and underground, its participants saw something amazing.  Since time immemorial, Abkhazia has been famous for various miracles.  New Athos cave - one of them, it amazes with its size and variety of beauties.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Athos cave Abkhazia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1048130.jpg"></div>  During the first study of the "bottomless pit" was able to establish only that the cave is incredible.  Many cavers explored the system of underground halls and galleries in subsequent years.  A map was gradually compiled, and in 1965 the first documentary was shot.  Footage recorded on film showing underground beauty did not go unnoticed.  And it was decided that the <span>New Athos cave</span> (Abkhazia) should become a full-fledged tourist attraction.  The problem was that the natural entrance was a well overlooking the ceiling of one of the halls.  It was decided to make a new artificial entrance.  In 1975, all work was completed, and the first tourists were able to descend underground using a special train.

    <p>  The underground railway was opened on July 4, 1975.  The total length of the line is 1291 meters, it includes three passenger stations.  For tourists, the journey starts from the Entrance Gate platform, an examination of the underground beauties begins from the Abkhazia Hall site, and ends at the Anakopia Hall.  The railway is a narrow single track.  As a transport, a unique passenger electric train "Tourist" is used, consisting of a head, a motor and four trailed wagons.  This underground metro is proud of Abkhazia.  New Athos cave has become a public attraction precisely thanks to the organization of a comfortable descent for tourists.  The underground railway and the passenger train itself were made according to unique projects.  Not so long ago, the train was reconstructed, and today tourists can enjoy maximum comfort during the descent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New Athos cave in Abkhazia: photos and halls today </h2>
