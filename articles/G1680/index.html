    <p>  Many incorrectly pronounce the name of this settlement, giving out the second letter "e" for "e" and stressing it.  The emphasis should fall on the first e.  In historical documents you can find other names for this settlement - Karadzha and Kara-Adzhi. </p><p>  Olenevka is the nearest settlement from the western point of Crimea - Cape Tarkhankut.  The village is supplied with electricity, water, internet and mobile connection.  It has a bus station, a market, several restaurants, cafes and shops.  The central street is Lenin Street. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort Specialization </h2><p>  The village of Olenevka (Crimea), reviews of which became the basis of this article, is a very picturesque and calm place.  This is a true <span>steppe Crimea</span> with unique air and natural gifts.  On three sides, the village is surrounded by warm Black Sea waters. </p><p>  More recently, Olenevka was a small village, but today it has evolved to the status of a real resort and continues to win more and more tourist hearts every year.  The fact is that divers, kite and windsurfers like to meet on the local coast.  All pensions are oriented specifically for these sports.  Here you can easily find rental wetsuits, scuba gear, masks and fins, as well as refueling cylinders.  There are special diving centers in Olenevka (Pelican, Bottlenose Dolphin), which not only rent equipment, but also teach the beginners of diving.  And experienced divers are transported here for immersion in the most picturesque places of the district. </p>

    <h2>  Rest and treatment </h2><p>  There are no enterprises and large settlements on <span>Cape Tarkhankut</span> , therefore nothing merges into the sea.  Thus, if you are looking for one of the most environmentally friendly areas of the peninsula, then Olenevka (Crimea) is suitable for you.  Reviews confirm that nature is really notable here.  Therefore, every year more and more tourists come here, not only to dive and go surfing, but also for the purpose of healing and a relaxing family vacation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thanks to the sea breezes - soft winds that change direction twice a day (at night they blow from land to sea, and during the day - from sea to land), Olenevka air is a natural inhaler.  It is saturated with ozone, calcium, sodium chloride, potassium, magnesium, fluorine, bromine and iodine.  A variety of odorous herbs growing in the local steppe give the wind an even more sophisticated aroma.  All this has a very positive effect on the health of tourists. </p><p>  In July-August, sea water at local beaches has a temperature of about 24-26 ¬∞ C.  Near the village there is a salt lake of the Sary-Gol estuary.  Its medicinal brine and mud contains active ingredients that have a preventive effect on the body.  Due to the special climatic conditions of the cape, the summer season here begins in mid-May and ends in October.  Here it is Olenevka (Crimea).  Reviews show that this place is very fond of people who promote a healthy lifestyle, as well as who prefer family vacations. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Olenevka (Crimea), reviews of which arouse the desire to come here, is located far from large settlements.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs good, on the other hand, it‚Äôs problematic.  The nearest railway stations are in Evpatoria and Simferopol.  It is more convenient to get from Evpatoria - from the bus station (located 100 meters from the railway station) there is a direct bus to Olenevka.  The bus travels for about two hours.  Driving from Simferopol is more problematic, as there are no direct flights to Olenevka.  Have to make a transfer to the village of Black Sea.  This way will take about 4 hours. </p>
