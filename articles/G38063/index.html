  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to clean the phone from viruses and protect it from re-infection?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since the advent of the first mobile phones, more than a dozen years have passed.  During this time, this technique has changed so much that it has become almost as versatile as computers.  Therefore, no one is surprised at the question of how to <span>clean the phone</span> from viruses. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean your phone from viruses" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1162320.jpg" width="375"></div></h2><h2>  What do those who run malicious programs achieve? </h2><p>  With the advent of a large number of free programs that can be downloaded to a mobile phone, hackers began to develop viruses that could "infect" the phone.  Introduced malware can interfere with the smartphone, performing various operations on it, including financial ones.  If the phone "caught" the virus, then using it you can easily write off funds from a bank account tied to one of the Internet accounts. </p><p>  Malicious programs that hit your mobile device do not manifest themselves.  Attackers control them through remote commands. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove a virus from your phone" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1162323.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How to check your phone for viruses through a computer? </h2><p>  To ‚Äúcatch‚Äù malware, just download a file containing dangerous scripts to your mobile phone.  In addition, people who actively use e-mail often catch viruses.  In this case, the pest enters the device immediately after the user opens the message marked as spam by the system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before you remove the virus from your phone, <strong> </strong>  you need to make sure that he really is there.  This can be done using a desktop computer or laptop.  Connection is made through a special cable that synchronizes the operation of two systems.  The verification process will be displayed in the ‚ÄúMy Computer‚Äù tab.  Before you clean your phone from viruses, you must scan the memory card.  You can do this by clicking on the corresponding icon.  The verification process takes only a few minutes.  After this time, a list of files that caused the problem appears on the monitor. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check your phone for viruses through a computer" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1162340.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How to remove a virus from your phone? </h2><p>  To get rid of malware detected as a result of anti-virus scanning, you need to click on the ‚Äúdisinfect all‚Äù button that appears next to the list of ‚Äúinfected‚Äù files.  In addition, it will be useful for anyone who is interested in how to clean the phone from viruses to learn about the existence of another way to remove malware.  But after the user performs a factory reset, all information stored on it will disappear from the mobile phone.  Immediately after this, you need to install an antivirus program and carry out diagnostics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sometimes the virus remains on removable media.  Therefore, before cleaning the phone from viruses, it is recommended to scan the memory card separately from it for greater reliability.  This can be done on a desktop computer using a proven antivirus program. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone caught a virus" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40827/1162343.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  How to install an antivirus program on a mobile phone? </h2><p>  Most modern devices are sold with protection already installed.  But for those on whose phones there is not even a simple program, it is recommended to install it yourself.  To do this, go to the appropriate site and download the appropriate antivirus.  Such programs are fully adapted for mobile devices.  They not only protect the phone from all kinds of hacker attacks, but also detect and destroy viruses in a timely manner.  In addition, some programs can block calls from paid numbers and suspicious SMS.  By installing such an antivirus program, the user will not even accidentally connect to dangerous servers and will not answer an ‚Äúinfected‚Äù call. </p><h2>  How to prevent viruses from infecting your phone? </h2><p>  In order to avoid unauthorized malware getting into your mobile phone, you need to follow a few simple rules.  First of all, you need to deactivate the ability to download programs from any unverified sites.  The next step should be to install a good antivirus program.  In addition, do not neglect to regularly update existing software.  Those who do not want a virus to get into their phone are advised to refrain from reading the received SMS and MMS mailings.  Often, "infection" occurs through e-mail. </p><p>  It is not recommended to use the ‚Äúdeveloper mode‚Äù and download programs to your device from unverified sources.  All software should be installed exclusively from official sites.  In the process of installing it, you need to carefully monitor what information is requested by the program.  If possible, it is recommended to activate the encryption and protection of personal data.  Sometimes infection can occur as a result of connecting the phone to a computer that has caught a virus.  Therefore, experts recommend connecting smartphones only to trusted PCs.  Also, special care should be taken when using unprotected WI-FI.  Using the free Internet distributed in public places, it is advisable to refrain from conducting any financial transactions. </p>
