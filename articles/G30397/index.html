  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is the inventory of fixed assets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Based on a written order from the management, a commission is formed to <span>conduct an inventory of the</span> fixed assets of the enterprise.  All members of the commission must be familiarized with the order and the date when the <strong>inventory of fixed assets</strong> begins. </p><p>  Distinguish between planned and unscheduled, selective, full or continuous inventory.  Always carry out an inventory when changing the materially responsible person. </p><p>  Prior to its implementation, it is necessary to check the availability and records in all inventory cards (form No. OS-6), registers, check the <span>technical documentation</span> for equipment, documents for rent and storage of fixed assets.  In the absence of documentation, it must be restored or executed. </p><p>  All data of the inspection of own fixed assets are recorded in the inventory (form No. INV. 1), which reflects the name of the item, its inventory number, location, basic technical information and indicators.  <span>The inventory inventory</span> is compiled in duplicate and signed by the members of the commission and the materially responsible person.  One copy is transferred to the accounting department, and the second remains with the materially responsible person.  For fixed assets that are leased or stored, they have a separate inventory inventory. </p><p>  In the case when the <strong>inventory of fixed assets</strong> revealed that the <strong>fixed</strong> asset has undergone reconstruction, modernization and its purpose has changed, then its name should be indicated in the inventory list in accordance with the new purpose. </p><p>  If during the inventory process they find fixed assets that were not previously accepted for accounting or with incorrect technical data, then appropriate adjustments are made.  In the absence of a mobile device at its location (bus, tractor, plane or ship), a mark is made, an accounting statement indicating the reason for the absence is attached, and an inventory is compiled upon his return from the flight. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When identifying unsuitable fixed assets, a separate defective statement is drawn up, the date of entry and the reason for the unsuitability are indicated.  The document is signed by the commission, and, if necessary, the item is sent for examination to the relevant organizations to identify the causes of the malfunction and conclude that it is suitable for further operation. </p><p>  If the <strong>inventory of fixed assets has</strong> revealed discrepancies between the actual data, according to the inventory and accounting data, then a comparison sheet is compiled (form ¬ªINV. 18). </p><p>  The accountant, upon completion of all the necessary documentation, must make in the accounting program, after the <strong>inventory of fixed assets is completed</strong> , corresponding to a particular situation.  In case of shortage and damage to fixed assets, accrued depreciation is written off by posting D-02 K-01, K-01 D-94.  If compensation is made, then K-94, D-73, then the accountant writes off at market value, and the difference between the market and residual value is written off to deferred income D-94 K -98.  And as debt is paid off, D -98 K-99 is written off for profit or loss.  If the culprits have not been identified, then the shortfall is attributed to production costs, be sure by written decision of the head of D-91 K-94, then D-99 K-91- for financial results.  If the <strong>inventory of fixed assets</strong> revealed surpluses, they must be capitalized at market value for other income D-01 K-91. </p><p>  The results of the inventory should be taken into account and reflected in the month in which the inventory is completed.  The results of the annual inventory are reflected in the annual report. </p><p>  <strong>Inventory of fixed assets should be carried out</strong> at specified deadlines, with the preparation of all necessary documents, always on the basis of the order of the head of the appointed commission. </p>
