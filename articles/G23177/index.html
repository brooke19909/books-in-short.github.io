At the head of all living things was Pharaoh - the deified powerful ruler.  The ancient Egyptians obeyed him implicitly.  Pharaoh wore a double crown (red and white), symbolizing the sign of his power over the Upper and Lower <span>Kingdoms of Ancient</span> Egypt.  It was the power given to the ruler that was able to hold a diverse tribe, who worshiped their gods, were far apart and generally had their own customs!  So, my friends, today we will plunge into Ancient Egypt for a short while and find out what it is like - the life of the ancient Egyptians! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient egyptians" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/284976.jpg"></div>

    <p>  <strong>First wonder of the world</strong> </p><p>  Ancient Egypt, of course, is associated in the minds of each of us with the pyramids ... The unlimited grandeur of the power of the pharaoh has left its legacy in <span>Egyptian culture.</span>  The ancient Egyptians themselves erected eternal tombs for their rulers.  The very first pyramid for Pharaoh Joser was erected by a professional architect of the time - Priest Imhotep.  He was a healer, and a sage, and the supreme adviser to the ruler himself.  The first pyramid was 60 meters high!  Can you imagine how high it was for that time?  In general, the largest tombs of Egypt were erected in the deserts at a time when the fourth dynasty of the <span>pharaohs</span> was in power <span>(Cheops,</span> Chefren, Mikerin). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, the construction of the pyramids for the pharaohs was then the only external manifestation of the power of the Egyptian rulers, which allowed to unite the forces of the ancient Egyptians, directing them in any desired direction. </p>

    <p>  And yet, the absolute power of the Pharaoh did not save Egypt from collapse and internecine wars.  Soon, the country simply broke up into separate areas that were at war with each other.  Over two hundred years, <span>civil wars</span> and unrest continued.  The ancient Egyptians themselves called this period the Great Decay, and later historians will call it the First Decay of Egypt.  It is interesting that during this period the pharaohs succeeded each other almost every day!  For example, 70 rulers of the sixth dynasty were in power for only 70 days! </p><p>  <strong>Middle Kingdom</strong>  <strong>The history of the ancient Egyptians</strong> </p><p>  This happened during the reign of Mentuhotepe the First of the eleventh dynasty of the Pharaohs.  Egypt under his rule again became one country.  This period was nicknamed the Middle Kingdom. </p><p>  We can say that <span>this era</span> is a kind of technical progress.  The ancient Egyptians began to make weapons and tools from bronze - an alloy of copper and tin.  After all, bronze was much stronger than copper, and therefore the weapons from it were stronger - labor productivity increased.  Professionally armed troops began to appear, which conquered more and more new lands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life of the ancient egyptians" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/284977.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  The power of the country grew stronger, the power of the pharaoh became more and more influential!  During this period, a hieroglyphic letter appears, with the help of which many different stories, tales, teachings and scientific texts were written, which in the slightest degree, but reported on certain achievements in medicine, science and construction. </p><p>  After some time, new feuds again weaken the unity of this mighty power, and the so-called Second collapse of Egypt will happen.  But this, friends, is another story. </p>
