    <p>  Reviews of the Olympic Lagoon Resort Paphos 5 * hotel, which are left by guests, contain a lot of kind and laudatory words about local cuisine.  A variety of dishes, always fresh and tasty products cannot but win the hearts of people who are vacationing here.  Ice cream and nicely decorated desserts, which children really like, are especially noted. </p><h2>  What can hotel guests do </h2><p>  Everyone who came to rest at the Olympic Lagoon Resort Paphos All Inclusive hotel will definitely not be bored.  After all, there is a mass of various sports and entertainment events that can cheer and cheer up even the most gloomy tourist. </p><p>  A variety of pools, including indoor, will allow all those who do not want to go to the sea to swim freely.  Guests who prefer sports games can use the basketball court, tennis court, play indoor soccer or volleyball, and even shoot archery. </p><p>  Throughout the day, an amazing team of hotel animators in every way entertains all guests, and you can take a break at a disco or watch a bright show every evening at the X-Perience Arena entertainment center. </p><p>  Hotel guests in their reviews note that the animation in the hotel is carried out mainly in English.  This is often inconvenient for young children who do not know a foreign language and do not understand much.  But the rest of the hotel's activities are worthy of the highest rating. </p>
