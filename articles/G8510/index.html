    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Apparently, this inexpensive hotel appealed to many Russians.  Quiet and calm, it is great for a relaxing break.  Good location, clean and fairly spacious rooms, giant beds with clean, pleasantly smelling linen, quality cleaning - all this was appreciated by our compatriots.  The small pool was an excellent alternative to the sea, especially since there were never a lot of people around it.  Among the minuses of this hotel, some note the scarcity of food and noise in the rooms on the ground floor, coming from the street.  In general, Pleasure Beach Resort is a place where many Russians are going to return at the earliest opportunity. </p>
