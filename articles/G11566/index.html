However, year after year, little by little, these venerable media tycoons in the tourism business are more calm and not artsy, and most importantly, cheaper Tunisia.  Hotel Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * is considered one of the best here.  It is located near the village of Mahdia - the world-famous center of silk masters.  The region where this city is spread has its history from the time of the Phoenicians, that is, for almost three thousand years!  In the tenth century, Mahdia became the capital of the caliphate, and it got its name from the word "Mahdi", that is, the Messiah, the Savior.  This town was liked not only by pious citizens, but also by those who were completely not friends with the laws, namely fanned romance and sea pirates involved in bloody stories.  In Mahdia, there was their main outpost, from which we have remained architecturally interesting ruins.  Here is a unique place to spend their holidays for those who choose among other hotels Caribbean World Mahdia 4 *.  Mahdia (the name is pronounced Mahdia in Russian) in our time is a modern medium-sized city with exotic Arabic charm.  It is interesting to conduct excursions, shop and just walk.  But most of the time, of course, tourists will be in the hotel.  Therefore, for them the most important thing is what kind of service is here, what domestic and other conditions.  Numerous reviews of people who visited this hotel indicate that its employees make a lot of efforts, making the rest of all guests bright, carefree and memorable.  We offer you the most detailed, and most importantly, reliable information so that everyone can make their own opinion about this African resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caribbean World Mahdia 4 Mahdia" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1431726.jpg" width="523"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location, how to get there </h2><p>  Everyone knows that the small state of Tunisia, desperate to become rich and economically independent, is located in northern Africa, between Libya and Algeria.  About half the length of its borders is washed by the Mediterranean Sea, on the coast of which the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * is located.  Mahdia (Mahdia) is located, one might say, in the center of the country's coastline, somewhat south of Monastir and the island of Djerba.  Further south along the coast there are several more settlements, but Mahdia is the only large resort among them.  The hotel in question is located in the suburbs, about 7 km north of the borders of the city and is connected with it by a good highway.  All significant resorts of the country lie to the north.  There is only one south of Mahdia on the coast, and even that is a very small town of Chebba (or Shebba).  It is of some interest as a historical monument, since it was erected in the VI century, but so far the resort service is not developed here.  And the closest settlement is the town of Macknin, located on the shore of a large salt lake.  It is only about 20 km from the hotel.  You can go to McNean for jewelry and pottery. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Tunisia has several major international airports where Russian travel agencies sell tickets.  If you are going to relax in the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 *, the best option would be a flight to the airport of Monastir, since from there to this hotel a little more than 40 km.  The agency where the tickets were purchased provides comfortable transfers to the organized tourists with tinted windows and air conditioning, while the guide entertains the visitors with interesting stories about the country.  If you go straight from your airport to your hotel, the journey takes less than half an hour.  The same amount of time is spent traveling by taxi.  But since it has already been established that the transfer carries tourists to all hotels located on the course, the path can stretch for 2, or even 3 hours.  If the agency offers you an air flight to <span>Enfida Airport,</span> you will have to travel 100 km to the hotel and spend about an hour on it, if you do not deviate from the route on the way.  The most inconvenient option is to fly to Carthage (Carthage) Airport, from which it is almost 220 km to the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 *.  Therefore, when buying a tour to this hotel, be sure to pay attention to where you are offered a flight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  Do not think that if you go to Africa, then you are waiting for only boring monotonous landscapes, endless sands and terrible heat.  The Mediterranean coast of Tunisia seems more like a fertile oasis than a sweltering desert.  Tourists, who first arrived here, have the impression that they got into the Garden of Eden, the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * hotel has such a beautiful and green area.  Mahdia, located a few minutes away from it by car, impresses with European roads without the usual pits and potholes, snow-white buildings and an abundance of palm trees.  You will see enough of all this on the way from the airport.  Leaving the bus and entering the hotel territory, you will be delighted with the abundance of fresh greenery, the variety of not only all kinds of palm trees, but also other vegetation, fragrant, flowering, eye-catching unexpected compositions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caribbean world mahdia 4" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1431716.jpg" width="519"></div>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is quite impressive, as much as 180 acres, and a caring hand is felt everywhere, since it is difficult to find a neglected lawn or an unclean corner here.  But not only the beautiful nature impresses with the territory of the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 *.  The photo shows how many there are bizarre shapes of ponds and recreation places under reed umbrellas.  After admiring such a wonderful design, you go into the central building, the facade of which is also decorated with reeds, and you find yourself in a very spacious and bright lobby, where the reception is located.  This part of the hotel is done in cheerful colors, which creates a pleasant impression and a positive mood.  The highlight is a beautiful fountain.  A small minus - the reception staff practically do not speak Russian, and they also have difficulties with English.  The fact is that in Tunisia, which has long been under French rule, they speak Arabic and French.  Our tourists who do not speak these languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave to decide their questions in the international sign language.  At the reception you can exchange currency, take things in the laundry, invite doctors, book excursions, deposit valuables, leave your luggage for a while.  In the lobby you can use Wi-Fi for free, shop in the shops located here (souvenir, with clothes, with beach accessories and spices), admire pictures generously hanging on the walls, and fish in aquariums.  Near the reception there is a bar and a cinema hall, where there are conditions for watching football and other interesting programs.

One of them is the main one.  In it on the ground floor there is not only the reception, but also some infrastructure of the hotel, on the second there is a restaurant and residential rooms, on the third there are only rooms.  All buildings are similar in external design, but have a different color of the walls, which adds a special charm to the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caribbean World Mahdia 4 Tunisia reviews" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1431719.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <p>  The category of all rooms is one - ‚Äústandard‚Äù, but they are for accommodation of 1, 2 and 4 people.  The views from the windows are different, depending on the location of the case.  Basically it is a hotel garden, a swimming pool, a road, but there are rooms from whose windows you can admire the sea.  The decor in the rooms is very simple, the design is fully consistent with the principles of minimalism.  Please note that the Caribbean World Mahdia Hotel 4 * received its first guests in 2008, and so far no repairs have been made here, so some interior items may not be entirely new.  Equipment - the minimum amount of furniture (beds, bedside tables, wardrobe, table), a paid safe (in the closet), a modern TV with a couple of channels in Russian, a very compact refrigerator, the use of which is also chargeable, air conditioning (only works in summer and in the first half September), hair dryer, telephone.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Almost all tourists (with very few exceptions) take all-inclusive tours in the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 *.  Reviews about the catering here are quite favorable.  The hotel can offer guests access to 5 excellent restaurants.  In the main are the main meals.  It works from 7 a.m. when breakfast begins, and until 11 p.m.  Four other restaurants are specialized.  They prepare Italian, Indian, Chinese and Mexican cuisines.  You can visit any of them every day for money and once every 7 days for free by appointment. </p><p>  The layout of the main restaurant is such that there is an indoor hall for a large number of seats (the hotel can accommodate more than 1000 guests at the same time) and a compact terrace with breathtaking views, but not everyone has enough seats. </p><p>  The type of food practiced in the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * (Mahdia) is difficult to unambiguously define as a "buffet", because side dishes, salads, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvegetables, sausages and cheeses, sauces (there are about a dozen), some fish dishes, bread and the pastries here are really placed on the tables, and the guests take these products for themselves, as much as anyone needs.  But the meat, pancakes, omelets, scrambled eggs, even watermelon are laid out on plates in portions.  In addition to the first and second courses, the restaurant always offers: sweets, raisins, dates, nuts, pastries, honey, halva, jam.  From drinks you can order free water, soda, Coca-Cola, sprite, beer, wine, tea bags, coffee powder.  Guests are allowed to take bottled water to their rooms. </p><p>  There are also many bars in the hotel - 5 pieces.  They are located in the lobby, near the pool, on the beach, in the territory.  For a bite to eat, guests are invited to the Moorish cafe, which also has many drinks and delicious snacks. </p><h2>  Hotel for children </h2><p>  The youngest tourists pay great attention to the staff of the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * (Tunisia).  Reviews of the service for children are, in principle, good.  On the territory, kids can frolic in the children's pool, the depth of which begins with 35 cm, as well as on a well-planned playground under palm trees.  In addition, children always visit the mini-club with pleasure, where cheerful and kind educators organize games and all kinds of fascinating events.  In the evenings and all day, animators work with children, arrange games, contests and a disco for them.  From the point of view of life, being in the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * with children is also very convenient.  In the rooms, upon the request of the parents, they are provided with wooden cots, although the restaurant does not have a children's menu, there are many dishes suitable for eating kids.  Among them are milk, cottage cheese, cereal, milk porridge, boiled vegetables and chicken without spices.  Payment for children who are not yet 2 years old is not made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caribbean World Mahdia 4 Mahdia Hotel" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1431721.jpg" width="526"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel for outdoor enthusiasts </h2><p>  In the brochures you can see that the name of the hotel in question is served as Caribbean World Mahdia Aquapark 4 *.  This is because there is even a small, but its own water park.  It is a site in the territory where a pool with 5 slides is equipped, two of which are screw.  Reviews about them are not entirely favorable.  Cons consider tourists a short time, only 4 hours a day, insufficient comfort during the descent, a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water park pool and the crowded location of the slides themselves.  But, despite these shortcomings, the water park is always popular with both adults and teenagers, and small hotel guests are not allowed to go down the hills. </p><p>  But you can spend an active day in the Caribbean World Mahdia Aqua 4 * not only in a mini-water park.  The hotel has a golf course, tennis courts, a place for archery, squash, soccer, volleyball, darts, a very large outdoor pool with a depth of 1.75 meters, an indoor pool, a sauna. </p><p>  In the evenings, a disco is held every day at the hotel and some dances are taught.  And always looking for vacationers helps experienced hairdressers who provide their services in a beauty salon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caribbean World Mahdia Aquapark 4" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1431724.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Absolutely all guests of the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * are satisfied with a beach vacation.  Tunisia, Mahdia in particular, is famous for its rather long and clean beaches with soft as flour, white sand, turquoise sea, a shallow depth off the coast, convenient entry into the water.  It is this beach that is owned by the hotel.  It is intended only for guests, but sometimes outsiders still get here.  Basically, these are local traders of all rubbish and summer clothes.  They can impose their goods on holidaymakers only until security sees it and, upon their first request, leave the beach. </p><p>  The rest of the tourists here goes without any problems.  Sunbeds, umbrellas and mattresses for them are available in sufficient quantities.  We draw your attention - sometimes these items of beach interior help to convey to the desired place a special employee who may not be satisfied with one "thank you". </p><p>  The sea in the vicinity of the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * (Tunisia, Mahdia) is almost always calm, jellyfish are rare, there are few animals in the water, only small fish.  That is why diving enthusiasts are not particularly interested here. </p><p>  For entertainment on the beach, animators arrange games of football, volleyball, conduct marine exercises.  Tourists also have the opportunity to rent a canoe, go windsurfing, and ride a camel. </p><p>  The advantage of the beach is the presence of lifeguards on it.  In addition, buoys have been installed in the sea, protecting the area where the safe depth ends. </p><p>  Some tourists traveling to Tunisia for the first time, and, in particular, to the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 *, are interested in what month it is most comfortable to relax there.  Regarding the coastal section where Mahdia is located, it can be said that there is wonderful weather all year round with plenty of sun and heat.  However, hotel guests can swim in the sea only from the end of May, since before this period the water temperature even near the coast does not exceed +14.  This despite the fact that Mahdia is considered the southernmost resort.  In September and even in October it is here that the sea can please with a water temperature of up to + 25-22 degrees.  The air in this corner of the country in winter can be quite warm (up to +16, if the wind blows from the desert) and somewhat cool (only up to +6, if the wind is from the sea).  Knowing these features of the Tunisian climate, everyone can decide for himself when to go to Mahdia on vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunis Hotel Caribbean World Mahdia 4" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1431720.jpg" width="531"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment outside the hotel </h2><p>  No matter how interesting it was in the Caribbean World Mahdia 4 *, Mahdia is such a city that you should definitely visit.  It has such a rich history that familiarization with the sights it has left will be interesting to everyone.  You can see here ancient fortresses, towers, a mosque, erected at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries.  Having been in Mahdia, it is unthinkable to do without shopping.  Unique silk products, leather shoes, clothes, bags, exclusive jewelry, oils, spices, exotic souvenirs are bought here.  By the way, a good shopping center is located directly opposite the hotel, which is convenient for those who prefer to purchase everything on the spot. </p><p>  And for those who, on the contrary, like not only staying at a hotel on vacation, you can recommend interesting trips, for example, to the Sahara (for 2 nights), to Monastir, to El Jem, to Duggu, to Sousse and many others.  You can buy all excursions at the reception. </p><p> Tourists of any age really like an excursion to the Phrygia Zoo, located near Hammamet.  Many animals there freely walk around the territory, they are allowed to feed.  From Mahdia, the trip there takes about 3 hours.  You can get there with a guided tour, and on your own, using minibuses or an electric train going to Sousse, and from there either by taxi or again by minibus. </p><h2>  Hotel Caribbean World Mahdia 4 * (Tunisia, Mahdia), reviews </h2><p>  For tourists, this hotel leaves a good impression.
