Steam rises from the surface of the water, which is a sign of hot water, and the whole sun illuminates this whole picture.  So, this is not only there, "with them," but here, "with us."  For example, in the Mostovsky district of the Krasnodar Territory, in which there is something to see and where to relax.  If you have not decided how you will celebrate the New Year, then you can discover these places and combine the useful with the pleasant.  Useful, this is about the sources, which are many, as well as tourist centers.  We can say that this is a balneological paradise, not yet fully appreciated by the population of Russia.  You can come to the hot springs of the Mostovsky district for a week or two: doctors advise to withstand just such a period for the effective effects of thermal waters. </p><h2>  About the benefits of thermal waters </h2><p>  The purity of water from thermal springs and its saturation with mineral trace elements were appreciated by our distant ancestors.  In many parts of the world, one can hear legends about miraculous healings of terminally ill people who have experienced the healing properties of thermal water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otdbix-dlya-vsex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Base&quot; Old Mill &quot;" class="if uuid-2964304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2964304.jpg"></div><p>  The hot springs of the Mostovsky district are not inferior in quality to many well-known foreign analogues.  And the nature of these places is an additional healing component.  Where healing water comes to the surface, sanatoriums and numerous tourist centers have been built.  You can come here all year round, but winter trips during the New Year and Christmas holidays have become especially popular.  In addition to the completely cultivated hot springs, in the Mostovsky district there are also "wild" where there are minimal conditions for swimming.  However, they are also used.  Mostly locals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Living water </h2><p>  The water composition of each thermal spring carries information about the deep layers of the earth through which water made its way before appearing on the surface. </p><p>  So we can talk about the uniqueness of each reservoir: the spectrum of diseases with which you can come to the source depends on the content of mineral components and trace elements in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="23tur.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Base &quot;Pearl of the foothills&quot;" class="if uuid-2964336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2964336.jpg"></div><p>  However, one should also be aware of the dangers of uncontrolled and "fanatical" use. </p><p>  Therefore, before the trip, be sure to get expert advice, taking into account your disease and the properties of the thermal water of a particular source. </p><p>  Among the short list of ailments, in the presence of which one should refrain from bathing in a hot spring, oncology and heart diseases, as well as diabetes mellitus, various fungal skin lesions and asthma can be called. </p><p>  But those who have revealed gastrointestinal diseases, problems with gynecology, joint diseases, disorders of the nervous system, as well as endocrine abnormalities - can hope for a significant improvement in their health. </p><h2>  Hot and cold mineral water </h2><p>  The temperature of the water in it depends on the depth at which the source begins its path to the surface.  Accordingly, the composition of thermal waters depends on the depth.  You should know that the main part of such sources is located on the territory of volcanic activity, and the other part originates at a very great depth, which explains the high temperature of the water, which in some places reaches the boiling point. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="otdbix-dlya-vsex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsahvoa Mountain" class="if uuid-2964307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2964307.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, you should not confuse thermal water with mineral water.  These are different categories.  <span>Sources of mineral</span> water lie closer to the surface of the earth, so they have a high level of impurities, including harmful ones, associated with the human factor.  There are almost no harmful substances in thermal water; it contains many elements of the periodic table that have beneficial effects on human health. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kukarta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Base &quot;Silicon Baths&quot;" class="if uuid-2964314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2964314.jpg"></div><p>  Nevertheless, many of the hot springs are mineral, which allows the use of water from them both for the adoption of water procedures and for drinking with the aim of healing.  In almost every hot spring base in the Mostovsky district, information on the chemical composition of water is widely available.  Therefore, it will not be amiss to get acquainted with this information before the trip, and then consult with your doctor about the appropriateness of drinking water. </p><p>  Even if you are confident, observing the simple rules of bathing in thermal springs will make your stay in the Mostovsky district as comfortable as possible: </p><ul><li>  do not plunge sharply in hot water to avoid dizziness; </li><li>  leave your heart open when bathing, especially if you have low blood pressure; </li><li>  remember that for a long time (more than 20 minutes) being in hot water, you endanger yourself; </li><li>  drinking alcohol while taking balneological procedures makes your stay in the hot springs of the Mostovsky district, as in other similar places, ineffective. </li></ul><h2>  Where are you waiting </h2><p>  In the Mostovsky district, a wide selection of recreation centers for every taste and budget, where you will find comfort and a pleasant pastime with a useful healing effect. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="0o_6Tx3GkZs" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o_6Tx3GkZs" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/1/7/6/4/11764.jpg"></div><ul><li>  In a sanatorium called ‚ÄúKhutorok‚Äù you can treat the stomach, digestive system, as well as diseases of the kidneys and excretory system.
