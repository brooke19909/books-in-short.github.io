  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social support for families: nursing mother allowance and other benefits</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When a child appears in the family, in addition to the pleasant troubles and problems of care and upbringing, parents also have questions about the payments that are due to them, because any support from the state and maternity benefits can help, and are unlikely to be superfluous, especially for young families. </p><p>  After a woman has received <span>maternity allowance,</span> she is assigned a childcare payment of up to one and a half years.  This amount is fixed, and if mother worked before then, it is 40% of the salary (in this case, the average earnings for a certain period are taken).  If not, then the benefit is paid to the social security authorities, and today amounts to a little more than 2000 rubles for the first child, and a little more than 4000 for the second and subsequent ones.  Every year this amount is indexed and increased. </p><p>  Not everyone knows that nursing mothers are also entitled.  The fact that <span>natural feeding</span> is the most rational diet for a child has long been confirmed by many doctors.  To stimulate this, as well as to ensure the full nutrition of women during this period, this payment was prescribed.  It should be noted that in different regions of Russia it varies.  So, in the Penza region they pay 550 rubles, in the Kuban 150 rubles, in Perm a one-time payment of 1150 rubles is given, some regions give these mothers special fortified mixtures in dairy kitchens. </p><p>  What documents must be provided and how long is the allowance paid to nursing mothers?  Firstly, the most detailed information will be given in social security at the place of residence (or registration), where money will be charged.  But most often it is necessary, in addition to the birth certificate of the child, personal identification documents, to provide a <span>certificate from the pediatrician</span> that the child is breastfeeding.  Usually this type of food for the baby lasts about a year, so the benefit will be paid the same amount of time.  But more and more women believe that breastfeeding should last as long as possible, at least up to two or three years.  In this case, it is much more difficult to obtain benefits for nursing mothers, but it is quite possible by providing relevant certificates and evidence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fact is that, as such, the age limits of this payment are not indicated, however, in some cases, officials rely on a scientific basis, saying that a woman is considered to be breastfeeding, whose milk is the main type of food for the child, and this continues until the baby is one year old. . </p><p>  Knowing that there is a benefit for nursing mothers, some may forget about the payment for a full-fledged diet for a child, which relies from the beginning of feeding (4 months) up to 3 years.  This payment is common in those regions where, for some reason, dairy kitchens that previously gave part of the food to babies were closed. </p><p>  Single mothers enjoy special privileges, however, this status must be assigned to a woman officially.  After all, not every mother who brings up a child alone can have one.  For this, the baby must be born out of wedlock or after a certain time after its dissolution, and in the column "father" should be a dash or a note made at the direction of the woman.  In this case, until the child reaches the age of 16, a monthly payment of 40% of earnings or a fixed minimum rate (for non-working people) paid in social security is assumed.  At the same time, each region has its own measures of support for this group of parents, so the amount of the allowance for single mothers may vary depending on the place of residence. </p><p>  Thus, at the birth of a child, parents have <span>social assistance</span> from the state, which they can accept.  At the same time, employees of social protection bodies or the accounting department of the enterprise where one of the parents works will help to find out about payments and benefits. </p>
