    <h2>  Sol El Mouradi Skanes (Tunisia) Travel Reviews </h2><p>  Since today many travelers make the final decision on choosing a hotel based on the opinions of people who have already visited it, we decided to bring to your attention the generalized comments of the Russians who spent their holidays in Sol El Muradi Skanes (Monastir, Tunisia).  We note right away that the vast majority of Russians were very pleased with their decision to stay at this hotel and would gladly recommend it to all tourists traveling to Tunisia.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  As for the hotel rooms, our compatriots found them quite spacious and pleasantly decorated.  Furniture and appliances are in good condition.  Cleaning is done every day.  Towels and bed linen are also changed several times a week.  Moreover, according to tourists, here they do not just take out the trash from the room and slightly sweep the dust off the surfaces, but vacuum and thoroughly wash the floor in the room and the bathroom, as well as on the balcony. </p><p>  The territory of Sol El Mouradi Skanes is small, but it is very well planned, so there is enough space for everyone.  The only minor drawback is the fact that within the hotel you will not find a place for walking.  However, there are as many as three swimming pools, sports grounds, restaurants and bars. </p><p>  Traditionally, disputes between guests flare up when it comes to food at the hotel.  The hotel in question was no exception to this rule.  So, some tourists claim that the choice of dishes is small, and a four-star hotel could offer travelers a more varied menu.  However, another part of our compatriots claims that they were more than satisfied with the food at the hotel and did not see any reason for any discontent at all. </p><p>  Also controversial opinions can be found regarding the hotel staff.  So, some travelers claim that the staff of Sol El Mouradi Skanes 4 * are not very quick and friendly.  However, most of our compatriots are convinced of the opposite.  In addition, experienced tourists recommend not to forget about the specifics of the country and to encourage local staff with a small tip.  It will cost quite inexpensively, but you can count on excellent service from the hotel staff. </p><p>  Our compatriots were very pleased with the level of animation in the hotel in question.  According to them, the local team of animators consists of real professionals in their field and is struggling to make the guests' rest as interesting and varied as possible.  So, in the afternoon you will be invited to take part in various competitions, play darts or volleyball, do aqua aerobics.  In the evenings, the hotel hosts a variety of shows, theme events and discos. </p><p>  As for the hotel‚Äôs own beach, for the most part, tourists were also satisfied with it.  Despite the fact that it cannot be called large, everyone can always accommodate here without problems.  The only aspect that travelers recommend paying attention to is the presence in the coastal waters of jellyfish, which are especially active in July and August.  However, this fact is characteristic not only for the hotel in question and its environs, but also for the entire Tunisian coast. </p><p>  In general, it can be noted that the Sol El Mouradi Skanes hotel (the reviews of our compatriots who have visited here only confirm this) fully correspond to its four-star category and price.  So if you want to spend a great vacation in Tunisia, be sure to come to this hotel. </p>
