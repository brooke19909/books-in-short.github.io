    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key differences from flagships </h2><p>  The model looks very much like the flagship phones from the Xperia line, so many users can easily take one device for a completely different one.  Along with this, there are some differences.  First of all, the Sony Xperia M2 Dual lacks a metal edging.  In more expensive versions, it is a structural element of the aluminum frame, and therefore they have more weight.  In addition, the M2 Dual case does not protect the device from dust and moisture inside.  Another proof of this is the open connector for connecting a USB cable. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display is far from the <span>strongest side of the</span> Sony Xperia M2 Dual.  Reviews of most device users and experts indicate that it cannot be called advanced.  Be that as it may, for a smartphone with such a cost, the screen quality is acceptable.  In particular, the model uses a qHD display with a diagonal size of 4.8 inches.  The image density is 229 pixels per inch, and the resolution is 960x540 pixels.  Many smartphone owners say that the screen fades when exposed to <span>sunlight</span> over time.  This is considered a significant drawback.  In this case, the distortion of the picture at different viewing angles is negligible.  The display is characterized by medium brightness, and therefore experts recommend setting this parameter manually manually.  As for sensitivity, it can be called decent: texts are created without problems, and the sensor reacts quickly to touch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Xperia M2 Dual review" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/732360.jpg" width="600"></div>

The processor consists of four cores that operate at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The RAM size of the device is 1 GB.  As for the internal drive for storing data, its capacity is 8 GB.  Along with this, despite such modest parameters, the device is notable for good performance.  Even quite voluminous applications and games run without problems and work on Sony Xperia M2 Dual.  This is largely due to the fact that the smartphone uses far from the best display with medium resolution.  As for the operating system, the device runs on the Android 4.3 shell.  Most users of the device claim that the interface operates without any delay. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  With communications, the model is all right.  The phone works with two SIM cards and is able to function in LTE networks.  The device is equipped with a Wi-Fi module, USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 4.0.  The navigation system is implemented in GPS format.  The standard set of programs includes the myXperia service.  Its purpose is that, similarly to devices from Apple, it allows you to determine the location of the smartphone, delete all data from it, or simply block it.  It should be noted that this service must be activated. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Sony Xperia M2 Dual is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera equipped with auto focus and flash.  It is based on <span>an</span> Exmor RS- <span>type matrix</span> with the ability to quadruple digital zoom and create videos in FullHD quality.  Compared with the flagship models from the line, such characteristics are very modest, but in this case, do not forget about the price difference between these devices.  In automatic mode, 36 different scenes are provided, the parameters of each of which the device independently adjusts depending on external conditions.  Due to this, the resulting images are of good quality.  To make the best use of the capabilities of the device, experts recommend the use of appropriate applications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Xperia M2 Dual video review" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/732361.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The smartphone is also equipped with an additional camera, which is located on its front part.  High-quality photos with her help will not work.  It is only suitable for creating so-called selfies, which have become very popular lately, or for making video calls. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  At a fairly high level are the smartphone Sony Xperia M2 Dual characteristics of battery life.  The device is equipped with a 2300 mAh non-removable lithium-ion battery.

In case of listening to music, the smartphone will be discharged somewhere after 57 hours.  Users also have access to energy saving mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Xperia M2 Dual Specifications" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/732359.jpg" width="600"></div>
