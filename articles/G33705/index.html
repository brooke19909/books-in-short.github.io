    <h2>  Model Content </h2><p>  Depending on the substantive issues, such models are divided into groups: </p><ul><li>  production models in general; </li><li>  separate options for regions, subsystems, industries; </li><li>  complexes of models of consumption, production, distribution and formation of labor resources, income, financial relations. </li></ul><p>  Classification of models of these groups implies the allocation of structural, <span>functional, structural and functional</span> subsystems. </p><p>  When conducting research at the economic level, structural models are explained by the interconnection of individual subsystems.  As common options, models of intersectoral systems can be distinguished. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Functional options are used for economic regulation of commodity-money relations.  One and the same object can be represented in the form of functional, structural forms at the same time. </p><p>  The use of structural models in research at the economic level is justified by the interconnection of subsystems.  Typical in this case are models of interbranch ties. </p><p>  Functional models are widely used in the field of economic regulation.  Typical in this case are consumer behavior models in terms of commodity-money relations. </p>

    <h2>  Signs of models </h2><p>  Classification of models involves the consideration of individual functions that help clarify controversial issues.  The descriptive approach found the maximum distribution in simulation modeling. </p><p>  Depending on the nature of the detection of cause and effect relationships, there is a classification of models into variants that include individual elements of uncertainty and randomness, as well as strictly deterministic models.  It is important to distinguish between uncertainty, which is based on probability theory, and uncertainty that goes beyond the law. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Division of models according to the methods of reflection of the time factor </h2><p>  Classification of models by this factor into dynamic and static types is supposed.  Static models involve the consideration of all patterns in a certain period of time.  Dynamic options are characterized by changes in time.  Depending on the duration of use, classification of models into the following options is allowed: </p><ul><li>  short-term, the duration of which does not exceed a year; </li><li>  medium-term, designed for a period of one to five years; </li><li>  long-term, designed for a period of more than five years. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the specifics of the project, changes are allowed in the process of using the model. </p><h2>  According to the form of mathematical dependencies </h2><p>  The classification of models is based on the form of mathematical dependencies selected for work.  They are mainly used for carrying out calculations and analysis by a class of linear models.  Consider the economic types of models.  Classification of models of this type helps to study the change in consumption and demand of the population in case of growth of their material incomes.  In addition, using the <span>economic model</span> , changes in the needs of the population are analyzed in case of an increase in production, and the effectiveness of the use of resources in a specific situation is evaluated. </p><p>  Depending on the ratio of endogenous and exogenous variables that are included in the model, classification of the models of these species into closed and open systems is applied. </p><p>  Any model should include at least one endogenous variable, and therefore completely open systems are very difficult to find.  Models that do not include exogenous variables (closed options) are also practically uncommon.  In order to create such an option, one will have to completely disengage from the environment and allow serious coarsening of the real economic system that has external relations. </p><p>  As the achievements of mathematical and economic research increase, the classification of models and systems becomes much more complicated.  Currently, mixed types are used, as well as complex model designs.  A single classification of information models has not yet been established.  At the same time, about ten parameters can be noted by which model types are built. </p>

    <h2>  Model Types </h2><p>  A monographic or verbal model involves a description of a process or phenomenon.  Often we are talking about rules, law, theorem, or a combination of several parameters. </p><p>  The graphic model is executed in the form of a drawing, geographical map, drawing.  For example, the relationship between consumer demand and the cost of production can be represented using the coordinate axes.  The graph clearly shows the relationship between the two values. </p><p>  Real or physical models are created for objects that do not yet exist in reality. </p><h2>  The degree of aggregation of objects </h2><p>  There is a classification of information models for this attribute on: </p><ul><li>  local, with the help of which the analysis and forecast of certain industry development indicators are carried out; </li><li>  microeconomic, intended for a serious analysis of the structure of production; </li><li>  macroeconomic, based on the study of the economy. </li></ul><p>  There is also a separate classification of management models for macroeconomic species.  They are divided into one-, two-, multi-sector options. </p><p>  Depending on the purpose of creation and use, the following options are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  deterministic, having unambiguously clear results; </li><li>  stochastic, which suggest probabilistic results. </li></ul><p>  In the modern economy, balance models are distinguished, which reflect the requirement of the conformity of the resource base and their application.  For their recording use the form of square chess matrices. </p><p>  There are econometric types, for the estimation of which the methods of mathematical statistics are used.  On such models, the development of the main indicators of the created economic system is expressed through a long-term trend (trend).  They are in demand in the analysis and forecasting of certain economic situations associated with real statistical information. </p><p>  Optimization models make it possible from among many alternative (possible) options to choose the best option for production, consumption or distribution of resources.  The use of limited resources in such a situation will be the most effective means to achieve the goal. </p><p>  <span>Simulation models</span> suggest the participation in the project not only of an expert, but also of specialized software, computers.  The resulting expert database is designed to solve one or more tasks by simulating human activities. </p><p>  Network models are a set of operations and events that are interconnected in time.  Most often, such a model is intended to carry out work in such a sequence as to achieve the minimum terms of the project. </p><p>  Depending on the selected type of mathematical apparatus, models are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  matrix </li><li>  correlation-regressive; </li><li>  network </li><li>  inventory management; </li><li>  mass service. </li></ul><h2>  Stages of economic and mathematical modeling </h2><p>  This process is focused, it obeys a certain logical program of action.  Among the main stages of creating such a model are: </p><ul><li>  statement of an economic problem and its qualitative analysis; </li><li>  development of a mathematical model; </li><li>  preparation of initial information; </li><li>  numerical solution; </li><li>  analysis of the results, their use. </li></ul><p>  When posing an economic problem, it is necessary to clearly state the essence of the problem, note the important features and parameters of the simulated object, analyze the relationship of individual elements in order to explain the development and behavior of the object in question. </p><p>  When developing a mathematical model, the relationship between equations, inequalities, and functions is revealed.  First of all, they determine the type of model, analyze the possibility of applying it in a specific task, form a specific list of parameters and variables.  When considering complex objects, diverse aspects are built so that each characterizes individual aspects of the object. </p><p>  Next, the necessary mathematical calculations are performed, the results obtained are analyzed. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There is currently no separate concept for the model.  The classification of models is conditional, but this does not reduce their relevance. </p>
