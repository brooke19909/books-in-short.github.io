    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Against the backdrop of European hotels, which usually do not have their territory and developed infrastructure, Hotel Surf Mar 4 * stands out.  It can please not only with its location, but also with an abundance of various objects, including those intended for children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, the Surf Mar 4 * hotel does not have a large territory, but this does not spoil it at all - all the free space has been turned into a blooming garden, where it is very convenient to relax in the midday heat.  Opposite the building of the hotel complex is a fairly large open-air pool.  It occupies three hundred and twelve square meters and is completely hidden from prying eyes by trees and flowering shrubs.  The pool is surrounded by sun loungers and parasols, which are free for hotel guests. </p><p>  Vacationers can use the restaurant and bar, working on a convenient schedule.  In the restaurant, guests have breakfast, lunch and dinner.  But the bar is designed for evening entertainment, although it operates in the daytime.  Here those who do not plan to go to the coast and spend time by the pool love to relax. </p><p>  Since in Europe many tourists often travel by rented car, the hotels try to make fairly spacious parking spaces where cars and motorbikes can be accommodated.  Hotel Surf Mar has a parking lot for one hundred and twenty cars and a garage for twenty more cars.  This service is free for hotel guests. </p><p>  On the ground floor of the hotel complex there is a TV room where vacationers spend time in the evening.  They have a wide selection of channels and films in different languages. </p><p>  The reception is open around the clock, so hotel guests can contact the staff at any time for help on various issues.  There is also a luggage storage room, and there are various vending machines selling drinks and snacks.  They are usually very fond of kids who prefer a high-grade lunch of soda and chips with crackers.  There is a safe and a currency exchange at the reception, so vacationers do not have to go out to the city to exchange cash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel has a small conference room where you can hold a serious event, as well as solve issues with business papers - send a fax or make copies.  Please note that this service is not included in the room rate. </p><p>  The hotel has various sites for outdoor activities, we will talk about them in the next section of the article. </p>
