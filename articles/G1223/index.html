  <section class="page js-page"><h1>High-quality and inexpensive home theater projector</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Creating your own home cinema is now possible, primarily due to the appearance on the market of projectors designed for home use.  Now there are a lot of models that are suitable for this role.  A home theater projector must meet several requirements.  It should be quiet, since too loud a sound of work is unacceptable in small rooms.  So that it can be used in a normal living room, the noise should not exceed 27 dB, otherwise it will experience discomfort. </p><p>  The characteristics that a projector for a home theater possesses will not always be the same as those that are important for presentation and other projectors.  For example, the intensity and strength of the light flux is not so important at home, because the rooms are usually small, unlike, for example, large halls for demonstrations, where the conditions are sometimes not the best.  Much depends on the specific model, the most famous manufacturers are Epson, Panasonic, BenQ. </p><p>  A projector for a home theater should do a good job of displaying video; in films, there is a frequent change of frame.  If he does not cope with this, then the picture quality will be extremely low.  Another requirement is a high-quality and accurate display of colors and shades, which also has a direct impact on the received impressions.  Some projectors do not have a very high color rendering, especially for models that are suitable for demonstrations and display of various schemes, etc. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Projector Features</strong> </p><p>  When choosing a device for home use, you need to pay attention to several basic parameters.  There are several technologies that allow you to get different image resolution.  The higher it is, the better the projector will be for a home theater. </p><p>  Such projectors should output 16: 9 and 16:10 video.  Improved capabilities for displaying dynamic video are required, and the picture should be with a minimum amount of noise.  This may include Epson or Optoma products. </p><p>  For use at home, contrary to popular belief, absolutely no projector is suitable, since projector technologies are different.  Budget models are intended for small offices, educational institutions and other institutions for presentations.  But at the same time, the price is not an indicator that should be guided by.  Installation projectors are quite expensive, they are used in large conference rooms, but the emphasis is on the power of the light flux, the ability to work on presentations, and the implementation of various connection standards. </p><p>  <strong>Home use</strong> </p><p>  In addition to high-quality image display, a home projector should be able to connect to other devices.  If the user can easily and quickly connect it to a laptop or home computer, then he will be able to display information from him or play movies, which is very convenient.  But here the question arises, how to <span>connect a home theater.</span>  It is also necessary to consider that the projector does not have its own sound system, therefore external speakers are required.  As a rule, these are multichannel speakers capable of reproducing sound in Dolby Digital mode.  It will not be superfluous to have a remote control so that you do not have to constantly approach the projector. </p><p>  In general, the creation of a home theater ends here.  Focusing on these parameters, you can choose a system at a fairly low price, but at the same time it will meet the basic requirements.  However, a single projector is not enough, so you need to think about the soundtrack.  Sometimes it is easier to create it on the basis of a personal computer, although you can also purchase a blue-ray player in addition.  Many modern <span>projectors BenQ,</span> Optoma, Nec, Epson are able to output video in Full HD resolution, so the quality will not suffer. </p>
