What is needed for this? </h2><p>  In order to independently perform pillows in the form of letters, you will need some materials and tools.  We list them below: </p><ul><li>  fabric (cotton, linen, fleece, felt, flannel); </li><li>  threads </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  filler (synthetic winterizer, holofiber); </li><li>  paper; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  pins </li><li>  sewing machine. </li></ul><h2>  Making pillows in letters.  Method number 1 (the easiest) </h2><p>  This model of a product can be executed even by a beginning seamstress.  The manufacture of such elements of the alphabet is manual.  We study the instructions. </p><p>  On paper, draw a full-size sketch of the letter.  To ensure that all elements are proportional, use a ruler.  Cut the resulting template and transfer it to a double folded fabric.  Pin the paper part with pins and circle it with a pencil.  Now remove the template.  Cut the textile blank exactly along the contour.  Since the letters will be sewn together manually on the front side of the product, no allowances should be left. </p><p>  Getting to the connection of parts.  Sew them with a back seam (‚Äúover the edge‚Äù).  So that the letter has an aesthetic appearance, try to sew all the stitches at the same distance from each other.  When the product is almost completely sewn up, put the needle down and take the filler.  Fill the pillow with small portions of syntepon (holofiber).  Try to keep this material from clumping inside the letter.  Do not fill the product too tightly, otherwise the seams may break.  Next, sew the hole, fasten the thread and cut it.  That's all.  Similarly, follow other pillows with letters.  Such soft elements of the alphabet can be decorated with lace, embroidery, textile applique, beads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="letter pillows" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/344437.jpg?1393590877875" width="332"></div>

The letter is a pillow, it‚Äôs a toy.  How to execute? </h2><p>  In this part of the article, we are talking about how to decorate these products from fabric using a sewing machine. </p><p>  A paper template is made exactly as described in the previous embodiment.  But the pattern itself is done differently.  When cutting blanks from fabric, retreat 1-1.5 centimeters from the intended contours, thus forming allowances.  <span>How to sew pillow letters of</span> this kind?  Connect the parts on a typewriter.  Sew on the seamy side of the product along the drawn lines.  Leave a small hole and turn the letter through it to the front side.  Now fill the inside of the pad with filler.  <span>Fill the</span> hole manually with a <span>hidden seam</span> .  One element of soft alphabet is ready.  Decorate the product as you wish. </p><h2>  We sew voluminous soft letters.  Method number 3 </h2><p>  The pillow model, the manufacturing method of which is described below, differs from the previous ones in that it turns out to be more voluminous and stable.  And all because in this version the letter has not only the front and back sides, but also the end sides.  In the photo you can see examples of such products.  How to make such soft pillow letters with your own hands? </p><p>  On paper we draw a sketch of the letter and separately - its end faces.  Here you should be careful not to make mistakes with measurements.  The width of all lateral, upper and lower elements of the letters should be the same.  We transfer the patterns to the fabric and cut out.  You can stitch the product on the wrong side or on the front - that's how you want.  If you decide to connect the parts in the face, then use decorative seams.  Fill the letters in the same way as described in the previous instructions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="letter pillows" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/344442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a soft alphabet of foam rubber? </h2><p>  In order to perform the following version of the pillow-letter, you will need the materials indicated in the list: </p><ul><li>  furniture foam rubber (60-100 mm thick); </li><li>  the cloth; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  construction knife; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  pins </li><li>  paper; </li><li>  pencil. </li></ul><p>  From the paper, follow the letter face pattern.  Put it on the foam, pin it with pins.  Cut a letter along the contour with a knife.  Follow this procedure on a flat surface, but note that you may scratch it.  Therefore, it is better to put a piece of old plywood or thick cardboard under the foam.  From the fabric, cut out the elements of the pillow-letter: the details of the front, back, sidewalls, top and ‚Äúsole‚Äù.  Consider the dimensions of the product and leave room for allowances.  Sew together all the parts, stern back.  Insert the foam blank into the resulting textile cover.  Now attach the back textile wall and attach it manually with a blind seam.  Everything, the product is ready. </p>
