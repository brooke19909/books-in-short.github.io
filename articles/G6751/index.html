    <p>  The Cold War is a global military, geopolitical and economic confrontation between the <span>Soviet Union</span> and the <span>United States of America</span> with the support of various allies from all sides.  This confrontation lasted for almost fifty years (from 1946 to 1991). </p><p>  The Cold War was not a military battle in the literal sense.  The basis of the debate was the ideology of the two most powerful states of the planet at that time.  Scientists characterize this confrontation as a very deep contradiction between the socialist and capitalist systems.  It is symbolic that the Cold War began immediately after the end of World War II, as a result of which both countries remained winners.  And since devastation prevailed in the world at that time, ideal conditions were created for planting a <span>model of governing the</span> people in many territories.  But, unfortunately, the United States and the USSR at that time differed in their opinions, so each side wanted to get ahead of the opponent and make it so that in a vast territory where people did not know what to believe and how to live on, plant their own ideology as soon as possible.  As a result, the people of the losing states will trust the winning country and enrich it at the expense of their human and natural resources. </p><p>  This confrontation is divided into stages of the Cold War, among which the following can be distinguished: </p><p>  - The beginning (1946-1953 gg.).  This stage can be described as the attempts of the USSR and the USA to hold the first events in Europe, which would be aimed at instilling one‚Äôs ideology.  As a result, since 1948 the possibility of starting a new war has hung over the world, so both states began to rapidly prepare for new battles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - On the brink of <span>nuclear war</span> (1953-1962 gg.).  During this period, relations between opponents improved slightly and they even began to make friendly visits to each other.  But at this time, European states, one by one, begin a revolution in order to independently lead their country.  To eliminate indignation, the USSR actively began to bombard the outbreak of conflicts.  The United States could not allow such liberties to the enemy and they themselves began to set up their air defense system.  As a result, the relationship deteriorated again. </p><p>  - The stage of discharge (1962-1979 gg.).  During this period, more conservative rulers came to power in the warring countries, who were not particularly willing to lead an active confrontation, which could well lead to war. </p><p>  - A new round of confrontation (1979-1987).  The next stage began after the Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan and several times shot down foreign civilian aircraft that flew over the state.  These aggressive actions provoked the United States to deploy its <span>missile launchers</span> on the territory of several European countries, which, of course, already infuriated the USSR. </p><p>  - The coming to power of Gorbachev and the end of the confrontation (1987-1991).  The new <span>ruler of the USSR</span> did not want to continue the struggle for ideology in other European countries.  Moreover, his policy was aimed at eliminating the communist government, which was the founder of political and economic repression towards the United States. </p><p>  The end of the Cold War was marked by the fact that the Soviet Union made great concessions and did not particularly lay claim to power in Europe, especially since the defeated countries had already departed from the devastation and began independent development.  The USSR, on the other hand, began to experience a deep crisis, which in December 1991 led to the final <span>collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</span>  Thus, the Cold War did not bring a positive result to our state, but became one of the elements that led to the collapse of the great state. </p>
