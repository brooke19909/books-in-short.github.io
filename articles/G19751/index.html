  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rostov region: the village of Wet Bataille</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A small village in southern Russia Wet Bataille is one of many that preserve the traditional way of life.  It is difficult to say what will happen if the population concentrates only in large cities.  Most likely, civilization will simply perish.  There was a time when they stimulated the move from the village to industrial centers, and workers were needed in the factories.  Today the task is to do everything possible to revive the village. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Wet Batai of the Rostov Region is the center of the corresponding municipality of the Kagaltsky District, located 26 km from Rostov-on-Don and practically adjoins the city of Bataysk.  The municipality combines two more settlements Malodubravny and Novorakitny. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rostov.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House in the village of Wet Bataille" class="if uuid-2666066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2666066.jpg"></div><p>  The village is located in a flat area with favorable conditions for farming.  The average annual temperature is +8.9 ¬∞ C. The frost-free period is 257 days.  Despite the hot, dry summers, the area receives enough moisture to successfully farm. </p><p>  Over 15 peasant farms engaged in the cultivation of cereals and Pancake week crops are registered here.  The agricultural cooperative ‚ÄúCherry‚Äù is working successfully.  Favorable economic conditions allow him to constantly increase production volumes for many years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Village History </h2><p>  The history of Wet Batai began from the beginning of the 20th century, during the period of a sharp rise in industrial production.  Life went on.  During the construction of the Vladikavkaz railway, not far from Bataysk station, the Wet Batai junction was formed.  Before World War II, the tiny village lived a calm, peaceful life among the grain fields.  The war brought ruin; fierce battles were fought on the lands near Rostov-on-Don. </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The memory of World War II" class="if uuid-2666065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2666065.jpg"></div><p>  Even today, residents in their gardens find trophies of those times.  The post-war revival of the national economy breathed new life into the village.  PMK-19, VSUZ-19 were built, the Vishnevyi state farm began work.  The village began to grow and develop.  The end of the 20th century brought ruin again, but the Vishnevyi state farm managed to survive, became a cooperative and is now successfully working. </p><p>  Over the past decade, the population on the territory of the municipality has steadily kept at the level of 2.5 thousand people. </p><h2>  Transport infrastructure </h2><p>  The proximity to a large metropolis and the presence of a railway crossing makes the land of the village attractive for business development.  In addition, a large federal highway Rostov-on-Don - Stavropol passes through the village. </p><p>  Two regional trains run daily to the regional center.  In particularly busy periods, a third train is added.  Every day there are three comfortable buses.  Travel time is only 41 minutes. </p>
