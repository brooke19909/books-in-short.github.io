We don‚Äôt tell them as many kind words as mothers, we give them fewer gifts made by our own hands, fearing that they will not appreciate.  And in vain.  In this article, we will see how to make a dad a birthday card.  Dads love us as much as mothers: they rejoice in all our victories and try to support us during the defeats.  Dads, no less than mothers, appreciate our gifts. </p><h2>  Beautiful birthday card for dad </h2><p>  In order to make such a card, you will need craft paper, white paper, glue and scissors.  For decoration, you can take the usual wide satin ribbon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kristyandbryce.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="birthday card" class="if uuid-2464122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2464122.jpg"></div><p>  Instead of roses, you can use anything you want: buttons, beads, even coffee beans. </p><ul><li>  Cut out the heart from white paper.  Glue it in the middle on kraft paper. </li><li>  Next, using the roses or what you replaced them with, glue the white heart around the edges so that a three-dimensional heart is obtained, as shown in the photo above. </li><li>  After that, cut a small rectangle from another sheet of the craft and glue it just above the heart.  Cut a rectangle of white paper even smaller than the previous one and paste it on top of the craft rectangle. </li><li>  We take a pre-prepared satin ribbon, assembled by a bow, and either attach it to the card with glue, or hold it behind and tie it. </li><li>  At the very end, when the handmade birthday card for Dad is ready for birthday, we write a wish on a white rectangle.  Anything, the main thing - with all my heart, so that dad would be pleased. </li></ul><h2>  The second version of the postcard </h2><p>  At first glance, it might seem that making such a voluminous birthday card for dad is very difficult.  In fact, this is not so.  So what do we need? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="greeting card for dad" class="if uuid-2464101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2464101.jpg"></div><p>  Colored and white cardboard, felt-tip pens / paints, glue, scissors. </p><ul><li>  We take colored cardboard (any color), bend it in half and unbend it. </li><li>  We glue white cardboard on the inside so that it is a centimeter smaller than the main (color) on each side. </li><li>  Three colored rectangles of different sizes are cut out of colored cardboard of a different color.  We also fold them in half and use glue to connect them as shown in the photo above. </li><li>  On the rectangles we write with felt-tip pens or paints congratulation for the father.  The usual "Happy Birthday," "I Love You," and so on.  If you want a handmade birthday card for your dad to be original, you can write something that only two of you will understand.  Go for it! </li></ul><h2>  Postcard "Building Tools" </h2><p>  For a box with construction tools, you will not need to bother at all.  You will need colored cardboard, white paper, craft paper and buttons.  As well as glue and scissors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbusinesscardsguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dad's birthday" class="if uuid-2464104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2464104.jpg"></div><p>  How to make this birthday card for dad? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The first thing you need is to find in advance on the Internet and print images of tools: a hammer, a saw, a screwdriver, pliers and so on - of your choice.  Next you need to carefully cut out the ‚Äútools‚Äù along the contour. </li><li>  Next, take colored cardboard, cut a slightly smaller rectangle of white paper and glue it on top.  On white paper, we stick craft paper (we make holes in it in advance) of an even smaller size. </li><li>  We glue pre-printed and cut tools on top of the craft.  We ‚Äúfasten‚Äù with their heads the buttons, which we separate in advance from the legs. </li><li>  After everything is done, we proceed to congratulation.  We glue a rectangle from an ordinary sheet of paper at the very bottom of the postcard, and a rectangle from craft paper on top.  On it we write beautiful congratulations to dad.  "Happy Birthday," "I Love You," "You are the Best," is something warm and pleasant. </li></ul><p>  And that's it, Dad‚Äôs birthday card is ready for his birthday! </p><h2>  Another postcard option </h2><p>  If you want to make a simple, but at the same time a soulful postcard, then this option is for you!  All you need is colored cardboard, pen, glue, scissors, colored paper, desire and very little free time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cardsbystephanie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dad's birthday" class="if uuid-2464123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2464123.jpg"></div><ul><li>  We bend colored cardboard in half. </li><li>  Cut out the age of the pope from colored paper - numbers.  Glue them on the cardboard on the inside.  We write outside ‚ÄúHappy Birthday, beloved dad!‚Äù, And inside - a more detailed congratulation.  If you wish, you can write poems for dad - on your own or take it from the Internet.  The main thing is to put your whole soul into these words, then such a birthday card from your son to dad will be very expensive.  Or from a daughter - it doesn‚Äôt matter. </li></ul><h2>  Postcard "Ties" </h2><p>  Such a creative postcard is rarely seen.  It is unusual, beautiful and easy to manufacture.  Surely you are wondering about how to make such a card to dad for his birthday.  Answer: very, very simple! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbusinesscardsguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="postcard to beloved dad" class="if uuid-2464103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2464103.jpg"></div><p>  You will need, as in all previous cases, colored cardboard, white cardboard, colored paper, a pen, glue and scissors.  And also a wire. </p><ul><li>  We glue the white cardboard on top of the colored one, paying attention to the fact that the white one is shorter by a centimeter on each side. </li><li>  Next, you need to build something similar to a hanger from the wire.  It will not be so difficult to do this. </li><li>  Next, cut out ties from colored paper and "hang" them on a hanger.  The hanger is glued to white cardboard. </li><li>  Using a pen, in a beautiful handwriting, we write a congratulation to my father.  And also, if desired, you can draw a frame around the edges of the card for greater color. </li></ul><p>  Everything, a creative DIY postcard for your dad for your birthday is done! </p><h2>  Postcard with the hands of a child </h2><p>  The above postcards are more suitable for adults - children are unlikely to cope with them, at least without the help of an adult.  Children are better off trying to draw a birthday card for dad, as shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="greeting card to dad" class="if uuid-2464182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2464182.jpg"></div><p>  Any child can handle this pattern.  All he needs is cardboard, paints and his own palm. </p><ul><li>  The kid dips his hand in the paint, leaves its imprint on the sheet and goes to wash the pens. </li><li>  Further, the child already draws a brush on the candles with a brush (although it can also be done using the fingertips).  For greater beauty, you can draw wavy lines on the "short", as shown in the photo. </li><li>  If the child does not already know how to write, then you can help him finish the card: ask what he would like to pass on to dad, and write it on the card. </li></ul><h2>  Plasticine postcard </h2><p>  How to draw a birthday card for dad, we discussed, let's see how it can be blinded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cbc.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sculpting card for dad" class="if uuid-2464192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2464192.jpg"></div><p>  To make such a wonderful postcard, you will need cardboard, felt-tip pens, plasticine, a modeling board and a special knife - a stack. </p><ul><li>  The head and torso of the "dad" can be sculpted with any colors - as his imagination tells the child.  For the head you need to roll the ball, then flatten it on the board with your fingers.  In general, it will be necessary to flatten all parts of the body, since on the card they should be more or less flat. </li><li>  The ball-body rolled into a sausage will become an oval.  Handles and legs are also sausages. </li><li>  After the little man is stuck together, we fix it on cardboard.  We draw him buttons and a bow, as shown in the photo.  We make a face: we draw eyes, a mouth, a nose and hairs.  In the end, we write on the remaining plasticine-free part of the card a happy birthday for Dad. </li></ul><p>  Such a beautiful postcard from a child will surely please dad, and he will keep it for a long time and carefully. </p>
