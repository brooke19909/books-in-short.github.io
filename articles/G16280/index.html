All hotels adapt to generally accepted standards, so memorize the abbreviations in advance, and you will be able to navigate them like an avid traveler, and you will tell beginners who want to go to a particular hotel what HB, BB food means. </p>

    <h2>  BB, or Bed &amp; Breakfast </h2><p>  In fact, it translates as "bed and breakfast."  It is clear that you will be given only a morning meal, which was originally included in the price of the tour.  For the rest you have to pay an additional fee in the restaurant.  A buffet is usually offered.  This implies that you yourself come to the large set table on which the dishes are laid out and lay them in the quantity you need. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The type of food, which means only morning meals and overnight, is most often found in European small hotels and small resort towns, as well as in those places where the main emphasis is on sightseeing tourism.  This is convenient if the excursion program is scheduled for the whole day, that is, you leave the hotel early and return only late in the evening. </p>

    <h2>  What is offered for breakfast </h2><p>  The food at the HB hotel is more complete, but if you want to save some money, consider the BB menu in more detail.  These are a variety of sandwiches, stewed and fried vegetables <span>on skewers, fruits,</span> snacks on tartlets and unleavened bread, canap√© sandwiches, fried pieces of meat or chicken wings, various salads and desserts.  Tea, water or coffee are also free drinks.  Alcohol, cocktails and juices will have to buy for your money.  Nutrition HB - what is it?  You will read more about this later. </p><h2>  HB (Half Board), FB and AL </h2><p>  If you do not like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbreakfast alone, and you want to eat twice a day, then it is worth stopping by the system called "Nutrition HB".  "What is it?"  - you ask.  The abbreviation is translated as "half board".  You eat twice free.  Most often this includes breakfast and dinner only.  Other hotels may offer breakfast and lunch, although this is not particularly welcome.  UAE hotels offer replacing dinner with lunch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Only in the morning, drinks are offered free of charge.  Usually it is coffee, tea and water.  You will have to pay for drinks for lunch or dinner.  If you still have a bottle of alcohol left out, it is served the next day in the evening meal.  What else is convenient when choosing an HB system?  You do not have to pay every time for drinks.  It's simple - you tell the waiter the room number of the room, and the bill is provided after eviction from the hotel. </p><p>  Who will like HB?  Most often, this type of food is found in 3 * or 4 * hotels.  This is ideal for travelers who come to relax for a short time, and also will appeal to those who prefer to go to a restaurant for lunch.  If you spend all day on the beach and enjoy sunbathing, choose a HB-style hotel.  In the afternoon you can have something to eat on the beach, and in the afternoon hours you really do not want to eat.  A light salad in the afternoon or snacks, a glass of local spill beer will help save money and preserve your figure, because usually for dinner you can enjoy more solid and hearty dishes. </p>

    <p>  FB, AL are Full Board and <span>All Inclusive.</span>  What does HB nutrition and BB mean, we have already figured out.  Full Board is a <span>full board,</span> which includes a full three meals a day (breakfast, lunch and dinner).  Drinks that are set for lunch or evening for dinner are not included. </p><p>  All Inclusive has the same principle as full board.  That is, breakfast, lunch and dinner are given to you from the hotel for free.  In addition to them, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are served, mainly from a local producer.  What is meant by the nutrition of HB, BB and AL is known, and you can choose a place to live.  But there is another category, more elite - UAL. </p><h2>  UAL or Ultra All Inclusive </h2><p>  Translated as "ultra all inclusive."  This also includes breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Local alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are also imported.  Various free services may be provided at the discretion of the administration. </p><h2>  English and continental breakfast </h2><p>  After we figured out what the nutrition BB, HB, AL and UAL means, let's move on to traditional breakfasts.  Some hotels can offer tourists English, American or Continental. </p>

A full set of dishes includes juice (orange or any other fruit), scrambled eggs with the addition of ham slices (in some hotels relies on it omelette), fragrant toasts fried to a crisp.
