  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotels of Russia - the generosity of the Russian soul</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Our country - generous and hospitable - is ready to welcome guests from all over the <span>globe</span> throughout the year, and everyone will find something for himself that is not in his homeland, and, perhaps, nowhere else in the world.  Trips around the country and hotels in Russia will amaze the most sophisticated and experienced tourists, opening before them more and more new faces of our vast Motherland.  A country of contrasts - this is what Russia is called outside its borders, and it cannot be said that this is not so. </p><p>  Only in our country there are various opportunities for a wonderful holiday - resort and beach (Black Sea, Caspian and Azov coasts), mountain excursion (Ural, Altai, Caucasus), balneological and aesthetic (Caucasian Mineral waters, Baikal, Karelia).  Those who spend at least a few days in Russia will definitely want to return here more than once.  Foreigners, for whom such a vacation is exotic, always leave positive reviews about hotels in Russia, however, as well as about all the holidays spent here.  Particularly popular is a trip to the eastern part of our country, where you can have a great rest, organizing snowmobile safaris and skiing, as well as participating in exciting jeep tours or fishing on Lake Baikal - one of the most picturesque places in the whole world. </p><p>  Many hotels in Russia located in this region invite tourists to spend a magical holiday in their comfortable rooms, but guests from abroad most often prefer the Baikal Business Center hotel.  Located in a beautiful and ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIrkutsk, this hotel offers its guests 59 rooms of various categories, and for businessmen - a chic room for business meetings, negotiations, conferences and presentations.  As practice shows, <span>business negotiations</span> held in conditions of incredible beauty and a clean environment are very successful and have long-term follow-ups.  If you come to Lake Baikal with a view to spending your usual family vacation, the most important thing you should remember is the beauty parlor and beauty salon, modern gym and sauna, as well as the rich nightlife in restaurants, coffee houses and comfortable bars - all the best that can be offered Russian hotels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In recent years, trips to the Caucasian Mineral Waters have been very popular among foreign tourists - a health and medical resort located in an unusual place between the <span>Caspian</span> and Black <span>Seas</span> .  There are hotels of the highest class, with high-quality service and comfortable accommodation, and there are budget options - pensions and <span>private hotels,</span> which, however, in terms of service are not inferior to the more elite "colleagues" in anything.  Experienced travelers are advised to pay attention to some similar hotels in Russia, in particular, the Beshtau hotel complex, which has occupied a large territory with magnificent views of most of this region - traditionally Russian feather grass steppes, magnificent pine and deciduous forests, elegant alpine meadows and gloomy wonderful landscape of the <span>Caucasus mountains.</span>  The hotel has 178 rooms, spacious and comfortable, equipped with everything that a modern person needs - a TV, telephone, Internet access.  In addition, hotel guests get the opportunity to conduct business negotiations in a local conference room or relax in one of the many restaurants.  For example, in the Beshtau restaurant, which serves foreign guests specialties of traditional Russian cuisine, as well as European and Caucasian dishes, or in the Varadero cafe-bar, the design of which is made in the Cuban style, which allows not only to watch incendiary dances, but also smoke a real Cuban cigar.  Many tourists who travel to Russia with pleasure visit the lobby bar, which always offers its customers hot and cold dishes and a variety of alcoholic drinks (alcoholic and cold). </p>
