And everything else - a huge construction site in the field, which only after a considerable time will become a full-fledged neighborhood, planted with trees and flowers.

    <p>  The developer, the Arcada construction company, had to work hard during the creation of the project, since obtaining permission to build the complex required that it fully comply with the architectural concept of the region.  You can imagine what the challenge was for the designers.  However, they coped with it with dignity. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  A more specific location of the Mandarin residential complex is Nizino, a village located in the Lomonosov district.  It is only six kilometers from Peterhof, the famous Peterhof Canal flows through the territory, and from some windows of the complex you can see the outlines of the Belvedere Palace.  Agree, this is such an advantage that it is impossible even to compare with the dream of many future apartment owners in new buildings to see at least a forest that looms in the distance from the balcony. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In accordance with the concept, the construction is low-rise and not large-scale.  The complex includes only 4 buildings with 5 floors each, made in a minimalist style.  In total, it is planned to rent 506 apartments.  These will be studios, odnushki and dvushka. </p><h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  Low-rise <span>housing complex</span> began to be erected in 2014.  Construction is carried out in two phases using frame-monolithic technology.  The deadline for the first was set for April 2016.  However, SC ‚ÄúArcade‚Äù ahead of time put into operation two buildings in the fall of 2015.  To date, only a few apartments are on sale.  The deadline for the second stage is the end of 2016.  At the moment, work is being conducted ahead of schedule, so it is quite possible that the remaining three buildings will be commissioned earlier. </p><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The low-rise residential complex "Mandarin" can be called the debut of the company "Armada".  Previously, all her projects were implemented only in the industrial construction segment, and she began her activity in 1977 with the installation and laying of engineering and communication networks.  IC is constantly expanding its sphere of interests in the real estate market, in addition, it builds all of its facilities at its own expense, which, according to the management, is sufficient for it to realize any planned project. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, the fact of the early commissioning of two buildings of the "Mandarin" eloquently enough testifies to the conscientiousness and hard work of the IC specialists. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  In terms of ecology, Nizino is considered almost the cleanest region of the Leningrad region.  There is not one not only a large, but even a small industrial enterprise.  Which, however, is not surprising when you consider that the LCD "Mandarin" is adjacent to the palace and park ensemble of world significance - Peterhof.  The latter includes the huge Lugovoi Park, on the territory of which nine beautiful lakes are located.  Also nearby is the shore of the Gulf of Finland. </p><p>  However, you can not talk about the ecology of the territory, which is under the protection of UNESCO, for a particularly long time.  Everything is clear and without further ado. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In simple terms, the territory on which the housing estate is located is an ordinary province.  And to count on the fact that here you can find a lot of entertainment venues and a myriad of supermarkets would be at least unreasonable.  But all that is needed can be found in Nizino. </p>

    <p>  So, in the village there is a clinic, a pharmacy, several shops, a branch of Sberbank, a school and a kindergarten.  In addition, all the first floors of the buildings "Mandarin" will be given to the objects of commercial infrastructure, so that residents of the complex will be able to use their services, almost without leaving home.  However, for major purchases and entertainment at this stage, you need to go to the city.  Closest to all, at a distance of five kilometers is the shopping center "Rocket" in Peterhof. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Almost next to the complex there is a bus station, from which minibuses and buses regularly go to Peterhof and St. Petersburg.  You can get to the first one in ten minutes, and it takes about 40 minutes to get to the nearest metro stations - Leninsky Prospekt, Avtovo, Prospect Veteranov. </p><p>  In addition, in Nizino there is a railway station through which electric trains arrive at the <span>Baltic Station.</span>  As for motorists, they have at their disposal a very convenient exit to the roundabout located seven kilometers away. </p><h2>  LCD "Mandarin": planning </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the apartments in the complex are presented by studios and 1-2-bedroom living quarters.  Regarding planning decisions, unfortunately, you will not name them especially diverse. </p>

    <p>  So, two-room apartments are presented in only one version, however, the location of the rooms and their ergonomics and functionality are quite good.  There is a large kitchen, a spacious L-shaped entrance hall with a niche of four "squares" arranged under the dressing room, and a separate bathroom.  There is a glazed balcony.  There are 4 types of studios.  The bathrooms in them are combined, the hallways from the main room are not fenced off with a wall, but there is a heated balcony, which can be easily adapted for an office. </p><p>  As for the "odnushki", there are three options for planning.  All types of apartments provide access to the balcony through the kitchen, which, incidentally, is quite spacious (from 10 to 14 sq. M), in the hallway there is a niche for a dressing room or a spacious wardrobe.  Bathrooms are only combined.  Ceiling height - 2 m 70 cm. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  All apartments are for rent without <span>finishing.</span>  The developer installs double-glazed windows, mounts and connects all utilities, equips the entrance doorway with a metal door.  There is a screed on the floor.  In addition, there is a special offer today, according to which, when buying an apartment in the second stage houses, you can get a fine finish as a gift. </p>

    <p>  This means that the apartment will be commissioned ‚Äúturnkey‚Äù - with installed interior doors, painted ceilings, wallpaper on the walls, tiles in the bathroom and in the kitchen, as well as all the necessary plumbing equipment. </p><h2>  The cost of apartments </h2><p>  Today, in the Mandarin LCD (St. Petersburg), a studio with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24-25 "squares" can be purchased for one and a half million rubles, for a one-room studio (from 38 to 46 "squares") you will have to give from two to two and a half million.  Two-room living space (52 sq. M) will cost 2 million 249 thousand. </p><h2>  LCD "Mandarin": reviews </h2><p>  What do those who have already purchased apartments, as well as those who are only considering the purchase option, say about this low-rise complex?  It is worth noting that the reviews are quite mixed.  At the initial stage of construction, everyone was worried that due to the fact that the project is a pilot project for IC Arcada, the developer will not be able to cope with the task.  Nevertheless, the delivery of the object earlier than the scheduled deadline not only confirmed the company's reputation, but also ‚Äúwiped its nose‚Äù to all those who did not believe in its strength.  That is, today everyone is absolutely calm and even waiting for the early commissioning of houses of the second stage.  People who have already purchased apartments in the Mandarin residential complex have no complaints against the developer.  On the contrary, everyone only emphasizes the quality of the work done.  Apartment owners like that they have really even walls, correctly wired electrical wiring, all emphasize the quality factor and attractive appearance of the entrance metal doors. </p>

    <p>  As for the location, the fact of having one‚Äôs own housing in the immediate vicinity of the royal palaces cannot cause anything but admiration.  Yes, there are those who are dissatisfied with the fact that the metro is far and there are no large supermarkets nearby, but no one hid this.  In addition, in St. Petersburg itself shopping and entertainment centers and metro stations are also not located in front of the entrance to each staircase.  So this is, by and large, nitpicking.  Especially considering the fact that you can reach Raketa shopping and entertainment center by car in ten minutes. </p><p>  As for the cost of housing, then everyone considers it quite acceptable.  So, by and large, the Mandarin residential complex can be considered an excellent place for those who would like to live close to magnificent historical and natural sights, but at the same time not far from the metropolis. </p>
