A modern <span>mosaic painting,</span> similar to a classic creation, has evolved to the level of home crafts, accessible to everyone.  Having given the lessons some free time, you will be able to create a wonderful masterpiece with your own hands. </p><p>  To work on such a work it is not at all necessary to have extraordinary talents and be a brilliant artist or designer.  Many mosaic paintings can be made using special kits that contain all the necessary materials and instructions. </p><h2>  What is a kit like? </h2><p>  For example, under the brand name "Snow White" such kits are produced in convenient tubes.  Their surface is covered with a protective film, and their light weight makes it easy to transport the packaging home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosaic picture" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/814255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Each pack depicts a specific mosaic pattern, the tools and parts for the manufacture of which you receive.  In this box you will find: </p><p>  - the basis on which the markup diagram is applied (on it you can easily recreate the desired image); </p><p>  - a set of mosaic particles of the colors you need; </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - special tweezers for work; </p><p>  - plastic containers for sorting "puzzles" to facilitate the search for what is needed; </p><p>  - Help that coordinates your actions. </p><h2>  The foundation is above all </h2><p>  "Snow White" - mosaic paintings that can be collected not only by adults, but also by children from 12 years old.  A convenient and intuitive diagram drawn on the basis greatly simplifies the work.  It is divided into many small multi-colored sectors.  Each of them shows a sign indicating the color of the part that needs to be placed in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosaic paintings" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/814256.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Such marking is much more convenient than digital.  The fact is that mosaic <span>paintings with their own hands</span> are created from a large number of shades.  If each of them were designated by a separate number, these numbers would be large and would not fit well in small squares.  With compact icons, this problem does not occur. </p><p>  Their decryption is under the scheme.  Its location simplifies the creative process, because the hint is always in sight.  And at the end of the work, this part of the canvas can simply be cut off. </p><h2>  Important Features </h2><p>  The surface of the base is lubricated with special glue and covered with a protective film.  Since the component fixing agent dries very quickly, the additional coating must not be completely removed.  Each time, getting to work, remove small fragments of the film and apply parts to the area freed from it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To make it more convenient for you to collect mosaic paintings, do not skip from one area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe canvas to another.  Better to move smoothly between opposing edges.  Even if the latch on the untreated area dries prematurely, you can replace it with a special <span>adhesive for plastic.</span>  Although this option will require more time and effort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snow white mosaic paintings" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/814252.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <p>  The mosaic details are very small.  But they are arranged in colors in small bags and containers, which greatly facilitates the work with this material. </p><h2>  Where to start? </h2><p>  DIY mosaic paintings are created as follows.  First lay the base on a straight, hard surface (table or floor).  Further, your main task is to fill each cell on the canvas with pebbles of the corresponding color.  Pour them a little into the containers and take out one at a time with tweezers.  One after another, put the details in the drawn squares. </p><p>  The details that make up the mosaic picture are very clearly cut.  Therefore, such ready-made sets are often called diamond.  After a certain part of the base is completely covered by them, you will see how the sun plays in the faces of each element.  Despite the fact that they are made of plastic, the rays of light are refracted in them and create a unique radiance. </p><h2>  How it's done? </h2>

    <p>  Sets of "mosaic paintings" are best to collect row after row.  It is recommended to start work from the upper left corner and move the square after the square to the end of the line, and then move on to the next.  But many lovers of handmade can not resist the temptation to lay out the figures on the diagonal.  What scheme is more convenient for you to do - you will understand when you get down to business. </p><p>  Collecting mosaics according to the pattern is a bit like drawing a picture by number.  The creative process in both cases must be divided into several sessions.  Each of them should last no longer than three hours.  Each time you will notice that your mosaic picture is going easier. </p><p>  The fact is that the skills necessary for this type of creativity are very easy to develop.  You will quickly remember the icons that indicate a particular color, and the need for peeping at the cheat sheet will decrease with each session.  Your movements will become faster and more coordinated.  Due to this, with each approach, you will cover the details of an increasing area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe base. </p><h2>  Additional design </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSnow White‚Äù - mosaic paintings, the canvases of which can be decorated with additional elements upon completion of work.  For example, many craftsmen glue their canvases to plywood and frame them with beautiful baguettes.  This operation is performed by specialists in art stores.  If you want to conduct it yourself, consult with a connoisseur what indentation on the canvas is best done from the edge of the frame.  As a rule, this number fluctuates around one centimeter or half of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosaic picture sets" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/814254.jpg" width="573"></div>

    <p>  The packaging of mosaic paintings does not indicate their level of complexity.  As a rule, it grows in direct proportion to the size of the canvas itself.  In addition to the main recommendations listed above for work, remember a few more features. </p><h2>  Do not forget! </h2>

    <p>  Firstly, if you make a mistake in the process of folding the mosaic, it will be very difficult to fix it.  Therefore, when gluing the details, you need to carefully monitor what color is required for a particular square.  To make your creation look neat, try to make the rows as even and uniform as possible. </p><p>  Secondly, getting started, be prepared for the fact that you will need a lot of effort to achieve your goal.  The fact is that the details in the mosaic are very small, there are a lot of them in the set.  Therefore, you must be as calm and focused as possible in order to do everything perfectly. </p><p>  Thirdly, never back down from the plan given by the scheme.  It makes no sense to show your creativity in this lesson, since there are exactly as many squares of a specific color in the box as the creators of the set intended.  If you want to replace one shade with another, you may simply not have enough material. </p><h2>  results </h2><p>  The process of collecting a mosaic picture can hardly be called simple.  But he will bring you a lot of pleasure when the first results of the work appear on the canvas.  Examining new finished fragments will make you joy and pride.  And the brilliance of details in the sunshine will add even more charm to the finished creation. </p><p>  Such sets are always very high quality and thought out to the smallest detail.  You can even collect them with your child, which will positively affect his fine motor skills, creativity, and ability to concentrate.  Another interesting option for creativity is a mosaic picture of rhinestones.  It sparkles even better than the standard ones and looks simply incredible. </p>
