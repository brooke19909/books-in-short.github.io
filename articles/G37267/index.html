If your phone ‚Äúuncomfortably‚Äù fell or you accidentally crushed it in your pocket (the object of our story will be the Samsung Galaxy S3), a glass replacement will be required immediately.  As a result, this kind of repair will cost the owner of the ‚Äúaffected‚Äù smartphone a decent amount (referring to the specifically mentioned model).  After all, the services of specialists are not a cheap pleasure, especially when it comes to repairing far from budget devices.  However, there is a less expensive way to restore a protective screen - to independently change a cracked case element.  Well, you will learn about all the subtleties and nuances of such a crucial event from the material presented below. </p><h2>  A little about the design feature of interest to us Samsung Galaxy S3 </h2><p>  Replacing glass on this model is a very time-consuming process, since the transparent security element is firmly glued to the display module.  To "remove" the front panel "painlessly", you need to try hard.  In service workshops, specialized equipment, the so-called separators, is used for such operations.  At home, it is much more difficult to implement the separation process.  Nevertheless, we are in a hurry to please you.  Subject to certain dismantling rules and relying on the invaluable experience of the determined and courageous, the project ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy S3.  Replacement of glass ‚Äùis quite feasible even with the hands of a person whose knowledge in technical aspects is equal to absolute zero.  However, we will not be silent, in the process of cosmetic repairs stipulated by us, the performer must be very attentive and extremely careful.  Let's not forget the main thing - a smartphone costs money! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 - glass replacement" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/1008002.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Preparatory phase: workplace </h2><p>  You will see the list of available tools a bit later.  Now let's stipulate what needs to be considered when organizing the workflow: </p><ul><li>  Lighting should be adequate, but not irritating to the eyes. </li><li>  There should be nothing more on the desktop. </li><li>  Nobody should distract you. </li><li>  Pleasant, and at the same time beloved music, let it become your second assistant. </li></ul><h2>  Regarding the dismantling tool and accessories of the Samsung Galaxy S3 </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself glass replacement is a very responsible process.  This will be said more than once, since this type of repair is really complicated in execution.  Therefore, before embarking on the immediate implementation of restoring the aesthetic primacy of the device, once again think about whether you can carry out your plan.  Decisive and courageous can significantly save on the services of professionals. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 do-it-yourself glass replacement" class="if" height="490" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/1008003.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  So, what do you need from tools in order to remove <span>broken glass</span> and install a new one? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Phillips screwdriver (with a very thin profile). </li><li>  Hair dryer with temperature regulator (industrial or household). </li><li>  Old bank card. </li><li>  Several plastic mediators. </li><li>  Special blade for prying off the sealed edges of the glass. </li><li>  A scalpel or a small pointed knife (certainly sharp). </li></ul><p>  By the way, as an encouragement: the owner of the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S3 glass replacement in Zelenograd will cost about 2000 rubles.  However, prices for this type of repair in other cities of the country may vary slightly.  In any case, if you purchase a new <span>protective glass</span> in a specialized store and install it yourself, then the benefit will be obvious (the price of a part varies depending on the quality of the product within 100-1000 rubles). </p>

    <h2>  Let's start with a simple: preparation for removing the glass </h2><ul><li>  Remove the rear protective cover. </li><li>  Disconnect the battery of the device. </li><li>  Take a SIM card and a memory card. </li></ul><p>  No need to unscrew the screws and remove the attachments.  The stiffer the design, the better. </p><h2>  Warming up the screen plane: a crucial moment </h2><p>  Repair of the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S3 device - replacing the glass separately from the module - implies the mandatory use of a hairdryer, since the protective element is firmly glued to the touchscreen of the device.  However, the touch navigation buttons located at the bottom of the phone are also firmly fixed using the above fixing substance.  As you know, the glue must be softened before you separate the glass from the module. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Turn on the hairdryer and adjust the discharge air temperature to the optimum mode (50-70 degrees Celsius). </li><li>  In a circular motion, holding the nozzle at a distance of 3-5 cm from the glass, warm the surface to a state of noticeable heat. </li><li>  Using a spatula or knife, carefully tuck out any of the upper edges of the protective element. </li><li>  Insert one of the trained mediators into the open lumen. </li><li>  Make at least three points of "undermining" the glass (in the upper part). </li><li>  Repeat the warm-up process briefly. </li></ul><p>  This is just the beginning of the Samsung Galaxy S3.  Replacing the glass further will require more painstaking efforts.  Be careful, and you will succeed! </p><h2>  Separation of glass from the display module </h2><ul><li>  When the protective element slightly moves away from the case and the screen, insert a bank card in the cleared gap. </li><li>  Slowly and very carefully, move the separating tool inward of the part toward the center until the edge of the credit card comes out on the other side of the display module. </li><li>  Warm up the adhesive systematically. </li><li>  Gradually, and most importantly, slowly, advance the bank card down the plane to the main navigation buttons. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 glass replacement in Zelenograd" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/1008028.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Attention: the sensor sensors (keys mentioned above) must be carefully separated from the glass until the dismantled part is completely removed.  Otherwise, there is a high probability of damage to the connection cable of the buttons, which means that a visit to the service center simply cannot be avoided.  However, you can always repair your Samsung Galaxy S3 (glass replacement), Tyumen city of residence, or another.  However, in our case this is not an option. </p><h2>  Cleaning the display module </h2><p>  After you manage to remove the glass painlessly, you need to remove the adhesive residue from the surface of the touchscreen. </p><ul><li>  The glue can be easily removed using a conventional window cleaner.  However, before using such a tool, you must make sure that its composition does not have aggressive substances. </li><li>  Normal microfiber will help you finish the gloss. </li></ul><h2>  Installing a new protective part </h2><p>  Glue the inner edges of the smartphone (around the perimeter of the screen) with <span>double-sided tape.</span>  Make sure that the fixing tape does not extend beyond the borders of the case frame and does not overlap the outer areas of the display module.  Position the part to be installed.  Remember that in the case of incorrect position of the glass with one hundred percent probability, dust and moisture will penetrate into the screen.  Agree, after such painstaking work, exposing the phone to the next risk of failure is, to put it mildly, a somewhat frivolous act. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 - SPB glass replacement" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/1008368.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  It is worth noting that repairing the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S3 (replacing glass): St. Petersburg is a city in which specialized workshops use almost factory technology.  That is, the new protective element is mounted using special glue, followed by ultraviolet treatment.  Of course, such a recovery scenario is possible at home, but only on condition that the contractor has the appropriate equipment and, of course, is not deprived of the proper experience. </p><h2>  No rules are impossible ... </h2><p>  You will be surprised, but a broken display or mechanical damage in the form of deep scratches is the result of unfavorable situations that are generally quite predictable, which means that all this (and much more) can be easily avoided if: </p><ul><li>  Transport the smartphone in a special case equipped with stiffeners. </li><li>  Do not carry the device in the back pocket of tight-fitting trousers. </li><li>  In crowded places (metro, minibus) hold the phone in your hand. </li></ul><p>  However, the human factor cannot be ruled out, and, as you understand, everything cannot be foreseen, and therefore be careful in any situation. </p>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion - a very useful tip! </h2><p>  Whether self-repair is advisable is up to you, and it depends on you how justified this kind of undertaking is.  And still the game is worth the candle!  In the event that your Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone needs a replacement camera glass, the solution is even simpler: unscrew the ten fixing bolts and remove the case frame. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy S3 - camera glass replacement" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/1008597.jpg" width="542"></div></h2><p>  On the reverse side of the removed part, it is necessary to unsolder the plastic holders, and only then subject the damaged protection element to the direct replacement process.  With such knowledge, you only have one thing left - to use everything in practice.  However, be wise and save wisely! </p>
