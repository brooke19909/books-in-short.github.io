    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  On the site of the dilapidated development of the city of Khimki, the developer <span>DENIZ-development</span> builds five six-story and four fifteen-story houses in several stages, as well as the necessary infrastructure.  The first high-rise of the Gorny residential complex (Khimki) has already been commissioned and is populated by residents.  The facades of all houses are faced with spectacular and strong pastel-colored ceramic bricks, which gives the complex an elegant look. </p><p>  All the necessary communications, an autonomous boiler room, a round-the-clock video surveillance system are connected to the houses.  The entrances are equipped with high-speed silent elevators, ramps, an intercom system and a concierge room.  The main decoration of the project were apartments with panoramic windows located on the upper floors of the buildings.  By the way, it is these apartments that are bought first. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of the <span>Gorny</span> residential complex, the Skhodnya microdistrict in Khimki was chosen.  The new microdistrict is located in an area with an excellent microclimate, as well as a developed infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  Proximity to the capital and all objects of its infrastructure boasts LCD "Gorny".  Responses of residents emphasize that from new buildings to the Moscow Ring Road only 15 km.  You can get to the capital not only by private car, but also by public transport without the slightest difficulty. </p><p>  If you travel by car, you can get to Moscow along the Leningradskoye Shosse.  Of course, this direction is busy, the traffic is dense, so car owners suffer from constant traffic congestion.  But in the near future the reconstruction of the Leningradskoye highway will begin, which is designed to improve the road situation.  Near the houses there is a <span>railway station,</span> from where you can get to the Leningradsky railway station.  Well, regular buses and minibuses will take you to the <span>Rechnoy Vokzal metro station.</span> </p><p>  The complex is located near Sheremetyevo Airport, which is why some residents complain of the endless noise from flying aircraft.  The developer foresaw this, so he installed modern double-glazed windows in each apartment.  This minimized the noise coming from the street. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The developer tried to choose a place with excellent ecology for the construction of the residential complex "Mountain".  Reviews of apartment owners are enthusiastic, many were bribed by the picturesque territory.  Excellent ecology of the complex is provided by the Khimki reservoir, the Sheremetyevo forest with an abundance of conifers.  Near the complex is <span>the Skhodnya River, the</span> project provides for the arrangement of the embankment, which will become a favorite place for walks and recreation for residents. </p>

    <p>  There are no harmful industries near the Gorny residential complex, which has a positive effect on the environmental situation.  All in all a great place to live. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer tried to create the most comfortable conditions for each resident.  That is why all the necessary infrastructure objects will appear on the territory of the complex: playing and sports grounds, areas for walking and recreation, bicycle paths, shops.  Moreover, the project provides for the construction of a kindergarten, school, as well as multi-level parking. </p>

    <p>  Residents of the rented house complain about the shortage of social infrastructure, especially kindergartens and schools.  But this phenomenon is temporary in nature, this shortcoming will soon be eliminated.  Not far from the complex, just a few minutes drive away are the largest shopping and entertainment centers where you can make all the necessary purchases and have a great time in the company of friends and relatives. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Apartments in the Gorny residential complex impress with a variety of planning solutions.  The choice of buyers offered options from 43 to 84 square meters.  All of them are rented ready to move in, that is, with a turnkey finish.  The walls and ceilings are painted with high-quality washable paint, the floors are covered with a class 32 laminate, electrical wiring is carried out, sockets and switches are installed, the bathroom has all the plumbing. </p><p>  The responses of the first residents emphasize that the finishing work was done efficiently.  The developer did not save on materials, installed plumbing of a European manufacturer.  The height of the ceilings is 2.65 meters.  In each apartment, the installation of interroom faith was made, a strong and reliable front door was installed.  Residents of the commissioned building emphasize the excellent heat and sound insulation properties of the finished apartments. </p>

    <h2>  Terms of purchase </h2><p>  You can buy an apartment in the residential complex "Mountain" on the terms of 100% payment within a week after registration.  The complex is accredited by the largest banks, therefore, a mortgage loan can be issued on favorable terms.  The minimum down payment is 20% of the price of the apartment.  The interest rates on the loan start from 11-12%, it is issued for a period of up to 30 years.  Some companies offer to purchase an apartment in Moscow on an installment payment basis until the object is completed.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to purchase housing in the Gorny residential complex by installments, which some buyers attributed to the shortcomings. </p><p>  A one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã38 to 50 square meters will cost from 3 192 000 rubles, a spacious two-room apartment - from 4 700 000 rubles, and a three-room version of an improved layout - from 5 800 000 rubles. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  LCD "Mountain" - a great option for buying real estate.  The responses of the first residents are generally positive: the developer managed to take into account the wishes and requirements of modern residents of the metropolis.  As the objects are commissioned, new infrastructure will appear on the territory of the complex, it will be landscaped and landscaped.  Moreover, an apartment here can be purchased on favorable terms. </p><p>  We strongly recommend that you take a closer look at the project, at least once visit the construction site. </p>
