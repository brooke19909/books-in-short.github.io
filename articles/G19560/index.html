This is precisely what makes the era of his reign unique.

Briefly, the table on the problem posed clearly shows the wide scope with which the emperor acted.  He seemed to have a hand in everything: he reorganized the army, government bodies <span>,</span> made significant changes to the social structure, economic sphere, diplomacy and, finally, contributed to the spread of Western European culture and lifestyle among the Russian nobility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Army Conversion </h2><p>  At the middle level, it is very important that students learn the basic facts of the topic “Reforms of Peter 1”.  Briefly, a table on this problem helps students familiarize themselves with the data and systematize the accumulated material.  Almost all of his reign, the emperor waged war with Sweden for access to the Baltic Sea.  The need for strong and powerful troops arose with particular urgency at the very beginning of his reign.  Therefore, the new ruler immediately began to reorganize the army. </p><p>  One of the most interesting sections in the topic under study is the “Military Reforms of Peter the Great”.  Briefly, the table can be depicted as follows. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Creating a new type of army </td><td>  Unification and training measures </td></tr><tr><td>  Recruitment system introduction </td><td>  Creation of schools, colleges </td></tr><tr><td>  Army rearmament </td><td>  Unification of the form, awards, medals </td></tr><tr><td>  Using new weapons </td><td>  Personal Merit Promotion </td></tr><tr><td>  Fleet construction </td><td>  Introduction of new charters </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  The Importance of Military Innovation </h2><p>  It shows that the emperor’s steps were dictated by the specific needs of his time, but many of his innovations continued to exist for a very long time.  The main goal of the reforms was to create a permanent and regular army.  The fact is that before there was the so-called local recruitment system: i.e.  the landowner came to the shows along with several servants who also had to serve with him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, by the beginning of the 18th century, this principle had become obsolete.  By this time, serfdom had finally taken shape, and the state began to recruit soldiers to serve from the peasants.  Another very important measure was the creation of professional military schools for the training of officers and command personnel. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peter's reforms 1 table summary" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1235203.jpg" width="220"></div></h2><h2>  Power Transformation </h2><p>  Practice shows that one of the most difficult topics is the “Political Reforms of Peter 1”.  Briefly, a table on this problem clearly demonstrates how deep the transformative activity of the emperor in government was.  He completely changed the central and local administration.  Instead of the <span>Boyar Duma,</span> which used to carry out deliberative functions under the tsar, he created the Senate on the model of Western European countries.  Instead of orders, colleges were created, each of which performed a specific function in management.  Their activities were strictly controlled by the prosecutor general.  In addition, a special secret fiscal authority was established to control the bureaucratic apparatus. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Reforms at the Center </td><td>  Local Government Reforms </td></tr><tr><td>  Creation of the Senate, Synod, collegiums </td><td>  Creation of provinces, provinces, counties </td></tr><tr><td>  The creation of the prosecutor general </td><td>  Introduction of new officials: governor, governor </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  New administrative division </h2><p>  No less complicated is the topic “State reforms of Peter 1. Briefly, the table on this issue reflects the cardinal changes that have occurred in the organization of local government.  Provinces were created that were in charge of the affairs of a certain area.  Provinces were divided into provinces, and those, in turn, were divided into counties.  Such a structure was very convenient for management and met the tasks of the time in question.  The governor was at the head of the provinces, and the governor was at the head of the provinces and counties. </p>

    <h2>  Changes in industry and commerce </h2><p>  A particular difficulty is often caused by studying the topic “Economic reforms of Peter 1. Briefly, a table on this issue reflects the complexity and ambiguity of the emperor’s activities in relation to merchants and traders, who, on the one hand, sought to create the most favorable conditions for the development of the country's economy, but at the same time acted almost serfdom methods, which could not contribute to the development of market relations in our country.  <span>The economic activity of</span> Peter Alekseevich was not as effective as the transformation in other areas.  At the same time, this was the first experience in the development of trade along the Western European model. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Industry creation </td><td>  Government measures for economic development </td><td>  Trade </td></tr><tr><td>  Creation of manufactories, ascribing peasants to them </td><td>  Pursuing a policy of mercantilism </td><td>  The introduction of a <span>state monopoly</span> on a number of goods </td></tr><tr><td>  Permission to purchase peasants for manufactories </td><td>  Protectionism </td><td>  Forced relocation of merchants to St. Petersburg </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Transformations in the social structure </h2><p>  A simpler topic is “Social reforms of Peter 1. Briefly, a table on this issue clearly demonstrates the fundamental changes that have occurred in Russian society of the time studied.  Unlike his predecessors, the emperor introduced the principle of distinction in the military and state spheres, depending not on the tribal affiliation, but on personal merits.  His famous “Table of Ranks” introduced a new principle of service.  From now on, a person, in order to get a promotion or rank, had to achieve any success. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Nobility </td><td>  Peasantry </td><td>  Third estate </td></tr><tr><td>  Mandatory Service Introduction </td><td>  Introduction of poll tax </td><td>  Unification of urban population according to the European model </td></tr><tr><td>  Promotion based on personal service </td><td>  The final enslavement of the peasants </td><td>  Providing cities with self-government, dividing citizens by workshops and guilds </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  It was under Peter that the social structure of society was finally formed.  The main pillar of the autocracy was the nobility, which replaced the clan aristocracy.  The emperor’s successors also relied precisely on this estate, which indicates the effectiveness of the measures taken. </p><p>  You can complete the study of this problem by summing up.  What significance did the reforms of Peter 1 have in Russian history?  The table, a brief summary on this topic can serve as an effective means of summing up.  Regarding social transformations, it should be noted that the ruler’s measures met the needs of his time, when the principle of parochialism was outdated, and the country needed new personnel who would have the necessary qualities to fulfill the new tasks that the country faced in connection with the Northern War and Russia's access to international arena. </p><h2>  The role of the emperor's transformative activities </h2><p>  The topic “Basic reforms of Peter the Great”, a table, a brief summary of which is an important component in studying the history of Russia in the first quarter of the 18th century, should be divided into several classes so that students have the opportunity to properly consolidate the material.  At the final lesson, it is necessary to summarize the material covered and indicate what role the transformations of the first emperor played in the future of Russia. </p>
