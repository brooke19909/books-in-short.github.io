    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Despite the general positive picture, there are also some shortcomings in the work of the Ic Green Palace 5 * hotel (Antalya).  Reviews of tourists indicate the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  almost all the rooms of the hotel have slippery <span>marble floors,</span> and therefore there is a big risk of slipping and falling (especially in the dining room, where they constantly pour something); </li><li>  the hotel has some kind of selective attitude towards tourists - only European guests can bring suitcases to a room; </li><li>  you have to take places on the beach in the early morning, otherwise you will then have to sunbathe on a towel; </li><li>  the children's pool is too cold water, and the heating function is not provided; </li><li>  there is no protection on the beach, and therefore everyone uses it as a common one (as a result - dirt and crowding); </li><li>  there is no special coating on the playground, and therefore it is very dusty in the heat, and after the rain there are puddles and dirt; </li><li>  not very conscientious cleaning of the rooms - the floors do not wipe and do not vacuum; </li><li>  on the tables in the restaurant, not tablecloths, but some paper napkins that quickly get wet and torn; </li><li>  when you check into the room, you may not find the promised fruit and wine baskets, and therefore do not hesitate to remind employees of this defect; </li><li>  even in cool weather, the pools do not include heating; </li><li>  the impression is that all guests are deliberately lodged in poor rooms, so that later they knock out an extra charge for changing the room; </li><li>  Due to a poor hood, the bathroom constantly smells damp. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p> Very popular with tourists is the Ic Green Palace 5 * hotel (Antalya).  Room categories from "Standard" to "VIP" are distinguished by luxurious decoration, as well as an increased level of comfort.  It has all the necessary amenities.  Particularly noteworthy are the built-in extra beds, which absolutely do not take up space during the day when folded vertically, and at night provide a full sleep (unlike the usual folding beds).  But the quality of cleaning is poor.  And her schedule is not very convenient - on some days the maids come after dinner. <br><br>  Ic Green Palace 5 * hotel (Antalya) can brag of a beautiful green territory.  Here you can find more than three hundred species of exotic plants, including bamboo, as well as date and <span>banana palms.</span>  There are many walking paths, benches, gazebos, as well as original garden decor.  Artificial ponds deserve special attention, in which water lilies and lilies grow, fish, ducks and swans swim, which you can feed bread after breakfast.  A unique atmosphere has been created here, which allows you to relax from the urban environment and enjoy nature. </p><p>  There are also serious shortcomings in the Ic Green Palace 5 * hotel (Antalya).  Guest reviews indicate that the beach is very small, dirty and groomed.  In addition, due to the lack of protection, everyone comes to him, and therefore from private he turns into a public one.  Also worth noting are flaws in nutrition.  In this area, the hotel is clearly in crisis.  Previously, meat and fish dishes, as well as a variety of delicacies, were served in huge quantities, but now it is mainly chicken, crab sticks and a herring from a supermarket.  The range of dishes is created due to the same type of vegetable salads. </p>
