The poet is buried before entering his native village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bashinform.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Postcard dedicated to the poet" class="if uuid-2648975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98396/2648975.jpg"></div><h2>  Awards and Prizes Nazar Najmi </h2><p>  As a well-known poet, Nazar Najmi has a large number of awards and prizes.

As already mentioned above, many of his works are put to music and are very popular.  The most striking talent of Nazar Najmi is seen in his poems.  He is the author of sixteen poems.  Moreover, almost all of them are unique, the poet tried to take motives from the life of the Bashkirs to show the reader the whole originality of the life of the Bashkir people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nazar Najmi Corner" class="if uuid-2647124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98396/2647124.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the poems have been translated into Russian and very loved by readers, while the rest, who have not yet reached the Russian reader, are still waiting in line to become loved by the public.  The poet himself, in turn, did not remain in debt and translated many Russian verses into the Bashkir language, making Russian culture a little closer to the Bashkir reader.  During the life of the poet, a three-volume collection of his works in the Bashkir language was released, which also speaks of his great popularity and people's love for his works. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="vlI1sEpqkiQ" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlI1sEpqkiQ" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/9/8/1/5981.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  People often underestimate the importance of regional writers.  They preserve the culture of small nations.  We know many famous writers who played a big role in preserving the culture of their peoples.  Their distinguishing feature is that they write in their own language.  Such writers: </p><ol><li>  Nazar Najmi. </li><li>  Rasul Gamzatov. </li><li>  Ahmedkhan Abu Bakar. </li></ol><p>  There are still many writers - immigrants from small nations, you will not list all.  However, these three played the biggest role in preserving folk culture.  Let us dwell on Nazar Najmi.  He is a cultural hero of his people, in the book "History of Bashkir Literature" Nazar devoted the main role.  The full official biography of Nazar Najmi in the Bashkir language is also written there.  This only shows the attitude of the Bashkirs themselves to the poet.  And in this article we presented a brief biography of Nazar Najmi, but only in Russian, we can hope that after reading the article you will want to study his works more deeply in order to feel all their beauty. </p>
