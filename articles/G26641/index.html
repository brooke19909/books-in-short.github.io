    <h2>  The origin of the resort </h2><p>  The formation of Yalta - the merit of Count M.S.  Vorontsov, who cherished the idea of ​​turning the southern coast of Crimea into an elite vacation spot for the Russian aristocracy.  The count enthusiastically engaged in road construction, competently distributed coastal lands, established maritime traffic.  By the 70s of the 19th century, Yalta had become a fashionable resort, possibly thanks to real estate acquired by the imperial family in Livadia. </p><p>  Luxurious summer houses, fashionable hotels, restaurants, shops, hospitals grew in the city like mushrooms after the rain. </p><p>  The beauty of Yalta, its popularity does not decrease over time.  Rather, on the contrary, those who have visited this resort at least once are looking forward to a new meeting. </p><h2>  Sanatorium-resort base </h2><p>  Another famous S.P.  Botkin talked about the healing effects on the human body of the special Crimean air.  However, in tsarist times, recovery in Yalta was available only to nobles and wealthy bourgeois.  After the revolution, all the chic palaces, villas and villas were nationalized.  Already in 1921, thousands of workers took over Soviet Yalta.  Sanatoriums and boarding houses, quickly converted from the estates of the Russian aristocracy, quickly redeveloped to treat a large number of vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pensions Yalta all inclusive" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849348.jpg" width="600"></div>  From all over the Soviet Union, people with problems with the respiratory system and musculoskeletal system were drawn into the region.  By the beginning of the Second World War, the boarding houses of Yalta, and there were 42 of them together with rest houses and sanatorium-type health resorts, could receive several thousand vacationers at the same time.

Residents of the region managed to maintain a unique sanatorium base, which allows them to successfully treat diseases of the respiratory system, blood circulation, tuberculosis and the nervous system. </p><p>  The number of health resorts, including children's ones, host year-round guests, is currently approaching sixty.  Most of them are involved in the treatment and prevention of all of the above diseases.  The sanatoriums “Eagle's Nest”, “Russia”, “Black Sea”, “Golden Lighthouse”, “Miskhor”, “Belarus” and many others have an impeccable reputation.  Some chose a narrow specialization and achieved significant success in it.  So, the Dolossy sanatorium chose pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by diabetes as its profile.  "Surf" successfully fights with an asthmatic component. </p><h2>  Boarding houses </h2><p>  However, not everyone who comes to the Crimea, seek to spend whole days in the doctor’s offices, taking all kinds of procedures.  Pensions in Yalta provide the opportunity to unlimited enjoy the sea and the sun, while doing a comprehensive recovery of the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yalta sanatoriums and pensions" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849356.jpg" width="600"></div>

Air conditioning is now an indispensable attribute of a quality vacation, and the availability of a constant water supply also plays a role in choosing a place for a vacation. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  And despite the fact that for the most part Yalta pensions are housed in former noble mansions built over a century ago, the level of comfort in them meets the most stringent requirements.  Malachite, for example, is located in the very center of the city on the territory of the old estate.  Several years ago, the building was overhauled, new sewage and water supply systems were installed, and new furniture was purchased.  The interior of the rooms is consistent with European mid-range hotels.  This health resort offers its guests only breakfast, in addition, treatment can be arranged in the Kuibyshev sanatorium.  By the way, almost all city pensions offer this kind of service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yalta resorts with pool" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849361.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <p>  Yalta, "all inclusive" in which is far from being as popular as in Turkey, still offers this kind of food.  Crimean all inclusive is much more modest than Turkish and most often provides for three meals a day on the menu or on the buffet system.  The health resorts “Kiev”, “Massandra”, “Energetik”, the “Seasons” boarding house built in 1999, and many others work on this principle. </p><p>  Most resorts have their own beach and green areas.  Having the opportunity to choose, tourists prefer to go on holiday to the <span>boarding houses of Yalta with a swimming pool in</span> order to be able to enjoy swimming even in bad weather.  Without making a mistake in your choice, you can recall every day spent in the Crimea long after the end of your vacation. </p>
