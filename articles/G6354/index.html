Overview of instruments for detecting hidden wiring</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The indicator (hidden wiring tester) is intended primarily for searching the voltage circuit.  Moreover, he is able to detect various electromagnetic radiation.  The power of the perceived signal depends on the indicator model.  As a rule, the device is capable of detecting electromagnetic radiation with a power of up to 0.4 mW. </p><p>  Another function of testers is the search for metal objects.  At the same time, it is possible to detect them only at a certain distance from the device.  Typically, this maximum distance can be 55 mm.  In this regard, conventional metal detectors are more powerful.  Checking the integrity of the network can be carried out with a resistance of not more than 50 ohms.  Some models are available with the ability to determine the polarity in the wires.  This can only be carried out with direct current. </p>

    <h2>  Detector panel </h2><p>  On the front panel of the indicator there is an operating mode switch, as well as a regulator.  It is designed to search for metal objects.  Additionally, on the side of the device there is a button for turning on the flashlight, which will help to work in a dark room.  On the other side of the indicator there is a contact probe and a movable sensor, which is assembled.  In the lower part of the device next to the product marking is a contact plate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Testing the device and performing calibration </h2><p>  Checking the performance of the indicator is quite simple.  First of all, you must configure the device switch.  As a rule, he is able to occupy three positions.  In this case, it must be set in the middle.  The second step is to adjust the probe.  To do this, use the contact plate, which is located at the bottom of the indicator.  Next, the probe is placed at an angle of exactly 90 degrees.  Only then can you press the contact electrode on the side of <span>the device.</span>  If the wiring tester is working properly and the voltage from the batteries is coming in, the display will instantly flash.  Additionally, in many models, an intermittent signal sounds. </p><p>  To calibrate the indicator, the switch is set to the first position.  After that, the plate moves away, and the probe is installed at an angle of 180 degrees.  Next, set the sensitivity control.  To this end, the wheel must be turned up to the very end.  After that, the display system in the device is triggered.  For calibration, you should start turning the wheel in the opposite direction and wait until the light goes out.  In this case, the sound signal should stop. </p><p>  In conclusion, you need to leave the sensitivity control and take any metal wire.  The indicator of the hidden wiring to it must be brought at a distance of at least 30 mm.  If the LED lights up again, the device has successfully passed calibration. </p><h2>  Indicator usage </h2><p>  How to check the wiring in the apartment?  To search for an alternating current circuit, the first mode on the device is used.  You can set it using the switch on the side of the device.  In this case, the movable sensor must be in the assembled state.  The exact location of the chain should be determined from the outlet.  During operation, it is important to hold the tester against the wall with the front. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you deploy the device, you need to change the sensitivity settings.  This can be done using a special controller.  To search for electromagnetic radiation in a circuit, a second mode is used.  In this case, the movable probe should also remain assembled behind the plate.  First of all, the signal is checked at the outlet.  Next, the device should be removed from it and monitor the indicator.  If there is no sound signal during operation, then there is no circuit in this place.  It is additionally important to consider that the device will display a signal with a capacity of not more than 0.4 mW. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the device </h2><p>  When the cable tester is in close proximity to the wiring, a resistor trips.  It connects in the device with a static electricity chip.  To transmit the signal to the unit there is a special antenna, which is presented in the form of a copper wire.  Ultimately, the signal reaches the emitter.  In some models, an additional sound indication is installed.  In this case, the resistance of the resistor is perceived only up to 50 ohms.  The coils in the device are charging from the battery. </p><h2>  Bosch 120 indicator </h2><p>  Hidden wiring in the wall with this indicator is detected very quickly.  The detection depth is 30 mm.  The microcircuit in this model is installed in the ‚ÄúDD1‚Äù class, and the LED is of the ‚ÄúH1‚Äù type.  In total, the device has three channel transistors.  In general, the current transfer coefficient is quite high. </p><p>  A clear disadvantage of the indicator is excessive sensitivity.  At the same time, it is sometimes very difficult to adjust the regulator.  Inverter type power supply.  In general, the model turned out to be compact and convenient and well suited to repair wiring.  The standard set of the device includes one 9 V battery, two markers, as well as a protective case.  There is a model "Bosch 120" in the market of 5000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Review of the DMF-20 Defort tester </h2><p>  Tester "Defort DMM-20" stands out for its compactness.  There are no protruding parts on the case.  In this case, the electrical wiring in the wall is detected very quickly.  In general, this device is easy to use, and there is only one mode.  With it, you can determine the voltage at a shallow depth. </p><p>  There are two LED indicators in this device.  The first lamp lights up when the network is at a distance of more than 20 mm.  In this case, the second indicator will work only in the immediate vicinity of the wiring.  Sound alarm in this model is installed.  The length of the device is 200 mm, the width is 80 mm, and the thickness is 35 mm.  The Defort DMM-200 cable tester weighs 18 kg, and it will cost the buyer 1100 rubles. </p>
