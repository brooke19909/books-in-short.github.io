Every second smartphone owner has this app.  This is due to the fact that it can be used for personal communication, data transfer, and for business.  However, it is not always convenient to use it on smartphones, it is more pleasant to use the messenger on the iPad, holding a large screen in your hands.  But how does the user install Vatsap on an iPad, because this messenger is incompatible with this type of device? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.applepit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install vatsap on ipad" class="if uuid-3197795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45958/3197795.jpg"></div><h2>  Cause </h2><p>  Activation of the application takes place by the attached phone number.  This is a prerequisite for the security of data transfer.  To install Vatsap on your iPad, you need a dialer on your device.  However, there is no such function on it, although theoretically the tablet supports the function of receiving SMS.  As a result, the developers of the iPad noted that this program is incompatible with their development.  But this does not mean that you can not circumvent the requirements of the messenger. </p><h2>  Install WhatsApp </h2><p>  So how to install "Vatsap" on the iPad, if it is not possible to activate the program?

Let's consider some of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This technique involves the installation of an unofficial version of the program, so it is impossible to guarantee the safety of correspondence.  To activate the application, you must download it.  To do this, find "WhatsApp" on the Internet, but not on the official website, download it, install it on your device.  Then the application must be launched by entering the phone number and entering the verification code. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technsolution.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install vatsap on an ipad without an iPhone" class="if uuid-3197792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45958/3197792.jpg"></div><h2>  Jailbreak Utility </h2><p>  And "Jailbreak" how to install "WhatsApp" on the iPad?  One of the most popular tablet utilities developed by Apple is the Jailbreak program.  It has unlimited access to all corporation file systems.  With this utility, you can simply run Vatsap on the tablet.  However, before installation, it should be noted that the use of such software is not approved by the corporation, although its use in the Russian Federation is not prohibited at the legislative level. </p><h2>  Activation Features </h2><p>  And the user himself how to install "Vatsap" on the iPad and where to download it?  Download the messenger from the official site will not work, as it is designed exclusively for smartphones.  But this is not a reason to be upset, because there are always workarounds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The easiest way to install the application is to use the web version of the application.  To do this, go to the developer's site and open the program using the online version of the application.  The activation principle will be the same as the activation of WhatsApp on a computer - using a QR code.
