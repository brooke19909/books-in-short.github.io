What does this concept mean? </p><p>  A deposit is money located in a bank with the aim of obtaining further benefits in the form of interest that accrues on the amount of the investment.  What does it mean to open a contribution to a third party?  This is the name of a deposit placed in a bank, the benefit of which is received not by the depositor himself, but by the one to whom the account is drawn up according to the concluded agreement.  And since the depositor and beneficiary are different people, there are special conditions for processing such a contribution.  Consider how to replenish such a deposit and whether it is possible to reissue it to another person, what percentage of the return can be received.  And also compare the terms of deposits in favor of third parties of two large Russian banks: PJSC Sberbank and PJSC VTB. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="contribution to third parties" class="if uuid-3171381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/3171381.jpg"></div><h2>  How is the deposit opened? </h2><p>  According to paragraph 5. Article.  7 of Law No. 115-FZ of August 7, 2001, a deposit in the bank must be made personally.  But banks began to interpret this wording a little differently.  Some institutions insist on the mandatory presence of the person on whom the deposit is opened.  Others willingly enter into a contract with a new citizen in favor of a third person.  For example, if citizen A. wanted to open a contribution for citizen B., then A.'s personal presence is mandatory, because citizen B. is not a contributor, just an agreement is in his favor.  Under this procedure, according to the civil code, no power of attorney is required for the actions taken. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  When a third party contribution is needed </h2><p>  In banking terminology, the recipient is the one in whose name the deposit is open. </p><p>  Contribution to the name of the Recipient may be required in different situations: </p><ul><li>  the depositor is away, and his relatives need money; </li><li>  at the time the contract expires, the depositor's passport will be invalid; </li><li>  deposit as insurance in case of loss of documents; </li><li>  special gift; </li><li>  an asset for children, associated, for example, with education, weddings, buying a home; </li><li>  You can use the deposit as a money transfer; </li><li>  when buying real estate, this is often used because  no fee for transferring funds; </li><li>  for a guaranteed return of the insured amount, as  the contribution will be reimbursed to each investor. </li></ul><p>  For example, you can make a contribution to relatives or friends to ensure safety, if an insured event occurs.  Suppose the total amount of the deposit is 2,800,000 rubles, upon the occurrence of an insurance event the recipient will be paid only 1/2 the amount, because there is a maximum limit on payments, which is equal to 1,400,000 rubles.  And if you place part of the amount on yourself and the other on your loved one, then you will receive a refund for the entire amount of the contribution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="contribution to third party banks" class="if uuid-3169667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3169667.jpg"></div><h2>  Deposit Processing </h2><p>  To open a deposit in favor of third parties, banking institutions set different conditions for depositors.  Some banks allow you to make a choice for a deposit from any current deposit offer.  Some banks are limited to one or two programs.  The list of documents required to conclude a contract is also different for everyone.  According to the legislation, a bank employee does not need additional documents to make a deposit to a third party;  it is enough for him to clarify the surname, name and patronymic of the beneficiary.  There are cases when a bank institution requested a photocopy of a child‚Äôs birth certificate or his passport to make a deposit on him.  Such a seemingly inconvenience will protect you from possible errors in writing personal data or in the form of issuing funds to namesakes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Contract </h2><p>  The conclusion of a deposit agreement in favor of a third party proceeds according to the usual procedure: </p><ul><li>  The depositor turns to the bank branch, where he was interested in the proposal to open a deposit. </li><li>  To conclude an agreement, he necessarily takes with him an unexpired passport of the Russian Federation with a valid registration. </li><li>  To avoid mistakes when concluding an agreement, take photocopies of your birth certificate or passport of the person you are opening a deposit with you. </li><li>  In the contract, indicate the recipient.  At the time of conclusion of the contract, you are a depositor, and you deposit money into the account. </li><li>  When you sign the contract, deposit money into the account at the cash desk of a banking institution. </li><li>  One copy of the signed contract is transferred to the depositor. </li></ul><p>  When signing the contract, you should carefully study all the terms and conditions that the banking institution offers you.  Pay attention to the point on the possibility of replenishing this deposit by unauthorized persons, since some banks restrict this action.  In this case, in order to replenish the account, the permission of the beneficiary will be necessary.  Most often, banks allow depositors to manage the deposit until the registered owner applies for rights to their deposit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsbtc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="contributions to third parties" class="if uuid-3169679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3169679.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I replenish the deposit? </h2><p>  Each bank has established rules for replenishing a deposit account.  If the contract does not stipulate any special comments, then the account can be replenished by any person, whether it is the depositor himself, the recipient, or even a stranger.  To do this, you must contact the nearest branch of the bank where the contract was concluded, present documents indicating the full name of the recipient and the correct account, and then make money through the cashier of the banking institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Online </h2><p>  Many banks offer to use the services of an online bank or ATM to save the time of the depositor.  The currency of the open deposit should be taken into account: if it is not rubles, then in this case a third-person power of attorney will be required.  Such a rule is legal and absolutely legitimate.  If the account is in rubles, a power of attorney is not required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.pockit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="contribution to third party features" class="if uuid-3169666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3169666.jpg"></div><h2>  Which bank approves third party deposits? </h2><p>  In our country, not all banks support registration of deposits for other citizens.

If you have rubles or dollars, you can use the programs ‚ÄúSave‚Äù, ‚ÄúReplenish‚Äù, ‚ÄúManage‚Äù, and if you plan to deposit in euros, then ‚ÄúSavings Account‚Äù with a rate of 0.01% per annum is suitable for you.  If you are a senior citizen, then in this bank you will receive the largest percentage on ‚ÄúSave‚Äù and ‚ÄúReplenish‚Äù deposits, while the initial amount will be minimal.  To complete all procedures, you must contact any branch of Sberbank PJSC. </p><p>  If the depositor and the recipient are in different cities, the latter must contact the nearest office and write a statement about the transfer of funds.  Within three days, the recipient will be able to issue money.  If the deposit term has ended, and the funds remain in the account, then the conditions of the contract continue to apply.  You can withdraw money on the day the deposit is completed through the Sberbank Online mobile application, simply transfer it to another account.  The number of deposits is not limited.
