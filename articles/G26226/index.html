But it came into operation operating twenty-two years earlier, at the end of 1966.  And then it was called "Zhdanovskaya".  In honor of this prominent functionary of the Stalin era, the entire administrative district was called at that time where the station was opened, now known to everyone as the Vykhino metro station.  And for almost half a century it has been ultimate in this direction.  This continued until the metro line stepped behind the Moscow Ring Road and advanced towards the region.  This happened in the fall of 2013.  And today the Vykhino metro station is on the stage between Ryazansky Prospekt and Lermontovsky Prospekt stations.  The launch of a new section of the metro line significantly improved the entire <span>transport infrastructure</span> in the south-east of Moscow and actually included whole areas located beyond the Ring Road in city life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro vykhino" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/310204.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h3>  Vykhino metro station, architectural and engineering features </h3><p>  The appearance of the former Zhdanovskaya metro station was greatly influenced by the historical era in which it was put into operation.  This period went down in the history of Soviet culture as a "struggle against architectural excesses."  Just a cursory glance at the modern Vykhino metro station allows us to make sure that in this section of the front in 1966 the struggle was crowned with complete victory.  It is simply impossible to detect any architectural excesses here because of their complete absence.  The appearance of the station is made in the style of bare constructive functionalism.  This is an open ground station with small concrete visors above the platforms.  Only the simple fact that it was the last station of this type in the entire Moscow metro can please here.  On it, the "era of the struggle against architectural excesses" ended successfully.  And in the history of metro construction, this station has become a clear example of how not to build. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The metro station &quot;Vykhino" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/310201.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h3>  Metro "Vykhino".  Working hours and binding to urban infrastructure </h3><p>  The station operates in standard time mode.  It is open for passengers at half past five in the morning, and closes at one in the morning.  Every day, an intense flow of passengers passes through the platforms of the Vykhino metro station.  This is due to the fact that it is located in a rather lively place.  Here, passengers transfer to various types of land transport.  In addition to the railway platform of the same name, the Vykhino metro station is the final stop of many bus routes heading both to the city and to the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro vykhino working hours" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/310202.jpg" width="496"></div>  From <span>the station's platforms</span> , access to the streets of Red Kazanets, Veshnyakovskaya and Khlobystova.  In addition to large residential complexes, not far from the station there are many business and administrative structures, commercial enterprises and entertainment establishments.  With the opening of traffic along the metro line beyond the Ring Road, business and commercial activity in the entire area that runs to the Vykhino station has significantly intensified.
