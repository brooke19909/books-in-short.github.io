    <p>  In addition to the well-known Beeline, MegaFon and MTS, we also have Tele2.  Customer reviews indicate that this service provider also deserves special attention.  Thanks to its interesting tariff plans, wide coverage area and various promotions, the company is very loyal to its customers.  Therefore, it is not surprising that now it serves more than 35 million subscribers throughout Russia. </p><h2>  History </h2>

    <p>  The activities of <span>"Tele2" began (feedback from</span> subscribers of that time can confirm this) back in 2003.  The start was given by a Swedish commercial group, which poured funds into the creation of a new mobile provider in Russia.  The Moscow Region was the first region for Tele2 as the most promising from the point of view of running a successful business.  In the future, of course, other regions were connected.  After 2 years, the company's subscriber base totaled 3 million people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The company truly showed its initiative and became innovative due to the introduction of high-speed Internet connection technology 3G / LTE.  It happened very recently, literally in 2013/2014.  By offering these services, the operator was able to increase its user base by several million subscribers. </p><p>  As indicated on the official website of Tele2, the company‚Äôs coverage is currently operating in 64 regions of the Russian Federation (of which 59 have Internet connections).  In addition, the operator can boast of launching the country's first 4G network in the Moscow metro. </p><h2>  Concept </h2>

    <p>  Interestingly, all the company's services are divided into several categories for greater clarity of how they are offered.  So, there is a section ‚ÄúTariffs‚Äù, where a person can connect a package of calls, messages, Internet data to his mobile;  as well as ‚ÄúServices‚Äù, where you can select some one-time option.  In turn, these sections can be further broken down into options designed for communication, entertainment, messaging and other tasks. </p><p>  For now, we note what one-time options a subscriber using <span>Tele2</span> services <span>(Moscow)</span> can connect to himself <span>.</span>  Tariffs we will describe in more detail a little further. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  So, the options for communication are probably the most popular with this operator.  This includes a spam filter, caller ID (as well as an option to hide your number), control over all expenses, the ability to know who and when called you, hold, call forwarding, caller blocking, conference call in collective mode, "Tele2 "-calls and more.  The company‚Äôs website has more detailed descriptions of each of them, so here we will not waste time on this.  In general, by the name of the service you can guess what is meant.  Some of them are available by default, while others should be connected separately. </p><p>  The ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù category includes dating, a newsletter portal, finding friends on a map, installing music files instead of beeps, and more. </p>

    <p>  So, what do subscribers offer in ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù by connecting to the indicated tariffs? </p><p>  The basic plan is Black.  It is logical that the subscriber reviews describing "Tele2" call it the most simple: it is suitable for subscribers who are satisfied with a minimum.  The option makes it possible to make free calls within the network, as well as 2 gigabytes of mobile traffic.  As a bonus, the package provides 150 SMS messages.  The cost of the tariff plan is 99 rubles. </p><p>  At the ‚ÄúVery Black‚Äù tariff, the volume of available services is noticeably larger.  Internet traffic here doubled, and also connected a package of 400 minutes for free calls to all numbers in Russia.  The tariff price is 299 rubles, the number of messages has increased to 400. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúBlackest‚Äù package following it is 10 GB of traffic and 1000 minutes for calls and messages.  This option is available to Tele2 subscribers, the Moscow region for which is set as their native region.  Some customer reviews from other areas indicate that they have a slightly different tariff structure, so it may differ in our case.  The cost of the package is 599 rubles. </p><p>  Super Black offers twice as many features - 2000 minutes of calls;  as well as 15 GB of Internet.  Its price is 1199 rubles per month.  This is the whole set of integrated tariff plans that are allocated for the company's subscriber. </p>

    <p>  ‚ÄúOrange‚Äù and ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù are special rates.  The first makes it possible to call all numbers within the region at a price of 1 ruble per minute;  the second provides 7 GB of Internet traffic and calls to all numbers at 1.8 rubles.  for 299 rubles (meaning monthly payment).  "Tele2" positions the last package as intended for working with routers and modems. </p><h2>  Customer Reviews </h2><p>  Of course, knowing the cost of services and the amount of data provided is important when working with any operator.  However, most of all about how well the company provides its services, we will be told feedback. </p><p>  First of all, their authors evaluate the coverage served by Tele2.  This is important for the reason that it directly affects the quality and availability for the communication subscriber.  The more developed the operator‚Äôs infrastructure, the higher the quality of the services provided.  This refers to mobile towers and regions in which their signal is available.  On this issue, there are no complaints against the operator - indeed, in cities and towns where the provider‚Äôs coverage area is marked on the map, the signal is quite strong. </p><p>  Another question is the service provided by the operator.  In this regard, of course, there are also negative reviews.  Some customers complain that they haven‚Äôt received the settings for a long time (Tele2 promise to send automatic parameters within a minute, while in reality it takes several hours);  there are complaints that the subscriber is not sent an activation code for his new number.  There are a lot of similar stories - apparently, the problems are associated with the active growth of the operator, the expansion of his base.  In all such cases, the company's consultant calls back and asks to clarify whether the problem is resolved. </p><p>  The third important point in the work of any provider is the price.  In the policy of tariff formation, as well as in how the payment is organized, Tele2 really succeeded.  You can judge this, at least, by those profitable options that we described above. </p><p>  Indeed, it is difficult to find more affordable tariffs in the Russian market of communication services.  Even harder is to see their combination with a high level of service. </p><h2>  Conclusions about the operator </h2>

    <p>  Today it is believed that the Tele2 company can become an excellent alternative to the usual three brands in the domestic market.  This is something new and interesting, something that allows you to make mobile communications more accessible.  The more such players appear in the telecom business, the more the quality of communication increases and the price of it falls. </p><p>  Therefore, if you have been using the services of your operator for a long time and notice that it is becoming less and less profitable, pay attention to Tele2 (Moscow).  We presented the operator‚Äôs tariffs above - they really can be called attractive.  Therefore, it is possible that the services of this company will interest you more. </p>
