The information in this article will help you, here you will find answers to all your questions about this.  All options and methods have been tested by many people, and each of them is convenient and effective in its own way.  For example, two SIM cards on one Tele2 number - is this possible?  Of course yes.  As well as on MTS, Megafon and other operators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.topnomer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM card of different sizes" class="if uuid-3193989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/141226/3193989.jpg"></div><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  To begin with, the mobile operator does not give its subscribers such an opportunity at all.  Even if you try to make a fraud by acquiring a duplicate of your SIM card and inserting it into another phone.  In this case, the SIM card will simply be inoperative.  In general, this whole procedure will be completely ineffective. </p><h2>  What to do? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pngtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM card anonymous" class="if uuid-3193998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/141226/3193998.jpg"></div><p>  Your mobile operator in any case will not give an answer to this question.  No one does this, and usually companies do not provide such services to their customers.  Therefore, the only way to install two SIM cards on one number is to invent your own method.  Of course, there are ready-made solutions to such actions, and in this article they will be disassembled.  To do this, you need to download a special application from the App Store or Google Play.  It will allow you to use two SIM cards on one or two phones at the same time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Emotion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="redd.com.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM card from a mobile operator" class="if uuid-3193999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/141226/3193999.jpg"></div><p>  The client who installed this application can not only communicate with anyone who is interested in him, but also make calls and send different text messages to other users.  And it is worth emphasizing that all users of this application can easily carry out such operations, even if the subscriber to whom the call is made is not registered in the eMotion system.  And here you can say an even more wonderful thing: the call will be made even if the SIM card is not inserted in your phone. </p><p>  The most important thing that makes the application work so efficiently and harmoniously is the use of binding to a phone number.  You bind them as you like, and they work completely over the Internet.  Therefore, when you make a call to another person, your phone number and all other information will be surely displayed.  However, this only happens if the subscriber to whom you are making a call or writing a text message is in your phone book.  And it is worth mentioning once again the most important advantage of this application: calls are made even when the SIM card is not inserted into your mobile device.  This can not be repeated if you own a regular cell phone that does not have such an application. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Is it possible to have one MTS number for two SIM cards?  Of course yes.  And what is the principle of work?  All action takes place through one application, it is called eMotion.  The first action is this: you need to take your main, first SIM card.  Next, you just need to take and install this utility on your mobile phone.  In it, you can easily and free to install a second SIM card that you insert into your mobile phone.  And the second slot you should "hammer" is not a regular SIM card with a phone number, but a SIM card with the Internet.  It should be noted that this only works if your cell phone has two slots for such cards.  If not, nothing will work. </p><p>  Two SIM cards on one number is not so convenient and effective.  Yes, you can make calls and write text messages to other users without the Internet and delay.  However, it will be much more difficult for you to carry out the same actions.  Call notifications will be sent to your phone in e-mails.  And if the calls you receive are very important, it can be difficult to call back the person who called you.  Or perhaps you will not be able to contact at all and will constantly call back to each other in the hope of still talking. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sim cards" class="if uuid-3194006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/141226/3194006.jpg"></div><p>  Payment for the usual installation of the eMotion application is exactly zero Russian rubles.  Also there is no monthly fee for all services.  Everything that is carried out in the application: calls, text messages and so on - also happens completely free.  The entire fee is taken from incoming calls.  If you somehow manage to pick up the phone and even notice this call, then you will be charged 80 kopecks per minute of conversation.  However, this is only a fee for talking with those people whose mobile operator is the same as yours. </p><p>  If the subscriber with whom you are talking uses another operator‚Äôs services, then they will take twice as much - one ruble 60 kopecks.  It is worth emphasizing right away that if you take the package for free minutes of calls, this bonus will not apply to this application.  And the whole board will continue to be implemented.  For sending SMS messages to other users, there is no charge at all.  The only requirement for users of this application is Internet access.  It is, of course, paid.  Everything else is almost free. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  This service has been operating since the distant 2008.  At the time of 2019, it is already very much improved and revised.  Now eMotion exists not only for individuals, but also for entrepreneurs.  The latter option is different in that it has more functions, there is a fee for some services, and the application is really created for legal entities that are engaged in any business activity. </p><p>  The service provides an opportunity to create a telephone connection in a couple of hours, which was not even dreamed of 15-20 years ago.  After all, then there were no smartphones and new applications that would allow people to receive calls very quickly and, of course, have two SIM cards for one number.  Then the entrepreneurs did not even dream of making their business easier and making it independent.  They hired hundreds of people who took calls and were responsible for them.  It is worth emphasizing that this application is famous for the fact that it almost does not charge for telephone communications. </p><p>  Only a little money for calling other subscribers.  The main difference between this application and competitors is a single balance, which is installed on one SIM card.  There will be no confusion and any problems.  How to make two SIM cards on one number?  Just download the eMotion app. </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="polit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SIM cards" class="if uuid-3194007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/141226/3194007.jpg"></div><p>  You can independently conduct office telephone communications.  Next, you can configure the communication equipment, and then make calls both independently and for free, and redirecting them to your number for a small fee.  You can also use two SIM cards on one number, and this is called multi-channel.  Very convenient, isn't it?  In general, this service is really needed by any entrepreneurs and businessmen whose business is based on calls and applications. </p>
