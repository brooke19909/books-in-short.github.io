Our people prefer to relax in the "fours" and "fives", because in hotels of these categories there are always excellent accommodation conditions, fantastically varied and tasty food, wonderful service.  In the line of popular five-star hotels there is also Club Phaselis.  Kemer - the city near which this complex is located - is considered one of the best Turkish resorts with an ideally developed infrastructure of the tourism business, shopping, and sights.  This fact, of course, will be useful for those who decide to go on vacation to the "Phaselis Club" (Kemer), because getting from the hotel to the city will not be difficult.  But many, resting here, do not leave the hotel at all, because it has everything that the soul may desire. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Club Phaselis Hotel (Kemer) is located in the popular resort village of Goynuk, on a small peninsula.  The sea surrounds it on three sides, on the fourth - a huge forest park and Taurus mountain range.  In the line of coastal hotels, the Club Phaselis is the last from Goynuk and Antalya, but the first from Kemer.  It is located quite secluded.  The nearest "neighbors" from it are within 2-5 km.  For some tourists this is a plus, for others - a minus.  An excellent road runs past the complex, along which dolmushi run every 15 minutes.  For $ 2, they can go home to Kemer, about 7 km away, or for $ 1 to the center of Goynuk, which is only 2 km away.  <span>Antalya Airport</span> is 45 km from the hotel.  It takes about an hour to get to the transfer provided by the travel agency, as tourists are usually brought to other hotels along the way.  For lovers of attractions, the Phaselis Club is also an excellent choice.  Kemer is an amazing city with ancient history, and, of course, there are many interesting places worthy of attention.  For example, only 12 km from the hotel complex are the ruins of ancient Phaselis, and 50 km away is the ancient Olympos, where you can also see Mount Chimera with always burning lights. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists vacationing at the Phaselis Club (Kemer) leave reviews about the hotel rather mixed.  Some consider it wonderful and certainly want to return there.  Others do not advise anyone to rest there.  If you study the comments, we can conclude that the impressions of people directly depend on the work of the maintenance staff, which often changes in this hotel.  One comes across responsible workers who are perfectly performing their duties, while others - irresponsible.  Although, in fairness, we note that the level of "stardom" of the hotel obliges a lot, and therefore, the choice of personnel must be approached with all responsibility.  And now we will pass directly to the advantages and disadvantages of the complex we are considering.  So what did the guests notice? </p>
