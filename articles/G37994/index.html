    <h2>  Golubitskaya village - where is it? </h2><p>  Golubitskaya is located 9 kilometers from the wonderful and beautiful southern town of Temryuk.  It itself is located 55 kilometers from the well-known numerous health resorts and sanatoriums of the resort city of Anapa.  Many vacationers love to leave reviews.  Golubitskaya is noted in them as a very conveniently located village between two settlements.  After all, Anapa is located on the Black Sea coast, and Golubitskaya, as we have already said, on the Azov coast. </p><h2>  A little about the page </h2><p>  A person who has never come to this village after reading reviews about vacations in Golubitskaya will surely want to personally enjoy the beauties of the local landscapes, breathe plenty of life-giving air and buy his own in the waves of a not always calm sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golubitskaya village reviews" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20675/464579.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Golubitskaya is a quiet small village, and in the summer, when crowds of vacationers who want to comfortably and usefully spend their long-awaited vacation fill it, it becomes noisy and festive.  It is not worth worrying about the future place of residence here.  Already before entering Golubitskaya, you can see a lot of advertising posters and banners inviting you to stay in cozy recreation centers, and in the village itself you can not help but pay attention to luxurious hotels and houses immersed in greenery and flowers, which also offer convenient and comfortable accommodation. </p><h2>  Listen to feedback </h2><p>  At these recreation centers, in hotels and guest houses, vacationers often leave a variety of reviews.  Golubitskaya - how remarkable this village is, whether you liked to relax here and what interesting places you managed to visit, you can learn from these responses.  Let's get acquainted with some of them. </p><h2>  Sharing impressions </h2><p>  Many vacationers do not visit Golubitskaya for the first time.  There are those who only come here every year.  The owners of guest houses are becoming almost relatives for them, because cordial hospitality is a hallmark of these people.  I must say that in such houses there are all conditions for a comfortable and dignified existence: hot and cold water, a dining room with all the kitchen utensils necessary for cooking, clean comfortable rooms with a refrigerator and a TV.  But it seems that hardly anyone will watch it, the resort is not at all up to it.  The convenient location of the house: the sea is a ten minute walk, good shops, local markets where you can buy fruit at a reasonable price - all this, of course, gives a feeling of bliss and tranquility.  Here you will not find eternally hurrying anxious people, cars do not rush at tremendous speed, so you should not particularly worry about road safety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in golubitskaya reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20675/462733.jpg" width="500"></div>

Reviews about Golubitskaya, whether good or not, are made up of how you relaxed here, whether you got an adequate level of comfort, and, of course, how much money you spent during your stay.  Satisfied travelers in such houses leave the most positive feedback.  It is nice to know that people spend time comfortably, get maximum pleasure, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãunforgettable impressions, and most importantly, for little money.  They also advise everyone to visit Golubitskaya. </p><h2>  How to have fun in the village </h2><p>  As it turns out, most visitors have the brightest and most pleasant memories of their holidays in Golubitskaya.  The reviews that they leave in special books with hotel administrators clearly show this. </p><p>  Missing the long sayings about comfortable living in the luxurious apartments of an expensive hotel, we will tell you how, from the point of view of an ordinary family, you can have fun in the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about the rest in Golubitskaya" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20675/462739.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The main thing why numerous holidaymakers seek these lands is, of course, to improve the health of their children.  Bathing in sea water and staying in the life-giving air, even if only for some two weeks, favorably affects their further well-being for a whole year. </p><p>  The Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov in Golubitskaya is clean sandy beaches, warm water, a flat <span>gentle beach.</span>  There is where to show imagination to children, building intricate figures and castles on hot sand.  With joyful screeches and screams of pleasure, you can rush across the surface of the sea on a ‚Äúbanana‚Äù and ‚Äútablet‚Äù, soar for several minutes like a bird on a paraglider, show courage by skiing on a jet ski or an ATV.  Do you want extreme and unforgettable impressions?  Feel free to go to the Amazon waterpark located here.  Steep slides with safe bends, convenient places for sunbathers, all kinds of water rides - all this awaits visitors of this entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Golubitskaya" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20675/462741.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mud lake </h2><p>  Numerous reviews speak of how vacationers on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov have fun and successfully spend time.  Golubitskaya is famous not only for its clean beaches and amazing atmosphere, one of its attractions is a healing mud lake.  In his search, one does not need to make any movement on transport, since it is located within walking distance from the central beach.  This healing mud, which contains elements of bromine and iodine, has a positive effect on people suffering from musculoskeletal diseases.  Not only adults, but also children love to frolic in this thick heavy liquid, knowing that it is simply impossible to drown in it.  And then, substituting your body for the scorching rays of the southern sun, wait for it to dry completely, at heart without losing hope that this procedure will be useful for the body. </p><h2>  Exchange of impressions </h2><p>  The <span>private sector</span> enjoys wide popularity in the village of <span>Golubitskaya.</span>  Reviews of residents in this area are also very diverse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golubitskaya Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov reviews" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20675/464585.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  Almost all houses that surrender during the holiday season are equipped with convenient car parks, since people often come here from all over Russia to travel by personal transport.  Thus, a lot of amenities are created: there is no need to carry heavy trunks, to travel independently to the interesting and interesting places this side is famous for, and you can also take home barrels of excellent Krasnodar wine, which, by the way, can be bought in every village step. </p><p>  Late in the evening, many bars and restaurants open in Golubitskaya, which can be easily found by the music coming from there and the tantalizing smell of barbecue.  By the way, it should be noted that, if you are not fans of night parties, choose housing away from such establishments, so as not to turn your long-awaited vacation into something unbearable and unimaginable. </p><h2>  What else can I see? </h2><p>  Golubitskaya finds the most flattering reviews among older vacationers who come here on vacation with their grandchildren: after all, the sea is nearby, and there is not as much noise as in large resort cities.  As for the purchase of products, there is also nothing to worry about: there is a popular and familiar to everyone Magnit, several markets where you can always choose a delicious piece of meat.  If you don‚Äôt want to cook, there are a lot of dining rooms and cafes at the services of vacationers in the village, where you can have a very cheap lunch. </p><p>  A trip with children to the Nemo Dolphinarium will be a pleasant pastime in a series of fast flying days, and a visit to a crocodile farm will be an unforgettable event for both adults and children.  Believe me, this sight is worth it.  To see so many toothy at the same time is unlikely where else you will happen!  In only one room, decorated under an African pond with shores, there are about twenty of them: these are large crocodiles and their cubs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golubitskaya private sector reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20675/462764.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  It is decided, we are going to rest! </h2><p>  Well, did the village of Golubitskaya impress you?  Of course, you will write your reviews about it, having gone to rest at least for a couple of weeks.  And do not forget to take pictures of all the best moments of every day spent there, so that in the long, cold winter, looking at familiar pictures, once again plunge into the atmosphere of serenity and tranquility of this nice and cozy place.
