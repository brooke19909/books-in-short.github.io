It is necessary to place ads on online and offline boards, tell a potential client about housing, along the way, find out how decent a person is talking to you, as well as prepare and show housing and much more. </p><p>  The contingent in this market is so diverse that it is very, very difficult to determine a normal tenant at first glance.  Moreover, the demand for housing for rent is very large.  He is sought after by young couples, established families, shift workers, as well as the notorious Chinese and Vietnamese.  The risk of running into serious trouble is great, even if you want to rent an apartment for rent.  Fast, expensive and hassle-free - this is what any homeowner wants.  But not always, but rather, as a rule, it turns out exactly the opposite, if you approach this matter, as they say, through the sleeves. </p><p>  So, we will analyze useful and time-tested tips on how to quickly rent out an apartment, not get lost in papers, find good tenants and what you should pay attention to first of all in this difficult enterprise.  For a more visual picture, we will consider everything in stages. </p><h2>  Market research </h2><p>  To rent an apartment quickly and profitably, first of all, you need to analyze the real estate market and get acquainted with the proposals of competitors.  The easiest and most affordable way is to surf themed websites.  First of all, of course, it is worth paying attention to the pricing policy of your region / district, and then already studying housing photographs: layout, furniture, the presence of some household appliances, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.unpakt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="renting an apartment" class="if uuid-2671623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2671623.jpg"></div><p>  The speed of renting an apartment, as well as the cost is affected not only by its appearance, but also by its location.  For some customers, the cosmetic component is not at all important, but only the accessibility of one or another key place.  If a good infrastructure is organized nearby with shops, transport interchanges, kindergartens, schools and entertainment centers, then you can quickly rent out an apartment at a very decent cost. </p><h2>  Market features </h2><p>  Most of the thematic sites distribute housing by price categories: luxury, economy and business class.  In order to quickly rent out an apartment, it would be useful to identify it in one of these categories, and not toss an ad into sections such as "Other" and "Else." </p><p>  A thorough study of the market will allow you not only to determine the cost of housing, but can also indicate a fairly accurate portrait of potential tenants.  The latter is true, as a rule, if you are going to rent an apartment for a long time.  So to speak, daily or even hourly customers can be very different, and here, as such, analysis of the clientele is practically useless. </p><h2>  We are preparing housing for delivery </h2><p>  If you have defined your housing as an economy class, then there is no reason to go bankrupt for expensive repairs.  This is impractical, because the invested funds will not pay off for a long time with the low cost of rent.  But to leave torn wallpapers, cracked glass and a rusty bathtub is also not worth it, because in this case the maximum you can count on is guest workers or other ambiguous personalities, as well as tiny amounts in your pocket and problems with the police. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nahid.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment for a long time" class="if uuid-2671621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2671621.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to quickly rent an apartment and not at a bargain value, then the first thing you need to do is to remove all the accumulated trash.  After that, it will be clearly out of place to check the plumbing and the electrician for its operability.  In this way, you will not protect the tenant from unnecessary problems, but also yourself, because the flooded neighbors from below will not add karma to past or future residents. </p><h2>  Repairs </h2><p>  If the pipes look extremely unpresentable, then you can buy an ordinary PVC panel and attach it to a problem place.  It is inexpensive, and installation is extremely simple.  Going broke on something more capital like a box with decoration is also unprofitable, especially if you yourself are not going to live there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.materiaux-produits.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment" class="if uuid-2671620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2671620.jpg"></div><p>  If the wallpaper (in unfurnished housing) is torn or somehow damaged, it is better to re-paste them.  The same goes for linoleum and ceiling whitewash.  The costs here will not be so large, but they will pay off with the increased cost of rent.  Even with minor cosmetic repairs, housing will change for the better, which will have the most positive effect on finding a clientele and allow you to quickly rent out an apartment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Furniture </h2><p>  If you plan to rent economy housing with furniture, then here, again, you do not need to go broke into expensive sets.  To rent an apartment, the necessary elements will be quite enough: a closet, sofa, armchairs, bedside tables, a table and chairs.  Having a kitchen set will add to the desire to rent your home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stylecaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment faster" class="if uuid-2671624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2671624.jpg"></div><p>  So you should worry about the necessary household appliances.  First of all, it is a refrigerator with a washing machine.  You can also leave a simple, but still a TV.  The installation of expensive equipment in a budget apartment will increase its cost only slightly. </p><p>  Stuffing housing with household appliances is also not worth it, especially if you rent it out for a long time.  In most cases, tenants when moving already have their minimum, which they are quite comfortable with.  In addition, many do not want to mess with the "master" equipment, because when a breakdown often conflicts and other problems arise. </p><p>  If you have a high-class apartment at your disposal, then there is already no need to save on household appliances of the first and second necessity.  They rent such housing, as a rule, people who are not poor and accustomed to comfort, in case of breakdowns / damage to equipment, are ready to pay the indicated amount. </p><h2>  A photo </h2><p>  The second thing that pays attention after the cost of the apartment is the visual part, that is, the photographs presented.  That is why this step is very important and largely determines how quickly you find tenants. </p><p>  To quickly rent an apartment without intermediaries, you must competently show in the photo all the advantages of your home.  You can, of course, turn to professionals who will find all the necessary angles, and if you wish, they will even ‚Äútake photos‚Äù where necessary, but this, again, is an extra waste. </p><p>  It is best to photograph in sunny weather in good light.  Do not skimp on the pictures, click in each corner, and therefore you will figure out what to leave and what to remove.  Be sure to photograph the bathroom, kitchen and hallway.  Some go to small tricks, adding furniture and some other interior items that will not give up, but the apartment at the same time looks much more comfortable and presentable. </p><h2>  Photo Features </h2><p>  Experts do not advise doing this, but some tenants do not pay attention to the lack of a vase on the table or even the table itself.  If you want to rent an apartment through an agency, then the realtor upon arrival will take the necessary pictures himself. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the photos must be of good quality.  It is best to use an intelligent camera or, in extreme cases, a smartphone with a very good camera.  A soapy picture of the interior of your apartment will not add to it either price or popularity. </p><h2>  Ad </h2><p>  Here we set out to write a real masterpiece, and without regard to the number of characters.  It is better to list absolutely all the facts about your apartment, than to miss something, afraid of a bloated text.  That is, every moment you need to not just mention, but paint in detail. </p><p>  Note when you last made repairs, whether there is a balcony, whether the bathroom is combined, what is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãeach room, including the pantry, - all this must be indicated in your ad.  If the creative impulse does not come, then you can view similar detailed and beautiful texts by editing them to suit your conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="24." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment quickly and profitably" class="if uuid-2671622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2671622.jpg"></div><p>  It will be clearly not out of place to mention the nearby key infrastructure elements: a hypermarket, a kindergarten, a school, a cinema, an ice rink, etc. It is also worth talking about your neighbors, so that for a future allergic resident a catwoman or a dog lover on the site would not be a surprise. </p><p>  In addition, you should definitely indicate the requirements for tenants.  Here they are very different, ranging from gender, age and nationality to the sphere of employment.  Of course, it is better to rent an apartment to non-smokers and residents without animals.  But alas, there are very few such people, so many have to deal with, so to speak, problem contingents and do not have to sort out much. </p><p>  First of all, it is necessary to place an ad on top resources like Avito and thematic sites in your region.  And do not forget about the photo - it is better and as much as possible. </p><h2>  Inspection </h2><p>  You need to communicate confidently, and therefore it is better to make a pretentious list of tenants in advance.  That is, how many people, whether there are children, pets, we smoke, drink, dance at night, etc. Practice shows that at the same time you can negotiate with three or four, but no more potential customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiplinger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to quickly rent an apartment" class="if uuid-2671626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2671626.jpg"></div><p>  You need to allocate about an hour of time, best in the evening (but not at night) or at lunch.  As a rule, 15-20 minutes are enough for one client.  In addition, not everyone comes to a meeting.  It will be useful to note that tenants also agree with several owners of apartments and when finding the best option from a competitor, they may simply not call you to refuse to meet. </p><h2>  Contract </h2><p>  After the ideal or close to the tenants were found, it was time to formalize all the relationships on paper.  The contract itself can be downloaded on the same "Avito" in the thematic section "Documents".  The forms there are more than enough for almost all occasions, so there is plenty to choose from, it will not be difficult to find exactly your best option. </p><p>  The contract must be printed in duplicate and filled in blank columns.  The document must necessarily reflect: meter readings, passport data of the tenant and lessor, as well as the amount of the security deposit if you rent an apartment with furniture and appliances. </p><p>  It will also be useful to photograph / scan the passport of the responsible tenant and take a couple of phone numbers (home, work, mothers, fathers, aunts).  By doing this, you will once again insure yourself and protect yourself from unnecessary problems in case of a sudden ‚Äúdisappearance‚Äù of tenants. </p><h2>  Realtors </h2><p>  In the case of realtors, the whole process is significantly simplified.  If you contact a serious company that responsibly approaches all issues and cares for your reputation, then all you need is to visit the office once and filter out the options offered by the realtor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.realtor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rent an apartment through a realtor" class="if uuid-2671625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2671625.jpg"></div><p>  Specialists themselves will come to your apartment, take high-quality photos, submit advertisements, fill in the requests of job seekers and give you all the necessary information.  In addition, after the approval of the tenant, the employees will draw up an agreement where all your interests will be taken into account and insurance will be taken care of at the same time. </p><p>  Reliable companies have rich experience, as well as the availability of sensible personnel, so the only thing that is required of you is to voice your requirements and pay money for the services provided.  Everything else will be done by professionals and professionally. </p><h2>  Underwater rocks </h2><p>  It is also worth warning that in this market there are a lot of scammers and so-called black realtors who can fraudulently save you not only money, but also an apartment.  Therefore, everything related to housing is better to give into the hands of trusted professionals. </p><p>  Before going to the company that attracted you, it would be useful to check its history, the availability of a license confirmed by tax authorities, as well as reviews of real customers.  It is best to look at the responses on thematic forums, and not on the website of the company itself, because in the latter there will be only praises without specificity and negativity. </p><p>  Some reputable companies provide a number of additional services, such as preparing reports for the tax for you on a rental, collecting fees in your absence, etc. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  There are no unnecessary or optional items in our article.  If you give up on one of them and trust the Russian "maybe", then you can be very sorry.  Well, if you simply do not get paid, but when you find defeat and chaos upon arrival at your apartment, then grabbing your head will be too late. </p><p>  Also, there are cases when residents flatly refuse to evict from the apartment.  Well, if the contract was correctly drawn up, then the situation will be decided in just a couple of days.  But if not, you will have to talk to the police, the court and evict stubborn guests in the presence of bailiffs. </p>
