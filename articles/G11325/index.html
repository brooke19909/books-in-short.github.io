Reviews about the domestic manufacturer are generally positive.  An indisputable advantage of the brand is that in gadgets the balance between quality, price and functionality is optimally maintained.  In the presented novelty, the developers tried to implement the relevant characteristics, complementing them with a presentable appearance.  This model is a simplified version of the smartphone BQ-4072 Strike.  The prefix Mini indicates reduced dimensions.  You should not expect any innovative developments, such as a frameless screen, unlocking with a glance, etc. from this device.  However, some functions that were previously found only in the middle segment are already being implemented in ‚Äústate employees‚Äù. </p><p>  What did the developers decide to attract the attention of customers?  What hardware "stuffing" is equipped with the BQ-4072 Strike Mini?  The answers to these questions and not only can be found in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq 4072 strike mini reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2190417.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Design, dimensions, ergonomics </h2><p>  Thanks to the spectacular appearance, the <span>phone BQ-4072</span> Strike <span>Mini</span> receives praise.  First of all, users focus on the metal case.  The material is high-quality, owners should not worry about surface deformation and the formation of scratches.  An indisputable advantage is that even during active use, without using covers, the phone does not lose its attractiveness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, buyers were pleased with the range of colors.  There are five interesting solutions in the line.  Gray and silver are perfect for connoisseurs of classics.  Representatives of the beautiful half of humanity prefer the pink specimen.  Gold and blue options look no less interesting.  This diversity indicates that the manufacturer is trying to guess every potential buyer, giving him a wide choice. </p><p>  Talking about the metal body of the BQ-4072 Strike Mini, in the reviews the owners focus on the presence of plastic inserts.  They are located below and above.  If you don‚Äôt take a closer look, it‚Äôs not immediately possible to distinguish them.  They are decorated to match the color of the main surfaces.  The transition of materials was performed perfectly - there are no gaps. </p><p>  What can be said about the dimensions of the phone?  The width and height are small (126 and 66 mm), quite consistent with the gadget with a 4-inch screen.  The situation is a little worse with the thickness.  This model can not claim to be narrow, since this parameter is more than 11 mm, which is considered quite large by modern standards. </p><p>  The layout of the controls follows the standard layout.  The lock and volume keys are on the right side.  At the top are two microUSB and audio connectors.  Ergonomics users have no comments.  All elements are located in such a way that they are in quick access.  People with an average palm size can control functions with one hand. </p><p>  An unpleasant precipitate appears when you look at the front panel.  Most users find the screen frame a bit thick.  Also, the lack of illumination of the control panel is considered a disadvantage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone bq 4072 strike mini reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2190418.jpg"></div>

It is thanks to him that developers can reduce the size of the gadget.  However, not all such an opinion.  There are frankly negative reviews on the Web.  The BQ-4072 Strike Mini is ideal for the first category of customers.  Its 4-inch screen is made using TFT technology, which is not distinguished by impeccable quality.  Such a matrix does not shine with wide viewing angles and high detail.  However, with regard to the latter indicator, with a small diagonal, pixelation is practically not visible. </p><p>  Comments from the owners also arose in the brightness range.  It is not enough for comfortable work on the street, especially in sunny weather.  Unfortunately, the developers were not surprised by the high resolution.  The maximum peak of possibilities is limited by the quality of 800 √ó 480 px. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq mobile bq 4072 strike mini reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2190420.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The optics used in the BQ-4072 Strike Mini, reviews were not very flattering.  The main camera is based on a 5 megapixel sensor.  The developers supplemented its characteristics with autofocus and flash, which allow you to get a more or less high-quality frame.  You can change the settings in the application.  There are several additional modes.  The clearest pictures are taken in the daytime.  In poor lighting conditions, blurring and noise are visible in the photo. </p><p>  The front-facing module with a resolution of 2 megapixels is mainly used for video communication.  Selfies, of course, can be done, but the frame is obtained, frankly, not very.  Detailing is low, color rendering is weak. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq 4072 strike mini 8gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2190419.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Performance and software </h2><p>  It is unlikely that anyone expected a powerful hardware platform in the phone for 3,000 rubles, so the buyers did not feel disappointment when they learned that the smartphone has a simple Spreadtrum SC7731 processor with a frequency of 1200 MHz.  But the amount of RAM pleasantly pleased.  Now at the disposal of users 1 GB.  Of course, this does not provide record performance, but for simple games and simple applications it is quite enough. </p><p>  Customers are also interested in what size of the built-in storage in the BQ-4072 Strike Mini?  8 GB!  Owner reviews indicate that even an undemanding user will have such a volume, so it is recommended to install a flash card. </p><p>  But what is the indisputable advantage of this smartphone is the version of the operating system.  Owners can enjoy the latest (seventh) Android.  Few could count on such software on the phone for 3,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The maximum number of negative reviews BQ-4072 Strike Mini received due to a weak battery.  Autonomy is provided by a 1500 mAh battery.  Definitely, this is not enough for a smartphone that will be used not only for calls.  If you connect to the Internet during the day, take pictures, correspond with messages, then you will not be able to do without recharging.  Unfortunately, the phone does not have a special economic mode, so in order not to be left without a connection, you will have to purchase Power Bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone bq 4072 strike mini reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2190422.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone BQ-4072 Strike Mini: reviews </h2><p>  What is the opinion about the simplified version of the Strike gadget?  The smartphone, definitely, justified all the money invested in it.  Given the low cost (up to 3000 rubles), the owners boldly highlighted its advantages.  These include a metal case, small size, flawless assembly, the current version of the OS.  But the most significant drawback was the battery life. </p>
