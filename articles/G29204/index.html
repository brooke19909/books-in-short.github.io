The group consisted of ten people, six students (including the head of the group - Igor Dyatlov), three graduates and one instructor of a neighboring tourist base.  They left Sverdlovsk by train on January 23.  The last bastion of civilization for young people was the geological village of Second North.  By the way, here, on January 28, one of the participants in the hiking trip experienced health problems and was forced to return to Sverdlovsk.  Looking ahead, let's say that this saved the life of Yuri Yudin.  He lived to venerable years and died in April 2013.  The remaining nine members of the group moved out of the village on skis on the way to the Holatchahl and Otorten mountains.

And they were supposed to return on February 12th.  The first actions to organize exploratory work were undertaken <span>on February 19,</span> 1959.  The tent was found <span>on February 25</span> empty and strangely cut several times on one side.  The bodies of the campaign participants themselves were found even before the beginning of May.  At different distances from the tent, with strange signs of death - some had terrifying injuries to their skull or chest, others froze in the snow, one of the members of the group literally had no tongue (with a clenched jaw, which indicated that it could not be animals).  Moreover, they all very quickly left the tent literally without clothes, what were at that moment.  Actually, the reasons that forced tourists to run away or leave (and traces hundreds of meters from the tent indicate that they didn‚Äôt escape at all) from their shelter at night and in cold weather are the central issue of this whole story, in which Dyatlov‚Äôs group got into it.

    <p>  The cause of death of children for more than fifty years is hidden from the general public.  Moreover, there is not a single coherent theory into which all the features of the incident fit: a strange <span>skin color</span> in people found after a while, body position, the absence of obvious traces of strangers, of unknown origin craniocerebral and chest injuries, strange incisions of the tent, it‚Äôs not clear where they came from traces of radiation on the sweaters of two guys.  And I must say that there are already several dozen versions of these.  Among the most developed: those associated with a <span>technological disaster,</span> criminal (tourists could be victims of high-ranking military poachers, escaped prisoners and even foreign spies), an avalanche, <span>fireballs</span> and many others.  But not one of the versions explaining the death of the Dyatlov group today is capable of logically and consistently describing all the events of that day.  And especially the circumstances that forced tourists to leave the tent.  At the same time, supporters of a number of conspiracy theories are convinced that the truth about the death of the Dyatlov group is known to the government, which at one time harbored the real causes of the tragedy.  Investigator Lev Ivanov, who was running the case back in 1959, could not reveal the true picture of the incidents (or could not tell?).  In conclusion of the case to this day, there is a strange formulation that the death of the Dyatlov group was caused by an unknown elemental force that tourists could not overcome. </p>
