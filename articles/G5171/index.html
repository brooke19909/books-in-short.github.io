    <p>  The company appeared in the post-war period, when Germany was just beginning to recover from its own defeat.  The well-known Liebherr became famous for his talent and work in two areas: technology and management.  Thanks to a reasonable and calculated approach, we can confidently say that the merit of the doctor is the current prosperity of the company, as well as the opening of about 90 companies that focus around the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is important to note that the first steps towards the establishment of such a successful enterprise was 1938, when the young genius had to become the heir to the family business.  It was at that moment that Hans realized that it is extremely important to study the needs of people and provide them with what they need so much, and even make money on it. </p><h2>  General description Liebherr CTP 2521 </h2><p>  This is a cost-effective option that is affordable for many people.  The price of the Liebher refrigerator of this model averages from 17,000 to 25,000 rubles, which is very beneficial for European quality.  The model is freestanding, it cannot be used as a built-in technique, so in this case it will become interesting to the adherents of a classic refrigerator.  The freezer is on top, which is quite convenient for older people to use.  Indeed, in this case, you will not need to bend down to get the products. </p>

    <p>  The case is made of white plastic.  The refrigerator is equipped with an electromechanical type of control.  As for energy consumption, it refers to type A +++.  Thus, the manufacturer stated that the cost of the refrigerator requires only 171 kW per year.  In fact, this is a pretty good indicator, so you don‚Äôt have to go broke on electricity bills. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  This is a medium-sized refrigerator with a total volume of 235 liters.  Of these, 191 liters fall on the volume of the refrigerator compartment, and 44 - on the freezer.  This is a great option for a family.  The weight characteristic of Liebherr CTP 2521 does not exceed 55 kg, which makes its transportation much easier.  The shelves inside are made of thick glass, which helps withstand a considerable load.  Each housewife can safely put even pots on the shelves. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator libher instruction" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/2040691.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Equally important is the ability to change the position of the doors.  In this case, the equipment can be put anywhere in the kitchen.  After all, if necessary, the door can open to the right or left.  Noise is an equally important indicator, especially for families where there is a small child.  In this case, the noise height does not exceed 40 dB.  This is an indicator that can be compared with a calm voice.  The parameters of the refrigerator are 55 x 63 x 140 cm. Since the height is less than one and a half meters, it can even be placed under a hinged kitchen set. </p><h2>  Cooling system </h2><p>  Since this option is designed for the average buyer, it is immediately worth noting that the device does not have additional functions.  Therefore, the price of the Liebher refrigerator is appropriate.  In order to cope with the main tasks, additional functionality will not be needed.  Defrosting the refrigerator occurs exclusively in manual mode.  As for the freezer, it is capable of qualitatively freezing up to four kilograms per day.  This is a good indicator to help maintain product quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator liebherr ctp 2521" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/2041125.jpg" width="306"></div>  Unfortunately, a situation may occur in the life of every person when they turn off the electricity as a result of a serious accident at the station.  However, do not worry, because during the day the refrigerator is able to keep cold, which means that the quality of the products will not suffer at all.  Defrosting the refrigerator compartment has a drip system.

Therefore, it is extremely important to familiarize yourself with the basic precautions that were indicated by the manufacturer, including the instructions for the Liebher refrigerator. </p><p>  First of all, it is important to note the location of the device.  It must not be near the hob or other electrical appliances that may cause automatic defrosting. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bicameral refrigerator liebherr ctp 2521" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2040968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is not recommended to have a refrigerator by the window if it is the sunny side.  The exposure to ultraviolet rays increases the load on a single compressor and makes it work for wear, which can also adversely affect the condition of the technical device.  It is preliminary recommended that you carefully think over the place where it will be located, since inaccurate movement can damage the mechanism. </p><p>  Modern models do not differ in one aspect from ancient refrigerators - it is forbidden to put hot food on the shelves, as this will also lead to defrosting and spoilage of products.  Also, the instructions for the Liebher refrigerator indicate that in order to prevent premature failure of the device due to an unstable power supply, the consumer must provide protection.  For these purposes, it is best to connect the appliance through a voltage regulator. </p><h2>  Advantages of the model </h2><p>  Based on customer reviews of the Liebherr CTP 2521, we can conclude that the model, like any other refrigerator of a competing company, has its advantages.  What are the benefits of consumers? </p><ul><li>  Compactness.  Thanks to its size, the refrigerator can be delivered even in narrow spaces.  Many note in their reviews of the Liebherr CTP 2521 that it can even be placed under overhead lockers, which also saves enough space. </li><li>  Specifications.  First of all, it is necessary to note energy consumption, since 171 kW per year is a really insignificant consumption, therefore this technique is referred to a rather high class - A +++. </li><li>  Cooling system that does not require any additional actions from the owner.  Drip defrosting is one of the most relevant functions that most modern models are equipped with.  Products in such devices do not weather and do not lose their natural moisture. </li><li>  A well-known name owned by the manufacturer is the key to quality and long-term operation.  This is crucial because a global brand will never produce a poor quality model.  Most consumers note in reviews of the Liebherr CTP 2521 that they chose this model because of European build quality. </li><li>  Silent work.  The indicators of 40 dB, declared by the manufacturer, are fully consistent with reality, which is extremely important for families with small children. </li></ul><h2>  Model flaws </h2><p>  In addition to the advantages, Liebherr CTP 2521 user reviews also mention the disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Door mounting diameters do not always correspond to pin holes.  As a result, the handles do not sit tight and may eventually become loose.  The length of the power cord is also insufficient, so the outlet must be at close range. </li><li>  Ergonomics of the inner space.  And although the dimensions of the device are quite compact, there are some flaws inside.  So, for example, at the bottom there is not enough one more shelf on which it would be possible to place products.  In the freezer, the last shelf is too narrow, so a large amount of freezing can not be put there. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  A controversial issue remains regarding noise performance.  In this case, opinions were divided among consumers.

    <p>  Analyzing today's market, it is worth noting that the average cost of a refrigerator varies between 20,000 and 23,000 rubles.

It is compact in size and has a modern defrosting system.  This option is perfect for a small family or small-sized kitchen. </p>
