    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The indisputable advantage of Cozy Beach Hotel 4 * (Pattaya, Thailand), according to many tourists, is its proximity to the sea.  So, guests can walk to the nearest beach in just a few minutes.  True, the road runs at an angle, so it can be difficult for older people to climb back.  As for the beach, it is municipal.  Tourists can rent sunbeds and umbrellas for a fee (about 50 baht for a whole day).  The beach itself is not very big.  It is regularly cleaned of garbage, but still tourists cannot call it very clean. </p><p>  Many travelers also preferred to visit other beaches.
