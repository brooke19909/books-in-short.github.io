    <h2>  Tachograph - what is it?  Product Overview </h2><p>  What do you need to know first?  First of all, it is worth answering the question: car tachograph - what is it?  What does this device do, and why is it needed if there is a standard speedometer? </p><p>  A tachograph is a control on-board measuring device that ensures compliance with the requirements regulated by the AETR (European Agreement that streamlines the operation of vehicles). </p><p>  The device is designed for continuous indication and simultaneous registration of indicators such as time, vehicle speed, mileage, work schedule (periods of rest and work) of drivers. </p><p>  A short answer to the question about the tachograph: what is it, will be a comparison of the device with the so-called black box in airplanes.  More accurate information can be obtained by a detailed examination of the functions and characteristics of the device. </p><h2>  What does the installation of the tachograph give? </h2><p>  Install a tachograph is not a problem.  Depending on the size, the device can be placed in a slot for a speedometer or car radio. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Daily recording of information can serve for the following purposes: </p><ul><li>  Accurate registration of mileage and speed.  It is no secret that when calculating the values, standard speedometers rely on their own program, which does not always correspond to exact values.  In the calculations, the effective wheel circumference (how much it takes for a full revolution) is taken into account, which makes it possible to fairly accurately determine how many turns are carried out for each kilometer of the way.  The regular speedometer performs calculations in a slightly different way, and the final result may vary significantly. </li><li>  Resolution of disputes.  Not just irrefutable proof is the information for which the cryptographic information protection unit of the tachograph is responsible.  What it is?  Encrypted data that cannot be falsified.  The information will help prove to the driver that they are right for the road patrol officers and protect their interests in the event of an accident. </li><li>  Conducting financial statements.  Data obtained from tachokarts or electronic tachographs provide clear information about the work of personnel.  It is possible to calculate up to a minute the driver‚Äôs work and rest time, which helps in assessing the effectiveness of staff work or for calculating the earned funds at the enterprise. </li><li>  Organization of the enterprise.  Since the data provided by the tachograph cannot be falsified, some aspects of the activities of enterprises can be clearly structured.  Thus, the requirements for the maintenance of vehicles indicate that the inspection should take place no less than every 10 thousand km.  Tachograph indicators cannot be ‚Äúwound‚Äù in any way or shift the frequency of inspections in any other way. </li></ul>

One of the AETR points refers to the fact that each driver must carry tachocards with him over the past 28 days.  Using the device, you can record any movement of vehicles, which significantly reduces the risk of unforeseen situations or helps to understand them thoroughly. </li><li>  Implementation of additional features.  Asking: "Tachograph - what is it?"  - First of all, drivers want to learn about the practical application of the device.  In addition to its direct functions, the device can be used as a speed limiter or for switching on / switching equipment modes at given speeds. </li></ul><p>  The above is <span>not a complete</span> list of tasks that help tachographs solve.  The law prescribes the installation of equipment on almost any transport that carries out passenger and cargo flights in order to be able to control the situation on the roads. </p><h2>  Features of the tachographs </h2><p>  Really, what are they?  Having decided to install a tachograph, it is necessary to consider the main features.  Namely - the design of the device, its components and the main elements.

    <p>  To obtain the recorded information, you must have 4 special keys or smart cards.  The latter include the following types of cards: </p><ul><li>  Driving - to store data regarding the movements of a particular driver for the last year. </li><li>  Map of a car dealership or workshop - to configure the tachograph, make changes to its functionality. </li><li>  Map of a company or company - for storing and reading all kinds of information about upcoming and completed flights, about other data relating to cars of a particular company.  In addition, smart cards of this type are designed to exclude the dissemination of company information. </li><li>  Inspection - for reading information from driver cards.  Allows you to familiarize yourself with all the violations that occurred in the reporting period (speed, schedule).  Helps to eliminate or eliminate equipment malfunctions (power outages, incorrect sensors). </li></ul><p>  In search of an answer to the question: tachograph with cryptographic information protection - what is it, it is safe to say that this device is designed not only for fixing the main indicators, but also for reliable storage of information. </p><h2>  Tachograph model selection </h2><p>  Not every digital device, not to mention analogue (pointer), fits the clear standards put forward by devices within the framework of the AETR project. </p><p>  A few manufacturers received proper certificates, including European developers and domestic enterprises: </p><ul><li>  VDO trademark and Continental Automotive GmbH; </li><li>  Stoneridge Electronics products </li><li>  the latest innovations of EFKON AG; </li><li>  precision ACTIA instruments; </li><li>  Incotex technologies (model "Mercury TA-001" and higher); </li><li>  Shtrikh devices SM 10042.00.00-13 and SM 100.42.00.00.14; </li><li>  KZTA (tachograph "KASBI DT-20M"); </li><li>  CJSC Izmeritel-Avto (tachograph TCA-02NK); </li><li>  ATOL company (Drive 5 tachograph); </li><li>  LLC "INTELLIK RUS" (tachograph "EFAS V2 RUS). </li></ul><p>  Before deciding which tachograph to install, it would be useful to familiarize yourself with the registry of the Federal State Institution Rosavtotrans.  There you can find a complete list of equipment models approved for use in Russia. </p><h2>  In what cases is it necessary to set tachographs? </h2><p>  First of all, the devices should be installed on auto companies engaged in various types of commercial transportation.  There is a whole list of vehicles in the dashboard of which you need to mount tachographs.  The laws prescribe the installation of devices on buses and other modes of transport, based on the number of seats, maximum weight and type of transported contents. </p>

    <p>  Whether it is necessary to set a tachograph or not can be understood by the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  The number of passenger seats.  If the number of seats excluding the driver‚Äôs is more than eight, then you can‚Äôt do without installing the device.  This classification of vehicles includes any car category M2 and M3. </li><li>  Vehicle tonnage.  Installation of the device is considered mandatory for any vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tons. Any cars of categories N2 and N3 can be assigned to this classification. </li><li>  When transporting <span>dangerous goods</span> (explosive or active chemical compounds). </li></ul><p>  These conditions are valid only for commercial transport on which tachographs should be installed.  Rules have many points and exceptions, and to be sure, you should carefully re-read them. </p><h2>  When should you be wary of fines? </h2><p>  The main regulatory document on which to rely in this case is Federal Law No. 196 with subsequent amendments.  It deals with traffic safety on roads, signs the methodological base to achieve optimal performance. </p><p>  From April 1, 2013, legal entities and <span>private entrepreneurs</span> are liable not only in the absence of equipment, but also if it does not comply with existing standards.  For example, a fine is provided for identifying malfunctions, overdue maintenance or due to non-observance by the <span>driver of the regime of work and rest</span> (workday - not more than 8 hours, continuous driving - not more than 4 hours). </p><p>  At the same time, fines for drivers and management vary significantly.  If in the first case we are talking about 1-3 thousand rubles, then in the second fines are much higher - 5-10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Do not forget also about the list of malfunctions for which material punishment threatens.  You can pay for a broken tachograph not only by withdrawing from the state.  vehicle numbers, but also by placing the car in a penalty parking lot (in the case of transportation of highly hazardous substances). </p><h2>  Maintenance and tuning of digital tachographs </h2><p>  After the question "Tachograph - what is it?"  considered by us from all sides, the operation of the device does not begin to seem less complicated.  Even the installation of the device itself becomes an almost unsolvable task for car owners. </p>

    <p>  In the event of any complex repair of the vehicle, it is necessary to carry out an additional verification of the accuracy of the readings of the control device.  Verifications have a certain periodicity, but can be carried out with any suspicion of a hardware malfunction. </p><p>  In numerous forums, one more question is often asked: calibration of the tachograph - what is it?  It will also be useful to find out why this procedure is needed and what stages it consists of. </p><h2>  Reasons for tuning devices </h2><p>  Calibration of tachographs, which is sometimes called calibration, and sometimes adjustment, calibration or verification, is performed not only after their direct installation.  The main objective of this procedure is to make the device readings as accurate as possible.  In this case, it is necessary not only to take into account all kinds of errors, but also to take into account the numerous factors that cause deviations (installation features, external causes). </p><p>  In this case, the device should record the performance of a particular vehicle as accurately as possible, which means that it is necessary to synchronize and adjust the parameters. </p><h2>  Cases in which verification is necessary </h2><p>  Calibration of tachographs is necessary in several cases.  If the examinations are not carried out on time, the device may show incorrect indicators, and possible deviations from the norm will gradually worsen. </p>

    <p>  Timely checks of the equipment make it possible to ensure the safety of the driver on the road, otherwise, not only the risk of unforeseen situations increases, but also the possibility of material penalties. </p><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  You can try to answer the question: car tachograph - what is it, from several sides.  The device must be installed on commercial vehicles of large dimensions. </p><p>  The device makes it possible to ensure the proper level of security, which is not difficult to believe, given how difficult (almost impossible) to distort the indicators recorded by the tachograph. </p><p>  The contrast can be felt more strongly if you compare modern digital equipment with a somewhat outdated analog. </p><p>  True, the owners of switch devices will have to (if not yet had to) change unreliable devices. </p><p>  Experts say that controlling speed and mileage is not the main function of the device.
