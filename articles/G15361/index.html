    <p>  According to legend, the river owes its name to one of the Old Russian princes.  The ruler and his squad did not manage to cross the watercourse - he spilled too much as a result of heavy snowmelt.  In the hearts of the prince and uttered a phrase that later transformed into the name of this river. </p><p>  Fans of antiquities in the city will definitely be interested in the wooden temple of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God, built in the 19th century.  This architectural landmark of Lukhovits was discovered and restored after decades of "Soviet atheism" only in the 90s.  The old iconostasis and valuable murals have been preserved in the interiors of the church. </p><h2>  Cucumber Museum </h2><p>  Attraction Lukhovits number 1 - this, of course, the Museum of Cucumber.  Vegetables in this city, thanks to fertile soils and a mild climate, grow very juicy and tasty.  The local cucumbers are successfully delivered to almost all corners of a vast and vast Russia! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Cucumber Museum in Lukhovitsy tells the story of growing a green fruit.  It was opened here not so long ago - in 2008.  The museum is an impromptu garden where visitors are told how to cultivate cucumbers properly and what dishes can be prepared from them.  This institution often hosts tastings, various festivals and events. </p><h2>  "Top" five Lukhovitsky monuments </h2><p>  Another notable feature of Lukhovitsy is its monuments.  The city is decorated with many wonderful sculptures, both serious and comic.  Here are five of the most interesting and beautiful Lukhovitsky monuments: </p><ul><li>  Monument to Peter the Great - a modest small sculpture, installed near the museum of local lore.  The bronze sovereign stands on the deck of the ship and proudly looks into the distance.  The founder of the Russian fleet is immortalized in Lukhovitsy not by chance.  In the vicinity of this city, the first ship in Russia was launched. </li><li>  Monument to the Cucumber-breadwinner is the main visiting card of Lukhovits!  It is very strange that this monument appeared in the city only in 2007. </li><li>  Aibolit Monument is a touching and harmonious composition, installed near the children's clinic.  Behind the good doctor is a tree, on the branches of which all his patients are located. </li><li>  The monument to the <span>postman Pechkin,</span> respectively, is located near the city post office building.  And they opened it exactly on Communication Day in 2008. </li><li>  The monument "MiG-23" is located on the square near the recreation center "Start".  This is just as important a symbol of Lukhovits as a cucumber.  The military maneuverable fighter that stands on this pedestal was launched back in 1967. </li></ul>

    <p>  Quartz sand was once mined in these quarries.  Half a century ago they were abandoned and flooded, and the banks of the formed reservoirs were ennobled.  Carp and crucian carp are found in the water of anthropogenic lakes, however, special permission must be obtained for their fishing.  According to the reviews of the residents of the city and its guests, rest on the Blue Lakes in Lukhovitsy can be successfully combined with walks through the local forests and picking delicious berries. </p>
