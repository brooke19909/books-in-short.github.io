Each corner is full of mysteries and provides many opportunities for active and passive relaxation.  Karelia is becoming more and more popular.  Its landscapes are not inferior to European resorts with world names.  The level of service offered by various companies in this region is also growing.  <span>An example to follow</span> is the tourist complex ‚ÄúYanisyarvi‚Äù.  Excellent staff work is the key to the success of this organization. </p><h2>  Lake District </h2><p>  The fantastically beautiful republic of Karelia is located in the northwestern part of the Russian Federation.  The glacier, which passed through its territory several thousand years ago, changed the <span>terrain.</span>  He left behind a lot of pits, which were subsequently filled with <span>fresh water.</span>  Today, over 27,000 rivers and 60,000 lakes count on the republic‚Äôs area.  Each of the reservoirs is the pride of the country and is worth a visit. </p>

The recreation center ‚ÄúYanisyarvi‚Äù stands on this line.  Dizzying landscapes open from the territory of this complex.  Green patches of earth peep out from the plain of the water.  The waves of the pit beat against the stone land.  Further, beyond the rocky coast, fertile soils lie on which lush coniferous forests grow.  There at the height of the season there are a lot of berries and mushrooms.

    <h2>  The land of fantastic legends </h2><p>  It will be especially interesting to spend the holidays here for children.  They will certainly be interested in the history of this lake, because it is full of mysteries and secrets. </p><p>  Today, scientists offer two versions of the origin of this fantastic reservoir.  The first claims that the volcano was the cause of the formation of the pit, which raged in this territory for many centuries.  The second hypothesis says that many years ago an asteroid fell on this place.  He formed a cavity, which was subsequently filled with water.  The Finns called this pond "rabbit lake", which sounded in their language as "yanisyarvi".  The hotel will become a real territory for adventure. </p>

    <p>  The extraterrestrial origin of the pool can be confirmed by the story of a St. Petersburg student who witnessed the fall of another meteorite into the water.  This happened in 1908.  They say that cosmic stones fly into the lake today.  There is a lot of information that water as a magnet attracts galactic energy. </p><h2>  The pearl of the complex </h2><p>  Amazing with its beauty, nature.  20 small streams feed each reservoir, each of which fascinates with originality.  The foundation pit itself plays the role of a road for the Janisioki River, flowing through its territory.  In general, this is a whole system of water vessels and veins that make up the magnificent organism of Karelia. </p><p>  The basin basin is divided into two parts by a peculiar ridge.  The southern pit has a maximum depth of 57 meters, the northern one is shallower and reaches a mark of 37 meters.  Most of the bottom is covered with silt.  Such conditions contribute to the diversity of the underwater world.  Good fishing is a "trick", which attracts tourists to the recreation center "Yanisyarvi". </p><h2>  Anglers paradise </h2><p>  Those who visited this complex claim that perch, pike, roach, bream, whitefish and salmon are found in the lake.  Only 15 species.  Also, many people note that the fish in this place is not capricious and pecks even at the most ordinary bait. </p><p>  The land of the Karelian region is very rich.  It is especially famous for ponds full of different tailed trophies.  For those who wish to spend time on vacation with benefit and return home with presents, the complex offers fishing.  Employees of the establishment can tell both beginners and experienced fishermen about the features of the underwater world of this area. </p><p>  The Yanisyarvi Recreation Center rents all the necessary equipment: from fishing rods to motor boats.  The catch on this lake is always significant, therefore not only local residents come here, but also guests from other countries. </p>

    <h2>  Instructions for hunters </h2><p>  Of course, you can catch prey in any part of the reservoir.  But if you want a specific type of fish, you will have to try and remember a few rules.  For example, whitefish does not like great depths and swims along the coast, where the mark is no more than 5 meters. </p><p>  Perch, pike and zander are not tied to a specific territory, so you can catch them everywhere.  But the latter species is very rare, and if it appears in a bucket, then consider that you were lucky. </p><p>  Rest on Lake Yanisyarvi is impossible to imagine without fishing.  Most often people come here for trophies such as trout and salmon.  The first species does not like noise, so it is better to ambush it in quiet company.  The second lives on a sandy and stone bottom.  In order to get such a boot, you should choose the right place for the boat. </p><h2>  Start Area </h2><p>  This place is a good opportunity not only to relax, but also to expand your horizons, gain fresh emotions and even get a new hobby.  The base places a significant emphasis on active entertainment.  Besides the fact that guests can rent fishing equipment, they also offer such activities as paintball, diving, <span>water skiing.</span> </p><p>  Many novelties are offered by rest on Yanisyarvi.  Reviews are given by those people who rented ATVs and snowmobiles.  Unfortunately, not everything is so good here.  Clients complain that sometimes instructors lack knowledge.  Therefore, it is worth taking such fun only to those who have experience.  If you are not a supporter of extreme sports, then the administration offers other types of sports: badminton, tennis, darts. </p>
