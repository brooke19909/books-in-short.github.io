    <h2>  Is it possible </h2><p>  People are wondering if it's possible to make billions.  In fact yes.  But not in one day.  And not even two.  Except for a long period of time.  Therefore, do not think that it is very simple.  After all, then everyone would be rich.  So by ‚Äúbillion‚Äù we mean simply a large amount of money.  Only then can all the proposed methods be considered real and relevant. </p><p>  In principle, you can earn a billion a day.  But not quite real.  It's about virtual money.  More specifically, about gaming.  In almost any game you will have such an opportunity.  But with real finance, everything is much more complicated.  So get ready: the solution of the task will require you not only time, but also strength.  Of course, one cannot do without endurance and patience. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sources of profit </h2><p>  Where to earn 1 billion dollars?

    <h2>  Rent </h2><p>  How to make a billion from scratch?  To do this, you will have to use all possible sources of profit.  It has already been said that income can be obtained from your own property.  But how exactly? </p><p>  It is about renting out real estate.  Usually these are apartments.  A very good source of passive income.  With a large amount of real estate, you can generally forget about the real official work.  Unless you really did not dare to earn billions. </p><p>  This method is not realized by everyone.  After all, not everyone inherits property, not everyone is able to buy several apartments.  Therefore, just keep in mind that renting out real estate for rent simply helps to answer where to make a billion and how to do it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="earn 1 billion dollars" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1335904.jpg" width="600"></div>

And this is taking into account the presence of a large salary. </p><p>  Try to strive for leadership positions and be employed in profitable areas of activity.  A good alternative is to work in government.  You can get at once in several places for a part-time job. </p><p>  This option is suitable for many.  It is usually recommended to learn the rules of saving, work harder, look for part-time jobs, and then you can achieve success in earning.  Not trillions, but enough for life. </p><h2>  Freelance </h2><p>  How to make a billion from scratch?  There are a lot of options for solving the problem.  It all depends on you and your skills.

    <p>  It‚Äôs best if your hobby turns into a business.  Most often, freelancers open their own business.  Among them you can find: photographers, web programmers, web designers, translators, tutoring tutors, videographers, ordinary programmers and so on.  You can list infinitely long.  But this profession more often than others allows you to open your own business and earn a lot. </p><h2>  Handmade </h2><p>  The modern world is full of diverse ideas for making money.  Some offers are becoming extremely popular and fashionable.  Handicrafts are in fashion now.  If you know how to craft something with your own hands, you can use these skills in order to answer how to earn 1 billion dollars. </p><p>  Do a variety of crafts and sell them.  It can be even the simplest hair clips or jewelry.  The main thing is that the crafts are handmade and exclusive.  This approach will help you make money fast.  The more original your proposals, the more profit will come. </p><p>  It‚Äôs better to organize sales over the Internet.  True, for starters you will have to unwind.  Only after they learn about you, it will be possible to fully hope for a huge profit.  Not always, but very often.  The main problem here is the search for customers.  But you can always cope with it. </p><h2>  Copywriting </h2><p>  How to make a billion?  Copywriting - this is the most common option for those who prefer to work through the Internet.  This approach usually requires only a "well- <span>hung language."</span>  Well, knowledge of punctuation and grammar.  In general, competent and rich speech.  If you have these talents and skills, you can count on success. </p><p>  Copywriting is the writing of texts to order.  They give you a topic, and you write to the customer what he asks.  After you receive payment.  A very good and profitable way to make money.  This also includes rewriting - the same spelling of texts on order, but from a certain source. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a billion a day" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1335693.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <p></p>
    <p>  To translate ideas into reality, use a variety of copywriter exchanges.  For example, Advego or eTxt.  Register and look for orders.  Then you will receive the payment to the exchange account, from there the money is transferred to the electronic wallet.  Very comfortably. </p><p>  On average, such an income is about 20-30 thousand rubles per month.  But with a huge portfolio and talent, you can get more.  Therefore, many believe that it is this approach that will help you quickly and without problems make good money.  The advantage is that it is remote work.  And it suits everyone: ordinary citizens, and women on maternity leave.  The main thing is to have a computer and the Internet in front of you.  Of course, if you are well versed in any particular subject, be sure to indicate this.  You can increase your earnings for your own talents. </p><p>  At first, do not expect high profits.  As elsewhere, promotion is needed.  Look for customers, and then establish yourself as an experienced and talented copywriter.  A little practice - and you will be able to "on the machine" to do many duties.  For example, check and edit the received text. </p><h2>  Writing </h2><p>  How to make a billion?  Another approach that can be indirectly equated with copywriting is writing and publishing your own book.  Writers get good fees for their work.  It‚Äôs a sin not to use it.  True, you must be able to write and interest the reader.  This is not given to everyone.  Only a few succeed in writing. </p><p>  To get started, try to do samizdat.  Will have to invest a little in this matter.  If you can interest the public, all expenses will pay off very quickly.  You can say you need promotion.  And talent.  All this will help to earn big money.  And if you combine writing with other methods of making a profit, you can hope that your income will increase exponentially. </p><h2>  Scammers </h2><p>  Another way to get billions is through fraud.  Wrongful, illegal and terrible method.  Cheating and scamming people for money is prosecuted by law in all countries of the world.  Therefore, you should not seriously consider this approach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to earn billions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1335695.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As practice shows, fraudsters get rich very quickly.  But at the same time, they are also rapidly losing the money received.  After all, fraud is punishable.  In most cases, cheaters are punished.  Keep this in mind.  There are many fraud schemes, if you are really considering such a way to generate income, carefully study the proposed options.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to make a billion dollars.  Everyone is able to choose a business to their liking and bring it to life.  The main thing is to set a goal and constantly develop ideas. </p>
