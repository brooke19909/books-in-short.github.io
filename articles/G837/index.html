Patchwork master class</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Decorative pillows lying in an armchair or sofa make the room cozy and homely.  Most people purchase these products in stores, but it is not always possible to find the necessary color or model.  After all, I want to choose pillows suitable for upholstered furniture or for curtains.  If you want to buy a truly unique thing, for example, in the now fashionable patchwork style, you will have to pay a double price, because handmade is always priced more expensive. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make pillows from shreds with your own hands, what fabric is better to choose for sewing, how to draw a sketch of future crafts and how to do the work step by step.  The photographs presented will show how varied the patchwork patterns on the pillows can be.  For work, you will need drawing stencils, drawn paper for fitting, an iron, a ruler and chalk, scissors and a thread with a needle for stitching, as well as a sewing machine for the final connection of small elements into a common ornament. </p><p>  Decorative pillows from shreds can be of very different shapes - round and square, rectangular and in the form of a cylinder.  Only the front part of the product is made of multi-colored parts, the back side is sewn from the plain main fabric.  The pillow consists of several parts.  The first step is to sew a napitnik, filled with a padding polyester, and sew up tightly from all sides.  Next, work is done on a beautiful cover, which is made removable, most often with a zipper. </p><h2>  Pattern drawing </h2><p>  Patchwork, or patchwork, is always done according to a clear pattern.  To compile it, you need to purchase a special centimeter paper in a box.  The selected pattern is transferred to the sheet in full size.  You can draw a diagram yourself, or you can find a drawing on the Internet.  Patchwork ideas for pillows depend on their shape.  A round product is often broken down into sectors.  The cylindrical roller is decorated with stripes, but for the manufacture of square pillows in this style you will have to work hard, since the pattern can be made up of dozens of small elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="imaginesque.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern drawing" class="if uuid-3078277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078277.jpg"></div><p>  On the sample of the figure in the article it is seen that for the formation of the front side of the pillow you need to sew a lot of squares and triangles together, so that they are all the same size.  In order not to confuse the details, it is desirable to paint the scheme in fabric colors. </p><h2>  Sewing pillows </h2><p>  We will start the master class for the patchwork pillows with the manufacture of a square-shaped napkin.  The fabric should be natural, dense and strong, so stock up with satin or calico.  Depending on the shape of the product, fabric cutting is performed.  For a square or rectangular pillow, the fabric can be folded in half to make not 4, but 3 seams.  The synthetic winterizer must be purchased either by weight or by sheet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric selection" class="if uuid-3078252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078252.jpg"></div><p>  In the first case, the napkin is first sewn, a small hole for the filler is left, the inside is densely stuffed with synthetic winterizer and the remaining piece is sewn up manually or with a surface seam on a sewing machine.  The sheet synthetic winterizer is first sewn in several layers, and then inserted neatly into the finished cover, the last side of the cover is sewn with the outer seam.  The same type of filler is used for pillows of round and cylindrical shape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  For patchwork sewing, it is very important to choose the right fabrics so that they harmoniously combine with each other, and be of the same quality.  The most commonly used natural material is cotton, calico, linen, muslin or poplin.  The fabric should not be stretch and stretch, otherwise it will not be possible to fold an even pattern.  The alternation of several types of fabric looks beautiful, when they combine light and dark, bright and dull, with a large and small pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sectors pillow" class="if uuid-3078262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078262.jpg"></div><p>  Be sure to choose the main fabric with a single color, which will combine the pattern on the front side and will occupy the entire back of the pillow. </p><h2>  Assembling parts together </h2><p>  As you already understood, pillows made of scraps with their own hands are sewn from separate pieces.  The photo below shows that fabrics of various colors are cut into squares.  However, it must be remembered that on each part from all sides it is necessary to leave 0.5 cm to the hem of the fabric.  Some masters use a cardboard template for clarity.  It is laid out on a cut square of fabric, bent from all sides in the middle and immediately ironed with a hot iron, making a fold in the right place. </p><p>  When all the details have been prepared, they are stitched together in smooth, clearly visible lines.  Similar patterns are made when cutting triangles, hexagons or round central parts when sewing patchwork pillows.  For beauty, you can add an outer seam using contrasting threads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Stitching </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at connecting the parts together in a single picture.  For convenience, a composition of large squares is assembled.  Depending on the chosen pattern, they can only be composed of small squares, or of squares and triangles.  Each seam is necessarily ironed with a hot iron both on the front and on the wrong side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thermoweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect parts" class="if uuid-3078286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078286.jpg"></div><p>  When large elements are prepared, they are stitched together in strips.  This applies only to square or rectangular pillows.  Next, we‚Äôll take a closer look at how to sew a pillow made of round patches with your own hands. </p><h2>  Round pillow </h2><p>  The basis for a round pillow is made up of several circles of sheet padding polyester sewn together by threads.  The bed is sewn of dense fabric from two circles and a long thin side strip.  Work on a decorative cover is made from individual shreds by sectors.  To do this, use a cardboard template and several harmoniously combined colors of cotton fabric.  Sectors are cut so that on each side there is fabric for hemming and seams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meetmeatmikes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round shred pillow" class="if uuid-3078230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078230.jpg"></div><p>  Using a template, iron all the seams to draw straight lines to connect the parts together.  To hide the center point of the pillow, prepare two large buttons with a buttonhole at the back, wrap them with any fabric and sew all layers of fabric and synthetic winterizer together, as in the photo in the article. </p><p>  The side and back sides of the cover are sewn in the same color as the central part of the craft.  They can be colored or plain, according to the choice of the master. </p><h2>  Heart variant </h2><p>  For beginners, a pillow of shreds can be made with a heart in the center.  You can even sew the strips together without trying them on; just attach pieces of fabric in the form of long trapezoids nearby and stitch one to the other.  Iron the resulting pattern with an iron and set the large square aside.  The main work is done on the opening in the shape of a heart on the main tissue.  You will need a template to draw outlines with chalk on the back of the pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kollabora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart pillow" class="if uuid-3078238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078238.jpg"></div><p>  When you cut a hole with scissors, be sure to leave 1 cm for the hem of the fabric.  Since the heart has rounded edges, it is necessary to gently iron the hem so that there are no wrinkles.  You can sew a circular seam with stitches.  Then put the patchwork so that it covers the hole completely, and sew it with a needle and thread.  Cut off the excess edges of the scraps with scissors.  It remains to stitch the heart along the contours of the sewing machine and the main part of the decorative pillow will be done.  This craft can be sewn as a gift for Valentine's Day. </p><h2>  Hexagon pillow </h2><p>  This is one of the difficult options for making a patchwork pattern.  Only for the front side of the cover, it is necessary to cut and sew several dozen small elements with each other with six seams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="society6.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hexagon pillow" class="if uuid-3078220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078220.jpg"></div><p>  Such painstaking work can only be done by experienced craftsmen.  To smoothly cut and iron all the edges of the hexagons, be sure to use a dense cardboard template.  All parts are first connected to each other, and then at the end the shape of the square of the front side of the pillow is already cut out. </p><h2>  Variety of drawings </h2><p>  Pillows made of shreds with their own hands are sewn according to a wide variety of patterns.  The more complex the drawing and the more small details, the higher the seamstress's craftsmanship should be.  If you are just learning to sew patchwork style patches, start with large stripes or squares.  It is easy to make a soft roller from rectangular elements of different colors.  The side circles of the cylinder are sewn at the end of the work, and attach a ‚Äúzipper‚Äù to the central seam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zibbet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful pillow" class="if uuid-3078227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3078227.jpg"></div><p>  When you get an even picture and a clear connection of elements into a single whole, you can try intricate patterns of small details.  You can dream endlessly.  So, in addition to the heart, the sewing of which we examined above in the article, you can make a hole in the shape of an apple, a pear or a cat figure.  It is easy to do the work from the same shape of the patches, however, they may differ, located at different angles.  Fell in love with the patchwork masters that opens the will of fantasy.  In the work, you can realize any creative ideas and ideas.  You can vary not only the pieces of shreds, but also the color scheme.  Even from several cuts of the same color, you can create many different pillows, combining them each time in a different way. </p><p>  In the article, we examined in detail how to sew pillows of patchwork-style fabric scraps on your own.  For work, be sure to prepare a drawing made by yourself or printed on a printer from the Internet.  This will greatly facilitate the work and help to cope with the task with ease.  To align the edges of each part, you need to make a cardboard template and iron all the folds with a hot iron.  Then it‚Äôs a matter of technology, it remains only to sew the details with neat seams and the pillow is ready!  Try your hand at a new art form!  Have a good start! </p>
