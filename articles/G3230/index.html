Sochi Krasnaya Polyana is also perfect for such a vacation, and a tourist will not even need a foreign passport to travel here. </p><p>  It is not worth worrying about the fact that among the hotels of this resort there are exceptionally expensive options.  Here you can easily find a decent hotel with quite affordable prices.  One of these is the three-star hotel Burnt by the Sun, conveniently located near the ski lifts. </p><h2>  Winter holidays in Russia </h2><p>  Today, the most popular resorts in Russia, of course, are the resorts of the Crimean coast of the Black Sea and the city of the Krasnodar Territory, which are also located on the banks of this wonderful salt pond. </p><p>  However, Crimea is popular mainly in the summer, when you can swim in the sea and lie on the beach, exposing yourself to the burning rays of the sun.  In winter, almost no one visits these places, because the sea is cold, the weather is also not summer, and you won‚Äôt be able to sunbathe. </p><p>  However, this cannot be said about the Krasnodar Territory, where crowds of tourists flock even when snow is already lying around.  Of course, no one goes to Anapa or Gelendzhik to swim in the sea.  The resort called Krasnaya Polyana is very popular in the winter months, where after the 2014 Winter Olympics all the conditions for a wonderful winter holiday appeared. </p>

    <p>  Mountains covered with pure snow, a bright sun that literally blinds your eyes, reflected from a snow-white cover, cozy hotels and all kinds of restaurants with warm drinks - all this creates a unique atmosphere that can only be felt in the mountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, this place and its surroundings are amazing.  After all, if guests ride in the mountains at sub-zero temperatures, then if they ride some 40 kilometers and find themselves on the coast, they can even warm up a little right on the street.

Of course, there are rental points here for those who, for various reasons, have not yet acquired their equipment, and they already really want to experience the indescribable sensations of speed and extreme. </p><p>  And if someone suddenly wants to take a break from the frantic speeds and warm themselves near the sea, then guests can easily leave here and ride, for example, in the Central District of Sochi.  There are many interesting places where you can walk and see the sights.  After such an informative walk, you can safely return to the mountains and conquer these snow-capped peaks with renewed vigor. </p><h2>  Accommodation in Krasnaya Polyana </h2><p>  It is very difficult not to find a suitable place to stay for all those who came to rest in Krasnaya Polyana.  On the territory of this village itself, as well as nearby villages such as Esto-Sadok and Gorki Gorod, there are many hotels and private houses that are happy to offer rooms for tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that in the period from December 25 to January 14, all rooms are even more expensive, since this is the time of the New Year holidays. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of the Hotel </h2><p>  Guests who over the past couple of years visited the hotel "Burnt by the Sun" 3 *, reviews about this place leave mostly positive.  Tourists like the low cost of rooms, and breakfast, and the provision of transfers to the ski lifts. </p><p>  Vacationers note that the cleaning performed in the rooms is modest, but quite sufficient to maintain cleanliness in the rooms: they wipe the floors, take out garbage, but the beds do not make up.  Although some tourists write that they could be cleaned more often, and not once every few days. </p><p>  Of the main disadvantages, guests note only a small parking for cars, as well as the proximity of the hotel to a large street.  Because of this, the rooms are quite noisy. </p>
