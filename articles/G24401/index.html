In 2016, the company released many products that are now popular.  Among the "newborns" falls and Highscreen Bay.  Reviews about this smartphone leave different, so it is difficult to understand whether the project was successful. </p><h2>  Creativity </h2><p>  The first thing that immediately catches your eye is the name Highscreen Bay.  As you know, bay is translated from English as ‚Äúbay‚Äù or ‚Äúbay‚Äù, but here Russian-speaking users can read as ‚Äúwow‚Äù, that same English delight wow. </p><p>  In general, a group of creators who work on the names of Highscreen smartphones, and this time worked hard.  The name turned out to be really promising.  Well, we will study and consider the Highscreen Bay smartphone.  User reviews will help us with this. </p><h2>  Who lives in the tent? </h2><p>  Let's start with the box.  The equipment on these smartphones is the same.  Sometimes there are pleasant little things that are not alien to Highscreen Bay.  Reviews about the configuration mostly leave positive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen bay reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405357.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Firstly, a branded box from the manufacturer.  It still schematically depicts a smartphone with its technical characteristics.  Secondly, inside, in addition to a smartphone, there is a huge number of ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù.  Excellent high-quality headphones, an additional OTG cable, the already famous USB Type C, and a good branded case-book.  By the way, the latter always goes in the color of a smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Elegant protection </h2><p>  The cover book is a separate topic for conversation.  The basis for it is plastic.  High quality leatherette for a cover was attached to it.  In addition, on the front of the case is a small window-hole.  When the smartphone is in a case, its locking mode becomes compact, and all possible information is placed in the window.  Thanks to this, you can receive calls and view notifications without opening the cover, and this convenience is noted in the reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone highscreen bay reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405351.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  What did the Highscreen Bay LTE smartphone look like?  Design reviews are often positive.  Given that the phone can be attributed, rather, to budget devices, there is no curved display, modular housing or special premium materials.  Everything is quite modest and ordinary, but at the same time very neat and of high quality. </p><p>  The back of the phone is covered with two-layer plastic, has a matte finish, but with a top ball of transparent gloss.  That is, the phone looks matte, but it is smooth to the touch.  By the way, three colors are available to users.  Each model has its own version of the texture of the back cover.  For example, a white device received a metallic illusion of a coating; it shimmers in the light, but unfortunately it collects fingerprints too actively. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Color varieties </h2><p>  But the colors of the smartphone Highscreen Bay LTE reviews are contradictory.  The most successful, according to the owners, remains the classic white, which seems to be like snow-white, but also with a "metallic" tint. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen bay lte reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405356.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is also a Golden Highscreen Bay smartphone.  Reviews about this option are often negative.  Many considered it too pathetic, which does not quite correspond to the "stuffing" of the smartphone.  An interesting option is dark blue.  From the outside it seems that it is black, and if you look closer, there is a deep blue tint. </p><h2>  What put where? </h2><p>  Control elements are located classically for the device.  The camera is closer to the upper left corner.  An LED flash was placed next to it.  The lens protrudes slightly above the body, so to avoid scratches, there is a metal rim around it.  The speaker, as usual, is located below.  To make the call audible, even if the phone is lying with the cover down, barely visible projections are made on the case.  In the center of the back there is a signature inscription. </p><p>  The lock and volume buttons are still there, on the right edge of the device, there is a headphone jack at the top, and a USB Type C connector at the bottom. A microphone speaker is next. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The developers cunningly acted with a screen.  A black frame was made around him, due to which the size of the display was visually increased.  At the top, there is still room for the front-end, an indicator for notifications and a barely noticeable speaker grid.  Three famous touch buttons remain in place from below. </p><p>  By the way, it is also interesting that the developers tried as much as possible to bring the design closer to the leading flagships.  Therefore, in addition to visually enlarged display, we worked on the thickness of the smartphone.  They held a silver edging on the sides, which made the device sophisticated. </p><p>  As for the SIM card slots and memory card, they are, as usual, located under the cover, next to the battery.  On this occasion, some had problems with Highscreen Bay Blue.  Responses of owners affected the back panel of the device.  Out of habit, it turned out that it was difficult to open it to get to the SIM card.  The fact is that there is no separate connector for this business, so you can pick up the lid in the "usb" area. </p><p>  Due to difficulties that arose with the lid and mounts, the owners complained that either the socket had cracked, or one of the mountings had broken.  Smartphone assemblies were also found in which the panel noticeably ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù immediately after purchase.  Therefore, in the store at this moment it is better to pay special attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone highscreen bay golden reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405355.jpg"></div>

    <p>  We will return now under the cover.  You can change the memory card and one of the ‚ÄúSIM cards‚Äù (there are two of them) without removing the battery, but in order to get the second ‚ÄúSIM card‚Äù, you will first have to remove the battery.  By the way, both SIM cards are in micro format, which pleases most users, since you don‚Äôt have to go to the salon and change them. </p><h2>  Conclusion about the "beautiful wrapper" </h2><p>  Outwardly, the smart turned out to be presentable, but quite ordinary.  It is neat, thanks to some tricks of the developers, even sophisticated.  It lies well in the hand, and it is quite comfortable to use on the go.  At first glance, it seems like high-quality buttons on the side panel, although the volume rocker in some assemblies is a little ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù. </p><p>  The light from the notification indicator pleases with its brightness during the day, but sometimes annoying at night, especially when charging.  Therefore, it is better to turn the smartphone over so that too bright ‚Äúwinks‚Äù do not interfere with sleep. </p><h2>  Endless war </h2><p>  It is immediately worth noting that the developers have prepared an AMOLED screen for Highscreen Bay Gold.  Reviews for this type of display are always different.  The endless war between IPS and AMOLED will never end, unless an alternative appears.  In principle, this dispute is equivalent to comparing operating systems for smartphones.  Indeed, in most cases, the choice of a screen is a matter of taste. </p><p>  If before this question was acute, what to choose - bright, ‚Äújuicy‚Äù and saturated, or a more natural and calm display - then over time this disagreement was forgotten.  Now you can adjust AMOLED to a calmer tone, or make IPS ‚Äújuicier‚Äù. </p><p>  But in the case of Highscreen Bay, the Pandora‚Äôs Box opened.  This is due to the fact that the hardware AMOLED, unfortunately, cannot be adjusted in any way.  Only temperature changes are available in the settings. </p><p>  There were users with questions and permission.  The display received 5.5 inches, but for some reason the indicators are 1280x720.  The fact is that for the same price you can buy smart with a resolution of 1080x1920.  If you translate these values ‚Äã‚Äãinto ppi, then the difference is 267 to 401, and this is more than significant. </p><p>  Of course, the numbers are numbers, but regarding the screen, the Highscreen Bay smartphone receives positive reviews.  If you take a competitor with a higher resolution and compare, the difference is noticeable, and in the use of one smartphone such "little things" are not visible.  Errors can also be seen if you ‚Äútransfer‚Äù from a better display to Highscreen Bay. </p>

    <p>  There are no complaints regarding viewing angles.  The display fades slightly, but the image does not distort.  The brightness is also optimal: it is quite powerful on a sunny day, and in the dark at a minimum level allows you to comfortably use your smartphone.  With automatic tuning, the phone adequately responded to changes in light, although with a quick change it was noticeably ‚Äúthoughtful‚Äù. </p><h2>  Survivability </h2><p>  With regard to the battery, the Highscreen Bay Gold smartphone has positive reviews.  Despite the fact that many "brothers" received a more capacious battery, this model with its 3150 mAh confidently "lives" day. </p><p>  If you use the smartphone all day economically - about 10 minutes of calls, hours of surfing on the Internet and social networks, as well as the background work of mail, Skype and WhatsApp - then after 14 hours the device will have as much as 75% of the charge.  That is, in this mode, he can live more than two days. </p><p>  If you use your smartphone more actively, then after 10 minutes of conversation, two hours of reading and surfing the Internet, one and a half hours of music entertainment, half an hour of social networks, capturing important moments, 20 minutes of navigation and background work, the device will remain with 40% charge. </p><p>  These indicators are issued by the test apparatus.  In practice, different results come out.  Someone overnight can easily disappear 8% of the charge in sleep mode, while someone with the active use of games, calls and navigation, the smartphone manages without charging for almost three days.  Most often, survivability depends on how correctly the owner "swings" the battery after purchasing a phone. </p><h2>  Worthy photos </h2><p>  Regarding the camera, the Highscreen Bay LTE Gold smartphone received quite positive reviews from the owners.  For its price, the device received a decent lens with good color reproduction, focus and detail.  This is especially noticeable in good lighting.  If you take pictures on a cloudy day or at dusk, noise appears.  At night, the lens also produces good photos with the correct <span>white balance,</span> but, unfortunately, all with the same noise. </p><p>  The front camera is standard for this price category.  It‚Äôs not a shame to upload selfies on social networks; video calls on Skype are also good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen bay blue reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405354.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The camera interface pleases with a huge number of effects and additions.  Therefore, it is better to take pictures in manual mode, so there is more space for imagination and quality.  In addition to professional settings, here you can find familiar filters, ‚Äúmagic‚Äù adjustments or retouching.  HDR, panorama, night and burst modes are also available. </p><h2>  Operability </h2><p>  The developers have prepared the MediaTek MT6753 chipset for the smartphone, Mali-T720 works for the graphics.  A nice gift is the availability of Highscreen Bay LTE.  Reviews about the availability of these frequencies are always joyful, since 4G is now in demand.  The owners note that the developers have also added many ‚Äúbuns‚Äù to the technical equipment of the smartphone.  CorePilot technology is responsible for balanced performance, power consumption and heat dissipation. </p><p>  RAM in the device is 2 GB, of which 1300 MB is available on average.  The built-in here is 16 GB, of which 11 GB is free.  To enlarge it, you can use the slot for a memory card. </p><p>  The rest of the device is quite mediocre.  In principle, with regard to performance, Highscreen Bay 16 GB reviews are positive.  It is unlikely that anyone would think of buying this model for games, since the graphics chipset is average here.  The phone will be able to run Asphalt 8 at maximum settings, with a small FPS drawdown, it is also possible to play World Of Tanks Blitz at "minimum", but in the end the device will overheat and slow down in the process. </p><h2>  Commander-in-Chief </h2><p>  The Russian-Chinese project turned out to be quite high-quality, but so far uncompetitive.  Of course, he is still far from world flagships, but he could find his audience.  Controversial Highscreen Bay 16GB smartphone running under Android 5.1 Lollipop.  Often this device is taken precisely because of the "clean" operating system. </p><p>  There is one reason for this.  The thing is that the company cannot boast of the presence of branded software, and therefore the phone enters the market ‚Äúclean‚Äù.  It is deprived of unnecessary software, and therefore it can safely be loaded with the necessary applications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone highscreen bay lte reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405352.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The Chinese have worked on energy conservation.  In the settings, you can select the economical backlight, adjust the operation of background applications and view graphs of the spent charge. </p><p>  The smartphone is not fully committed to Android.  If you search, you can find additions from the manufacturer itself.  In addition to the ordinary services of Google, the company‚Äôs gallery, compass and audio player were placed on the phone. </p><h2>  Musical delights </h2><p>  By the way, about the Highscreen Bay music player, user reviews are enthusiastic.  The thing is that the player received DTS support and a cool equalizer.  Headphones included are good, but music lovers may need a more expensive headset.  Basically, the player allows you to adjust the sound as soon as you want.  You can boost low frequencies, apply sound, or select your favorite preset.  Radio support is available, but with a headset connected. </p><h2>  Call me </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the phone has two slots for micro-SIM.  One radio module is available to it.  You can get to one SIM card without barriers, but for the second you‚Äôll have to remove the battery. </p><p>  At first glance, everything seems to be normal, but problems arise when installing micro-SIM.  The thing is that some phone models immediately ‚Äúask‚Äù about how to use one or another card.  In the case of Highscreen Bay, you will have to change everything yourself. </p><p>  It is also worth immediately setting up calls from two SIM cards.  By default, the phone will use only the first card, but in the settings you can select the option ‚ÄúAlways ask ...‚Äù, then when dialing a number the user has a choice. </p><p>  With regard to communications on Highscreen Bay, reviews on this subject are positive.  The interlocutor is heard well, no gaps were observed. </p><h2>  Too loud </h2><p>  But what really got into trouble was the external speaker.  The fact is that some Highscreen Bay assemblies with very loud sound have entered the market.  But this is not so bad, it can be corrected and changed.  Often there is a bug in which, in sleep mode, this speaker terribly hisses or fonit during charging.  Moreover, these problems are observed variablely.  Sometimes the phone starts to work normally, without making extraneous sounds, and sometimes even when the cover is opened, it begins to hiss. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="highscreen bay 16gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405350.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For some users, this problem went away after a flashing, some had to process the return of the device. </p><h2>  Calm stability </h2><p>  Basically, the Highscreen Bay smartphone turned out to be neat in appearance and stable inside.  There is a lot of good in it, first of all its design, a ‚Äúclean‚Äù operating system, by the way, is far from the old version, a high-quality camera and a tenacious battery. </p><p>  He is not without flaws.  Moreover, of the previously announced - it is rather a low-resolution display and too ‚Äújuicy‚Äù AMOLED.  But in practice, other shortcomings emerged.  Not always a successful assembly, problems with the speaker (not all) and average performance.  Now the phone costs 15 thousand rubles, regardless of the color of the case.  And this is a fair price. </p>
