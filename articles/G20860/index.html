  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to attach a card to a qiwi wallet: instructions and possible errors</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many are familiar with the Qiwi payment system (Qiwi).  It allows you to easily make various electronic payments.  Using the Qiwi system, you can replenish the balance of your mobile phone, repay loans, pay fines, utilities, etc. Money transfers are also available in it.  For maximum convenience, it is recommended to attach a card to the Qiwi electronic wallet.  How to do it?  We will deal with this issue. </p><h2>  Benefits from binding a card </h2><p>  First, let's see why you should bind a card to an electronic wallet.  For example, you often pay online for purchases and services.  On different sites you enter the data of your plastic card.  It's not safe.  Attackers can steal this information and take advantage of it.  You risk losing money stored on the card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creditsuite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card Requirements" class="if uuid-3184103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3184103.jpg"></div><p>  Think about how to attach a card to a Qiwi wallet.  By following this procedure, you exclude the possibility of theft of card data and money from the account.  After linking, you no longer need to indicate the card number, its expiration date, and cvc code to pay for goods and services on websites.  You will only enter the details of the electronic wallet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you wish, you can issue a virtual Kiwi card, which has a common balance with an electronic wallet.  This procedure will only take you a couple of minutes.  A virtual card can also protect you from scammers, because when paying you will enter the data of a virtual card, not a plastic one.  After making the necessary purchases, you can close the existing virtual card and issue a new one. </p><h2>  Suitable for binding cards </h2><p>  To successfully attach a Sberbank card (like any other bank) to a Qiwi wallet, read the current conditions.  So, you can attach to the wallet cards belonging to the payment systems MIR, MasterCard, VISA.  Be sure to pay attention to the phone number that you used when registering with Qiwi payment system.  You can attach a Russian bank card if your wallet is registered to a Russian number. </p><p>  For a successful link, the balance of your card must be positive.  Make sure in advance that the account has an amount of at least 20 rubles.  The fact is that to confirm the binding, the bank blocks a random amount of up to 20 rubles.  Subsequently, this amount is returned to the card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zzoob.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map binding instructions" class="if uuid-3184105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3184105.jpg"></div><h2>  Map binding instructions </h2><p>  If you do not know how to attach a card to a Qiwi wallet, go to the payment system interface using your username (phone number) and password.  Take a look at the top menu.  It includes the fields ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù, ‚ÄúTransfers‚Äù, ‚ÄúTop-up wallet‚Äù, ‚ÄúBank cards‚Äù, ‚ÄúWithdraw money‚Äù, ‚ÄúMore ...‚Äù.  You need a section related to bank cards.  Click on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You will see a page.  The first thing that catches your eye is the buttons for creating a virtual card and issuing a special plastic card from Qiwi.  On the right side, in a small frame, binding of cards of other banks is proposed.  Click on the Link Map link.  Fill in all the opened fields - card number, expiration date, cvc-code.  Next, click the button that confirms the binding.  After some time, a notification about the successful completion of the procedure will be displayed on the screen. </p><h2>  Binding Errors </h2><p>  In some cases, the binding procedure may result in an error message.  This happens in 2 cases: </p><ul><li>  the person was mistaken when entering the card details; </li><li>  the card does not meet the requirements established in the payment system. </li></ul><p>  How to attach a card to a Qiwi wallet without any problems?  Carefully enter the details.  Remember that the card must have a ruble account.  Also often errors occur due to lack of balance.  The bank cannot deduct a small amount from the card for verification, and because of this, the binding procedure is interrupted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thinkittheninkit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Errors associated with map binding" class="if uuid-3184108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3184108.jpg"></div><p>  The question of how to attach a bank card to a Qiwi wallet is often confusing.  But, as you can see, this is not so difficult.  Allow this procedure only 5 minutes of free time.  After linking, you can comfortably use an electronic wallet and safely make purchases and pay for services online. </p>
