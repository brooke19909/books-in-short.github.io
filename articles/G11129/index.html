This type of territorial unit lasted until 1929.  In this way, the division of the territory of the state into smaller administrative units was carried out, similar to regional division. </p><h2>  The history of the emergence of Smolensk province </h2><p>  During the creation of eight provinces by Peter I in 1708, Smolensk province was formed among others.  The lands of this region were previously part of one territorial entity and were located in the European part of the country.  Smolensk province lasted until 1929, subsequently becoming a region during the reformation of the territory of the <span>Soviet Union.</span>  The main provincial city was Smolensk. </p>

    <p>  The specific location of the lands of this territorial unit of Tsarist Russia ensured the neighborhood and economic activity with most of the other provinces. </p><p>  The province was bordered by the following lands: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Tver province (north and northeast); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Moscow and Kaluga (from the east); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Oryol (from south - east); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Chernihiv (from the south); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mogilev (from the west); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Vitebsk and Pskov (from the north-west). </p><h2>  Land reformation </h2><p>  The newly formed Smolensk province numbered about seventeen cities.  The largest of them: Roslavl, Smolensk, Bely, Vyazma, Dorogobuzh.  However, in 1713 the province was disbanded, its largest part went to the provincial part of the Riga province. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Subsequently, thirteen years later, it was partially restored.  It consisted of five counties: Dorogobuzh, Belsky, Smolensky, Vyazemsky and Roslavl. <br>  A little later (in 1775) the province was reformed into Smolensk governorate.  Due to territorial changes, seven new counties were included: Kasplyansky, Yelninsky, Krasninsky, Gzhatsky, Sychevsky, Porechsky, Ruposovsky.  A few years later, Ruposovsky and Kasplin counties were transformed into Yukhnovsky and Dukhovshchinsky.  And only in 1796 the governorship was reformatted again into the province. </p>

    <p>  Only here did buckwheat, barley and millet grow.  For the first time, the Smolensk Agrarian Society was created for the formation of agriculture.  There were warehouses of agricultural machinery and implements.  The introduction of a plow to replace the plow was very productive.  The guns made by local craftsmen were not inferior to the factory standard. </p><p>  By 1880, 954 factories and plants were operating in Smolensk province.  In the next eighteen years, the number of factories and plants increased by eight hundred units.  In particular, the dairies developed and improved, which were most of all in the eastern counties of the province. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  About 1000 years ago, it became clear that for the effective functioning of the state, division into administrative-territorial units is necessary.  The first mentions date back to the 10th century AD.  Princess Olga divided the Novgorod lands into graveyards.  Later in the 15th century, Ivan the Terrible divided the Novgorod territory into pyatins.  At the beginning of the 18th century, the concept of provinces and counties was introduced.  They became the prototype of modern areas and districts. </p>
