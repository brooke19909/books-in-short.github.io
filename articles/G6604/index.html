  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Individual and group excursions in Montenegro: reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are planning a trip to Montenegro, then you are probably considering a vacation plan.  After all, every tourist wants to see as many attractions as possible on vacation.  For inexperienced travelers who are traveling to the country for the first time, it is worth knowing about what excursions in Montenegro are and what you can do on vacation.  This is what we want to talk about in our article. </p><h2>  Individual and group trips </h2><p>  For those who want to see the country, it is worth taking individual or group excursions in Montenegro.  There are significant differences between these two types of travel. </p><p>  Upon arrival at the hotel, as a rule, the representative of the tour operator offers numerous trips around the country and abroad.  The peculiarity of group excursions in Montenegro, as, indeed, in any other country, is that a group of people is recruited, and tourists are collected throughout the resort.  And after the bus goes on a trip.  The quality of such a trip depends on many factors.  It is very important which guide will lead the tour.  And the contingent of tourists is no less important.  As a rule, people who are late and delay absolutely everyone always come across in a group.  <span>Sightseeing tours</span> are standard in nature, so there can be no deviations from the route. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.montenegropulse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sightseeing Tours" class="if uuid-2303638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2303638.jpg"></div><p>  Private excursions in Montenegro are a completely different option.  An individual guide works for you, who will be at your complete disposal throughout the trip.  The advantages of such an excursion are that, according to your desire, the guide can change the travel program, throwing out not everything that is not interesting for you, and supplement it with a visit to the desired places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, individual excursions in Montenegro are very popular.  Local guides, as a rule these are immigrants from the countries of the former Soviet Union, offer quite various routes.  If the price for group trips is standard, then with an individual guide you can easily bargain by reducing the price or including a trip to visit additional attractions.  Before an individual trip, the guide will tell you about all the nuances.  Such excursions are conducted in comfortable cars or in a small minibus if you want to go with your family or company. </p><p>  Unlike a group trip, you will not call in all the participants, but immediately go to the right place.  Another advantage of individual excursions in Montenegro is to stay in interesting places and take good pictures.  Usually such trips are more interesting, rich and thoughtful.  The guide is directly interested in making people enjoy the trip in order to have new customers in the future. </p><h2>  Where to get excursions? </h2><p>  If you are interested in holidays and excursions in Montenegro, then it is worth considering where you will purchase trips to the sights of the country.  In general, there are a lot of options, each of which has its pros and cons.  It is fashionable to purchase any trip while still at home through a single base of tours.  It contains all the possible offers from companies and private guides licensed.  The resource is verified, and therefore it can be trusted.  True, you will be asked to make a certain prepayment, for example, in the amount of 20% of the cost.  This option is very convenient.  In addition, a flexible discount system is always offered on Internet resources.  The only inconvenience is that there is always a risk that your plans may change.  Otherwise, this way of ordering trips is very good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many tourists prefer the old fashioned way to travel already at the place of rest.  For example, you can buy excursions from Budva or Becici in Montenegro almost everywhere.  They are sold everywhere.  All company IDs offer the same tours at the same prices.  However, it is worth remembering that beach barkers do not always report all the pitfalls, for example, about hidden payments.  During the tour you can find out that you need to pay extra entrance fees to attractions or lunch. </p><h2>  Varieties of excursions </h2><p>  It is worth noting that all sightseeing tours can be conditionally divided into trips to historical places, sea trips, trips to natural attractions.  Also, do not forget about such a popular destination as excursions from Montenegro to other countries.  They are also in great demand, because for one vacation, tourists manage to at least briefly get acquainted with several countries.  Such trips are possible both as part of a group and individually. </p><h2>  Canyons of Montenegro </h2><p>  Where can I go on a tour in Montenegro from Budva or Becici?  For tourists from the main resort centers are open all directions.  You can choose for yourself absolutely any trip.  According to reviews of excursions in Montenegro, the country's most popular canyons are.  During the trip, tourists visit two famous canyons of the country formed by the Tara and Moraca rivers.  As for the Moraca River, it has a length of about one hundred kilometers.  Its course is swift, with waterfalls and rapids.  Travelers' road will run along steep cliffs above the river.  But the canyon Tara is considered the deepest in Europe.  Here you can admire the famous <span>Djurdzhevich bridge.</span>  As a rule, tourists are invited to lunch in the city of Zabljak, after which the tour continues in the Durmitor National Park, where there are eighteen lakes of glacial origin.  All of them are located in a rather small area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="photoblog.wildernesstravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canyons of Montenegro" class="if uuid-2303649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2303649.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of <span>excursions in Montenegro, a trip to the</span> canyons is very eventful and interesting.  But many vacationers note that it is much preferable to choose an individual tour.  This will allow you to fully enjoy the beauty of canyons, make impressive photos. </p><h2>  Montenegro </h2><p>  Popular destinations include a trip to religious and historical sites.  The tour covers a visit to the ancient capital of the country of Cetinje, as well as the monastery, which stores part of the Holy Cross and the Hand of John the Baptist.  The second part of the trip includes a visit to the city of Kotor, located on the coast of the Gulf of Kator.  Tourists are also brought to the village of Negushi to get to know the life of the local population.  Here you can taste the famous Negus sausages and cheeses, as well as drinks such as raki and wine. </p><h2>  From Montenegro to Dubrovnik </h2><p>  Excursions from Montenegro to other countries are no less in demand than traveling around the country.  For tourists, a large enough selection of tours is offered, allowing you to see the nearest regions.  So, for example, you can go on a tour from Montenegro to Dubrovnik (Croatia).  The trip takes one day.  It is best to make it from Herceg Nova, since the city is only fifty kilometers away.  Such tours are organized by almost all travel companies.  Dubrovnik is worth a look.  He is incredibly beautiful and original.  You can walk around the old part for hours, exploring the stunning narrow streets and old houses with fortified walls.  No less interesting for tourists is the beautiful promenade of Dubrovnik.  Not far from the historical center is a park.  A city tour usually begins with a visit to the observation deck, from which the most important sights are visible.  Then guests are shown the Lodge Square with a fountain, the city hall, the Franciscan monastery, the princely palace, the city harbor and the fort of St.  Ivana, the Dominican monastery and the first pharmacy in Europe. </p><p>  You can also visit the dolphinarium aquarium in the city center.  In the institution you can see the most diverse marine inhabitants of the Adriatic.  Guests can visit the sea museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flyedelweiss.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Excursion to Dubrovnik" class="if uuid-2303652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2303652.jpg"></div><p>  But the sea excursion acquired on the promenade will allow you to take a boat ride to the nearby islands.  The excursion from Montenegro to Croatia is very exciting.  Tourists recommend bringing chocolate, figs and local wine from Croatia with them.  Of course, just one day is not enough to visit Dubrovnik.  In order to see all the most interesting, you need to spend at least two to three days. </p><h2>  Trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina </h2><p>  If desired, tourists can also go on an excursion from Montenegro to Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Group travel is usually designed for one day.  According to tourists, it is less tiring than visiting the <span>canyons of Montenegro.</span>  Sometimes people have a slightly biased attitude towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which the war died out not so long ago.  But a beautiful country is worthy of the attention of guests.  There really is something to see here.  The closest neighbor of Montenegro is beautiful and interesting.  To visit her you will have to take a passport with you.  Experienced tourists note that an individual excursion from Montenegro to Bosnia and Herzegovina is still preferable.  Independent travel will allow you to see the most interesting places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bosnia and Herzegovina" class="if uuid-2303654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2303654.jpg"></div><p>  The standard program involves visiting the city of Trebinje.  Tourists are shown the old part of the city and the Church of the Annunciation.  Next, guests leave for the ancient Tvrdosh monastery, which is known for its fifteenth-century wine cellars.  Here the monks still produce <span>Vranac wine</span> and Vinyak cognac from their own grapes.  By the way, the cellar data is open not only for visiting, but also for tasting. </p><p>  Further tourists will enjoy a walk during which you can buy delicious home-made products of local production. </p><h2>  Travel to Albania </h2><p>  Everyone can also go on an excursion from Montenegro to Albania.  After crossing the borders of the two countries, contrast is sharply noticeable.  It immediately catches the eye.  Albania is now the poorest country in Europe.  And yet she is beautiful.  It is worth seeing the city of Shkodra.  Here, tourists can visit the ancient fortress of Europe, Rosafa.  It existed safely 500 years before Christ.  Near the fortress is the Lead Mosque and Sheikh Zamil Mosque.  In the center is a museum of photography and archaeological finds.  Once, Shkoder was the country's most influential religious center, as evidenced by temples and mosques. </p><div class="photo" data-original="albania.al" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tour to Albania" class="if uuid-2303658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2303658.jpg"></div><p>  Then tourists are offered to visit Tirana - the capital of the country.  Once the city was founded by the Turkish governor Suleiman.  All excursions here begin from the central square.  Next, guests are invited to visit the Tirana History Museum or walk through the local market, which is exactly similar to the eastern bazaars. </p><h2>  From Montenegro to Italy </h2><p>  Montenegro in a sense is a unique country.  From it you can go to a variety of neighboring states, even for one day.  But the most fascinating can be called an excursion from Montenegro to Italy.  It is in this country that regular ferry services are established.  During the tourist season, all guides offer a one-day trip to Italy.  In fact, in the country you will be really full day, but by this time it is worth adding two more nights spent on the ferry.  He sends from the city of Bar.  The length of stay on the ferry leaves ten hours. </p><p>  By the way, trips to Italy are incredibly popular, since a separate tour to the Apennine Peninsula costs tourists much more.  Travelers go to Italy not only for shopping, but also for sightseeing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripinview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="From Montenegro to Italy" class="if uuid-2303660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2303660.jpg"></div><p>  The ferry leaves the city of Bar, and in the morning it arrives in Bari.  The standard excursion program includes a visit to the Swabian castle of the era of Frederick III, Tetra Piccini, the Cathedral of St.  Sabio.  Tourists are also given the opportunity to walk through the cobbled narrow streets, and then visit Farrapezi Square and the beautiful promenade.  The excursion to visit the Cathedral of St.  Nicholas.  In general, a walk around the city takes about an hour and a half.  But after lunch, tourists are taken to the town of Alberobello or Matera.  On the way, guests are offered to buy wines and souvenirs. </p><h2>  A fascinating journey through the bay </h2><p>  The selection of entertainment and excursions in Montenegro is simply amazing.  Among other activities, you can go on a pleasure boat to ride on the bay.  Many tourists note that a trip to the Herceg Novi Gulf is one of the most memorable adventures. </p><p>  It‚Äôs hard to imagine, but you‚Äôll ride on a small cruise ship all day long.  You will have an amazing opportunity not only to admire the natural beauties, but also to swim in the open sea.  Tourists visit the town of Herceg Novi, the presidential beach of Janine and the Blue Cave.  By the way, the price includes breakfast and lunch.  During the trip, the guides tell a lot about the history of Staraya. </p><h2>  Kotor Bay Travel </h2><p>  Another sea voyage can be made along the Bay of Kotor.  The bay itself is very beautiful.  During the tour there is enough time to admire it.  During the trip, tourists are invited to visit the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, located on the cliff of the man-made island.  They say that every year local residents strengthen and expand the island, dropping stones from boats. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.contactyachts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Boat ride" class="if uuid-2303661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2303661.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists can appreciate the beauty of the interior of the church.  Then the guests are taken by the same ship to the city of Kotor, also located on the coast of the bay.  It was once built by the Venetians, as evidenced by its appearance.  Tourists have plenty of time for walking around Kotor.  But on the way back, unfortunately, travelers are transported by bus, and not by sea. </p><h2>  Skadar Lake </h2><p>  A popular excursion among tourists is a visit to Skadar Lake.  The largest body of water in the Balkans is located in the continental part of Montenegro.  Passing the coastal mountains, you immediately get to the beautiful lake, which is part of the national park.  Fresh water separates Montenegro and Albania.  The lake is a real historical monument for the population.  It offers tourists a lot of entertainment: boating, walking and more.  The pond is known for its unique fauna and flora.  If you want to enjoy the natural beauty of Montenegro, then you should definitely come to the lake, because there are preserved wild places not touched by human hands. </p><p>  The pond has an interesting history.  Back in the thirteenth century, the Turks captured it and controlled the territory for five centuries.  And only in the second half of the nineteenth century the lake became Albanian, and in the twentieth became part of independent Montenegro. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about excursions </h2><p>  Montenegro is a terrific country, offering a fairly large selection of attractions.  Here you can visit stunning natural places and ancient temples.  But in what form to organize trips around the country - individually or in a group - of course, you decide. </p><p>  In our article we have given only some of the options for possible travel offered by travel companies.  In fact, the range of excursions is much larger and wider.  Among the great variety, you can choose the most interesting sights. </p><p>  All the resorts of Montenegro on every corner will offer you all kinds of trips.  In principle, their cost is the same everywhere, and the service too.  In the season, local guides do not make sense to deceive tourists, they are interested in making money.  But sometimes the quality of the excursion depends on the guide himself and on the assembled company on the bus.  Many travelers remain dissatisfied with group trips, as guides try to drive tourists, but in the end, the group still does not have time to go through all the places planned.  And the walk itself in the sights can be quite stressful.  In general, a lot depends on the quality of travel arrangements. </p><p>  More and more often tourists prefer individual excursions as a family or with friends.  According to holidaymakers, such trips are often even cheaper than group trips.  Indeed, an individual tour has several advantages.  Firstly, there is no need to wait for anyone, and secondly, anywhere you can be as long as you wish.  In addition, you can arrange a travel route in advance.  At your request, the guide may well change the route or make additions to it.  You also have the opportunity to choose the type of car on which you intend to go on a tour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.passporthealthglobal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Excursion trips in Montenegro" class="if uuid-2303662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2303662.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists recommend going to canyons only with an individual guide.  The ride itself is very busy and tiring.  And with a large crowd of people and fuzzy organization, unforeseen situations arise.  But an individual trip is more comfortable and not so tiring. </p><p> Individual excursions from Montenegro to other countries are no less in demand.  If you have a passport, border crossing does not cause problems.  In addition, experienced tourists still recommend allocating at least a few days to explore neighboring regions.  One day for Albania, Croatia is very little.  Therefore, it is worth giving them a little more time.  We hope that our information will be useful for you when choosing excursion tours in Montenegro and beyond. </p>
