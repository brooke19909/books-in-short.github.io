These actions are divided into reversible and <span>irreversible processes.</span>  If the process occurs due to the progress of the stage from the first to the next, then this action is called irreversible.  Self-organization is an example of such an action - an action of the development of the world, based on the principles of the "nature market". </p><p>  The participant in this market is the aggregate nature, which invents the latest methods of action, methods of organization, appropriate to the equality of systems.  One of the main properties of the market can be considered the ability to form a circle of feedback that determines the tendency to equal market.  From an economic point of view, the concept of the market is a very partial fact of the ‚Äúnature market‚Äù, which is, accordingly, a natural means of comparing different forms of organization of society. </p><p>  The market is characterized by different dynamic actions that occur in self-educated systems.  It can be considered an invention of mankind. </p>

    <h2>  Classification of dynamic actions </h2><p>  Dynamic actions are divided into 2 types: evolutionary and wave-like.  The first includes actions that cannot be repeated, the second, respectively, repeated actions.  Many fundamental sciences, including chemistry and physics, make reversible and irreversible processes paramount. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The evolutionary or irreversible actions are those significant changes that, even in the absence of various influences, proceed in a consistent direction.  For example, a constant trend of population growth, growth in total production, etc. </p><p>  Some dynamic, as well as thermodynamically reversible and irreversible processes, actions are applied by no means in comparison with the famous ideographic and nomographic points of view, as it may seem. </p><p>  All their structuring is in the planes of general theory and has absolutely nothing to do with ideography.  In the ideographic point of view, there is no possibility of establishing any laws.  Accordingly, such an opportunity is present in evolutionary action.  This action is not repeated only when it has a certain orientation, it does not have the ability to own two or more links that are in the same state or are at the same level. </p><p>  However, this does not mean that it is impossible to find a formula showing a sequence of moves from one part to the next.  So, the famous formulation of the unfolding system 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2n.  But this does not mean that this fact alone cannot be repeated in the indicated place and time, and it will not be repeated, from the nomographic point of view, at another time and in another place when reversible and irreversible processes are observed.  Entropy as a physical action in a thermal process is a prime example. </p><h2>  Wave processes </h2><p>  The wave-like (reversible, repeatable) actions are those actions of changes that have a specific direction in the current time span and change it every moment.  With reversibility, the action, being at a given instant in one state and after a while changing it, may eventually return to its original state.  For example, the movement of changes in market prices, the number of unemployed, interest on capital and others.  Of course, these economic elements of life can change in different directions.  Considering these changes as continuous, the movement of these oscillations can be represented in the form of a winding line, the direction of which at different moments will be different.  On this curve, you can easily see that, moving away from a point at the same height, after a certain period of time, you can pass a point at the same level.  However, this will not be the same, but another point, standing at the same height as the original one.  It will undoubtedly correspond to a completely different moment and a different structure of general economic conditions in demand, supply, production, distribution, etc. For the second point to completely coincide with the first, it is necessary that all the actions of fluctuations in economic reality are reversible, so that there is no opportunity to move forward or back so that the time category is not applicable to them.  Of course, it is indisputable that there is no such perfect reversibility in economic being, in it there are only isolated, obviously irreversible actions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  All actions are interconnected, therefore, it is necessary to take every move in connection with others, including irreversible ones, since at any moment there will undoubtedly be a fresh system of conditions in this or that connection.  It must be accepted that all movements of economic existence are irreversible.  In this case, it would also be necessary to recognize that all the actions of the fluctuations of nature are irreversible.  Therefore, the above remarks allow us to reject the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãabsolute reversibility.  Irreversible and reversible chemical processes, as well as actions occurring in physics, are based on the above criteria. </p><p>  It cannot be argued that in reality those and other actions proceed independently and separately.  You can only recognize their difference in principles and emphasize the distinction in the construction of academic research.  In order to highlight this idea, it is advisable to talk not about unconditionally, but about relatively reversible actions in economic existence.  We can conclude that in a relative sense one should discuss the reversible actions of changes in the components of economic life. </p><p>  Thoughts of reversible and irreversible actions, as well as thoughts of dynamics and statics, belong to natural science in the narrow sense of the word.  Reversible and irreversible processes in physics, examples of which are quite diverse, are essential in this science.  The same goes for chemistry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Relationship with economic components </h2><p>  A reversible and irreversible process is associated with the economy.  There are opinions about the correctness of the transfer of these ideas to economic ones.  But there are opinions that only terms and concepts are transferred. </p>

    <p>  The transfer of thoughts from one science to another is legitimate if it is scientifically fruitful, therefore, there is no other way out for solving this problem.  The facts of such a transfer take place.  There are especially many cases of transferring ideas from the sphere of social existence and sociology to the sphere of natural sciences.  So, some ideas and terms - power, law, value, principle of economy - were scientifically fruitful.  Therefore, one cannot object to their legitimacy.  During Mill, in the economy, borrowed the ideas of dynamics and statics, only the question arises: "Why would it be impossible to increase the range of use of thoughts of reversible and irreversible actions?" </p><p>  The acquisition of definitions from other sciences is almost always accompanied by their deepening or refinement, as well as a fundamental change.  In this case, the definitions and points of view are moved, increasing them, but without depriving the general meaning. </p><p>  According to the foregoing, it is impossible to talk about completely reversible actions in nature and in economic existence.  Here we are talking only about relatively reversible actions.  A reversible move in its pure form, in the conventional sense, is practically given only in a larger or smaller level of approximation.  With the idea on which reversible and irreversible processes, cycles are based, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe probability or impracticability of the renewal of the former state of elements and bodies or their system is connected.  The whole difference in both cases comes down to the following.  Reversible and irreversible processes in chemistry and physics have an act with the means of the same subject in the objective sense, this is not the case in economics.  When it is argued that the swing of the pendulum is a reversible action, then in this case we are talking about the same thing in the objective meaning of the pendulum, but this is not entirely correct.  There is no such equality in the economy. </p><p>  The thesis ‚Äúreversible and irreversible process‚Äù in the economy must be considered as an isolated case of a general concept. </p>

    <h2>  Addictions </h2><p>  When we consider the economic reality of a market capitalist society and its components, we have a logical question: to which of the indicated actions of change which components are prone to?  Almost all economic elements, taken separately or as a whole, are subject to quantitative and qualitative changes.  But while for some elements, for example, for organizing an economy, production technology, needs, etc., qualitative changes will be just as important as quantitative ones for other elements, such as price, discount percentage, rent, etc. e., quantitative changes will be of primary importance.  The significance of qualitative changes here acts mainly only when the nature of these elements changes, for example, when the price of free becomes set or from the market - monopoly. </p><p>  Finding out subsequently the relationship of economic components, their combination and reversible and irreversible processes, the circular process, the cycle, it is necessary to keep in mind the following.  Taken as a whole, economic reality is a whole stream of diverse and continuous quantitative and qualitative changes. </p><h2>  Processes in the national economy </h2><p>  In a holistic view, the course of economic development is seen as irreversible based on the fact that it contains any components that describe the curve of the irreversible course of change, for this reason it is allowed to argue that the course of development of the national economy, which takes place over time, does not happen much more than once per one and the same step. </p><p>  On the whole, the action of the national economy seems to be the irreversible action of the move from one step to another.  And therefore, the dilemma of changes in the national economy is, above all, the dilemma of the stages of its development.  So, the development movement of the national economy is considered irreversible, it follows that without interruption and without return the joint economic conditions for the course of change and any single component of the national economy change.  In the absolute sense, not a single economic element analyzed in relation to the whole complex of economic criteria can reveal a reversible course. </p>

    <p>  You can easily see and realize that the simple actions of the configurations of the economic sphere are significantly different, and that it is advisable to divide the elements into at least several groups.  Considered analytically separately, elements cannot be identified as capable of only irreversible changes.  A significant set of economic components, primarily value, for example, wages, commodity prices, and in-kind, such as the number of bankruptcies, the percentage of unemployed, exhibit reversible configuration effects. </p><h2>  Process separation </h2><p>  Reversible and irreversible processes, examples of which are easy to find in the economy, are ambiguous.  The configurations of such elements as the size of production, the number of people, the level of needs, technology, size of trade, reserves of capital, etc., consist of several components, have a complex structure.  One component is their overall growth, the other is the growth rate.  Considering the available factual material, in fact, it can be noted that the tendency to joint increase and formation of them implies an irreversible movement, which can stop only under the influence of force majeure.  On the other hand, the growth rate is a zigzag and is clearly a reversible action. </p><p>  The difference between the natural changes of the independent components of economic life is obvious and undeniable, and at the same time, only when taken into account can one recognize the kind of dynamics of financial life.  The presence of components that are subject to irreversible trends explains the reasons for the uniqueness of the national economic movement and gives a tape of continuous development.  Also, the establishment of elements and their components, subject to reversible wave-like changes, gives a chance to understand the swings that affect the whole national economy as a whole and the actions of its development.  In a concrete form, the national economic action of development is naturally unified.  However, the refusal to distinguish between the elementary actions of classification and the change of components in connection with their connection to these actions would mean, accordingly, the refusal of scientific research of a certain reality.  The above confirms the thermodynamically reversible and irreversible processes that occur in nature. </p><h2>  The specifics of the development of systems </h2><p>  A significant feature of the development of an arbitrary system is considered to be irreversibility, which manifests itself in a certain direction of its changes.  These changes imply taking into account the circumstances of time in the corresponding theory.  Formulas can be used to display actions that occur both in the present moment of time, and in the future, and in the past. </p><p>  D. S. Mill formulated the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãstatics and dynamics of actions in an explicit form.  It was based and pointed to reversible and irreversible processes, a circular process.  Originality or irreversibility means only the unreality of the configuration of the direction of actions in a specific period of time, which is typical for reversible actions. </p><p>  The difficulty of a certain economic reality leads to simplify it, to break away from most of its connections and features.  From this point of view, each economic concept provides only a conditionally true reflection of the corresponding part of economic reality. </p><p>  As a basis for analyzing economic development, a whole system of forming the financial activity of the community must be taken.  But an integrative general theory can only be built on the basis of a study of the development of separate concrete historical types of organization of economic activity. </p>

    <h2>  Equilibrium systems </h2><p>  A reversible and irreversible process from an economic point of view was considered by many scientists.  <span>F. Hayek</span> developed the idea that equilibrium in the market comes down to the mutual adaptation of personal plans and is executed according to the type that would be called ‚Äúnegative feedback‚Äù after the natural sciences. </p><p>  The definition of <span>negative feedback is</span> applicable to complex economic actions, which N. Kondratiev calls reversible.  Fluctuations in the economy, including periodic changes, such as costs, interest, wages, have been repeating over the years.  Fluctuations are divided into long, medium and short-term. </p><p>  The principle of negative feedback only shows how the unexpectedly appearing mode in the system is supported, but does not allow to detect the construction of the origin of the established order, as well as the transition from one stage of development to another.  For these purposes, it is necessary to strive for the principle of <span>positive feedback.</span>  In it, the advanced changes that are formed in the system are amplified and accumulated.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which theory is subject to unexpected deviations from balance, but if it is in a variable state, due to interaction with the environment, these wiggles are aggravated and ultimately lead to the acceleration of the past routine and device.  On the other hand, as a result of the interaction, the components of the old system come to a coordinated behavior, due to which joint actions appear in the system and a new order and a fresh ratio are formed. </p><p>  The emergence of aggregate actions, as well as the formation and progress of new structures, is associated with the facts of chance, which sequentially lead to the unsteadiness of the system. </p><p>  The market is an open system in which there is a continuous interaction between buyers and consumers, sellers and manufacturers.  Both random and spontaneous order reigns in the market. ,             ,    .          ,        ,       . </p>
