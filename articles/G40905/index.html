    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  ‚ÄúBeeline Bonus‚Äù is, as already mentioned, a special promotion that is held among all Beeline subscribers.  You could say something like an affiliate program.  You are credited with certain points for simply using communication services. </p><p>  It turns out that Beeline Bonuses for replenishing an account is not a fairy tale.  The funds received can be spent at your discretion.  But with some limitations.  Please note that points are only stored for 6 months.  Then they burn out.  And you have to recruit new ones.  You can receive up to 15% of the amount spent per month for communication services of a mobile operator.  A tempting offer, right?  But how to use bonuses?  Beeline offers several options.  About them a little later. </p><h2>  Share with loved ones </h2><p>  It is worth noting immediately that the participants of the action have the opportunity to replenish bonuses of relatives.  That is, you can transfer points to another account.  This is not so difficult to do.  But you have to consider some limitations.  For example, the minimum transfer is 10 bonuses, and the maximum is 3,000 per day.  For spending your comrades will be given only 30 days.  After that, unspent points disappear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Beeline Bonus is transferred to the account of another subscriber using a special request.  It looks like this: * 767 * number amount #.  In this case, the phone is written starting at 9, and the desired number of points is written with a space.  A few minutes of waiting - and you list the bonuses received to a friend.  A non-standard, sometimes even useful feature.  You do not have to think again how to use Beeline bonuses.  In this case, this is already the concern of the person to whom you transferred the funds. </p><h2>  The remainder </h2><p>  It should be noted further that not all subscribers are aware of how the residual points are checked on the account.  This is an important point to consider.  After all, if you do not have enough bonuses for a particular goal, it simply can not be realized.  The bottom line is disappointment. </p><p>  Checks the balance that is available on the account of the Beeline Bonus promotion on your phone using the USSD command.  Just dial * 767 * 2 # and wait for the SMS message, which displays all the points.  Sometimes the result is simply displayed. </p><h2>  Communication costs </h2><p>  We scored Beeline bonuses.  How to spend them now?  There are several approaches to solving this question.  And the first one is the payment of communication.  That is, you can accumulate points, and then pay them for calls, Internet and messages from a mobile phone.  Quite an interesting offer, which is in great demand among subscribers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Limitations are also here.  Firstly, the service is valid for 30 days.  After this period, you will have to reconnect it.  Secondly, if you suddenly do not have enough points on your balance sheet, then the rest of the expenses will be written off in monetary terms.  So keep that in mind. </p><p>  In order to spend Beeline Bonus on paying for a mobile operator‚Äôs connection, you need to activate this service.  This will help a special request.  You must dial * 789 # and send the command for processing.  Nothing more is required of you.  The main thing, remember - you need to monitor the balance of bonuses.  Otherwise, you will have to pay for communication in rubles.  But as soon as new points appear, they will again begin to be debited from your account.  Very comfortably. </p><h2>  Purchases </h2><p>  We have Beeline bonuses.  How to spend them differently?  And in general, can this be done?  Of course.  For example, all subscribers have the right to spend points to pay for transactions made in Beeline offices. </p>

    <p>  Of course, some restrictions have a place to be.  For example, you are able to cover only 10% of the purchase.  And the promotion does not apply to all goods.  Practice calls that most often, subscribers are invited to buy a gadget and modem "at a discount."  In this case, you also need to remember: 1 bonus is 1 ruble. </p><p>  To implement the idea, you must inform the employee about the intention to use the <span>"Happy Time" ("Beeline")</span> bonuses when purchasing equipment or a gadget <span>.</span>  After - name the desired amount of funds to be debited.  But no more than 10% of the purchase price.  The store employee will do all the necessary manipulations to realize your desires.  It turns out a kind of discount.  Sometimes this opportunity really interests many buyers.  Especially if they have a lot of points. </p><h2>  Help Partners </h2><p>  How to use Beeline bonuses with even greater benefits, if possible?  It's no secret that partner stores participate in any promotion.  And Beeline offers to make purchases from accumulated points from time to time.  But, as in the past case, with some limitations.  Often, the subscriber can cover only 20% of the transaction. </p>

    <p>  The process of using bonuses is no different from the previous one.  Come to a partner store, make a purchase, and name the number of points to be debited.  Be sure to include your phone number.  We get a kind of discount, pay and rejoice. </p><p>  But this scheme has its own drawback.  After all, affiliate programs are a rather rare occurrence.  To spend Beeline bonuses in such organizations, you will have to constantly follow the news on the official website of the mobile operator.  Plus, most often partners are mobile equipment stores and gadgets.  In principle, most products can also be purchased at Beeline stores. </p><h2>  Opinion about the action </h2><p>  What do subscribers think about ongoing promotions and bonuses?  Deciding here is quite difficult.  Someone says that he‚Äôs not completely satisfied, but to someone this proposal seems very tempting. </p><p>  In general, subscribers are really happy that they can receive Beeline bonuses for their calls.  Yes, spending them is sometimes difficult.  But, nevertheless, you can always find an alternative solution.  If you don‚Äôt know how to apply the Beeline Bonus at all, then the most logical way out is to transfer points to your loved ones. </p><p>  By the way, connecting the option "Happy Time" for subscribers who have been working with Beeline for a long time will be most beneficial.  After all, they will be able to receive 15% of the committed expenses.  In general, new users are offered only 5% of the total spending.  Not too much, but that may also be enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline replenishment bonuses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1127006.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Disappointing subscribers, perhaps, is that the Beeline Bonus cannot fully cover all purchases that are made in cellular offices, as well as in partner stores.  10 and 20% is too little.  That is how a large mass of program participants assures.  Nevertheless, you should connect this option to yourself.  You never know when you need it!  You already know how to use Beeline bonuses.  So, they will always find application. </p>
