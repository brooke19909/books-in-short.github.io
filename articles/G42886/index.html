For example, if your device is already purchased with a navigation program.  She paves the route on maps pre-set by the manufacturer.  The basic set depends on what kind of navigator you have.  That is, cards designed to work with Navitel will not work with Garmin, and vice versa. </p><p>  With all of the above, talking about the basic set, you should understand some of its specifics.  It may not contain maps of some regions required by the user.  Then, of course, you should know how to load maps in the navigator additionally.  There are several ways to do this.  One of these methods is to purchase licensed cards, or you can download them for free from the Internet. </p><p>  Unofficial maps of different regions are mainly developed on the basis of existing ones.  They are made by advanced users of navigators and, as a rule, the installation of unofficial maps is without technical support and updates.  In addition, they should be read by your navigation program, suit it in format. </p><p>  How to load maps into the navigator, where better to get them.  A good resource by which they are created is "OpenStreetMap".  The following important remark should be taken into account: installing unofficial maps on your navigator is associated with a certain amount of risk.  Accordingly, you should first take care to create backup copies of all available data on your personal computer.  Confidence that the software is functional and will not adversely affect the device can be obtained by the purchase and installation of official cards. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to load maps into the navigator, step by step we will consider the example of <span>installing the</span> <span>Navitel</span> GPS <span>-maps</span> : </p><p>  <strong>Step One:</strong> Connect the device to your personal computer.  If the program proposed as an example is located on a flash card, it should be removed from the navigator and opened on a PC.  We will work with her. <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  <strong>Step Two:</strong> On the flash card, you need to create (in the root) a special folder in which third-party maps for the navigator will be placed.  You can call it traditionally UserMaps. </p><p>  <strong>Step Three:</strong> In the created "UserMaps" folder, you need to create a subfolder.  A map of the corresponding region will be placed in it.  You can give it the name "Region". </p><p>  <strong>Fourth step:</strong> Files of the necessary map are copied to the newly created "Region" folder. </p><p>  <strong>Step Five: The</strong> flash card must be returned to the navigator and open the Navitel program on it.  As a result of the manipulations, a menu will appear. </p><p>  <strong>Step six:</strong> In the menu that appears, in the Navitel program proposed as an example, we are interested in the item that allows you to create a new atlas.  At the bottom of the window we find the icon with the image of the folder and click on it with the right mouse button. </p><p>  <strong>Seventh step:</strong> Following the previous recommendations, you will see a new window.  You will need to find the "Region" folder if you gave it that name.  It's about the folder where the new maps are saved.  We click on it, and then we should select the team with which the atlas is created - "Create Atlas".  Its creation will be performed automatically, and you just have to click the button with a checkmark.  That‚Äôs practically all.  In the list, select the desired atlas and use the new maps! </p><p>  How to load maps into the navigator using the example of free "Garmin" (Garmin): </p><ul><li>  The MapSource program must be downloaded and installed on the PC from Garmin.com. </li><li>  You need to download the necessary "Garmin" cards and place (unpack) them in special folders. </li><li>  Each card must be installed separately using the "Install" installation file. </li><li>  MapSource starts up, in which previously installed maps are detected. </li><li>  Available are visible at the top left.  All the necessary ones are selected in turn and sent to the "Garmin" device.  Accordingly, it must be connected in advance. </li></ul><p>  Thus, we examined the installation of a number of maps that are very popular in the navigator. </p>
