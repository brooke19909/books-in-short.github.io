    <h2>  About the line </h2><p>  Conventionally, the products of the Nokia company are currently divided into three segments.  The first of these is entry-level devices that only allow you to make calls and receive (or send) SMS.  They are indicated by three or four digits.  In common parlance, they are simply called "dialers."  The second group of devices is the Asha line.  It includes inexpensive and affordable devices.  They have basic functionality, which is quite enough for everyday use.  As the name implies, the Nokia Asha 210 <strong> </strong>  belongs to this particular device group.  The third segment is Lumiya smartphones.  Basically, this manufacturer produces devices running the Windows operating system (although there are exceptions).  Moreover, such devices can solve almost all problems.  But their cost is many times higher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The outstanding technical specifications of the Nokia Asha 210 <strong> </strong>  can't brag.  It is not surprising.  The device belongs to the intermediate class.  Available all the necessary functions, but there is nothing superfluous.  The main "trick" of this gadget is a full-fledged keyboard of the "YTsUKEN" format (in the English version it is designated as QWERTY).  That is, for each individual character has its own key.  It‚Äôs convenient for some subscribers to communicate precisely with the help of such devices (for example, on social networks), and this gadget is primarily focused on them.  An additional bonus is the support of two SIM cards in standby mode.  There is also the ability to play MP3 songs and listen to radio stations.  The latter can only be done with headphones connected, which in this case are the antenna.  The camera in this device is more than modest - only 2 megapixels.  You can‚Äôt expect phenomenal shots from her, but if necessary, with her help you can get a fairly high-quality picture.  The screen size is very small - only 2.4 inches.  At the same time, its resolution is 240 pixels in height and 320 pixels in width.  However, there is no support for touch input.  The type of matrix used is TFT.  Of course, this is not the best option for today, but this disadvantage is compensated by the affordable cost in comparison with analogues.  Today's price is $ 85.  For comparison: a similar device from BlackBerry costs several times more expensive - $ 350.  Of course, it is positioned as a smartphone.  But the lack of software for the QNX operating system will not fully reveal its potential.  So it turns out that the device from Nokia does not lose much to this smartphone, and the price varies significantly, which is important. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Let's continue the review of Nokia Asha 210 Dual and consider all available ways to connect to this device.  And here things are going well with the monitored device.  There is support for Wi-Fi (for connecting to the global Web) and Bluetooth (allows you to transfer data to other similar devices).  There is no support for third-generation networks, but there is only GSM, that is, 2G.  Given the special technology for compressing Internet pages with a built-in browser, a speed of several hundred kilobytes per second is quite enough for a comfortable viewing of content.  Also, the device is equipped with a standard 3.5 mm jack for connecting an external speaker system.  For charging and connecting to a computer, a microUSB connector is used, which today has become the standard for most mobile devices. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  With the built-in memory, Nokia Asha 210 Dual is doing very poorly.  The feedback from the many owners of such gadgets around the Internet is another confirmation of this.  Only 32 kilobytes are integrated into the telephone, which is very small.  The only way to solve the existing problem is to install an external microSD card.  The phone is equipped with an appropriate connector and supports drives up to 32 GB.  Therefore, when buying a new such device, it is imperative to purchase it.  Otherwise, it will not be possible to fully reveal the capabilities of this device.  There are no other ways to increase the amount of memory in this device. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  This line of mobile phones uses a pre-installed operating system.  It is also called proprietary.  In our case, this is the ‚ÄúSeries 40‚Äù.  This limits the functionality of the Nokia Asha 210. Applications that can be installed on a mobile phone are compatible only with this platform.  In the basic configuration are standard programs that allow you to fully work in such popular social networks as Twitter and Facebook.  The rest of the applications will have to be installed either from a specialized Nokia store or from third-party sources.  The latter option is not recommended, because along with such software malware can also get on your phone.  Certain complaints are caused by synchronization with a personal computer using the PC Suite utility.  Given the fact that Nokia is absorbed by Microsoft and all developments in the Asha line are being phased out, there is no reason to expect changes for the better.  But the problem of data transfer can be solved using Wi-Fi technology.  It works flawlessly on this phone. </p>

    <h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Now consider the housing of the Nokia Asha 210. A review without this would be incomplete.  All modern models of this manufacturer are equipped with multi-colored plastic cases.  This device is no exception in this regard.  Now on sale there are yellow, blue, black and white modifications.  It should be noted right away that scratches and dirt easily ‚Äústick‚Äù to them.  So you just need to buy a case and a protective film.  Case type - monoblock. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The phone comes with a battery capacity of 1200 milliamps / hours.  Its capacity is enough for a full day of active communication using Nokia Asha 210. The feedback from the owners of this mobile phone only confirms this.  With a less intense load, its resource will last for 3-4 days.  When playing an MP3 composition or listening to the radio, it will ensure the operation of the device for 24 hours.  Be that as it may, the battery is the strength of this device. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Regarding the prospects of the Nokia Asha 210, everything is clear.  This model, like the brand itself, will go into oblivion in the foreseeable future.  Smartphones and more advanced mobile phones are getting cheaper.  As a result, selling such entry-level devices is not profitable.  Therefore, only stocks remain.  If you want to become the proud owner of this gadget, then you need to hurry.  And so - a good device at a reasonable price, and even with the support of two SIM cards.  It has the following disadvantages: a lack of internal memory, a weak camera, a small screen, and problems connecting to a PC through specialized software.  In most cases, these remarks are either insignificant (for example, regarding a camera or a small screen), or they can be resolved without problems.  At the same time, the price of $ 85 is quite affordable for the Nokia Asha 210. Review on this <strong> </strong>  You can safely finish. </p>
