On its way, it creates incredibly beautiful landscapes, and this paradise is considered one of the most delightful natural sites of the peninsula. </p><p>  This is a wild and not very popular place among tourists, which is a deep gorge with a fabulous river, sandwiched between giant rocks.  Unfortunately, not every Crimean citizen has heard of the canyon, and it is necessary to talk about the amazing natural attractions that create an atmosphere of peace of mind. </p><h2>  Picturesque gorge </h2><p>  The not very famous Uzundzha canyon (Crimea), located near the village of Rodnikovoye, is beautiful at any time of the year.  In winter, when the snow-white cover completely wraps it up, it looks rather severe, and in the sunny summer, the slopes on which St. John's wort blooms acquire a beautiful emerald-yellow color. </p><p>  In spring, tourists admire the numerous cascades, and when there is no water, the riverbed is exposed and you can see the smooth stones composing it.  Their surface is covered with calcareous tuff plaque, and even an ordinary bottle thrown into the water by the not the most accurate tourist is covered with a dense whitish crust.  Snowdrops bloom here, and areas littered with snow alternate with green meadows that are on the sunny side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="uzunzha canyon how to get" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1693823.jpg" width="600"></div>

The channel of water artery flowing from the slopes of high mountains into the <span>Baydar Valley is</span> filled only in spring, when snowmelt begins, or in rainy autumn.  But in the summer, the flow becomes less intense, and already in June, few tourists see pathetic trickles that dry out after a month. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uzunge Canyon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1693832.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is amazing how a small rivulet struck in the mountains for many years on its way such a picturesque canyon of Uzundzha, the landscape of which is more reminiscent of the Carpathians than Crimea. </p><h2>  Skelskaya cave </h2><p>  Here is the <span>Skelskaya cave,</span> which was discovered at the beginning of the last century by local residents.  The speleological group found that the length of the underground grottoes is 700 meters, and their depth exceeds 90. </p><p>  Located near the village, the cave is readily visited by all guests of the Crimea, as a result of which it was seriously damaged at the hands of vandals.  In the 90s it was equipped for tourists, they had good lighting, and you can get inside only with an experienced instructor and for a fee.  After the collapse, she was locked for a year, and only a few years ago the excursions resumed, so everyone who visits the canyon of the Uzundzha River will definitely get acquainted with the amazing underground world.  The high arches of the cave are decorated with sagging formations resembling <span>fantastic animals,</span> and in its very center is a real giant - a stalagmit called "Knight in Armor". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gigantic menhirs </h2><p>  The village of Kolkhoznoe is located in the spacious Uzundzha hollow, in which there is a children's sports camp, several summer cottages and a tourist guest house.  In its vicinity you can see three-meter stone giants, to which people come from different parts of the country to fulfill their cherished desires.  Archaeologists believe that the Skeleton menhirs appeared before our era and have a special energy. </p><p>  Behind the village begins the second part of the gorge, where there is no paved road.  Tourists first go along the trail, then along the riverbed, and in the spring it is not very easy to do this.  But in the fall or summer, when it is dry and there is no heavy rain, it is not difficult to move. </p><h2>  Transparent lake </h2><p>  The Uzunji riverbed is quite easy to overcome, but along the way there is a difficult section where the rocks meet, breaking off by sheer walls.  To pass, you must have special climbing skills and use the rope.  A little further is the confluence of the river with its tributary Topshanar, and 500 meters away you can see a small lake, which is filled with streams of ice water from the source of Suuk-Su.  Most tourists, having seen the green expanse, dream of diving, but the desire to swim disappears after the cold burns their feet.  On the lake, you can fill your eggplant with the purest drinking water of excellent quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uzungeja Canyon photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1693826.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Uzunge Cave </h2><p>  Near the lake there is Uzundzha cave with a very narrow entrance, turning into a rather low corridor, which will take a long crawl.  The underworld is a whole system of tunnels stretching for one and a half kilometers, no more than 50 centimeters wide.  There are no beautiful limestone formations, so the cave is not of particular interest to people.  Underground passages are dangerous for movement, and those who wish should not inspect the grottoes without special escort. </p><h2>  End of the road </h2><p>  Tourists are more attracted by the cascade of small waterfalls that overturns during the wet period, located next to the cave, and in the hot summer only smooth stone can be seen at this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="uzunzha canyon reviews" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1693828.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The picturesque Uzundzha Canyon, squeezed on both sides by cliffs, almost at the very end of the valley forms a high ledge, from which a magnificent waterfall that does not have an exact name breaks off in the spring.  On the left slope there is an observation deck suitable for recreation, where you can hide from the scorching summer sun and shelter from snow or rain. </p><p>  A little further is the so-called Dead Gorge, passing through which some tourists feel a breakdown.  Animal bones are often found underfoot, and it is not surprising that mystical traditions are composed about him.  Here you will have to climb a lot of stones, and this is not an easy way for unprepared beginners.  From its picturesque corners, one can note two waterfalls covered with a green carpet of moss, next to which there is an exit from the gorge. </p><h2>  Uzunge Canyon: how to get there? </h2><p>  To get to a little-visited place, remote from the main routes, it will take a lot of patience.  You can get to the canyon located in the southeast of the Baydar Valley from Sevastopol, in the vicinity of which there is a fabulous place.  You need to get by taxi or shuttle bus to the fifth kilometer, where the bus station is located.  It is best to arrive here in the early morning, while there are not many who want to go in the suburban direction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uzunge River Canyon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1693829.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Here you need to take a ticket to the village of Rodnikovoy (the journey to it takes a little more than an hour), and get off at the stop at the appointed place.  Further, you can go to the canyon only on foot, turning right at the fork where the sign is set.  If you move on, you can see the parking lot for cars, where the Skelskaya cave is located.  Those who do not want to visit it go further in the direction of the dirt road.  Guests walk past the village of Kolkhoznoye and the Gorny children's camp along the path leading to the Uzundzha Hotel, next to which a local landmark is hidden in dense trees. </p><p>  From above, a fascinating sight opens up to the gaze of tourists.  Uzundzha Canyon is loved by lovers of unforgettable impressions and natural beauty, devoid of all traces of human civilization.  This wild place will make you forget about everything, so tourists recommend monitoring the time so as not to be late for the last scheduled bus.  And for those who want to spend the night in a miniature gorge, which gives peace and tranquility, you can take a tent with you. </p><h2>  What tourists say </h2><p>  Tourists admit that the colorful Uzunja Canyon is filled with a special atmosphere.  Guest reviews of Crimea are full of the most positive emotions, as a delightful natural monument makes you forget about all the problems and concerns.  A wonderful corner is surrounded by centuries-old trees, and in the evenings, when the bright rays of the sun do not penetrate into the gorge, it seems mysterious. </p><p>  Many tourists have seen that the canyon is one of the most picturesque places of the peninsula.  A miraculous attraction, in which time seemed to stop, I want to enjoy the whole day, and convenient recreational areas are created so that those who wish can stay for the night. </p>

    <p>  Uzundzha Canyon, the photo of which is unlikely to convey its fabulous beauty, will surprise with amazing landscapes of unique nature.  All who are not afraid of difficulties say that a natural object must be visited in order to understand how beautiful it is.  It seems to be a real piece of earthly paradise. </p>
