    <p>  To make this accessory you do not have to spend a lot of money.  All that is required of you is <span>the desire</span> to create and make a certain amount of effort to translate fantasy into reality.  Interesting needlework for the home can bring a new cheerful accent to your kitchen and make its design more original. </p><h2>  Some important tips </h2><p>  Before you begin, remember a few rules that have been tested in practice by experienced needlewomen.  They will also be useful to you in choosing materials for sewing hot coasters. </p><p>  So, since the main purpose of our accessories is to protect hands from burns and injuries, the first place in preparation for work is the search for a dense, comfortable fabric.  And since external design means no less than functionality to us, we must approach this process with full responsibility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, in order to sew something useful with your own hands for the home and, in particular, for the kitchen, you must adhere to the following rules: </p><ol><li>  The material should be dense enough to protect your hands from hot objects.  Therefore, additional funds will be useful for you to create crafts, namely, felt, batting or synthetic winterizer. </li><li>  It is necessary to carry out sheathing of a heater using natural <span>cotton fabrics.</span>  They do not melt from heat and when in contact with fire, which means they minimize the risk of burns.  In addition, do not forget that natural materials are much more pleasant to the touch than synthetics.  Therefore, with them you will be much more comfortable doing your homework. </li><li>  Pay particular attention to make your product comfortable.  When sewing a tack, make sure that the hand freely passes inward and is completely protected. </li><li>  Do not forget about the aesthetic component of the work.  When you create something with your own hands for the home, make sure that the craft is neat and beautiful, and its color blends harmoniously with the interior. </li></ol><h2>  Work process </h2><p>  Now let's get to work.  We will figure out step by step how to sew the perfect kitchen pot holder. </p><ol><li>  To begin, draw on paper a pattern of future crafts. </li><li>  Attach it to the material using <span>safety pins,</span> circle the outline and cut out the necessary details. </li><li>  Pin the outer and inner layers of fabric and the lining between them, sew each individual element on the sewing machine. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do it yourself for home" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/762439.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  If you want to put a picture on the product, this must be done at this stage of the work. </li><li>  Cut and fix on the surface of the applications that you plan to use. </li><li>  Connect the finished parts together using pins, stitch along the edges on the front side and steam it off with an iron. </li><li>  Draw around the edges of the strip of fabric that will hide the seams, and fix it. </li></ol><p>  On this your work is over.  You can hang ready-made oven mitts in the kitchen and at any time start checking them in action. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Weaving rugs from old things </h2>

    <p>  Needlework for comfort in the house is not just to bring you joy.  It is also useful in terms of its functionality. </p><p>  Clothes that you have not worn for a long time can be used to make beautiful details for the interior.  It can be rugs in the bedroom or bathroom, bedding for chairs and armchairs, as well as rugs for the hallway. </p><p>  These cute little things will bring the elements of antiquity to the design of your house, create the atmosphere of the grandmother's housing, where you spent your summer holidays.  And if, when working on them, you will use fabrics that harmoniously fit into the interior of your apartment, these crafts will place bright accents in the decor of the room. </p><h2>  We prepare materials </h2><p>  This needlework from home fabric begins with the preparation of so-called yarn.  To knit a rug, well-worn knitwear is best for you.  For example, it can be any T-shirts, T-shirts and thin blouses.  Ideally, they should be bright and made from natural materials.  Then the crafts will turn out not only stylish, but also pleasant when touched.  Spread the finished accessory on a straight surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This needlework for giving and at home is based on work with fabric tapes.  They can be done as follows. </p><ol><li>  To begin, cut the stitched part from the bottom from the selected <span>garment</span> . </li><li>  After that, go with scissors along the line between the side seams of the product and, not reaching the end by about three centimeters, stop. </li><li>  Divide the entire fabric into such narrow strips. </li><li>  Conveniently lay the workpiece on your hands and diagonally start cutting off the parts that you left earlier.  Thus, you will get a long solid ribbon. </li></ol><p>  This method is suitable for any thing, even children's tights.  During operation, consider the fact that the thicker the fabric you use, the narrower the tape you need to do. </p><p>  Spiral the part of the thing that remains.  Round off the right angles with scissors.  Tie all finished tapes together or sew them together.  Twist the finished strip into a ball and start work on the next.  If you get several ribbons of the same color, it is better to reel them together, so that later it is easier to orient in the colors that you have. </p><h2>  Main job </h2><p>  The kind of hand-made with the help of which such rugs are created is crocheting needlework for the house.  Even an inexperienced craftswoman can cope with this work.  First, decide which room the product is intended for.  So it will be easier for you to choose the right colors and size for it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="needlework for home scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/762436.jpg" width="559"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

    <p>  Type in such a number of air loops that will create a pigtail that defines the width of the product.  And now knit over it, as many rows as you need, with the most basic technique - crochet.  Let the first rug be rectangular or square.  Creating these forms does not require additional effort.  You just knit row after row according to the same pattern, and that‚Äôs it. </p><h2>  Design options </h2><p>  Try to make the next round.  First make a ring of five air loops.  And then expand it with rows of single crochet, increasing each of them by several stitches. </p><p>  Striped doormats look beautiful in which the first few rows are made with ribbons of the same color.  Then another tape is taken, and after a couple of levels you return to the first shade again. </p><p>  Combine materials as your soul desires.  Your imagination is not limited by anything except the presence of ribbons of the right color.  But their deficiency can be filled at any time, rummaging in old unnecessary things. </p><h2>  Weave rugs </h2><p>  When you master <span>needlework, ideas for</span> home can be found at every turn.  If you do not have a crochet hook, you can easily weave a rug or bedding without it.  To do this, you need to find any frame (for example, from photographs) or even make it yourself.  The length of its sides should be 30x45 centimeters.  And at the edges you need to nail small cloves at a small distance from each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="needlework for comfort in the house" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/762441.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Now pull between the heads of the thread that will underlie the craft.  Choose material of a neutral color that will not stand out sharply against the background of the main stripes.  If during weaving you will tighten the rows together, the bottom layer will not be noticeable at all.  With a looser technique, these tapes are visible.  Consider this fact when working. </p><h2>  Execution technique </h2><p>  Now take the main tape and begin to stretch it alternately under and above the strips of the base.  When you finish the row, turn the thread in the opposite direction and do the same operations.  Make as many lines as you see fit. </p><p>  To add a new color to the composition, cut off the main tape and firmly tie the other to its working end.  Do not forget from time to time to pull the finished rows to the first.  Make sure that the seams and nodules are inside out.  At the end of the work, carefully remove the finished crafts from the frame. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="needlework for the cottage and home" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/762438.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In this way, needlework for the home is easily performed, the schemes of which can be used to create not only rugs, but also napkins, hot coasters or even blankets. </p><h2>  Patchwork technique </h2><p>  Patchwork is a simple but very fashionable technique for creating a wide variety of decorative elements.
