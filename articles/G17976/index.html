  <section class="page js-page"><h1>loan limitation period</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably, each of us at one time came across a loan.  Either the equipment needed to be bought, or the furniture had to be changed, and we often rest not for our money, but for those that the bank gave us at high interest.  But we never think about whether he is capable of us?  We got the money, and in some cases we cannot pay: someone lost his job, and with it a certain income, someone simply is not able to pay such a large amount, and someone does not want to pay at all.  That's when the time comes when it is necessary to pay debts, or go to court and answer to the bank.  In most cases, the business usually wins the bank, which means that interest rises to heaven and paying off such a loan becomes unrealistic.  What to do in this case?  You need to use a completely legal basis for non-payment of the loan - using <span>the statute of limitations</span> on the loan. </p><p>  But how not to make a mistake at the same time and not fall into even greater bondage?  You just need to thoroughly know your rights using the statute of limitations on a loan, which is prescribed in the <span>Civil Code of the Russian Federation.</span>  Currently, non-repayment of debt on loans in Russia amounted to more than 12%.  All this suggests that a huge number of people can take advantage of this law.  This figure indicates that every fourth resident of the country is in a debt hole, while every second of these four has certain difficulties with paying money.  Therefore, it will be appropriate to say that many defaulters are very interested in such a procedure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I also want to clarify what it is - a statute of limitations on a loan?  This is such a procedure in which the statute of limitations for paying a <span>loan</span> is three years.  It turns out that those who took a loan, after this period, can simply refuse to pay all debts.  But in fact, the whole operation is not as simple as it seems. </p><p>  This is due to the fact that the statute of limitations on the loan provides for some mandatory nuances.  So, for example, during these three years, there should be absolutely no relationship between the borrower and the lender: no notifications received, no calls from the bank.  At the same time, the bank also goes to all the tricks so that the deadbeat could not use the procedure for the credit limitation period.  He transfers all rights to collect debt to collectors, which at least once a year remind you of unpaid money.  The proof of your communication can be not only the records of telephone conversations, but also the signature supplied upon receipt of a <span>registered letter.</span> </p><p>  So how do you actually calculate how long you have a statute of limitations on a loan.  It is calculated only from the moment when you completely stop communicating with the bank and its representatives, whether it is by phone or live - it does not matter at all.  Absolutely no communication!  And only then, if suddenly after three years you again receive a subpoena, you can file a <span>counterclaim,</span> this time appealing with a law that mentions the statute of limitations on a loan. </p><p>  Nevertheless, do not flatter yourself at the expense of banks.  They are not going to forgive you debts, so they will not wait three years to again demand your return of the debt.  They will do it much earlier.  Or, in order not to have unnecessary problems, they can generally sell your debt to another company. </p><p>  That is why it is worth thinking a thousand times before using the option that is beneficial to you.  Maybe it is gradual payments that will help you correct the situation and will be much more profitable than your hide-and-seek with the bank for three years.  Well, in order to avoid problems with paying loans, you should not borrow money at all.  It‚Äôs easier to collect than to think about <span>where to get money</span> for the next repayment of debt. </p>
