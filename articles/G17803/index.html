It stands out spectacularly among neighboring buildings with its ultra-modern style architecture.  This applies not only to the appearance of its facades and buildings as a whole, but also to the layouts of apartments, public areas, house adjoining areas.

    <p>  However, for residents of any complex, the amenities that the developer provides them and the quality of work always come first in importance.  What can the New Switzerland LCD boast in this regard?  What infrastructure will there be, transport interchange, what kind of ecology is around, which is also important, how is the construction going, and most importantly, when, finally, co-investors will receive the long-awaited keys? </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Vsevolozhsk is located near St. Petersburg.  Its center is only 25 km away by car.  The Berngardovka microdistrict is even closer to the Northern capital, which is one of its main advantages.  In the southwestern part of this microdistrict, the New Switzerland residential complex began to be built.  The place was chosen very well, as there is a large transport artery nearby - Khristinovsky Prospekt, through which you can reach the Road of Life in a matter of minutes.  From this point to the Ring Road only 7.8 km.  The address of the new complex is 16. Pochtovaya Street, 16. It is between Sovetskaya and Bibikovskaya Streets.  Khristinovsky Prospekt is 300 meters from the residential complex; the railway passes a little further.  The complex is surrounded by urban areas, where everything has been landscaped for a long time, there is a developed infrastructure, cleanliness and order, a lot of green spaces. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport Amenities </h2><p>  In terms of transport accessibility, you can rate 4 out of 5 LCD "New Switzerland".  Vsevolozhsk does not yet have a subway.  From its western outskirts to the nearest metro stations, and this is Bolshevik Prospect, Dybenko Street or Ladozhskaya, more than 14 kilometers. </p>

    <p>  Residents of the complex can be reached by minibus No. 430, and by minibus No. 530 you can get to Finland Station.  Public transport stops are 300 meters from the LCD.  200 meters further is the railway station.  By train, you can also arrive at the central transport hub - <span>Finland Station,</span> spending only 20 minutes on it. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The holders of LCD ‚ÄúNew Switzerland‚Äù, of course, are pleased to realize that they will live in a beautiful and environmentally friendly place.  There are no industrial enterprises in the okrug.  St. Petersburg is relatively close to Vsevolozhsk, but the distance is enough to prevent harmful emissions from industrial enterprises in the suburbs.  Near the residential complex, literally 350 meters away, the Lubya River flows and Sofiyivka Park begins, smoothly turning into a forest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  "New Switzerland" is a <span>residential complex,</span> which has already changed three developers.  The Stroyservice company began the implementation of the project.  Then the complex was called "Berngardovka."  Further, the relay was transferred to the Onyx developer.  Although he has a good reputation, his business did not go well either, and the LCD went under the patronage of Pro-Invest, which is completing it at the moment. </p>

    <p>  This is a whole group of companies formed in 1999.  At first, she was engaged only in the supply of finishing and building materials.  The priorities of management were the professionalism of employees, flexibility in solving tasks, an individual approach to all clients without exception.  As a result, Pro-Invest quickly became one of the leaders in the construction holdings of the Leningrad Region.  Now, along with deliveries, it carries out the whole complex of works on the construction of real estate - from design to sales to consumers.  Together with LCD ‚ÄúNew Switzerland‚Äù, Pro-Invest is working on projects of the LCD Officer, which is scheduled to be completed in the II quarter of this year, and the Pavlovsk Etudes LCD, the deadline for which is 2019. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The New Switzerland complex is small in scale.  It occupies a total of 3100 m <sup>2</sup> .  On this square, 2 houses are being built.  The first complex is smaller, it is planned to build only 30 apartments in it.  This building has 5 residential aboveground floors and 1 non-residential, basement.  The second complex, for 100 apartments, has 1 <span>basement</span> and 7 above <span>ground floors</span> , of which the first is the administrative floor, and from the 2nd to the 7th are residential.  In the courtyard of the complex, the developer plans to equip recreation areas, a place for children to play and a sports ground.  In the basement will be located parking.  In addition, additional parking will be done on the territory adjacent to the house.  On the ground floor of the seven-story building will accommodate 13 pantries, offices, lounges, meeting rooms, a billiard club, cafe, and a stroller. </p><p>  Despite the fact that it is not planned to erect other infrastructure objects, the co-investors of LCD ‚ÄúNew Switzerland‚Äù leave friendly comments.  Within a radius of 2500 meters from the complex there are Pyaterochka, Magnit, Dixy shops, a hospital, private medical clinics, a clinic for adults and children, several pharmacies, a gymnasium, a lyceum, four schools, more than ten kindergartens, four gas stations, and small grocery stores shops, there is even a boarding house. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The New Switzerland complex was conceived according to a very original design.  It uses non-standard solutions for glazing, setting angles, the concept of placing one house relative to another.  The entrances to both buildings are located from the courtyard, which is planned to be done without fencing and security.  Entrances to public facilities (cafes, billiards clubs and others) are planned to be made separate from the opposite side of the building. </p>

    <p>  Elevators will be placed in the spacious entrances of both buildings, but the issue of the advisability of the presence of a concierge has not yet been resolved.  The construction of the residential complex "New Switzerland" is carried out in a monolithic-frame way.  External walls are built using technology for the northern regions.  That is, they provide for three layers, one of which is insulating with isover.  A distinctive feature of the complex is the installation of gas boilers in each apartment, which will allow residents to independently adjust the heating power. </p><h2>  Layout of apartments and their features </h2><p>  In the residential complex "New Switzerland" from the developer of the company "Pro-Invest" the housing stock has 130 apartments.  They have a distribution of types. </p><p>  In the first building: </p><ul><li>  64 units of one-room apartments with a total area (S) of 23 to 48 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  30 two-room units, S = from 51 to 66 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  6 units  three rooms, S = from 76 to 77 m <sup>2</sup> . </li></ul><p>  In the second building: </p><ul><li>  20 one-room units, S = from 40 to 45 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  5 units  two-room apartments, S = from 59 to 64 m <sup>2</sup> ; </li><li>  5 units  three-room, S = from 76 to 82 m <sup>2</sup> . </li></ul>
