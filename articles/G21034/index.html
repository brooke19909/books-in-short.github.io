    <p>  The eastern shore of the Black Sea was ‚Äúunlucky‚Äù with rocks.  They were too strong for water, wind and chemical reactions to turn them into sand.  Crushing ended at the stage of pebbles and gravel, impregnable rocks that survive the onslaught of the sea for thousands of years have survived. </p><p>  Sandy beach on the Black Sea in the Caucasus coast - a rarity.  Surprisingly, among the stones and pebbles appeared golden sand and a <span>gentle beach</span> in Gelendzhik and Anapa.  The sand warms up well to a depth of 35 cm, pleasantly heats the skin.  Such natural procedures have a beneficial effect on the body, help with diseases of the respiratory system, musculoskeletal system, urinary system and skin. </p>

    <h2>  The south coast of Crimea.  Sand and pebble beaches </h2><p>  The Crimean peninsula is washed partially by the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, but the main part of the coastline belongs to the Black Sea basin.  The advantages of the southern location complement the unique mountain and steppe landscapes, healing mud, healing mineral water of the Crimea.  It is not at all surprising that the resorts of the peninsula have become renowned health resorts and dispensaries of international level. </p><p>  The conditional division of the coast of the peninsula into the South, West and East will help to better imagine where on the Black Sea the sandy beach is closer to the Caucasus, and where to reach the Turkish coast.  The historical and geographical parts of Crimea differ in coastal structure, climatic features, and recreational conditions.  Tourists sometimes resemble fairy-tale heroes choosing one of three roads. </p><p>  The most famous Crimean resorts - Yalta, Alushta, Gurzuf, Foros - are located in the south of the peninsula.  Here the clear sea, sandy and pebble beaches, picturesque landscapes.  The southern coast of Crimea is an earthly paradise where powerful tourist flows rush, especially in the warm season.  The beaches in Alushta are covered with dark shale sand, in places with fine pebbles and gravel.  The water is not clean enough at the peak of the summer season when the resort is overloaded. </p><h2>  Crimea.  Sandy beaches in the west </h2><p>  As an example, which clearly illustrates the problem of choosing beaches on the Black Sea, the Crimean city of Sevastopol, the Black Sea base of the Russian fleet, is suitable.  Among the three dozen of the most popular holiday destinations in the vicinity are an extensive sandy beach in Omega Bay, rocky Soldier's in the Admiral's Lagoon, and pebble Jashmovy at Cape Fiolent.  In addition to Sevastopol, on the western coast of the Crimea are located the famous resort city of Yevpatoriya, the villages of Saki, and the Black Sea. </p>
