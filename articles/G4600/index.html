Among them is also a well-known collector, philanthropist and diplomat - Golitsyn Dmitry Mikhailovich (1721-1793).  This man has done a lot for his own country, he not only set up relations with France, but also opened the first city hospital in Moscow. </p><h2>  From birth to conscious age </h2><p>  Very little is known about the earliest years of this person's life; more attention was paid to his family.  His mother was the daughter of an influential military man, the first ambassador of Russia, a permanent and excellent diplomat.  Her name was Kurakina Tatyana Borisovna, but she did not live the glory of her father, being the Oberhofer industry under two empresses at once - Elizabeth and Anna, she was also awarded the Order of St.  Catherine.  Mikhail Mikhailovich Golitsyn, the great man of that time, became the boy‚Äôs father, he was a member of the Northern War and the Azov campaigns, a member of the Supreme Privy Council and became president of the Russian Military Collegium. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn" class="if uuid-3122576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3122576.jpg"></div><p>  The patron himself, Dmitry Golitsyn, born in 1721.  His family was one of the most influential in the Russian Empire.  Perhaps that is why very little is known about the childhood of a great man.  The only thing that is clear and without reliable facts is that he received brilliant home schooling.  Some historians suggest that from a very early age he was assigned to military service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Career and marriage </h2><p>  <span>Prince Golitsyn</span> Dmitry Mikhailovich is rarely mentioned in historical documents.  It is known that, while serving in the Life Guards of the Izmailovsky Regiment in 1751, he married Ekaterina Dmitrievna Kantemir.  The girl was the daughter of the prince from Moldova - Dmitry Kanteminovich Kantemir and the Russian princess Anastasia Trubetskoy.  She received an excellent education, led by another famous person - Ivan Betskoy, it was he who later became the personal secretary of Catherine II herself.  Ekaterina Dmitrievna Kantemir among high society was considered one of the most beautiful, smart and educated girls.  The girl was honored to become the chamber-maid of honor Elizabeth Petrovna. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medalirus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ekaterina Dmitrievna" class="if uuid-3122568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3122568.jpg"></div><p>  Before marriage, Ekaterina Dmitrievna lived for several years abroad, but only for family reasons.  There is historical information that from childhood she was not distinguished by good health, she was often ill and suspected of infertility, in connection with which she was completely not going to get married.  However, the young prince Golitsyn did not heed her wishes and showed perseverance, which all ladies dream of.  As a result, they were married in 1751 on January 28.  The wedding was attended by the entire imperial court, foreign diplomats, Elizaveta Petrovna herself and military leaders.  After the ceremony, a grand ball was held in honor of the young, it was attended by about two hundred people.  It was on this day that Ekaterina Dmitrievna became a state lady. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitrie_Cantemir"><img itemprop="image" alt="Father Ekaterina Dmitrievna" class="if uuid-3122564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3122564.jpg"></div><p>  This marriage became a key impetus in the career and further development of the man as Dmitry Golitsyn, so already in 1751, on September 5, he became a chamber junker, and four years later - a chamberlain. </p><h2>  Foreign career </h2><p>  The death of Anastasia Trubetskoy, the mother of Catherine, was a key turn in the life of the couple, it was then that they began to think about the fact that health can be improved abroad.  This could help the climate of Western Europe.  In addition, a stay at the court of foreign monarchs could have a positive impact on the career of Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn. </p><p>  In 1757, the couple managed to get permission to travel and visit abroad, where they decided to go with Uncle Ekaterina Dmitrievna and, concurrently, with the curator of the girl‚Äôs training, Ivan Betsky.  But the couple did not change their habits, very quickly becoming an important part of the high society of Paris. </p><p>  The Queen of France received Princess Golitsyna as a native, meeting her in her bedroom and presenting to a narrow circle of trustees.  This attitude not only had a positive effect on the couple‚Äôs life, but also served as the setting for new friendships, thanks to which the prince became ambassador to France in 1761.  And next year he had to leave.  Due to distant kinship with the Austrian family of the emperor and his own merits, he was transferred to the post of ambassador in Vienna.  However, Ekaterina Dmitrievna could not accompany her husband, she was seriously ill, and the prince postponed all trips.  Dmitry Mikhailovich could not enter the post because his wife died on November 2, 1761, her death severely crippled the statesman. </p><h2>  Charity </h2><p>  Despite the great employment in public affairs, the prince was constantly engaged in charity work.  While he lived in Vienna for thirty years, he was able to put together a truly outstanding collection of painting masterpieces.  Dmitry Mikhailovich was a member of three Academy of Arts.  Among other things, it was this man who became the founder of the first city clinical hospital in Moscow.  Now it is commonly called the Golitsyn corps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golitsyn Corps" class="if uuid-3122573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3122573.jpg"></div><h2>  Patron's death </h2><p>  The famous statesman died in 1793 on September 19 in the Austrian capital, where he lived after his own resignation.  He bequeathed property to his own cousins, not only his own money, but also a collection of paintings in 297 paintings.  In addition, a clause was indicated in the will on the allocation of funds for the construction of the hospital - 920,600 rubles, a gigantic amount.  The Golitsyn Corps was already ready by 1802, an art gallery was also built there, but it did not last very long. </p>
