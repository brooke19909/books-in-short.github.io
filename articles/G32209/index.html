    <h2>  Crafts.  Easter.  Kindergarten </h2><p>  The bright holiday of Christ's Resurrection does not have a fixed date, but it always falls on a day off and happens in April or early May.  Waiting for a holiday for kids can be made less tedious if, in anticipation of joyful moments, engage with them in fascinating applied art.  The result of such activities at home can be successful applications from colored paper, Easter greeting cards, thematic compositions from natural material. </p><p>  It will be much easier for kids to make crafts for Easter in kindergarten with their own hands, if parents prepare them well at home.  It is important not only to be able to handle scissors, pencils, glue, brush, felt-tip pens and other devices correctly, but also to understand the meaning of the work conceived.  The ability to clearly and clearly express one’s thoughts, to form one’s position on controversial issues is simply not given.  This ability is developed in <span>the learning process</span> and is also an important and integral part of applied art. </p><h2>  DIY crafts in kindergarten do it yourself </h2><p>  The creative process for preschool kids has its own characteristics.  At this stage, the end result is not as important as the classes themselves.  The involvement of the children in the process will depend on how much the educators manage to interest the children.  Whatever the result of labor, it will be important for the development of an emerging personality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Crafts for Easter in kindergarten for different age groups should differ in level of difficulty.  Here a special role is given to educators.  They, like no one better, see the degree of development of this or that child.  In one case, they can tell you what is best to do at a certain stage of the lesson, in another - make a complex element for the baby so that he does not lag behind the general group. </p>

    <p>  When a child makes crafts for Easter in a kindergarten in the middle group, the participation of a mentor is required.  But educators do not need to overly impose their help on the pupil.  Without giving him the opportunity to express his individuality, you can miss the moment of manifestation of fantasy, and this is a component of talent.  Even if his work is not perfect, the main thing is that it will be original, and he will be proud of it. </p><h2>  Wreath of colored paper </h2><p>  It’s easy to make simple crafts for Easter in kindergarten using the applique method.  A wreath that can be hung on the wall, the door of the refrigerator or cabinet, will serve as a good reminder of the holiday. </p><p>  To make it, you need thick cardboard for the base and colored paper.  The composition is selected depending on the age of the baby.  It can be paper flowers, butterflies, birds, insects.  The number of elements to be glued and the complexity of their execution depend on the ability of children to cut out small details. </p><p>  In order to speed up the process and not bore the kids with this activity, all the components can be prepared in advance or given a home task to help parents in this matter.  Their participation is also important, because it is not only teachers in the garden who will evaluate the results of the work. </p><p>  Finished items are glued to the base of cardboard or thick paper.  The frame of the wreath can be round or oval.  If you make a longitudinal jumper in the middle, then it will be possible to glue on it letters pre-cut from paper in sequence, so that the words “Christ is Risen!” </p>

    <h2>  Natural material </h2><p>  A traditional Easter gift is a <span>colored egg.</span>  It’s not necessary to cook it.  After removing the <span>raw</span> protein and yolk from it, the shell washed with water can be stored for a long time.  It can be decorated in various ways. </p><p>  Such souvenirs decorated with various cereals look original.  Crafts for Easter in kindergarten (the older group) can already be made at a fairly high artistic level.  The shell is coated with glue or paste cooked on flour.  Grains are selected in different colors, shades, sizes and textures.  You can take semolina, buckwheat, rice, barley.  Suitable millet, lentils, crushed peas. </p><p>  These components can be stacked in rows greased with paste in rows in different sequences or laid out in the form of traditional Easter patterns.  This is convenient to do according to predefined contours.  You can use a stencil for these purposes.  The color and texture of cereals are selected by contrast.  Such Easter eggs look very original and elegant. </p>

    <h2>  Hanging souvenir </h2><p>  Decorative crafts for Easter in a kindergarten from a hollow egg look beautiful hanging on a thread or ribbon.  In the child’s room, such a souvenir will constantly remind of the first or next creative success.  With each new holiday, the collection may increase, decorative decoration may become more complicated.  This will be a good example of creative growth, a change in preferences in the process of growing up and the choice of new techniques for designing crafts. </p><p>  To begin with, the blown egg is washed with water.  The holes in the shell expand depending on the thickness of the thread or ribbon.  With a needle or a bent wire, the suspension is passed through both holes.  A beautiful knot in the form of a bow knits from below, and a loop for hanging is formed from above.  The length of the thread is chosen arbitrarily.  Decorative decoration of such a souvenir can be done with paints or applique. </p>

    <h2>  Using materials at hand </h2><p>  To make a simple craft for Easter on your own in a kindergarten from Kinder, you will need a plastic container-egg of this "surprise".  You will also need scissors, floss threads of different colors, beads, sequins, semolina, colored paper.  All this can be fixed <span>with PVA glue</span> or “Moment”.  For the convenience of its application, it is better to use a brush. </p><p>  One half of the “egg” is smeared with glue and, until it has frozen, is wrapped in a spiral thread, starting from the top.  Layers are stacked alternately.  After the glue dries, the procedure is repeated with the second part of the container. </p><p>  The top and bottom is decorated with sequins.  From the beads in the middle of the egg, an Easter pattern in the form of a cross is laid out.  From above, you can sprinkle everything with semolina, and cut small flowers from colored paper and stick them at the joints of threads of different colors.  No matter what level of complexity the Easter craft is, a souvenir made by children’s hands will always be an expensive and pleasant gift for relatives and friends. </p>
