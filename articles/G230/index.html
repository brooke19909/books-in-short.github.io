    <p>  The beach here is mixed: sandy and stone.  It is located in a small bay.  This arrangement provides perfectly smooth and calm water.  In rocky places there is a pier.  Excellent food and a lot of entertainment on site make the Ruby Platinum Hotel (Alanya) one of the most comfortable on the Mediterranean coast. </p>
