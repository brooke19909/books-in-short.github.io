    <h2>  Device niche </h2><p>  A rather interesting niche was chosen by marketers for the Doogee DG700 Titans 2. Reviews only confirm this.  This device will be a great solution for those who travel a lot, is an avid fisherman or hunter, and also leads an active lifestyle.  At the same time, unlike similar Sony solutions, it is more affordable.  On the other hand, it has more modest technical specifications.  But you do not have to expect anything supernatural from him - this is a budget smartphone in a protected case.  So it turns out that this solution of this Chinese manufacturer is aimed at those potential buyers who need an entry-level device with all the basic functions, excellent autonomy and a case protected from dust and moisture. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Impressive equipment, as for an entry-level phone, this Chinese device.  In addition to the smartphone itself, it includes the following accessories for the Doogee Titans 2 DG700: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Wired stereo headset. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  USB / microUSB format cable. </li></ul>

    <p>  In turn, the list of documentation that comes with the device consists of a warranty card and user manual.  Finally, it should be noted that this is a protected smartphone.  As a result, he does not need a cover and a protective film for the front panel.  The only thing that is certainly not enough in the above list is an external flash drive.  But this is generally accepted practice today, and all manufacturers do not equip their smartphones with memory cards.  This accessory has to be purchased separately, at an additional cost.  Moreover, there is not so much integrated memory in this gadget, and its owners simply can not do without an external drive. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Degree of protection for the Doogee Titans 2 DG700 IP67.  On the front panel of the display with a diagonal of 4.5 inches.  Above the screen behind a metal grill, a conversational speaker hid.  Next to it is the <span>front camera</span> and the eye <span>of the light sensor.</span>  Under the screen, three familiar control buttons are displayed: ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and, of course, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  All sides of the device are made of metal and are resistant to mechanical damage.  On the upper edge of the device is a special rubber plug.  Hidden underneath is a 3.5mm audio port and microUSB.  On the bottom edge of the gadget is only the opening of the conversational microphone.  There are volume buttons on the right side of the phone.  In turn, on the left - locks and a programmable button.  The back cover for the Doogee DG700 Titans 2 is made of leather.  The main camera and its LED backlight, which are located on a metal plate, are also displayed here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Computational Foundation </h2><p>  Modest enough, as by today's standards, the central processor is used in the Doogee DG700 Titans 2 - MTK6582.  This is a time-tested solution, which is based on 4 computing modules based on the energy-efficient architecture "A7", but these cores can no longer boast of a high level of performance.  It should also be noted that the clock frequency of each of them in the highest load mode rises to an impressive 1.3 GHz.  The computing resources of this central processor are enough to solve most everyday tasks: playing movies and music, reading books and surfing the Internet.  He will cope with all this without any problems.  The only niche that is too tough for this CPU is the most demanding three-dimensional toys of the latest generation.  But, on the other hand, to launch them you need a more expensive smartphone with a more productive chip. </p>

    <p>  So it turns out that this is a budget smartphone with a basic set of functions for every day.  If the user needs more, then you need to pay attention to more expensive solutions from Sony, for example Z3. </p><h2>  Display and graphics accelerator </h2><p>  Although this is a budget smartphone, the display quality is not satisfactory.  Its resolution is 540x960.  Moreover, the pixel density on its surface is 245 ppi, that is, it is almost impossible to distinguish individual points on the screen surface with the eye and the image is not grainy.  Further, it should be noted that the matrix underlying the display is made using the IPS technology.  Accordingly, the image on the screen turns out to be bright and saturated, and the viewing angles are as close as possible to 180 degrees.  Another feature of this phone is OGS technology.  Its essence is that there is no air gap between the front touch panel and the screen matrix surface, and this prevents image distortion at angles close to 180 degrees.  As a result, it can be noted that the screen quality in this device is excellent and it has no drawbacks.  In this case, the "Mali" -400MP2 acts as a graphics accelerator.  This, like the CPU, is a time-tested solution.  It cannot boast a high level of performance, but its computing capabilities are quite enough for most everyday tasks.  The only thing that he can not do, like the central processor, is the most demanding three-dimensional toys of the latest generation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Smartphone cameras and what they are capable of </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the degree of protection of the case in the Doogee Titans 2 DG700 is IP67.  This means that the device, albeit briefly, can be immersed in water.  However, it will remain in good condition.  But here is an additional button to control the camera in this situation is not provided.  Accordingly, the owners of this device do not have to rely on underwater shooting.  This rugged smartphone has dual cameras.  At the heart of the front camera is a sensor with a dimension of 5 megapixels.  This is quite enough for a "selfie" or for making video calls.  The main camera has a 8 megapixel sensor.  It also has an autofocus system and LED backlight. </p>

    <p>  The quality of the photos obtained with its help is quite good.  There is also the possibility of video recording.  The maximum quality of the videos in this case will be ‚ÄúHD‚Äù with a refresh rate of 30 frames per second.  The quality of the recorded video using this smartphone is not satisfactory and fully complies with the declared specifications. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Smartphone Doogee DG700 Titans 2 is equipped with only 1 GB of RAM standard DDR3.  At the same time, system processes occupy 700 MB, and only about 300 MB are allocated for the user's needs.  This is quite enough for most everyday tasks.  Well, something more to expect from an entry-level device is not necessary.  The capacity of the internal drive is 8GB.  The user is allocated about 3 GB to store personal data, and 1.5 GB is allocated for the installation of software.  The rest of the space is taken up by the preinstalled system software.  The previously indicated values ‚Äã‚Äãare clearly not enough for comfortable work on this device.  Therefore, without a flash card, the owner of this gadget is definitely not enough.  The corresponding slot is provided in this device and an external drive with a maximum capacity of 64 GB can be inserted into it.  If, for some reason, this is not enough, then you can use any of the available cloud storage services, for example Yandex.Disk. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The impressive battery capacity of this device, which is 4000 mAh.  Add to this the energy-efficient processor and a small display diagonal of 4.5 inches.  Also, the screen resolution is quite modest - 540x960.  As a result, you can count on 2-3 days of battery life with an average level of use of the gadget.  With a more intense load on the smart phone, the previously indicated value will be reduced to 1-2 days.  Well, with a minimum level of use of the device, you can count on the fact that it will last 4 days on a single battery charge.  Given that this is an entry-level device, these values ‚Äã‚Äãare definitely not satisfactory. </p>

    <h2>  Data exchange </h2><p>  The Doogee DG700 Titans 2 is equipped with an impressive array of wired and wireless data methods.  It implements the following interfaces: </p><p>  - The device is equipped with two SIM card slots at once.  There are network transmitters of the 2nd and 3rd generation.  In the first case, the speed is limited to 500 kbit / s., This is enough to download simple sites.  But in the second case, peak data transfer can reach several tens of megabits per second, and this is enough to download a video or make a video call and communicate using the same ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù.  Now we will figure out how to configure the Doogee DG700 Titans 2 smartphone to exchange data in this case.  And the algorithm is as follows: </p><ul><li>  When you turn on the smartphone for the first time, we get automatic settings from the operator. </li><li>  Save them. </li><li>  Reboot the device. </li><li>  We activate the data transfer service in the upper drop-down menu. </li><li>  We launch the browser and begin to browse Internet portals. </li></ul><p>  - Also, the device is equipped with a Wi-Fi transmitter.  The most common modifications are supported, namely b, g and n.  In this case, the speed can reach about 100-150 Mbit / s, and this is enough to download even a movie or any other large file to this device.  The main disadvantage of this technology is its small radius of action.  Such solutions are great for small offices or apartments.  Well, if you need to constantly be connected to the global web, then there is simply no alternative to mobile networks. </p><p>  - Another wireless transmission method is Bluetooth.  This interface allows you to connect a wireless stereo headset to the gadget or exchange information with a similar smartphone or phone.  The data transfer speed in this case is small, and voluminous files using this wireless technology is problematic to download.  But small musical compositions or photographs will not be difficult to convey. </p><p>  - For navigation, two technologies are immediately implemented in the device.  The first one is GPS.  It is based on determining the location of the device using a satellite system.  The second is A-GPS.  In this case, mobile towers are used for navigation.  It is the presence of these two technologies that makes it easy to turn this smartphone into a full-fledged ZHPS navigator.  The only thing that must be done in this case is to install additional software for these purposes. </p><p>  - As noted earlier, this smartphone is equipped with a microUSB port.  In this device, it performs two functions at once.  The first one is charging the battery.  But the second is activated when connected to a personal computer or laptop.  In this case, the device may turn into a regular flash drive or webcam.  The user selects the operating mode of the device by selecting the appropriate menu item when establishing communication with a PC or laptop. </p><p>  - Also, this phone model is equipped with a typical 3.5 mm audio port.  With it, you can connect an external stereo headset to the gadget.  The device comes with entry-level headphones.  The quality of their sound will suit the average user.  But music lovers will have to buy a more expensive speaker system with improved sound quality. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  As the system software in this gadget, the most popular software platform currently used is Android.  Moreover, in this <span>budget device</span> one of its most recent versions is installed - 5.0.  It is supplemented by a standard set of mini-applications from the search giant Google.  There are also programs built into the operating system (calculator, alarm clock, organizer, etc.).  The developers did not forget about social networks.  In this case, Facebook and Twitter clients were pre-installed.  But the rest of the application software (for example, additional toys, a text editor, domestic social network clients or an antivirus), the newly-made owner of this budget device will have to be additionally installed from the application store. </p>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  This smartphone is produced in only one version - Doogee Titans 2 DG700 Black, which is estimated by the manufacturer at $ 150.  On the one hand, the technical characteristics of this gadget are not impressive.  But after all, in this device the emphasis is placed on a protected case.  Hence the slightly overestimated cost of this smartphone in comparison with similar smart phones of this kind.  Otherwise, this is a typical entry-level solution, which boasts a fairly good degree of autonomy.  At the same time, its resources are quite enough to solve most everyday tasks. </p><h2>  Owner and expert reviews </h2><p>  The Doogee DG700 Titans 2 turned out to be an excellently balanced solution. Reviews say that it has practically no weaknesses.  His hardware is at an acceptable level.  The screen, like the camera, is not satisfactory.  Battery capacity and degree of autonomy - too.  Certain comments by the owners are caused by the security of the case in the Doogee DG700 Titans 2. A crash test conducted by a number of owners of this Chinese gadget indicates that its case is not so waterproof and dustproof.  But all the same, short-term immersion in water and a short exposure to a dusty environment does not disable this smart phone.  On the other hand, the affordable price tag of $ 150 eliminates all the previously mentioned comments.  You also need to consider that this is an entry-level solution and you do not have to expect anything more from it.  So it turns out that this smartphone has an excellent value for money. </p>
