  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oleic acid</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many fatty <span>(carboxylic) acids</span> are included in <span>plant</span> and animal <span>fats</span> .  These components are endowed with the energy function (energy is formed during their splitting) and plastic (they participate in the formation of biological membranes in the skeleton of plant and animal cells). </p><p>  The synthesis (compound) of fatty acids is carried out in the intestinal wall, liver, bone marrow, pulmonary, fatty and other tissues.  All of them (fatty acids) are divided into unsaturated and saturated. </p><p>  Oleic <span>acid</span> is considered the most valuable <span>.</span>  <span>The chemical properties of</span> this compound provide stability of membrane permeability, resistance to oxidation of deposited lipids with a moderate content of antioxidants. </p><p>  The synthesis of this compound occurs in particular in the cytoplasm of human liver cells.  Along with this, oleic acid is a part of <span>dietary fats,</span> which is of great importance in human nutrition.  The largest amount of this compound is found in olive oil (64-85%) and peanut (37-47%).  It should be noted that during heat treatment (during preparation) of these products, oleic acid is less susceptible to destruction. </p><p>  <span>Olive oil is</span> quite common in the preparation of various dishes, canning. </p><p>  The required amount of oleic acid from food is provided while maintaining a balanced diet.  In this case, the human diet should include fats, one third of which are vegetable, and two-thirds are animal compounds.  With this consumption, the proportion of oleic acid should be approximately 40%.  In this case, the normal functioning of the body is ensured. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most favorable diet is considered to be the content of oleic acid, close to its content in the fat depot.  Thus, the need for significant changes in the fatty acid composition of lipids supplied with food is eliminated.  This, in turn, prevents excessive waste of resources in the body, including energy. </p><p>  Oleic acid has a beneficial effect on maintaining immunity.  This compound, as well as others, is a source of energy.  It (energy) is released during the oxidation of oleic acid after it is cleaved from the lipid molecule under the influence of juice from the pancreas. </p><p>  Under industrial conditions, the compound is obtained by repeated crystallization by splitting lipids of olive oil. </p><p>  In the manufacture of the fat base for margarines, the hydrogenation method is used.  As a result, an oleic acid isomer, transoleic acid, is formed.  This compound is perfectly absorbed in the human body, but is practically not stored in reserve (not included in the fat depot). </p><p>  <strong>Oleic acid.</strong>  <strong>Application</strong> </p><p>  This compound is used quite widely in the manufacture of a variety of cosmetics.  Among them are creams designed to care for the skin of the legs, body, face, hands.  In addition, oleic acid is part of the cosmetic soap.  Means for problem skin, including this compound, have a beneficial effect on the process of cell membrane regeneration, help maintain moisture.  Problem areas soon acquire an attractive appearance.  In cosmetology, the use of olive oil - the product with the highest amount of oleic acid - is of great importance and quite common.  Salts obtained from the compound are part of a huge amount of fairly common detergents. </p><p>  It is very common in industrial applications.  Oleic acid is used as a base for the production of drying oil, paints, coatings. </p>
