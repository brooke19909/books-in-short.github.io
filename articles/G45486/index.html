    <h2>  Phone design and ergonomics </h2><p>  As it became known, the "apple corporation" decided to change its design trends, abandoning straight lines and corners in favor of more rounded ones.  Society perceived this innovation differently.  Someone liked it, and someone was upset, claiming that with these actions Apple is losing its personality.  One of the minuses of the current design of the phone is that the main camera protrudes relative to the entire body.  This can lead to the fact that when the phone is exposed to any surface, microcracks may appear on the camera glass, which can degrade the quality of the photo.  As for the buttons, their number and purpose does not differ from those that were on previous models.  But the placement and shape of the buttons are different from older models.  If the power button was previously located at the top of the phone, now it has been relocated to the right end part.  On the other side are the volume buttons, as well as a small lever that allows you to quickly turn off the sound if necessary.  All smartphone connectors are located on the bottom end of the smartphone.  There you can find a speaker for playing sound, a headphone jack, and a charger socket.  The glass of the smartphone, as well as the general shape of the smartphone, is rounded.  This is a pretty good idea, in general, the entire design of this smartphone looks very interesting and attractive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apple iphone 6 review" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545411.jpg" width="600"></div>

Many expected a quad-core processor from the developers, but this did not happen.  As a result, the novelty received a dual-core processor with a clock frequency of each core at 1.4 GHz.  In addition, the RAM of the new smartphone was 1 gigabyte.  As varieties were presented phones with different amounts of flash memory.  These are smartphones with a capacity of 16, 64 and 128 GB.  In addition, the phone is equipped with an eight-megapixel camera, which shoots equally well in the daytime and at dusk.  As a hardware operating system, the developers of the new smartphone created iOS 8, which will delight their fans with several new utilities that can simplify the management of the smartphone.  As the other characteristics of the smartphone, you can highlight the existing compass, as well as a 3.5 mm jack for listening to music using headphones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new apple iphone 6" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545423.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Phone software </h2><p>  The new Apple <span>iPhone 6</span> from an American manufacturer of mobile devices runs on a new platform called iOS 8. The operating system is not much different from the previous version in its characteristics, however, you can find some very interesting functions that could be useful for users of iPhone 6. First and a very successful function is that now you can delete messages with one button and do not have to oppress the removal of each individual letter.  Another convenient feature is the shooting interface.  When photographing objects, it has now become possible to set the zoom on the element that you need.  Thus, the Apple iPhone 6 smartphone has somewhat simplified the use of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone apple iphone 6" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545418.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Apple <span>iPhone 6:</span> camera and photo <span>review</span> </h2><p>  The main camera of the phone is located on its back side.  A clear drawback of the camera‚Äôs design is its bulge relative to the entire smartphone case, which can lead to undesirable consequences in the future with inaccurate use of the device.  The camera itself is eight megapixel.  The quality of the photos does not cause any complaints.  When photographing during the day, the Apple IPhone 6 mobile phone has proven itself only on the good side.  Photos were clear, and the colors were saturated and consistent with reality.  Particularly pleased with the innovation from the company's development team in the form of manual zoom.  Thanks to this feature, you can personally improve the future photo, focusing on those elements that the new Apple iPhone 6 ignores. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what will be apple iphone 6" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545415.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  Quality of communication and mobile Internet </h2><p>  First, we will analyze the network operation of the <span>Apple Iphone 6</span> device <span>, the characteristics of</span> which are quite good.  Internet access and networking is very fast.  It is also encouraging that at almost any point, this smartphone catches a 3g signal, but its predecessor did not always succeed.  Connection speed also does not raise any questions.  Even if you are at a decent distance from the antenna of the operator, the network does not disappear and keeps a fairly decent speed of both reception and return.  As for the conversation, it is still more qualitative.  The quality of communication with the interlocutor is beyond praise.  When talking, no noise or cod is heard, it feels like your interlocutor is right next to you.  The speakers also work perfectly.  You do not need to put it at full volume to hear the words of a friend on the phone.  This can not but rejoice. </p><h2>  What comes with your Apple phone </h2><p>  Let's see what the buyer gets after purchasing the Apple iPhone 6 smartphone, the characteristics and design of which caused a lot of positive emotions.  So, in the company box from under the smartphone, you can find, in addition to the brand-new smartphone, all the necessary documentation, which describes all the functions and capabilities of the smartphone.  As a rule, these instructions are used by people who first picked up a smartphone.  For those who have already dealt with similar devices in the past, this stack of papers is not needed.  In addition to documents, a headset is included with the phone.  The company does not change its traditions, and therefore the headphones for this phone differ from the standard ones in their unsurpassed design.  In order to be able to connect to a personal computer, you need a USB cable, which also comes with the phone.  In addition to all of the above, there is also a charger in the box. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone apple iphone 6" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545422.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary and Conclusions </h2><p>  As can be seen from the review, the American manufacturer of smartphones has again released a rather interesting smartphone model, which is already beginning to break records in terms of sales in various markets of the world.  It is worth noting that the company is trying to listen to users and correct those shortcomings that were made in previous smartphones.  The new iPhone was honored with an updated design that a certain circle of people liked, but some did not.  The development team tried to correct the flaws in terms of photographing objects, and she succeeded.  The only thing that can scare away the average buyer from acquiring this unit is its cost.  The price for a smartphone is set at one and a half thousand dollars, which is a fairly large amount, not everyone is ready to afford to spend it.  But, on the other hand, Apple has been releasing smartphones for a long time, which are more expensive than competitors' products, and sales are only growing.  And not every person who bought it will try to belittle his dignity, because he gave a tidy sum of money for it!  What will be the Apple Iphone 6 and what the future awaits him, it will be possible to find out very soon. </p>
