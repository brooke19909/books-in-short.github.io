    <h2>  A few words about the manufacturer </h2><p>  Today, the German company is engaged not only in the manufacture of high-quality refrigerators, but also in other household appliances: from stoves to air conditioners.  The washing machines and small <span>kitchen appliances of</span> this company are also very popular among buyers.  In addition, it was noted that it is developing well in the automotive industry.  Unlike other manufacturers, Bosch does not have a rich history of creation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the company‚Äôs concerns are open all over the world today, and the number of employees has already exceeded 280,000. Thanks to successful development in the automotive industry, it can be noted that this industry accounts for about 60% of the annual profit.  Subsidiaries of the holding are engaged in the manufacture of pneumatic devices. </p><h2>  Bosch KGS39XW20R refrigerator: specifications </h2><p>  This is a two-compressor version with the latest and most optimal features that can only be today.  In addition, the manufacturer claimed a fairly high reliability indicator.  The volume of the <span>freezer,</span> taking into account three food storage compartments, is 95 liters, which makes it possible to use it even for a large family.  The minimum temperature can reach -32 degrees. </p><p>  In the 257 liter cold store, the storage system is well thought out.  It has five shelves, a special bottle holder, two small hanging drawers.  The door is also equipped with comfortable roomy shelves, there is an egg stand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge bosch kgs39xw20r" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1898536.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For many consumers, the moment of saving is considered extremely important.  With a full operating mode involving two compressors per year, the refrigerator consumes about 304 kW.  No one is safe from emergencies, and manufacturers understand this.  However, what a shame it is when the lights turn off and the refrigerator is completely filled with foods that will have to be thrown away.  With the KGS39XW20R model, you can no longer be afraid of this, since it is able to maintain cold for almost a day from the moment the power is turned off.  Thus, each consumer can be calm about the safety of food.  It is worth noting that some buyers specifically turn it off for a day, so as to save on electricity costs.  Of course, experts do not recommend the use of such measures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  First of all, the presence of two compressors.  Those.  Each camera has its own motor.  It should be noted that not all manufacturers in the lineup have a similar option.  In total, compressors work less, which means that their service life will be longer than that of single-compressor models. </p><p>  Thanks to its attractive design and the possibility of a door hinge, the Bosch KGS39XW20R two-chamber refrigerator will fit harmoniously into any interior. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch kgs39xw20r price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1898538.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A distinctive feature of the model is ease of use.  So, for example, each person through the built-in small panel can observe all the settings.  If the door was not completely closed or in a hurry it was completely forgotten to return to its original position, an audible warning appears. </p><h2>  Defrost system </h2><p>  This model lacks such a popular function as No Frost.  But speaking specifically about the defrosting system of the <span>Bosch KGS39XW20R</span> refrigerator <span>,</span> user <span>reviews</span> in most cases are positive.  The manufacturer used the patented Low Frost technology.  Therefore, we can conclude that the cameras will have to be defrosted in manual mode.  In accordance with the instructions attached to the Bosch KGS39XW20R refrigerator, this should not be done more often than once every 6-8 months.  And the process itself does not take much time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The owner of the device will have to disconnect the device from the network, unload the products and wash the compartments.  Ice does not form in the upper chamber, as in old Soviet apparatuses.  In addition, the refrigerator with the lower Bosch KGS39XW20R freezer, thanks to two stand-alone compressors, allows you to defrost the compartments individually.  Also, this feature is convenient when leaving for a long time.  The refrigerator compartment can be turned off to save energy.  Since many people have frosts stored in the lower part for a year, the operation of this camera can be left. </p><h2>  Bosch KGS39XW20R: price </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that this is an average option financially, so almost every average Russian family can purchase it.  Estimated cost is from 25 000 to 35 000 rubles.  For a two-compressor unit, this is quite an adequate cost.  Using advantageous promotions of retail chains or discounts from the manufacturer, you can buy a refrigerator at a very reasonable price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch kgs39xw20r two-compartment refrigerator" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1898541.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of two compressors </h2><p>  Since the Bosch KGS39XW20R refrigerator involves the operation of two compressors, it is necessary to find out whether such a purchase is beneficial, whether there are good reasons to purchase this equipment. </p><p>  It is important to understand that not all manufacturers have similar models in the new line.  The main advantage of this innovation is the uniform load distribution.  After all, each compressor performs its role.  The first controls and ensures the operation of the refrigerator compartment, and the second - freezers. </p><p>  Other benefits include: </p><ol><li>  Long service life, as the load is evenly distributed and each compressor is responsible for a specific compartment </li><li>  Convenient temperature setting system.  If necessary, you can turn off one of the chambers, for example, for defrosting, washing or in case of vacation. </li></ol>

    <p>  It is worth noting that Bosch KGS39XW20R repair, according to user reviews, is more expensive, even if one of the compressors fails.  Since most often you have to change both motors.  As a rule, masters recommend thinking about buying a new refrigerator.  But do not put this fact above the rest when choosing a model.  The company uses high-quality components, so repairs may not be required during the entire operational period. </p><h2>  The presence or absence of the ability to change the location of the shelves </h2><p>  A convenient storage system is organized inside the refrigerator.  In the refrigerator compartment, 5 main shelves are fixed, which can be changed in height. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch kgs39xw20r bottom refrigerator" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1898542.jpg"></div>  In addition, they are made of durable glass.  There is a special box for storing fruits and vegetables, so the products retain their quality and presentation for a long time.  There are additional containers for storing eggs, butter, hanging insert for bottles.
