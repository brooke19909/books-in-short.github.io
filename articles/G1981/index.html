In the process of development, the concepts invested in it have repeatedly changed.  In medieval times, trying to compose a doctrine of being, he was considered as a philosophical proof of truths in religion.  With the advent of <span>modern times,</span> ontology in philosophy has become a part of metaphysics that studies the supersensible structure of everything that exists. </p><p>  Today, ontology is a branch of philosophy about being, the supersensible world, and the world as a whole. </p><p>  Thus, the terms ‚Äúmetaphysics‚Äù and ‚Äúontology‚Äù are close in meaning.  For some time they were used as synonyms.  Over time, the term ‚Äúmetaphysics‚Äù has fallen into disuse, and ontology has rightfully taken its place. </p>

    <p>  Object of study in ontology </p><p>  There are two main aspects - being and non-being - that are studied by the ontology in philosophy.  For a philosophical understanding of everything that exists in the world, the category of being acts as the source.  Ontological exploration of the world involves the use of a whole system of philosophical categories, the main of which are the concepts of being and non-being. </p><p>  Being is an all-encompassing reality, that which exists is actually.  The concept of "being" includes a world that really exists.  It forms the basis of all phenomena and things, guarantees their presence.  Nothingness is the absence, the unreality of everything that is concrete, existing.  Thus, ontology is a branch of philosophy about existence, being. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The origin and development of ontology </p><p>  What stages of formation did the ontology pass <span>in philosophy?</span>  <span>Philosophy</span> as a science and the question of being arise simultaneously.  For the first time, Parmenides, the philosopher of antiquity, took up his study.  For him, being and thought were identical concepts.  He also argued that being did not appear from somewhere and it is also impossible to destroy it, it is immovable and will never end in time.  Nothingness, in his opinion, does not exist. </p><p>  Democritus held the view that all things are atoms, thus recognizing being and non-being. </p><p>  Plato opposed the world of spiritual ideas and essences - that which represents true being, to the world of sensual things, which tend to change.  He recognized both being and non-being. </p><p>  Aristotle represented matter as "being in opportunity." </p><p>  In the teachings that arose in the Middle Ages, by being they understood God himself.  With the advent of modern times, ontology in philosophy interpreted being as the mind, the consciousness of man.  The only, undoubted and genuine being was the personality, its consciousness and needs, its life.  It consists of such basic forms: the spiritual and material being of a person, the being of things, the being of society (social).  Such unity helps to present the common basis of all that exists. </p>

    <p>  The realities of everyday life are opposed by a system of a normatively evaluating world, to which a person submits.  She dictates to each person various rules and requirements - political, moral, legal.  This system also introduces certain norms into the life world of everyone (for example, from what age you can attend school, take part in election processes, marry, be held administratively and criminally liable), and prescribe certain norms of behavior. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the philosophical and legal ontology is a way of organizing and interpreting certain aspects of social life and, at the same time, human being.  The being of law and being itself have significant differences, because legal being provides for the fulfillment of certain duties.  A person must obey the laws adopted in society.  Therefore, philosophical and legal ontology is a branch of science that has its own specifics.  He regards being of law as being-duty.  The law is a sphere of due, namely, that the "visible" as it were does not exist, but the reality of which is of great importance in the life of each representative of society. </p><p>  By legal reality is also meant a system that exists within the framework of human being.  It consists of elements that are characterized by the performance of certain functions.  In essence, this is an add-on that includes legal institutions, relationships, and consciousness. </p>
