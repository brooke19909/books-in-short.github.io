    <h2>  About accommodation </h2><p>  According to tourists, the ski resorts of Adler (Krasnaya Polyana, Rosa Khutor, Gorki-Gorod, etc.) are a chic vacation spot, but not cheap.  There are a lot of different hotels and hotels - mainly five- and four-star ones.  So, for example, a double room in the guest house ‚ÄúGrace Project‚Äù for a week will cost 77,000 rubles (in winter, at peak season).  And this, one can say, is one of the most budget options.  There are, of course, places where accommodation will cost about a thousand and a half per day.  But there are beds in dormitory rooms, which is, of course, a budget, but not quite a comfortable solution.  However, if the financial question of people who want to visit the ski resorts of Adler does not care, it's worth the trip.  You can even rent a villa in Krasnaya Polyana - for seven days it will cost about half a million rubles.  Not for one person, of course, as many people as you like can live in the villa, but within reasonable limits (which are determined by the number of beds). </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Although Adler ski resorts are shocking with prices, you can spend time here with a bang, however, you can stock up on an unlimited card or wallet without a bottom in advance.  A full tasty lunch here will cost more than 500 rubles - you need to be prepared for this.  But in Krasnaya Polyana there are a lot of shops and convenience stores, where products cost about the same as below, in the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, how can you spend your holidays here?  Adler is a resort that pleases with its diversity.  There are a lot of tracks, the total length of which is 39 kilometers.  Lifts lift people to a height of about 2300 meters above sea level!  There is a daily ski pass of about 1600 rubles per day. </p><p>  Families are advised to stay at the Gazprom Laura complex.  There are trails of small and moderate steepness, and besides, you can ride there in the evening.  For adults, the cost of a ski pass is about a thousand rubles on weekdays. </p><p>  Many people like the "Mountain Carousel" - a complex that delights visitors with routes of various difficulty levels.  In general, it is for the sake of skis, snowboards and atmosphere that many come to Adler.  <span>The resort</span> receives the best <span>reviews</span> - the only thing a tourist can be dissatisfied with (and who came with a very small budget) is the price.  Therefore, heading to Krasnaya Polyana, it is worth taking more finances with you - they will come in handy. </p><h2>  Olympic facilities </h2><p>  The vast majority of tourists, having arrived in the resort city of Adler, first of all go to the <span>Olympic Park, to</span> look at the places where the Winter Games were held.  Getting to it is easy - many minibuses ply there from the center.  In addition, in the Olympic Park you can admire not only the stadiums, torches and the Formula 1 track.  Just a short walk away there is a calm and quiet promenade with benches and spacious beaches.  Basically, all tourists go to the central beaches, but here the water is much calmer and, most importantly, quieter.  Many people care about the question: "Is there an entrance fee?"  The answer will please many - no, anyone can get to the beach, like to the Olympic Park, and absolutely free of charge. </p>

    <h2>  Budget options </h2><p>  Many people think that Sochi is the most expensive city in Russia.  Resort Adler, of course, does not differ at very low prices.  However, it is quite possible to find economical, budget vacation options.  Firstly, there are tons of free entertainment here.  The Adler resort, whose photos demonstrate a modern city that does not fall asleep even at night, is currently the most successful place for holding various festivals, competitions and concerts.  Many events are often free, so it‚Äôs a sin not to attend them.  Regarding accommodation - for 500-1000 rubles per day you can find a good guest house, located 10-15 minutes walk from the center.  It is better to look for an option with your own or shared kitchen - there are plenty of them too.  Since the products in Adler are cheap - both in the markets and in the market (especially there).  Because you can easily cook yourself, and it will not hit the budget. </p>
