  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mouse pattern with a detailed description of sewing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A small mouse can be sewn very quickly if you perform all the steps in the desired sequence and prepare the necessary materials in advance.  Small toys are often made from felt sheets.  It is soft and warm material, pleasant to the touch and comfortable to sew.  You do not have to process the edges of the fabric, since the threads on the cut of the felt do not split.  Small elements: eyes, mouth, mustache and ears - can generally be glued with hot glue.  They will be perfectly fixed. </p><p>  If you will make a mouse from a felt on a pattern for a child to play, it is better to use a nylon thread to fasten the parts.  It is advisable not to give such small toys to a child under 3 years old so that he does not tear off the buttons of his eyes and put them in his nose or ear. </p><p>  Such cute mice, as in the main photo in the article, can be used not only for children's fun.  It is interesting to attach them as a decor to a bag, backpack or wallet, carry them with keys in the form of a keychain, and give your beloved kitten for entertainment. </p><p>  In the article, we consider an easy mouse pattern for sewing toys with a detailed description of the work.  You can use felt sheets in all shades of gray.  The ears of a rodent are often made pink.  The fabric options of the toy also look great.  It is advisable to use cotton or linen, the material of which is not stretched and comfortable in sewing. </p><h2>  Mouse pattern </h2><p>  To sew a toy animal, you need to draw just a few details.  Two of them are the same - for the sides.  They look like a semicircle with a decrease in the size of the arc towards the rodent's muzzle.  The shape of the bottom resembles a drop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.365designs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric mouse pattern" class="if uuid-3178448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3178448.jpg"></div><p>  The same circles are drawn for the ears, a thin angle is cut off on them.  This is necessary to give them volume.  As you can see, on the mouse pattern, the sides are the same, so you can use one template to cut the part.  The length of an even line of side A and B is equal to the length of the center line of the bottom.  Sizes can be used different, depending on the version of the craft.  It is better for the child to make a large toy, and hang a small mouse on the keys. </p><h2>  Sewing crafts </h2><p>  For sewing you will need yarn threads for the tail, felt sheet, scissors, glue gun, filler to give volume.  In our case, sawdust and synthetic winterizer were used.  A needle with a thread is required for stitching parts and making a nose.  It is convenient to process all seams with shiny floss. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liagriffith.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a mouse on a pattern" class="if uuid-3178427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3178427.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, the mouse pattern is slightly different from the previous version.  The bottom is pointed on both sides, and the bottom line of the sides is not even, but smoother.  The ears are oval, with a cut bottom edge. </p><p>  Sewing begins with the upper seam, connecting the sidewalls on the back of the mouse.  Then the bottom is sewn.  Be sure to leave a hole for the insertion of the filler.  When the synthetic winterizer is inserted, all parts are stitched to the end. </p><h2>  Small parts </h2><p>  The tail when sewing a mouse on a pattern with their own hands is done either from a braided thread or use a piece of rope.  So that it does not fall out through the seam threads, a knot is tied at its end, which is hidden inside the body of the rodent.  Nose is done with stitches.  They make a small fold on the ears, and then glue them with a glue gun.  To form the eyes, you can use half beads or round buttons of black color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.womansweekly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tissue mice" class="if uuid-3178453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3178453.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs easy to make such a toy, the main thing is to want to create with your own hands.  You can assemble a mouse from the remaining scraps of any fabric, even into a flower or a cage.  Try to make such a craft using the patterns and tips given in the article. </p>
