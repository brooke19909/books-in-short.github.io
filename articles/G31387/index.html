Traditionally, there are two players on the market who share it among themselves.  And they do it quite successfully, so that users can only observe and choose.  More debate can only be raised with a question regarding <span>AMD</span> or Intel processors. </p><p>  Indeed, both players, concurrently the main and almost the only participants in this battle, have been fighting for several years now.  No one wants to give up their positions, but at the same time the struggle between them is so strong that users receive new models regularly, and they do not put sky-high prices on their products.  However, the question of quality and performance still remains, which, in fact, helps to answer which video cards are the best? </p><p>  Most of all this question puzzles the minds of computer game lovers.  They conduct tests and compare their results with each other, share their impressions.  But what do Ati and nVidia actually offer? </p><p>  Lineups of video cards </p><p>  It is difficult to compare these two brands, if only because they adhere to several different positions.  Often, all supporters are divided in half, depending on which <span>video card is installed</span> in the computer - Radeon or GeForce.  And these motherboards themselves in some cases get accidentally together with a ready-made system unit or in the configuration of a laptop manufacturer. </p><p>  Moreover, in order to at least try to answer the question which video cards are the best, it is necessary to take into account the fact that companies produce entire model lines.  And each model is different in price and performance.  In addition, each company has "hard days", so this or that version may not be entirely successful, but very quickly the situation clears. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Again, a lot depends on what the user is interested in, which video cards are better for a laptop or for a stationary computer, because the same versions may differ in performance depending on the version - mobile or full.  It is also necessary to take into account those circumstances and tasks for which the video card is selected.  For games, one is suitable, for working with graphics and video others. </p><p>  General trends </p><p>  Of course, it cannot be denied that there is always a general tendency with all video cards, on the basis of which each user can conclude for himself which is the best video card for him. </p><p>  Traditionally, it has turned out that products under the Radeon brand are considered to be somewhat more productive than GeForce video cards, but at the same time, nVidia has always been attentive to its developments and the organization of services for its customers.  They rarely have problems installing drivers and supporting certain technologies in games, which in some cases compensates for a slightly weaker hardware. </p><p>  It has already happened more than once when Ati was not ready to release one or another game, poor-quality drivers reduced performance due to poor optimization.  But if everything is done at the proper level, that the hardware showed its full potential and noticeably outperformed the video card under the nVidia GeForce brand in terms of speed and picture quality. </p><p>  Real professionals look at the indicators of "overclocking" capabilities, cooling and possible problems with overheating, and support for individual technologies.  Although in general, both experts and users agree that in the same price category there are video cards of approximately the same power, capable of coping with a given game with an equal result.  In addition, when deciding which video cards are the best, it is worth remembering that performance is determined not only by the video card, but by the whole system. </p>
