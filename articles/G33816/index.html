    <h2>  Hint for tourists </h2><p>  In fact, getting lost here is completely impossible.  This is a tourist town where everything is set for vacationers.  In general - this is Sochi.  <span>Arboretum Park</span> is too famous a sight to have to search for.  Take a taxi and in a few minutes you will be there. </p><p>  However, many tourists decide to hit the road on their own in order to simultaneously appreciate the beauty of the city of Sochi.  <span>The Arboretum park,</span> which can be reached in several ways, is located at Khostinsky district, Kurortny prospekt, 74. By purchasing a city map at any kiosk, you can easily find it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Entrance to the Arboretum is through the Central Gate located in front of the Upper Park.  You can get to them from the coast or the lower part on foot, but the road is not long and goes uphill.  Therefore, it is best to use the funicular and start exploring from the upper part of the Arboretum, gradually going down. </p><p>  By public transport you need to get to the Circus stop.  Almost all routes go to it, so there will be no difficulties.  Moreover, buses and minibuses pass here not only from Sochi, but also from neighboring resort areas.  So, number 105 is an ideal option for those who want to visit the Arboretum (Sochi).  How to get from the <span>Olympic Park?</span>  You just need to get on the bus and get off at the indicated stop. </p><h2>  Mode of operation </h2><p>  Here you are expected every day, at any time of the year.  The Arboretum park in Sochi is always beautiful, and no matter what the weather is outside.  It is never sad here.  The summer abundance of flowers replaces the autumn riot of colors.  In winter, the most delicate plants are covered with special caps, but the territory does not lose its incredible beauty from this.  And in the spring, he recommends that romantics visit the Arboretum park in Sochi. </p><p>  Opening hours in the summer - from 8:00 to 21:00.  If you want to consider every corner of the park, then come here for the whole day.  The winter period begins on November 1 and lasts until March 1.  At this time, visitors are expected from 9:00 to 17:00. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park arboretum in sochi" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1422567.jpg" width="448"></div>

A ticket for one adult - 250 rubles.  It allows you to walk around the entire territory.  When buying a ticket, a park card is issued, which is very convenient.  Children's cheaper, 120 rubles.  Up to seven years old kids are free.  <span>The cable car</span> for an adult - 200 rubles, for a child - 100. The park operates seven days a week. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  When going on an excursion, consider the air temperature in Sochi.  The Arboretum park is very large, there are many shady alleys on its territory, however, before planning your trip, you need to get acquainted with the map.  The fact is that it is divided into two halves.  The plain is located closer to the sea, and the second on the side of the mountain.  Both parts are connected by a tunnel, so from the main entrance you can go directly to the Lower Park.  However, in this case, you will be forced to climb up the mountain slope in the very sunshine to explore the Upper Park.  Therefore, we recommend using the funicular and starting the way down. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi park arboretum get" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1422565.jpg" width="600"></div>
