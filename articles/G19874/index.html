Reasons and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All modern people use various gadgets, the main of which is a mobile phone.  The latest released models are running operating systems, like computers.  They have multi-core processors, huge displays.  All these devices have one very important detail that ensures their mobility.  This, of course, is the battery.  A battery helps the device work offline.  Most smartphones run on lithium <span>batteries, which last</span> four years in average use.  But it also happens that the battery fails prematurely and swells.  So, if the battery on the phone is swollen, what should I do?  Because of what is this happening, and is it possible to bring the battery back to life? </p><h2>  Why does the phone battery swell </h2>

    <p>  A swollen mobile phone battery loses its capacity.  Because of this, it becomes unusable.  This can be explained by the fact that due to the pressure of the gases that are inside the battery case, the plates are stratified.  To return the battery to working condition, you need to close these plates.  This is often possible.  If the battery on your phone has swollen, there may be two reasons for this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the battery control board, called the charge-discharge controller, has broken; </li><li>  improper reaction in the battery with a working controller. </li></ul><p>  In both cases, the processes that occur in the battery are disrupted.  Because of this, gases begin to be released, which leads to bloating of the battery due to too much pressure. </p><h2>  Other reasons </h2>

    <p>  What causes a smartphone‚Äôs battery bloat? </p><ul><li>  Strong shock or battery drop. </li><li>  Liquid has spilled into the battery. </li><li>  Factory defect, which is detected on new batteries quickly enough. </li><li>  Incorrect battery charging or continuous recharging. </li><li>  Using a low-quality charger. </li><li>  The battery simply worked out.  This usually happens with batteries after 4-5 years of service. </li></ul><p>  All this can lead to bloating of the phone battery. </p><p>  If the battery on the mobile is swollen, what should I do?  In the case when the period of use is still not very long, but the warranty has already expired, you can try to eliminate bloating.  Sometimes such an operation makes it possible to return the <span>battery capacity</span> and make its further operation possible. </p><h2>  What should I do if the battery in my phone is swollen? </h2>

This does not always help.  After all, if the battery is old, it makes no sense to do this.  Even if the gases escape, the old battery will no longer work, because lithium is destroyed during the service life, the capacity is lost.  But if the battery does not last that long, then you can try to restore it. </p><h2>  Window and ball for exhaust gases </h2>

    <p>  In some batteries with an aluminum case, there is a special window through which gases are discharged.  This window is under the control board.  At this point, a small puncture can be made with a sharp object through which the accumulated gases will escape.  Often, batteries come in iron cases.  If the battery on the mobile is swollen, what to do with models with an iron case?  Such models have a special ball for the release of gases.  It needs to be pressed, but this should not be done very much, since the ball can go deep and close the plates.  In the process of exhaust gases, you can smell a specific smell. </p><h2>  Form return </h2><p>  After the gases from the battery are released, you need to get rid of bloating.  To do this, you need a heavy object having a smooth surface.  They can align the battery case with little effort.  You can take a pair of plates made of metal, wood or plastic.  They are attached to the battery, and this design is not slightly clamped in a vice.  It is necessary to leave the battery in this state for several hours to completely align the case.  After straightening the housing, its sealing is needed.  The hole that was made for the release of gases is filled with glue or sealant, after which the controller is installed in place.  Now you need to charge the battery either on the phone or on the charger. </p><p>  It is worth saying that part of the battery capacity will be lost, but then performance will return.  Well, if after many years of service the battery on the mobile has swollen, what should I do?  Discard and replace with a new one. </p><h2>  Battery Puncture </h2><p>  Another point.  It also happens that the battery has neither a window nor a ball.  In this case, you can try to pierce the body with a sharp object.  The puncture should be carried out at an angle.  If it is done vertically, then the chance is great to close the plate.  And if after that you just have to throw away the battery, then this is still good, since it can even ignite. </p><p>  So, if the battery on the phone is swollen, what should I do?  Now it‚Äôs clear that it is necessary to pierce it by releasing gases, and then return to form.  Thus, you can reanimate the battery and not waste money on a new one. </p><h2>  Choosing a new battery </h2>

    <p>  Is the battery on the phone bloated?  What should I do if the battery is completely out of order and cannot be restored?  Need to buy a new one.  But how to choose it?  After all, the assortment of batteries in stores is simply huge.  Obviously, first of all, it should be suitable for the device.  You do not need to trust sellers who claim that inexpensive batteries have a large capacity.  Usually the price matches the quality. </p><p>  If you take into account the type, then it is preferable to lithium-ion or lithium-polymer.  They are created using modern technology and provide the ability to recharge at any time. </p><p>  The second important parameter is the battery capacity.  Of course, it‚Äôs better to be big.  After all, then the phone will be able to work much longer. </p><p>  The manufacturer is not the last value.  The stores offer a wide selection of products from a wide variety of companies.  This makes purchase difficult.  But market analysis shows that only a small fraction of manufacturers can offer high quality batteries. </p><p>  One of the best is TF1.  The products are covered by a warranty of up to two years, and the parameters on the box correspond to the real ones.  Also high quality batteries differ from the well-known Nokia, Samsung, Fonmedia. </p><p>  These are the steps you need to perform when the battery on your phone has swollen.  What to do, everyone who reads this article will understand. </p>
