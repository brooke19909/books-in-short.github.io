  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social division of labor</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The division of labor is a process that has developed historically through the separation, modification and consolidation of certain <span>types of activities.</span>  It is realized in society in the form of the performance by its members of various works. </p><p>  In ancient times, people were forced to provide for themselves all by themselves.  It was so inefficient and only contributed to the preservation of primitive life, that even then the first social division of labor occurred.  It became possible thanks to the advent of trade.  You can read more about this at the beginning of Adam Smith's treatise. </p><p>  Distinguish between the social division of labor and the international.  The latter type is such a way of organizing the economy in the world when each country specializes in the production of a particular type of service or goods, and then exchanges them.  And the social division of labor is when social functions are distributed among members of society.  First of all, two large groups can be distinguished: managerial labor and productive. </p><p>  The main principle of the division of labor is the combination of the specialization of a particular employee with an increase in his technical level, and hence productivity. </p><p>  The faster the development of the latest technologies, the more complicated the processes become <span>.</span>  <span>The social</span> division of labor must correspond to them, not stand still, but also develop and deepen.  This is due to the fact that its forms affect many aspects: the equipment of work places, their maintenance, and specialization.  The methods and methods of labor and its norms also depend on them.  Various forms of its separation and cooperation provide a uniform load on workers, synchronization of their work. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The essence of the division of labor is the allocation of such <span>types of work,</span> which are not the entire production process, but its individual parts and are assigned to specific workers.  This is done in order to be able to simultaneously perform various operations.  In addition, it speeds up the acquisition of skills by employees. </p><p>  At the same time at the enterprise, the social division of labor can take place in the following forms: substantive, technological, functional, program-target, qualification and professional. </p><p>  When <span>the production process is</span> divided into separate technological operations, phases or stages, there is a technological division of labor.  It depends on the type of work and can be operational, substantive and detail. </p><p>  Functional division of labor occurs when a particular type of work is performed by a group of workers who specialize in the performance of certain functions. </p><p>  The professional division of labor depends on the type of profession acquired by specialists.  Workers perform in their places only the type of work that lies within the framework of the profession they acquired. </p><p>  Qualification division of labor is caused by differences in the level of knowledge and experience of employees. </p><p>  The manufacture of specific types of products by employees and units causes a substantive division of labor.  It can be, for example, parts, products, units. </p><p>  The essence of the linear division of labor (which is part of the functional) is to establish managers at a specific facility (workshop, site).  Their rights, roles and responsibilities are clearly delineated. </p><p>  The formation of groups of workers in order to solve specific problems forms a program-targeted division of labor.  In practice, it looks like a complete set of teams (creative, labor) for a while. </p><p>  The <span>type of</span> division of labor to choose is influenced by the <span>type of production, the</span> volume of output that is produced, its complexity and other factors.  Such features, in turn, cause certain boundaries of labor. </p>
