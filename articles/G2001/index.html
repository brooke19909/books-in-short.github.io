Residents of socialist countries so called girls and boys who were members of a children's public organization.  But in the United States and Western European countries they called a skilled and courageous person, a successful pioneer.  In this sense, the Japanese company Pioneer has always positioned itself, preferring to be at the forefront of technological excellence and technological progress.  Over its long history, which began on the first day of 1938, this company was engaged in the production of various types of equipment.  She owns many palm trees associated with the introduction of advanced technologies in production. </p>

    <p>  Modern AV receivers have a large list of connectors required for connection, namely: </p><ul><li>  compositional video and stereo - RCA; </li><li>  component for video; </li><li>  multi-channel video and audio jack HDMI; </li><li>  coaxial and optical, designed for multi-channel sound. </li></ul><p>  The number and variety of connectors can be different and depends on the class of the device, its functionality, as well as the price category. </p><h2>  Audio calibration </h2><p>  The Pioneer digital receiver is endowed with special features.  They are created due to the fact that Pioneer specialists were able to make their own technological discovery.  They created a multi-channel acoustics calibration.  Ideally, such a technology allows optimal tuning of indicators necessary for a particular room in which listening to audio recordings.  In this regard, mostly positive receivers receive Pioneer reviews.  Indeed, such a characteristic is their clear advantage over similar products of other brands.  Today, depending on the specific function, the company uses 3 levels of such technology: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  MCACC, working to measure the size and level of the speaker, as well as the distance to the subject.  In this case, a specific autonomous sound adjustment is carried out.  Such a system is able to independently make settings based on the information it receives.  This allows you to get the highest quality sound effects.  At the same time, Pioneer receivers are also endowed with the function of phase control.  This allows you to configure the delay of sounds and their equalization in accordance with the phase of other channels. </li><li>  Advaced MCACC, capable of 3D calibration, as well as measurements at more accurate readings.  This is made possible by using the Auto Phase time axis.  In addition, this technology allows for the additional Control Plus function, which provides automatic compensation and real-time phase analysis between the main signals.  The Standing Wave control function reduces unnecessary sound resonance. </li><li>  MCACC Pro.  This technology is considered the most advanced.  It went beyond the functions described above and includes a correction and phase analyzer.  At the same time, it becomes possible to group the indicators of the delay characteristics, which are possible due to imperfect filtering systems located in the loudspeaker.  At the same time, the adjustment process is activated, providing a smooth stream of reproduced sounds between different channels.  The technology provides for the implementation of the tuning function necessary for dual amplifiers, as well as adjusting the position of the speaker in increments of 1 mm.  It is worth noting that MCACC Pro works for all channels as a setting for the phase difference existing in the original audio recording coming from the speakers. </li></ol><h2>  Video playback </h2><p>  The Pioneer VSX AV receiver of almost the entire range created by the manufacturer is capable of supporting 4K / 24p / 4: 4: 4 / 36- and 4K / 60p / 4: 4: 4/24-bit signals.  As a result, the device allows you to turn on the palette of bright sounds.  Each of the devices on the Pioneer VSX AV receiver converts 4K video signals to consistent ones. </p><p>  In addition to other advantages, the video converter provided in the design of the device can be noted.  This element converts a composite video signal into a component one. </p>

    <p>  He is also able to convert any of the existing types of analog video signals with HDMI, that is, when you connect the following: </p><ul><li>  PC; </li><li>  DVD </li><li>  Blu-ray </li><li>  media player; </li><li>  video cameras; </li><li>  game consoles. </li></ul><p>  It is worth considering that this function is endowed with models that are in a high price category. </p><h2>  Advantages of Pioneer Products </h2><p>  What do Pioneer receiver manufacturers guarantee?  Customer reviews suggest that many products are attracted by such technical specifications as: </p><ul><li>  the presence of a digital system equipped with various software settings giving high-quality surround sound and allowing you to enjoy watching movies, listening to music and more fully perceive the space of video games; </li><li>  the presence of a powerful multi-channel audio amplifier that allows you to support digital audio sound formats; </li><li>  the presence of a high-quality receiver with digital indexing, which can be seen on the receiver's screen; </li><li>  excellent characteristics of a variety of audio and video systems that are in a one-time switching, as well as an affordable selection of audio and video sources using the remote control. </li></ul><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that installing only one Pioneer VSX AV receiver is not possible to configure the implementation of enveloping sound.  To create the necessary quality of the surrounding sound, you will have to acquire an acoustic system. </p><p>  Consider a brief overview of Pioneer receivers, which are very popular among consumers and deserve attention for their superior quality and reliability. </p><h2>  Model VSX-422-K </h2><p>  The Japanese company "Pioneer", being a well-deserved authority in the field of video and audio, offers the user a low-cost multi-channel component for a serious cinema system.  This is a Pioneer-422 receiver. </p><p>  When creating this device, the company did not save on design, on finishing the device.  She took care of the right choice of components and materials. </p><p>  The Pioneer-422 receiver is a true classic of the genre.  It has 5 gain channels and an output to the subwoofer.  As for functionality, this device is quite ascetic.  It does not have a USB port.  There is also no network interface and compatibility with the most common mobile gadgets.  However, not everything is so poor and poor.  The Pioneer-422 receiver does its job perfectly.  Its power amplifiers are made using Direct Energy technology.  Moreover, they are able to develop up to 130 watts for each channel.  This indicator is enough to serve large rooms.  I want to emphasize that this feature distinguishes it from similar devices in the public sector. </p><p>  In general, judging by the reviews of experts, all Pioneer receivers are famous for the digital part.  This is confirmed even in the younger model of similar devices of this line, which is the Pioneer-422.  It is endowed with features such as: </p><ul><li>  delay management and acoustics adjustment for phase-frequency characteristics; </li><li>  dynamic control of the existing range, which allows you to create the effect of surround sound; </li><li>  the ability of the built-in tuner to memorize up to 30 stations in a separate band, etc. </li></ul><p>  Already these functions listed above indicate the seriousness of the model.  Despite belonging to the budget option, it has an excellent ratio of quality and price, working confidently and professionally. </p><h2>  Model VSX-527-K </h2><p>  When choosing a <span>receiver for a home cinema</span> with a tight budget, buyers tend to pay attention to the youngest model in the entire line.  However, looking at the review of Pioneer receivers, you can make sure that the device following the release date offers a large number of additional functions, and you will not have to pay much more for it.  This is a receiver with the VSX-527 index.  Users note that this device is solid and of high quality. </p><p>  The Pioneer-527 receiver is literally crammed with the most advanced features.  Its exterior design is copied from the previous model.  The differences lie only in subtle details on the facade and in the wider switching arsenal available on the rear wall of the housing.  In addition, the Pioneer-527 receiver is slightly heavier than the previous model (200 g). </p>

    <p>  This device offers a huge number of functions that are not provided in the previous version.  For example, users are pleased with the RJ-45 connector, designed for twisted-pair Ethernet, as well as the port to which you can connect an external Ethernet adapter.  All this allows the receiver to integrate into the home network of the PC, opening access to a variety of multimedia content from Internet radio stations and DLNA servers.  However, this is far from all.  Thanks to the network connection, the device can be controlled using a smartphone or Android.  This becomes relevant when you install the free Pioneer ControlApp utility on your mobile phone.  After that, the gadget turns into a remote control for the Pioneer receiver, which is more functional than the regular one. </p><p>  In VSX-527, a minor defect such as the presence of spring terminals for the rear and central speakers was fixed.  A more advanced device makes it possible to connect with acoustics using five pairs of screw channels with an output power of each of 130 watts.  This function allows the receiver, despite its budget sector, to serve large rooms.  <span>The digital-to-analog converter</span> model has the parameters of 24 bit / 192 kHz.  But the characteristics of the ADC is a little more modest.  It is only 24 bit / 96 kHz. </p><p>  Among other functions, users note dynamic range control, Stream Direct mode, DSD converter (two channels), the ability to delay sound, as well as the ability to determine the difference and further automatic sound control. </p><p>  With a small difference in the price of useful functions, the VSX-527 receiver is much more than the VSX-422. </p><h2>  Models VSX-920-K and VSX-1020-K </h2><p>  These devices are the most democratic.  The manufacturer released them for a young dynamic audience, seeking to see in the purchased device a combination of the highest quality and multifunctionality.  The described models are released using innovative technologies, which allows them to meet the requirements of the most demanding consumers.  That is why they will surely appeal to lovers of modern technical devices. </p><p>  The Pioneer receivers of the VSX-920 and VSX-1020 models are capable of converting a video signal and improve the quality of the supplied picture to the highest resolution (1080p).  At the same time, their special convector allows you to watch movies with quality as close as possible to the original. </p>
