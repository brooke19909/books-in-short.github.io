How to access iCloud from iPhone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cloud services among modern users of PCs and mobile devices are in great demand.  They help to store large amounts of data on special servers, and then upload them if necessary.  Very comfortably!  And the place on the phone / computer does not deal with unnecessary documents.  Today we will be interested in the cloud on the iPhone.  How to watch it?  And go through authorization in it?  What is the iPhone cloud service used for?  In reality, everything is simpler than it seems.  And users can quickly take advantage of Apple's proprietary cloud service for their needs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="osxdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ICloud data sync" class="if uuid-2879619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2879619.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Apple has a unique service.  It's about <span>iCloud.</span>  <span>What is</span> this  And what is the appropriate option used for? </p><p>  ICloud Cloud is a service that allows you to synchronize data with devices of a particular Apple ID.  With it, you can transfer information from your phone or tablet to new "apple" devices, as well as view them or restore if necessary. </p><p>  Apple's cloud service is a common, albeit very convenient, data warehouse.  When configuring this option, a person will be able to choose how to save and synchronize information.  We will talk about this later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why used </h2><p>  How to see the cloud on the iPhone?  First you‚Äôll have to figure out why iCloud is used at all.  Maybe you can do without it? </p><p>  Apple Cloud Storage is used for: </p><ul><li>  creating backup copies of data; </li><li>  Shopping </li><li>  work with any documents on the device; </li><li>  Family Access settings </li><li>  saving and changing mobile device parameters; </li><li>  search and lock your lost iPhone; </li><li>  Key bindings and Safari maps </li><li>  work with applications of the App Store; </li><li>  work remotely with a Mac. </li></ul><p>  In fact, the iCloud cloud makes life easier for the owner of the apple device.  Without it, working with Apple devices is extremely difficult.  Therefore, users usually activate a branded cloud service on the iPhone or iPad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="money.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is iCloud for?" class="if uuid-2879621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2879621.jpg"></div><h2>  Data storage capacity </h2><p>  How to see the cloud on the iPhone?  Before you start working with this service, you need to thoroughly study it. </p><p>  Any data cloud has a certain amount.  By default, only 5 GB of space is allocated for storing data from the iPhone.  You don‚Äôt have to pay for this amount. </p><p>  If for one reason or another, a person does not have enough allocated space, he can buy it.  To do this, there is a Buy button in the cloud service settings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Photos have no restrictions on the amount of data storage.  But the cloud service stores the last 1,000 images per month.  As soon as the total number of images in iCloud exceeds the specified limit, the service will automatically erase the old data. </p><h2>  About registration </h2><p>  How to log in to the iCloud cloud?  First you have to register here.  But how? </p><p>  iCloud is a service from Apple.  He uses Apple ID for work.  There is no and cannot be any separate registration in the cloud service.  Therefore, all that is required for the owner of the "apple" device is to get yourself an Apple ID. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtoisolve.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work with files with iCloud" class="if uuid-2879623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2879623.jpg"></div><h2>  Turn on on your mobile device </h2><p>  How to see the cloud on the iPhone?  We have already said that a separate account and registration for working with iCloud is not required.  Instead, you have to be puzzled by the creation of Apple ID.  Suppose that one or another user already has such an account.  What's next? </p><p>  Entrance to "Iklaud" from the "iPhone" is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Turn on your mobile device and look at the main menu of the device. </li><li>  Go to the "Settings" section. </li><li>  Find and click on iCloud. </li><li>  Tap on the line with an example e-mail. </li><li>  Specify a password to log in to Apple ID. </li><li>  In the field "Required" enter data from the "apple" identifier.  Namely, the password for authorization in the system. </li><li>  Click on the sign "Login". </li><li>  Agree or refuse to attach Safari to iCloud. </li><li>  Set up geolocation.  Usually just tap on the inscription "OK". </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now you can work with the cloud service from Apple.  There is nothing difficult about this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where to set up </h2><p>  How to enter the cloud called iCloud?  It is enough to follow the previously indicated manual.  It will help activate the cloud service on your mobile device.  After that, iCloud will work on an ongoing basis.  User data is uploaded to the cloud automatically when connected to the Internet. </p><p>  Where is the cloud in the iPhone?  Usually this question arises when there is a need to edit the settings of the cloud service. </p><p>  To log in to iCloud you will have to proceed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Press the button responsible for opening the main menu of the device. </li><li>  Select "Settings." </li><li>  Tap on iCloud. </li></ol><p>  A small menu will appear on the screen of your smartphone or tablet.  Here you configure the cloud settings.  We can assume that this is "iCloud." </p><div class="photo" data-original="4apple.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ICloud Settings on iPhone" class="if uuid-2879616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2879616.jpg"></div><h2>  Web version </h2><p>  Where is the cloud in the iPhone?  The answer to a similar question we have already considered.  It is located in the "Settings" section of a particular mobile device.  Using a cloud service is easier than it sounds.  The main thing is to have an Apple ID account.  You can‚Äôt do without it. </p><p>  How to view information in the iPhone cloud?  You can use the iCloud web version.  It‚Äôs best to do this from a computer, but we‚Äôll focus on the mobile device. </p><p>  The main problem is that iCloud does not have a mobile version.  The data cloud is represented either by a site, or by a special program for Mac, or by an item in the settings of a mobile device.  Nevertheless, this limitation can be circumvented. </p><p>  How to see the cloud on the iPhone through a mobile browser?  It is recommended that you follow these steps: </p><ol><li>  Open Safari and go to icloud.com. </li><li>  Click on the "Share ..." button. </li><li>  Select the section "Full version ...". </li></ol><p>  The iCloud site will open.  Now you can log in to the service using your login ID and password from Apple ID.  Next, an interactive cloud menu will appear on the phone‚Äôs display.  Very comfortably! </p><p>  Important: to work with the service, it is important to have a network connection.  Without it, no authorization in the cloud will help. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sign in to iCloud through a browser" class="if uuid-2879617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2879617.jpg"></div><h2>  We watch pictures </h2><p>  Logging in to iCloud from the iPhone is pretty straightforward.  This is especially true for those who pre-registered the Apple ID.  Without it, you can completely forget about entering the "apple" cloud service.  This option is simply not supported without an Apple ID. </p><p>  How to see pictures in the cloud on the iPhone?  It is not difficult to do this.  After authorization in the cloud service, all pictures will be stored in a special section of the menu and immediately after creating the photo data will be uploaded to iCloud. </p><p>  So what if you want to see the pictures taken?  How can they be studied?  And how to view information in the iPhone cloud as a whole? </p><p>  For photos, the following instructions are relevant: </p><ol><li>  Turn on your mobile device and, if necessary, log in to your Apple ID.  As already mentioned, without this identifier it is not possible to work with a cloud service. </li><li>  Click on the "Photo" button. </li><li>  Open the "Photo" block. </li></ol><p>  In the corresponding section, all photos taken and stored in the cloud will be stored.  In the "General" contains pictures that are considered available to all users. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to one more point - "Albums".  Here all available images are divided into categories.  Or rather - on albums. </p><h2>  Computer Images </h2><p>  How to look at the iPhone cloud?  The answer to such a question will no longer cause any problems.  What should I do if I want to study images copied from an "apple" device to a cloud service on a PC? </p><p>  There is a solution!  To do this, perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Open a cloud service page in a browser on a PC. </li><li>  Log in using the username and password.  In iCloud, as we have already said, they work with the help of Apple ID. </li><li>  Click on the inscription "Photo". </li></ol><p>  After a few minutes, a list with the images uploaded to the cloud appears on the PC display.  Fast, easy and very convenient! </p><div class="photo" data-original="4apple.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View photos from iCloud on iPhone" class="if uuid-2879620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2879620.jpg"></div><h2>  About data transfer </h2><p>  How to see the cloud on the "iPhone", figured out.  And what needs to be done to open a cloud service on "apple" products in one case or another? </p><p>  It was previously said that iCloud allows you to synchronize data using Apple ID.  To transfer information to a new "apple" device, you just have to repeat the first instruction.  We are talking about authorization on a new device with the help of Apple ID. </p><p>  As soon as a person logs into your account, you can be happy about the result.  The data from the profile will automatically be transferred to the new device. </p><p>  Important: for successful authorization in Apple ID you will have to first connect to the Internet. </p><h2>  Cloud shutdown </h2><p>  How to view data in iCloud, we figured out.  And how is the entrance to the cloud service carried out, too.  Now we will find out how to disconnect from the corresponding option. </p><p>  Usually, in order to achieve the desired goal, it is recommended to act in this way: </p><ol><li>  Take a look at the iCloud section.  It is located in the "Settings" menu of the mobile device. </li><li>  Scroll through the list to the very end. </li><li>  Tap on "Exit" or "Delete." </li><li>  Wait. </li></ol><p>  Important: if the ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù option is activated on your smartphone or tablet, you will need to enter your Apple ID password after exiting the steps above to exit iCloud.  Otherwise, to cope with the task does not work. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  We met with the iCloud service for the iPhone.  Moreover, it is now clear how to work with this cloud-based utility.  There is no need to upload individual data clouds to apple devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iCloud on iPhone" class="if uuid-2879622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2879622.jpg"></div><p>  Is it possible not to use "iCloud"?  Yes, but then when working with the "apple" device, problems may arise.  For example, you cannot activate the option "Find iPhone".  Otherwise, work with third-party cloud services on Apple products takes place. </p>
