Quiet harbor of absolute peace is a world famous resort area, attracting tourists who dream of being away from civilization. </p><p>  Tours to the Seychelles - a real trip to the Museum of Virgin Nature, whose beauty has been preserved in its original form.  This is a real exotic, striking the imagination of Europeans! </p><h2>  Some facts about the archipelago </h2><p>  The island state is located in the western Indian Ocean, on the Amiranta and Seychelles islands.  Victoria is the capital of the magical archipelago, which includes 115 islands of coral and volcanic origin, but only 30 of them are inhabited. </p><p>  The tourism industry is a lucrative sector of the economy of the former colony of the French and British.  Here is a huge selection of hotels that can satisfy the refined taste of any visiting foreigner.  But the most comfortable and expensive places of residence (small, but very spacious houses, from whose windows amazing panoramas open) are located off the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.silversea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Seychelles" class="if uuid-2745101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2745101.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, it is an offshore zone where thousands of foreign companies are registered, contributing to the economic development of the country.  All industrial enterprises of the archipelago are concentrated here, and the people of Seychelles are actively engaged in tobacco growing, and also produce furniture for export from local wood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In a democratic state, they respect the choice of religion of the islanders, and here you can see the Catholic Church, which is adjacent to a Muslim mosque and a Hindu temple. </p><h2>  Islands of Paradise </h2><p>  Seychelles islands are divided into 4 groups: </p><ul><li>  Amiranti. </li><li>  Aldabra </li><li>  Farquhar. </li><li>  Seychelles. </li></ul><p>  It is a quiet haven where paradise and absolute peace reign.  Islands with magnificent beaches and picturesque landscapes are loved by newlyweds who come on a honeymoon.  Divers from all over the world, fans of surfing and yachting, as well as sea fishing, come here. </p><p>  Denis is a coral island located on the very edge of the underwater plateau, beyond the borders of which the ocean depth begins.  This is a beautiful corner, and its main highlight is the relict forest. </p><p>  The well-known scuba diving center is equipped at Dorosh.  Both experienced divers and novice divers rush to a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãland, experienced instructors will help make underwater trips memorable. </p><p>  The most picturesque <span>island of Praslin is</span> recognized with exotic plants and palm trees Coco de Mer.  Tourists with pleasure walk along a fabulously beautiful place, as if descended from a glossy postcard. </p><h2>  Journey to Bird </h2><p>  The northernmost island is Byrd, which will have to be reached by plane from Mahe (Seychelles) or boat.  Fans of interesting water travel always choose the second option.  The secluded corner is famous for its diversity of flora and fauna, but its main celebrity is recognized as a giant turtle listed in the Guinness Book of Records. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Often in the evenings, all the lights are turned off, and tourists on the beach delightedly see the colorful starry sky.  There are no paved roads and other benefits of civilization, and therefore it is one of the most beautiful places where you can be alone with nature. </p><h2>  The largest island of a corner lost in the ocean </h2><p>  The largest of <span>the Seychelles islands</span> is Mahe, in whose territory the capital of the republic and the international airport, built in 1971, are located.  At the beginning of the XVII century, pirates mastered it, turning the land into their safe haven, and the history of settlement began in 1770, when 15 colonists from France, together with slaves, founded the village of Port Royal here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easyvoyage.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heaven on earth" class="if uuid-2745060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2745060.jpg"></div><p>  After almost a hundred years, the Seychelles come under the rule of the British, who name the only city in honor of Queen Victoria of Great Britain.  Only in 1976 did the period of colonial ownership end, and the state gained independence.  And the administrative center is turning into a seat of parliament and the president. </p><h2>  A tiny capital named after the Queen of Great Britain </h2><p>  Victoria in the Seychelles is one of the smallest capitals of the world and the only city in the state with about 26 thousand people, most of whom are Creoles.  In 1841, the British built a port on Mahe, naming it after their queen.  Later, a tiny village formed around it, which turned into a small city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Surrounded by cinnamon plantations, it is planned as a huge park, tropical plants and dense trees of which are its main decoration.  Victoria was built on the northeast coast of Mahe.  Seychelles owes its popularity to this particular city.  The capital quickly turned from a provincial and sparsely populated settlement into a vibrant city, keeping up with the times. </p><h2>  A paradise created for a pleasant stay </h2><p>  The capital, located on the coast of the Indian Ocean and surrounded by majestic mountain ranges, and in fact is a paradise created for relaxation.  It can not be called a metropolis, because in Victoria there are no modern skyscrapers.  The thing is that here it is not allowed to erect buildings whose height would exceed the growth of palm trees. </p><p>  The main advantage of Victoria (Mahe, Seychelles) is a comfortable climate, thanks to which you can relax here at any time of the year.  The sun is constantly shining on the islands, and the flow of tourists who know that the weather will not present unpleasant surprises does not dry out.  However, it is worth considering that in the period from December to February pouring rains, which are accompanied by sweltering heat.  And from June to the end of August, a severe drought begins.  The best time to visit the island is May and October.  During these months, the minimum amount of precipitation falls and the optimum air temperature is kept, making the rest pleasant. </p><h2>  City and port </h2><p>  This is not only a unique city of Seychelles, but also the only deep-water port of the archipelago, capable of accepting several large liners simultaneously.  Smaller vessels enter the inner harbor.  An important transport hub is of international importance.  And for the country's navy, it plays a big role: it is here that the ships that go from Africa to India are refueled. </p><h2>  Cultural and economic center of the country </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the capital is the cultural, political and economic center of Seychelles, it retained the provincial atmosphere.  However, one of the smallest administrative centers on our planet can be proud of a huge number of attractions, which makes the city and port of Victoria in the Seychelles an ideal option for research. </p><p>  The tiny village has its own public transport, but it is best to get to know it on foot, walking along the two narrow streets on which there are one-story houses painted in a light shade.  The territory of the city is decorated with exotic plants and green coconut palms.  The colorful capital, which is a real advantage of Seychelles on the island of Mahe, is a city that allows not only to have a great rest, but also to enrich with new knowledge. </p><h2>  Miniature copy of Big Ben </h2><p>  An unusual attraction can be observed by tourists who are at the intersection of two streets.  Here stands the original silver tower, which appeared in 1903.  The four-meter building was erected in honor of Queen Victoria, thus perpetuating the memory of the time when the Seychelles were under British rule. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Bj√∏rn Christian T√∏rrissen, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clock Tower Downtown Victoria" class="if uuid-2745068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2745068.jpg"></div><p>  Of particular interest is the watch - a small copy of the famous Big Ben in London. </p><h2>  Museum and library </h2><p>  If you walk 200 meters, you can see an inconspicuous house.  On the ground floor there is a museum, the exhibits of which tell about the rich history of the Seychelles islands.  Victoria is also famous for its main attraction, which is a huge carved cube - the so-called possession stone, installed by captain Nicholas Morphy, who declared the islands French territory in 1756.  It also houses the oldest map of the state, drawn more than 500 years ago, the smallest statuette of Queen Victoria, a lot of items raised from sunken ships, colorful folk costumes and original musical instruments. </p><p>  Tourists fearfully examine exhibits dedicated to slavery and the magic of grie gris of African descent, reminiscent of voodoo.  After all, the Seychelles is the birthplace of secret cults, and witchcraft was brought in by the slaves of the colonists from France.  Catholic rituals were mixed with pagan customs, and so appeared black magic that defies any analysis.  And on the second floor, in the library, part of the local archives is stored. </p><h2>  The most revered monuments </h2><p>  The three-story building, called the "House of the People", is the center of both the political and cultural life of the town.  And not far from it is the monument "Liberation".  This is the most revered monument erected after the revolution that happened in the 70s of the last century.  It was after her that the country gained independence.  A proletarian is mounted on a pedestal, who with fury breaks the chains that bound him. </p><p>  Another monument tells about the peaceful neighborhood of Asians, Creoles and Europeans on the same land.  "Bicentennial Monument" appeared in 1978 in honor of the 200th anniversary of the development of Seychelles.  Three wings are interconnected, and each of them symbolizes the peaceful unity of peoples. </p><h2>  the main street </h2><p>  F. Rachelle Street, named after the patriot who died 41 years ago, smoothly passes into the coastal highway, which leads to the international airport, which receives flights from Moscow to the Seychelles.  From here you can fly to other islands, and all passenger terminals are located in the same building. </p><p>  On the avenue there are numerous <span>travel companies,</span> shops, banks and embassies of other countries.  Here you can also get acquainted with a unique modern attraction, the masters of which will teach you how to weave Seychelles hats and make original souvenirs from shells, tortoise shells, coconut fruits. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The city of Victoria is famous all over the world for its luxurious green oasis, in which the time capsule is stored.  It sealed the message of local students who wrote in 1994 an appeal to people of the future.  In it, students are asked to save the Seychelles nature.  The capsule will be opened in June 2044, and I want to believe that by this time all the wishes of the children will come true. </p><p>  The botanical park, founded at the beginning of the last century, is not only fruit trees, flowering shrubs and numerous palm trees.  Here you can look at the centuries-old giant turtles, frozen in the rays of the gentle sun, and watch how they eat.  The baby even sits on the shell of hulking creatures, trying to ride them. </p><p>  This is the best place to appreciate the richness of Seychelles flora without traveling outside the capital </p><h2>  Curious museum </h2><p>  Everyone who has visited the capital of the Seychelles island - Victoria, admires the Museum of Natural History, at the entrance of which visitors are greeted with a life-size sculpture of a Nile crocodile.  Among the exhibits are the skulls of huge alligators, stuffed sea turtles, and rich collections of moths and butterflies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interesting museum" class="if uuid-2745084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2745084.jpg"></div><h2>  Sir S. Clarke Market </h2><p>  While in the Seychelles capital, you should definitely visit the indoor market, where locals and tourists flock.  This is the real heart of the city, named after the man who served as governor during the Second World War.  Every day, merchants gather in the Chinese-style building, offering fresh fruits and vegetables, spices and herbs, freshly caught fish, as well as various souvenirs and beachwear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Victoria Market" class="if uuid-2745072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2745072.jpg"></div><p>  Saturday is the busiest day, as sellers offer great discounts on weekends for all goods. </p><h2>  Religious attraction </h2><p>  In 1874, the construction of the city cathedral was completed, in the appearance of which figures of the French colonial style appear.  A clock striking twice an hour is mounted in the roof of a beautiful building with powerful columns and majestic arches.  On Sundays, the religious monument of Victoria comes to life - hundreds of Catholics rush to Mass. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral" class="if uuid-2745079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2745079.jpg"></div><h2>  Holidays in Victoria in the Seychelles: reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the impressions of travelers, this is one of the most amazing places on our planet, which is permeated with romance and peace.  Residents of the city lead a measured life, and this calm has a beneficial effect on visitors.  Tourists admit that the capital of Seychelles fascinated them. </p><p>  Vacationers can‚Äôt even find the words to describe the incredible beauty of an amazing corner and declare that it is better to see the picturesque landscapes once with your own eyes.  The green island, lost in the Indian Ocean, carries directly to the gates of paradise on earth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenational.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Luxurious Mahe beaches" class="if uuid-2745095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2745095.jpg"></div><p>  True, vacation on the islands is available only to wealthy travelers, and the prices do not depend on the season.  The road to the mysterious world is not long, the flight from Moscow to the Seychelles takes about 10 hours, and it is better not to take the kids on a trip.  Direct flight is the easiest way to find yourself in a fairy tale. </p><p>  Lovers of secluded relaxation and lovers rent bungalows on small coral islands.  This accommodation option allows you to enjoy the sea and tropical nature.  Budget hotels with a minimum of amenities are located far from the beach, and on the first coastline are luxurious villas.  Tours to the Seychelles can be bought at any time, as the beach season lasts all year round. </p>
