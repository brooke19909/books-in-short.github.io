    <p>  What accommodation conditions does Citymax Hotel Bur Dubai actually provide?  Reviews confirm that the rooms here are really comfortable, spacious, with new furniture and the necessary amount of equipment.  They clean it regularly, so it’s unlikely to complain about cleanliness.  By the way, many employees are fluent in Russian, so communication problems will not arise.  All employees are polite and courteous, ready to resolve any problem. </p><p>  The food is also quite acceptable.  When ordering an appropriate package tour, the main restaurant will offer you a large selection of international dishes.  You can eat delicious food in a Chinese or Indian restaurant.  There are also a sufficient number of shops, supermarkets, markets, cafes and restaurants nearby, so food is unlikely to be a problem. </p><p>  Basically, travelers respond very well about this hotel, as they offer the most comfortable living conditions at a relatively low price, which, of course, cannot but rejoice.  For example, a tour for two will cost about 200,000 rubles (this is already with air travel), but you will spend these 8 days and 7 nights unforgettably.
