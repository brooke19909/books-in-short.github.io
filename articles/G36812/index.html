    <h2>  <span>Nikon reforms</span> and the emergence of "schism" </h2><p>  Various religious movements, which can be combined with the term "Old Believers", have an ancient and tragic history.  In the mid-17th century, <span>Patriarch Nikon,</span> with the support of the tsar, carried out religious reform, the task of which was to bring the process of worship and some rituals in line with the "standards" adopted by the Church of Constantinople.  Reforms were to enhance the prestige of both the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian state in the international arena.  But not the whole flock took the innovations positively.  Old Believers are precisely those people who considered the “book reference” (editing church books) and the unification of the liturgical office as sacrilege. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What exactly was done as part of the reform? </h2><p>  The changes approved by the Church Councils in 1656 and 1667 may seem too minor to unbelievers.  For example, the “Symbol of Faith” was edited: it was prescribed to speak about the kingdom of God in the future tense, the definition of the Lord and the opposing union were removed from the text.  In addition, the word “Jesus” was now ordered to write with two “and” (according to the modern Greek pattern).  Old Believers did not appreciate it.  As for worship, Nikon canceled the small bow of the earth ("throwing"), the traditional "two-fingered" replaced with "triple-edged", and the "pure" hallelujah - with "trident".  The procession began Nikonians against the sun.  Some changes were also made to the rite of the Eucharist (Communion).  The reform also provoked a gradual change in the traditions of <span>church singing</span> and icon painting. </p><h2>  “Raskolniki”, “Old Believers” and “Old Believers”: the difference </h2><p>  In fact, all these terms at different times meant the same people.  However, these names are not equivalent: each has a specific semantic connotation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Nikonian reformers, accusing their ideological opponents of <span>splitting the Russian Orthodox Church,</span> used the concept of "schismatic."  It was equated with the term "heretic" and was considered offensive.  Adherents of the traditional faith did not call themselves that, they preferred the definition of "Old Orthodox Christians" or "Old Believers".  “Old Believers” is a compromise term coined by secular authors in the 19th century.  Believers themselves did not consider it exhaustive: as you know, faith is not limited to rituals.  But it so happened that it was he who received the greatest distribution. </p><p>  It should be noted that in some sources, "Old Believers" are people who profess the pre-Christian religion <span>(paganism).</span>  <span>This is</span> wrong.  The Old Believers are, without a doubt, Christians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Believer culture" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/586776.jpg" width="298"></div>

    <h2>  Old Believers of Russia: the fate of the movement </h2><p>  Since the discontent of the Old Believers undermined the foundations of the state, both secular and church authorities persecuted the opposition.  Their leader, Protopop Avvakum, was exiled, and then burned alive.  The same fate befell many of his followers.  Moreover, in protest, the Old Believers staged mass self-immolations.  But, of course, not everyone was so fanatical. </p><p>  From the central regions of Russia, the Old Believers fled to the Volga region, beyond the Urals, to the North, as well as to Poland and Lithuania.  Under Peter I, the position of the Old Believers improved slightly.  They were limited in rights, they had to pay double taxes, but they could openly practice their religion.  Under Catherine II, the Old Believers were allowed to return to Moscow and St. Petersburg, where they founded the largest communities.  At the beginning of the 19th century, the government again began to "tighten the screws."  Despite the oppression, the Old Believers of Russia succeeded.  The richest and most successful merchants and industrialists, the most prosperous and zealous peasants were brought up in the traditions of the "Old Orthodox" faith. </p>

    <h2>  Life and culture </h2><p>  The Bolsheviks did not see the difference between the New and Old Believers.  Believers again had to emigrate, this time mainly to the New World.  But even there they managed to preserve their national identity.  The culture of the Old Believers is quite archaic.  They do not shave their beards, do not drink alcohol and do not smoke.  Many of them wear traditional clothes.  Old Believers collect ancient icons, rewrite church books, teach children Slavic writing and famous singing. </p><p>  Despite the denial of progress, Old Believers often succeed in entrepreneurship and agriculture.  Their thinking cannot be called inert.  Old Believers are <strong> </strong>  very stubborn, persistent and purposeful people.  The persecution of the authorities only strengthened their faith and tempered the spirit. </p>
