    <h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  The origin of Mr. Snake is igneous.  It is the second largest mountain of its type in the region.  The total area is about 194 hectares.  The height of the Zmeyka mountain is 994 m. Its entire surface is covered with dense forest vegetation.  In its shape, the Snake has an oval shape without a pronounced peak, slightly inclined to the northeast.  At the top of the mountain you can see a clear rocky ledge, composed of subvolcanic intrusion.  The top part is destroyed, this leads to frequent collapse of stones in this area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the southern foot of Mount Zmeyka there are underground water sources that amaze with their useful mineral composition.  The field is named after the mountain - Zmeikinsky.  Carbon dioxide-calcium-sodium water is extracted at a depth of almost 1,500 m. At the outlet, the water is hot, the temperature can reach 70 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Slopes </h2><p>  Mount Snake from the north and east side is heavily collapsed.  Violation of the slopes occurred due to the fact that in 30-70 years.  last century there was a quarry for the extraction of building materials.  After it was closed, constant collapses occur on these sides.  Currently, the pit depth is 200 m and the width is about 2 km.  Mostly stone was mined here, but in the mid-80s.  Beshtownites were discovered there - rare minerals that are very important in the scientific field.  Now they are not being mined. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain snake photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1300947.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The woods </h2><p>  Mount Snake, the photo of which is in the article, in places where it is covered with forest, is part of the Beshtaugorye massif.  This cover serves as a special protection for the mineral waters of the Caucasus.  The main tree species are oak and hornbeam.  The first is most often found in the lower zone of the mountain, the second - in the upper.  In addition to these trees, ash, beech, etc. are also found. In total - about 60 species.  Forests grow on foothill chernozem and gray-brown soils of different acidity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Beshtaugorsky forest massif is part of the state nature reserve.  On its territory, you can meet representatives of the flora, which are listed in the Red Book (dwarf euonymus, single lily, Caucasian ash-tree, cotoneaster Nefedova, etc.). </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  Hydronym Mountain Snake received a long time, but he entrenched it only a few years ago.  For a long time it had a Turkic name - Zhlak Tau, which means ‚Äúsnake mountain‚Äù. </p><p>  There are two versions explaining the origin of such a beautiful name.  According to one of them, before this place was a favorite for various kinds of snakes, there were a lot of them.  On the other - on one of the slopes of the mountain, the winding slots resembled a snake in shape as it moved.  However, these gaps are now impossible to see, since most of the surface has been significantly subjected to anthropogenic interference. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain height snake" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1300946.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excavations </h2><p>  Thanks to archaeological excavations it was found that in the period from VII to IX century.  n  e.  (Khazar period) people lived on the eastern slope of the mountain.  This is evidenced by finds in the form of fragments of pottery in large quantities.  Also above the excavation site you can find a mound of stones that resembles an ancient altar in shape. </p><h2>  Tourism and Attractions </h2><p>  Currently, Mount Zmeyka is a special tourist attraction, which annually at its foot collects a large number of tourists.  People who come to this area can see many interesting objects.  In addition to water deposits (Holy Spring, spring of St. Theodosius), there is a stone processing plant in the territory, a closed adit, in which beshtownites, a quarry, a monument to quarry workers who died during the war, and a dam were mined.  Also on the rise you can see bizarre-shaped stones.  Mount Snake, whose history is described above, has enough of them.  Some of them even have their own name.  For example: <span>stone-finger, stone</span> with a hole, stone-cross, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount snake story" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1300948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are also ascents to the top of the mountain.  And since the Snake is one of the most dangerous Caucasian structures of nature, the climbs are carried out exclusively at the head of the guide.  If you climb without it, you must be prepared for injuries and all other ensuing consequences (as well as a fatal outcome).  Therefore, if you value your life, then listen to the advice of professionals. </p>
