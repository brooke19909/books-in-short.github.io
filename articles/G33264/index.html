Even a sawn tree does not remain without their attention.  Indeed, you can make wonderful designer things from logs with a cut, which will serve as interior details and simply decorate a house or a summer cottage. </p><p>  Let's look at some interesting ideas for using <span>wood cuts.</span>  You can not remove the bark from the trunk, so the work will be even more natural and creative. </p><h2>  Chair for a summer residence </h2><p>  Such a comfortable chair can be cut out of a large log for a summer cottage with a chainsaw.  To make it stable, you must first cut the base evenly and install it in place.  Then start processing the seat.  Here you need to be careful not to make it too thin, otherwise, when the body rests on it, a thin layer can break off and cause trouble to the sitting person. </p>

    <p>  The seat is cut out smoothly.  On the front of the chair, the bark is cut off so as not to scratch the legs or tear the clothes of the person sitting on it.  From the back you can cut out the unnecessary part of the log.  Then the chair will be much easier, and it can be rearranged from one place in the yard to another.  To make crafts from wood cuts with your own hands look beautiful, they need to be cleaned with sandpaper to make the surface smooth.  To make the tree shine and look brighter, you can grate it with vegetable oil.  Impregnated wood will not deteriorate longer.  After several impregnations, the chair should be washed and dried.  Everything, the piece of furniture is ready!  You can sit down. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Original table </h2><p>  To make crafts from wood cuts with your own hands, you can use not only the whole log, but also individual sawn circles.  To make such a table, you need to take two large cut off circles and several small ones of the same thickness.  The base is made a little smaller than the countertop.  "Pancakes" made of wood need to be thoroughly sanded with sandpaper several times.  First, a large one (100) is taken, then it is smoothed out with a smaller one (80).  The same preliminary work is carried out with all the details of the future legs of the coffee table. </p>

    <p>  An important point in the manufacture of such crafts from wood cuts with your own hands will be clear, even planes of circles.  If the angle moves, the table will come out crooked, and nobody needs it.  It is also necessary to observe safety rules when working with sharp tools and such small parts. </p><p>  When everything is ready, you can start assembling all the elements.  They put down the base, a ‚Äúpancake‚Äù of a slightly smaller size is attached to it, to make the legs heavier so that the table does not turn over.  Next is the most difficult part of the assembly process.  "Pancakes" are set with a shift of one third, first one way, then from the middle up the elements are shifted to the other side.  From above, under the countertop, they should come together. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One wide circle is also set under the table top so that there is a solid base and objects from the table do not fall to the floor.  Further, to make crafts from wooden saws look colorful, the tabletop can be varnished.  The whole structure of the tree will appear, and the table will look bright and festive. </p><h2>  Flower stand </h2><p>  We offer one more idea for wood crafts for a summer residence.  This is a beautiful stand for flower pots.  You can use such a rack for other things.  For example, on shelves place soap, a glass with toothbrushes, and plates for washing next to the washbasin.  You can also put fruit dishes on the shelves so that children, walking in the yard, can have a meal without running into the kitchen. </p>

    <p>  To make such a craft out of wood cuts with your own hands, you need to choose a large circle for the base.  Then the whole structure will be durable and the rack will not roll to the side.  Next, you need to cut out a section of the tree with branches diverging in different directions.  Then the shelves will not overlap one another.  In the largest circle in the middle, a hole is drilled along the diameter of the branch, and it is inserted tightly into it.  You can put the base on the glue or drill a couple of screws from the bottom to the side. </p><p>  On the branches, horizontal sections are made at different heights, and they are planted on glue or the shelves are clogged.  They can have both the same size and different.  At the end, he cut the wood from the crafts for his own do-it-yourself cottages.  If such a stand will stand on the street, it is better to wipe it with vegetable oil several times after processing with sandpaper.  If the stand will be in the house, then you can cover the surface with acrylic varnish. </p><h2>  Mirror Design </h2><p>  From small circles sawn from wood, you can beautifully design a frame for a mirror or a picture.  It is necessary to cut many parts of the same thickness.  To fill the space between large elements, small circles from branches are also prepared.  The work is small and scrupulous, because every detail needs to be processed.  First, the bark is cut off, then each element is processed several times by sandpaper.  Next, you will need to cover it with varnish.  When all the elements are ready, then a strong base is taken, which will keep its shape well.  Better take a sheet of plywood. </p>

    <p>  A mirror is placed in the center and a template is outlined.  Then the central part is laid aside and proceed to the design of the frame.  Work begins from the drawn circle.  First, large elements are laid out, then voids are filled.  When everything is glued, time is given for complete drying.  At the end, you can lift the work and make sure that nothing falls.  Further, the mirror itself is glued onto the liquid nails.  Such a beautiful piece of furniture will decorate not only the cottage, but will also look good in a city apartment. </p><h2>  Decor element </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs fashionable to hang decor elements on the front door.  Such a heart made of wood cuts is quite easy to make.  This work will turn out even for a novice master.  Saws of different sizes are suitable, the main thing is that the thickness is the same.  Then all the elements are glued together, forming the picture necessary for the author.  It can be a heart, as in the photo below, or a butterfly or a dragonfly.  You can make your favorite cartoon character if children live in the house. </p>

    <p>  A screw is screwed into the middle, and a rope is tied to it, for which the picture will be hung on a wall or door.  You can close the mount with a bow or a flower from ribbons. </p><h2>  Hidden box </h2><p>  DIY craft crafts from a log with their own hands can be very functional.  For example, a great way to hide something from unwanted guests, who, unfortunately, sometimes visit other people's houses, is to make such a hidden box in a log.  The photo shows a unique thing in the excellent performance of a professional carpenter.  But a safe hidden in a piece of wood can be made much simpler.  The main thing is this is a great place where not one of the uninvited guests can guess. </p>

    <p>  A piece of log lies in a corner near the stove.  Not even the most sophisticated thief will realize that something valuable is hidden there.  So the advice is great.  And every master can cut a piece from a log.  Then you need to close the drawer tightly so that the joints are not visible.  You can also turn the round log with the other side. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, a lot of useful and necessary things can be made from logs using the saw cut method both for a summer residence and for a city apartment, the main thing is to have a desire and time to craft.  And we suggested you ideas.  Good luck </p>
