Given the fact that the flagship of HTC One is one of the very successful smartphones ever produced by a Taiwanese manufacturer, then a review of the new HTC One Max is simply necessary.  By the way, the term "max" is used by the company only for the second time.  The first phone to get that name was the HTC 4g Max Yota. </p>

    <h2>  External characteristics of the smartphone </h2><p>  The phone has a screen with a diagonal of 5.9 inches.  For this reason, it can be reliably attributed to the so-called "shovelophones."  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a phone with such a large diagonal can not be called new.  Many competitors, including Sony and Samsung, and Huawei and ZTE, have already released similar phones that are popular with customers.  The dimensions of the phone are 82.5x164.5x10.3 mm.  That is, it turned out to be not only large in appearance, but also quite ‚Äúthick‚Äù, which is the reason for the difficult control of the phone with one hand even for people with large palms.  A very positive point for this model is the case material.  Aluminum clearly stands out among competitors in its segment.  However, if the same HNC One Mini has an absolutely aluminum case, then with his big brother everything is a little different.  Edging around the edges and on the back of the panel is made of plastic.  Perhaps the only negative in the external characteristics of the phone lies in its thin back panel.  In order to properly fix it, you need to press the panel quite hard with your hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is included with the smartphone? </h2><p>  Everything is as usual here.  After the company abandoned Beats headphones as a compulsory headset for the lower cost of devices, standard headphones from a Taiwanese company come with phones.  By the way, in the box on HTC One Max the headset is of good enough quality.  In addition, here you can also find a USB device in order to be able to pair the phone with a computer, as well as a charger, which is better to always have with you.  For those who first encountered the use of touch smartphones, specially provided text documentation with a full description of all the functions of the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one max review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542129.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  Iron characteristic </h2><p>  The phone uses almost all the elements that make HTC One Max top-notch.  The only question arises only regarding the processor.  If almost all competitors use the most powerful Snapdragon 800, then the Taiwanese company decided to save money and put in its creation a slightly inferior quad-core Snapdragon 600 with a clock frequency of 1.7 GHz.  As for the rest, there are no questions.  Smartphone HTC One Max has 2 GB of RAM, as well as 16 GB of internal memory, of which 10 GB can be used to store files.  It may seem that there is too little memory for such a phone, but do not forget that there is the possibility of using an additional <span>MicroSD memory card, the</span> volume of which does not exceed 64 GB.  And this is more than enough.  The battery of the device is larger than that of its brothers: HTC One and HTC One mini.  Its volume is 3300 mAh.  The only disadvantage of this battery is its ‚Äúnon-removability‚Äù.  If it becomes necessary to repair the battery, it will be quite difficult to do. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone htc one max" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542137.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, HTC One Max, a review of which you can read, is equipped with a four megapixel camera with UltraPixel function.  As conceived by the developers, this innovation was supposed to outperform competitors whose cameras reached 13 megapixels.  But in reality, everything happened differently.  It is impossible to say that the camera of this phone has any advantages.  Rather, it is even inferior in quality of shooting to the same representatives of Samsung and Sony.  Photos that are obtained when using the camera have poor clarity and brightness.  As for the <span>front camera of the</span> smartphone, then its two megapixels is enough to be able to use it as a mirror and when communicating using the Skype application. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone htc one max" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542139.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unique smartphone features </h2><p>  If HTC Sense will not surprise anyone, then the developers have found something new that can surprise users of the brand new HTC One Max.  This is, of course, a <span>fingerprint scanner,</span> which is located on the rear panel under the main camera.  The essence of this function is the safety of using the phone.  Its owner can set his fingerprint as an entry point, and no one can just use a smartphone.  Another innovation is the ability to use the phone as a remote control.  They can turn on and off any household appliances and electronics that can be controlled remotely. </p><h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  The HTC One Max smartphone is equipped with the Android 4.3 operating system from Google, as well as the HTC Sense 5.5 firmware, which allows you to distinguish phones from this company from any other smartphone.  In theory, having such a large size, the phone should be adapted for applications in order to more easily use them.  But this is not, which is a fairly significant drawback.  The fact is that having a phone in your hands, it‚Äôs hard to manage applications in the menu, and there is no way to control the phone with one hand.  A very interesting firmware is the new BoomSound.  It was designed to ensure that the reproduction of any sound from the phone is as perfect as possible.  To tell you the truth, they succeeded in more than that. </p>

    <h2>  HTC One Max: price </h2><p>  Before you understand at what price you can purchase this unit, you need to decide for yourself how much additional memory you want to purchase as a component.  Today, without taking into account additional purchases, you can buy a HTC One Max phone for about 700-720 US dollars.  If you want to purchase an additional 64 GB microSD memory card, you will have to pay about $ 750.  It should be noted that not every music lover may like the standard headset that comes with the phone.  In the case of an additional purchase of new Bits Audio earplugs, an additional $ 70-80 will be required. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one max price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542134.jpg" width="577"></div>

    <h2>  HTC one Max: customer reviews and expert opinion </h2><p>  First we‚Äôll talk and find common ground among buyers.  In general, almost every user is satisfied with the purchased device.  Indeed, he had spent almost a fortune on him.  But among them you can find those people who, in addition to numerous advantages, were able to find flaws.  So, for example, not everyone liked the fact that the developers did not try to adapt the user interface to the big screen.  Among other shortcomings, a bad camera and a non-removable battery were noted, although their volume pleasantly surprised them.  Among the obvious advantages of the phone, users attribute the perfect sound of the smartphone with or without headphones.  Also, they did not remain indifferent to the efficiency of the phone, claiming that it works very quickly. </p><p>  Experts also shared their opinions on the HTC One Max.  Reviews of leading experts in this industry are, rather, a comparative analysis of competitors.  Knowing that this device has alternatives in this category, experts claim that the main disadvantage of this phone model from a company from Taiwan is its camera.  They say that at this stage, the quality of megapixels has not yet won their number.  However, in the price / quality ratio, this phone, according to experts, is a very good option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one max reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542131.jpg" width="527"></div>
