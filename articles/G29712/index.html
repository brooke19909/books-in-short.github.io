However, not always the owners manage to achieve the desired effect of the operation of the navigation system.  This is partly due to violations in the use of the device, but problems may arise due to improper installation.  Correct installation of the echo sounder for a boat requires both the correct location of the system components and their reliable fixation. </p><h2>  Choosing a location for fixing the sensor </h2><p>  Almost all models of sonars for boats are equipped with remote sensors that require a separate installation.  To begin the complex of works on fastening the navigation system should be with this device.  First of all, you need to find a place for optimal placement of the sensor.  It is advisable to focus on a flat platform, next to which there are no protrusions or holes. </p>

    <p>  The operation of the sensing element should not be affected by turbulence arising from the movement of equipment.  Therefore, it is necessary to look for <span>the mounting point</span> during the operation of the engine.  Its blades with swirls of water should not interfere with the function of the navigator.  The echo sounder for the boat can also be installed on the transom, but the sensor on this site can only be fixed if the screw is not in front of the transom.  When the zone is removed from external influences, it is necessary to check the possibility of immersion of the device in water and proceed with installation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sensor Installation </h2><p>  Usually, drilling configurations are supplied with echo sounders.  Mounting points should be marked on this fixture.  Next, you need to make holes.  The diameter of the drill depends on the design of the supporting tooling - as a rule, the thickness is several millimeters.  After that, you can start assembling the device. </p>

    <p>  First of all, the body and the supporting base are connected.  Direct <span>installation of the sounder sensor</span> on the boat is done using screws through the holes made.  Without fail, the mount is lubricated with silicone for sealing.  Working manipulations should be performed carefully so as not to damage the filling of the sensing element.  The slightest blow can make the sensor work incorrectly. </p><h2>  Preparation of the base for the fish finder </h2><p>  To install the device, a special base is used - the supporting base, which provides rigidity of fastening with minimal loads on the hardware.  The assembly of this fixture can be performed in different ways depending on the specific model.  The main thing at this stage is to make its connection with an echo sounder.  This operation is usually implemented using the same screw hardware in the housing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is important to make sure that the echo sounder for the boat is properly seated in its intended nest.  This will be evidenced by the absence of swaying of the device when shaking relative to the supporting platform.  Some designs also provide for the possibility of changing the position of the echo sounder at the base.  To do this, the screwed-in screws are loosened, and the instrument body rotates along the adjustment lines.  It is advisable to determine the final position before installation, ensuring that fasteners are sufficiently tightened. </p><h2>  Locating a Fish Finder </h2><p>  At this stage, you need to find a suitable place to place the installation panel on which the device will be fixed.  It should be determined taking into account several factors.  First of all, the cable from the sensor itself should reach the mounting point.  If necessary, you can purchase an incomplete longer wire, but it is better to get by with standard accessories.  Also, choose a place based on the ability to access the echo sounder from the inside of the hull.  This will allow it to be installed and adjusted more reliably. </p>

    <p>  Ergonomic nuances are also taken into account.  If it is not planned to use an echo sounder for a boat on a regular basis, then installation work during installation and disassembly should be as easy as possible.  To this it is worth adding accessibility to the monitor of the device during operation.  The display should be clearly visible from the user's normal position. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cable connection </h2><p>  Usually, supply kits for 2-3 m are provided in the kits. It is advisable to use the cable length exactly at the distance that will be enough to connect the device and the power source.  The compliance of the device with the power system is calculated in advance.  As a rule, a standard echo sounder for a GPS boat requires a connection to a 12 V circuit. Direct connection is via a fuse.  It should be placed either near the mount panel, or next to the battery.  Some fuse models also require the use of terminals, which should be stocked in a separate order - they are often not supplied in sets.  It is also recommended to install a backup power supply in case of failure of the main battery or conflicts between different electrical channels. </p><h2>  Mounting the base for the fish finder </h2><p>  Depending on the design of the device and the type of its connection with the carrier base, the installation can be performed in assembled form or separately.  Most often, fastening is carried out according to the second principle.  But to determine the optimal installation method, it is important to answer the following question: how to install the echo sounder on the boat correctly so that the filling is not damaged during the fastening?  Only dismantled installation will eliminate the risk of damage to the device. </p>

    <p>  Next, the attachment points are again marked and, using a drill, holes of the desired diameter are made.  This time, it will also require separate holes for the cable, which must be passed before fixing the base.  Installation is performed with complete hardware.  Strongly squeezing the hardware is not worth it, since excessive stress can lead to deformation of the surface of the boat hull. </p><h2>  Connecting the echo sounder to the sensor </h2><p>  This is the final stage in the part of electrical work.  The cable from the sensor is connected to the navigation device using special connectors and plugs.  To determine the optimal length of the wire entry into the previously prepared hole, temporarily install the echo sounder on the boat in the appropriate position.  The cable should be enough to rotate the display, and the extra length is cut off. </p>

    <p>  If you have complete wire clips, they should be used at this point.  Before removing the monitor, the system should be tested.  The operating parameters of the interface are checked, as well as the sensitivity of the sensor.  Special attention is paid to sound signals.  Usually this function does not work properly if the wiring was connected incorrectly or if insulation damage occurred in the circuit. </p><h2>  Instrument Installation </h2><p>  The main installation work on mounting the echo sounder is carried out inside the case.  This is the most reliable installation configuration, but it is possible only if the boat hull is single-layer.  Installation is carried out in two ways: through fasteners and epoxy glue.  It is advisable to use two tools at the same time, which will add structural strength.  On the inner side of the case, a platform is also installed, corresponding according to the hole pattern of the main external base.  If necessary, you can bring additional communications into the design niche. </p>

    <p>  Now another question should be answered: how to install an echo sounder on a boat so that it allows a minimum of interference?  Unfortunately, it is difficult to calculate in advance the effect of noise on a signal.  However, their level can be reduced if the passage of third-party wiring is excluded next to the equipment and in the casing niche.  Installation is carried out with screws, after the panel from the inside is correctly installed and fixed with epoxy glue.  It is important to emphasize that silicone is not used in this case, since similar compositions also negatively affect the quality of signal reception. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If the installation was correctly performed, then there will be every reason to count on the effective operation of the device.  But, again, do not forget about the rules for operating the echo sounder for a boat, which are often violated.  For example, many manufacturers do not recommend using the navigator when driving at high speed.  Care should also be taken to overcome shallow water and areas with flooded objects.  In such areas, equipment may display incorrect data.  In addition, the readings can be updated only at certain time intervals, and to accurately fix the parameters in a particular area, you will have to stop the boat. </p>
