It is famous primarily for its ancient architecture, as well as thermal springs.  Wiesbaden is an ancient settlement whose hot waters were used by the ancient Romans many centuries ago.  All lovers of European medieval culture, as well as those who wish to improve their health with the help of hot springs, should visit Wiesbaden in Germany. </p><h2>  Marktirche Church </h2><p>  Marktichre Church is the main Protestant temple of the city.  It was built on the site of an old medieval church, which was destroyed in a fire in the early 19th century.  Architects and city authorities took the construction of the cathedral extremely seriously.  Sparing no money, they created a church made in the Gothic style.  The construction of Marktihre was completed in 1860, and in those days it was considered the largest brick building in the region.  The western tower of the temple, which is almost 94 meters high, is still the tallest building in Wiesbaden. </p>

    <p>  The church was repeatedly restored.  During World War II, she came under fire from American pilots who confused her with the Mainz temple.  It was restored only by 1949, and a second restoration was carried out in the 1960s.  In the course of the work, the churches returned their historical appearance, restoring the reddish color of the building.  Now the temple is visited by a huge number of tourists who have looked at Wiesbaden.  Germany is famous for many churches, but this one will surprise you with its Gothic grandeur, as well as the internal decoration of the dome painted by stars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Thermal springs Wiesbaden </h2><p>  Hot springs are located throughout the city.  Some hotels provide their own equipped thermal baths.  There are also common baths that anyone can visit.  "Kaiser Friedrich's Baths" are the city's most popular baths.  The baths were built on the site of an ancient Roman term.  True, visiting the baths with the children will not work.  Entrance is allowed only to persons over 16 years old. </p>

    <p>  One visit to the bath is designed for 4 hours, but after the time has passed you can extend the rest by paying extra every half hour.  Each visitor is given a special bracelet that is used at the entrance to the baths, and also closes and opens its own locker.  Visiting a bath is taken naked.  In the baths are a variety of baths.  Here you can visit the Finnish, Russian, and Irish baths.  There is also a room where aromatic oils are added to the water.  In addition to baths, there are saunas and steam rooms in the baths.  The water temperature is approximately 66 degrees.  In addition, water is sold for oral use as a healing drink. </p><h2>  Old and New Town Halls </h2><p>  On the Palace Square are located immediately two town halls of Wiesbaden.  Germany is a republic governed by special municipalities.  However, the Old Building is no longer used for its intended purpose, and the government is sitting in the New Town Hall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The old town hall was built in the 17th century in the style of the Northern Renaissance.  Later, another building was added to the building, made in the Neo-Gothic style.  The entire government moved from here back in 1887.  Now the Old Town Hall is actively visited by tourists, and there is also a wine restaurant.  The building is considered the oldest in Wiesbaden. </p><p>  The new town hall is also made in the Renaissance style, but was built much later - at the end of the XIX century.  The building was badly damaged due to the bombing that took place during World War II, when the United States fired on Wiesbaden.  Germany itself contributed to the destruction of its heritage.  On the orders of the Nazi government, valuable frescoes inside the building were also painted over.  After the war, they tried to restore them, but to no avail.  Nowadays, the halls are decorated with copies made by contemporary artists.  For tourists, an art gallery is open in the building, as well as wine bars that are heated by thermal springs. </p><h2>  Church of St. Elizabeth </h2><p>  The city of Wiesbaden (Germany) is mainly represented by the Protestant faith, so many tourists will be surprised by the Orthodox Cathedral located on Mount Neroberg.  It was built in the middle of the XIX century by order of the Duke Adolf - the ruler of these lands.  His wife was the Russian Grand Duchess <span>Elizabeth Mikhailovna,</span> who died during her first birth.  The duke was so shocked by the loss that he ordered the construction of an Orthodox church on the site of her grave. </p>

    <p>  The cathedral was built by German architects who were inspired by the Cathedral of Christ the Savior being built in Moscow.  An Orthodox cemetery is also located on the territory of the church, where many representatives of noble Russian families are buried.  A small chapel was erected near the cemetery.  Services in the church are held only in the summer. </p><h2>  Wiesbaden Kurzal </h2><p>  Wiesbaden (Germany) has been a popular tourist resort for many centuries.  The kursal was built to entertain wealthy travelers.  Its construction was completed in 1907, and Emperor William II attended the opening.  Outside, the building complements the park, as well as two colonnades.  The length of one of them is 129 meters, so it is considered the longest in Europe. </p>

    <p>  The course consists of many galleries, exhibition halls, <span>restaurants, bars</span> and even a casino.  There are also halls for concerts.  The largest of them accommodates almost 1,500 people.  Unfortunately, most of the building was destroyed during World War II.  Restored Kurzal only in the 1980s.  Now it hosts regional exhibitions, conferences and symposia. </p><p>  The city of Wiesbaden (Germany), the photo of which is presented above, has a huge number of other attractions that are also worth seeing.  Tourists will appreciate the healing springs, ancient architecture and the perfect ecology of the city.  Visit Wiesbaden is for those who want to improve their health and at the same time have a good rest. </p>
