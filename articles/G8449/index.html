    <h2>  Yarn </h2><p>  Since we are going to knit a thing for warming in the cold season, we need to choose a thick yarn, consisting of half of a woolen thread.  For children, it is better to choose specifically children's yarn, it includes natural hypoallergenic fibers, which is very important for children's things. </p><p>  A yarn made of acrylic threads is great - it will make a soft and pleasant to wear product.  The shirt front with knitting needles, the schemes and description for beginners of which we will provide later in the article, will surely please your baby. </p><h2>  Shirt sizes </h2><p>  So, with knitting needles and yarn, we decided.  Now you need to figure out the size of your future bib.  From how many loops you pick up initially, the size of the shirt front depends.  If we are going to knit such a scarf-blende for a baby who is only 1 year old, then you need to dial 72 loops.  For a two-year-old baby, it is initially required to dial 8 more loops.  And so on, by age.  The total number of loops should always be a multiple of 4, do not forget about it. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Children's <span>shirt shirt with knitting needles: scheme,</span> description for beginners </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby shirt shirt with knitting needles scheme description for 1.5 years" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1448288.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  We present to your attention a fairly easy way to knit a circular scarf for children on round knitting needles.  For him, you must have 5 knitting needles.  Once the desired number of loops is typed, start knitting according to the recommended pattern: </p><ol><li>  Tie a 2 x 2 elastic band (alternating 2 front loops and 2 wrong loops), about 15 cm. </li><li>  Since we knit a product round, it is difficult for us to understand where it begins and ends, so you need to remember or mark them. </li><li>  After you knit the first loop, make a crochet (the crochet is an additional loop, it is not difficult to do it, you just need to grab the thread, forming an additional loop, and transfer it to the knitting needle). </li><li>  Tie all loops on the knitting needle, do not forget to crochet before the last loop, knit it as the front one. </li><li>  Follow steps 3 and 4 to knit the remaining three knitting needles. </li><li>  With the front loops, knit a new row. </li><li>  We knit the third row in the same way as the first, adding crochets. </li><li>  Add the crochets through each row, bringing the length of the shirt front to about 8 cm. </li><li>  Knit a few final rows with the gum technique as described first. </li><li>  Finish your knitting as follows: knit the last row, knitting two loops at a time, while removing them from the knitting needles. </li></ol><p>  You got a knitted shirt-front with knitting needles!  Schemes and a description for beginners on how to decorate it will not be needed, it all depends on your imagination. </p>

    <p>  You know, in order to tie a shirt-front for a baby for 1.5 years, you need to dial 72 loops.  This amount must be distributed on 4 knitting needles.  As a result, on each of them you should have 18 loops. </p><p>  Determine the beginning of the row.  The neck of the scarf, as a rule, needs to be tied with an elastic band, which will not allow the product to stretch very much in the sock.  So, we knit with an elastic band 1 x 1 (alternate 1 front and 1 wrong loops), about 8 cm. After the elastic is ready, we knit the next 4 rows with facial loops. </p><p>  The next step is to divide our knitting into four parts: </p><ul><li>  1 part - in front, which consists of 22 loops.  We knit it: alternate 2 front and 8 wrong loops. </li><li>  Part 2 - the right shoulder, which consists of 12 loops. </li><li>  Part 3 - back, also consisting of 22 loops.  We knit the back, as before. </li><li>  4 part - the left shoulder, consisting of 12 loops. </li></ul><p>  We continue to knit our bib, while adding one loop to the two sides of the first and last loops of each part.  This should make raglan.  Loops are added through each row.  And in order not to form large holes during the addition of loops, it is necessary to add them as follows: put the needle in the right hand under the working thread stretched on the finger and grab it.  Then we transfer this loop to the left knitting needle and knit the front one, behind the back wall. </p><p>  As you can see, with the addition of loops, the product expands, and in order to make it comfortable for you to knit, at this point start using circular knitting needles.  After your product is already knitted about 8 cm, we stop adding loops and close the front and right shoulder.  Continuing to knit the back, close the left shoulder. <br><br>  We tie the back.  You should get a product with the front and the wrong side.  In each front row on both sides we reduce one loop, until 30-32 loops remain on your knitting needles.  We close all the loops, the back is ready. </p><h2>  Decorate the shirt-front </h2><p>  If a baby <span>shirt shirt is</span> knitted <span>, the description scheme</span> for the boy or girl looks the same.  The only difference is the color of the finished product.  If you are going to tie a shirt-front for a boy, choose blue, blue, light green, beige, black.  If it will be intended for the girl, then choose bright and delicate shades of pink, red, yellow. </p><p>  The finished product can be decorated with embroidery, pompons, lace, buttons, bows.  The edges of the finished shirt-front can be crocheted (without crochet) at will or decorated to your taste.  It all depends on who the shirt shirt is for. </p>
