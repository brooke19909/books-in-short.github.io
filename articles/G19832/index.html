But be that as it may, tourists who travel to Samui by bus, usually do not regret too much about the time spent on the road.  Thailand is a very beautiful country.  And on the way, travelers can admire truly paradise landscapes, the blue sea, white luxurious beaches, overgrown with picturesque green mountains, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location Chaweng Noi Pool Villa 4 * </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">There are several</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">resort towns and villages</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">on Koh Samui.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Chaweng Noi Pool Villa 4 *</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">hotel</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">is located in the north of the island - in the former fishing village of Bophut.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Tourists who arrive on Samui with a plane transfer can reach this complex in just a few minutes.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The island's airport is located in close proximity to Bophut.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Drive to the hotel from here will take no more than 20-30 minutes.</span></span></span> </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, guests have to pay separately for using the safe in this hotel.  However, for four-star complexes in Thailand, this practice is characteristic.
