</li><li>  quite often a free bus runs that takes tourists to the hotel's private beach; </li><li>  bed linen, bath towels and even bathrobes were changed daily for clean ones; </li><li>  from the windows of all rooms a breathtaking view of the lagoon or modern skyscrapers; </li><li>  excellent sound insulation, thanks to which no sounds from the street, corridor or from neighboring rooms will penetrate into your room; </li><li>  a good gentle entrance to the sea with soft white sand, without sharp pebbles; </li><li>  there is a free shuttle to Dubai; </li><li>  the beds are very comfortable and much more than standard ones (it is also worth noting high-quality orthopedic mattresses, after sleep on which the back does not hurt); </li><li>  convenient free parking near the hotel; </li><li>  Hotel staff are polite, attentive and always ready to help in resolving issues related to accommodation and rest; </li><li>  TV broadcasts four Russian-language channels, which allows you to always be in the know about news from the homeland; </li><li>  pleased with the availability of iron and ironing board in the room, which eliminates the need to use a paid ironing service; </li><li>  the rooms are very large, beautifully decorated and well furnished; </li><li>  in the evenings, in the hotel lobby you can listen to live music performed by guest artists; </li><li>  it’s nice to receive a birthday cake as a gift from the establishment (also birthday parties are provided with a number of additional privileges in the form of late eviction or room upgrade); </li><li>  there is a Russian-speaking staff, which greatly facilitates communication; </li><li>  Considering that the hotel is located very close to the international airport, the transfer will not be long and tiring. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  <span><span>Not a single tourist is safe from negative moments during their vacation.</span></span>  <span><span>This is mainly due to flaws and shortcomings of the resort.</span></span>  <span><span><span>Hilton Sharjah has received such negative reviews:</span></span></span> </p><ul><li>  <span><span><span>extremely inconvenient shower design (due to the lack of a flexible hose, it is impossible to adjust the direction of water flow);</span></span></span> </li><li>  <span><span><span>the quality of cleaning is not the best (dust on furniture and poorly cleaned plumbing are especially striking);</span></span></span> </li><li>  <span><span><span>the cosmetic kit provided in the bathroom does not include a toothbrush or toothpaste;</span></span></span> </li><li>  expensive use of the Internet (although some persistent guests managed to get a wifi password for free); </li><li>  overpriced food prices absolutely do not correspond to either taste, quality or assortment (it’s good that there are many cafes and restaurants nearby where you can eat tasty and inexpensively); </li><li>  due to the fact that breakfasts are organized in the lobby, and not in the restaurant, it is always very crowded and crowded, and queues gather at the distribution; </li><li>  sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach are very old and in some cases faulty (besides, they are not enough for everyone); </li><li>  The highlight of the rooms is the large panoramic windows, but for some reason they are not washed well enough, which spoils the impression of a picturesque view; </li><li>  if you check in with small children, be prepared for the fact that they are not provided with separate towels; </li><li>  the rooms have long been in need of redecoration, and the plumbing needs to be completely replaced; </li><li>  there are practically no plants on the territory, and therefore it looks a little depressing (especially at least some greenery near the pool is not enough); </li><li>  after eviction from the hotel, the deposit must be returned to the card for several weeks; </li><li>  rental rates for vehicles are almost double the rates for similar services in agencies located near the hotel; </li><li>  if you make a cash deposit in dollars, they will refund it in dirhams at a very unfavorable rate; </li><li>  very upset by the lack of balconies in the rooms (there is no way to fully enjoy the views and just breathe in fresh air); </li><li>  the beach is very small and crowded, but because the rest on it can hardly be called comfortable and enjoyable; </li><li>  inconvenient and unregulated cleaning schedule gives guests a lot of inconvenience (often maids come in the afternoon, when guests relax); </li><li>  the hotel is located inconveniently relative to the sea (only the availability of a free transfer saves); </li><li>  the hotel is located in an area with heavy traffic, and therefore guests traveling by car constantly get stuck in traffic when entering and leaving. </li></ul>
