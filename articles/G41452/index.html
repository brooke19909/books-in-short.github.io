Domestic tourists choose a country, as a rule, for winter holidays.  An acceptable cost of accommodation in the resort of Fujairah is offered by the Sandy Beach Hotel &amp; Resort 3 * hotel.  We will tell you more about the complex itself, its rooms, the services and entertainment offered, as well as the reviews of guests who have already had time to relax in this place. </p><h2>  What is Fujairah </h2><p>  The easternmost emirate of the UAE is significantly different from other regions of the country.  Firstly, it is located on the shores of the Gulf of Oman in the Arabian Sea, and the rest of the resorts - in the Persian Gulf.  Secondly, the nature and infrastructure here is also completely different.  Instead of quicksand and numerous skyscrapers, tourists can enjoy magnificent mountains, green oases and clean sandy beaches.  Only about 150 thousand people live in Fujairah, so the resort is perfect for a relaxing and quiet holiday.  Local attractions include the Old Portuguese Port, the Old Town Fort and the Archaeological Museum. </p><p>  The weather here also differs from the western emirates.  The climate in Fujairah is more humid, so the heat is easier to tolerate.  Tourists often come to the UAE in December for New Year's holidays, but this month the city may be a bit cool for swimming in the sea.  The most suitable option for a holiday in Fujairah is considered to be the period from the end of August to November, as well as the spring months.  In summer, on the contrary, it is too hot and stuffy here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  More about hotel location </h2><p>  A small but cozy hotel located directly on the coast of the Gulf of Oman.

Thus, the location of the hotel is convenient, which is quite important for a good stay.  Near it there are also many infrastructure facilities: <span>restaurants, cafes</span> and small shops. </p>

    <p>  The only, but rather significant drawback is the remoteness from the capital.  And although Fujairah has its own airport, it practically does not accept tourists.  Most often, travelers arrive in Dubai, because the prices for flights here are much cheaper, and because of the greater number of flights.  Fujairah can also be reached by taxi or local bus.  However, the distance between cities is approximately 150 km, so such a trip is likely to take several hours. </p><h2>  Important information about the complex </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Sandy Beach Hotel &amp; Resort (Fujairah) can hardly be called a hotel for a respectable vacation.  It is more likely suitable for a budget holiday for picky tourists, but the service here is maintained at a good level.  The complex was built in 1980, but do not worry about the old room stock.  The last restoration here ended in 2011.  Moreover, the hotel annually undergoes light cosmetic repairs.  For tourists, it offers 96 rooms.  All of them are in a single residential building.  The total area is approximately 52,000 square meters.  m </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel criticism </h2><p>  Despite the huge number of positive feedback, tourists also share their unpleasant impressions.  However, guests note that in general, the shortcomings can not be called significant, so they are unlikely to spoil the rest, but you still need to know about them.  We list the main disadvantages of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  the high cost of cocktails in bars and restaurants; </li><li>  too hot water in the pool, so swimming there in hot weather is not very comfortable; </li><li>  not the best location, as the hotel is remote from the city center and from the airport; </li><li>  the hotel has no entertainment program, so in the evenings on its territory it is very boring; </li><li>  old furniture in the rooms. </li></ul><p>  Thus, Sandy Beach Hotel &amp; Resort is a great option for a cheap vacation in the United Arab Emirates.  The complex, of course, does not reach the famous luxurious complexes of this country, but it has everything you need for a good vacation. </p>
