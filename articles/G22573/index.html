    <h2>  What's in the box? </h2><p>  The Alcatel One Touch phone cannot boast of something unusual in terms of equipment.  User's manual <strong> </strong>  and a warranty card is a set of documentation for this device.  In addition to the smartest phone, the boxed version of this gadget includes such accessories: </p><ul><li><p>  Battery. </p></li><li><p>  Interface cord. </p></li><li><p>  Branded charger. </p></li><li><p>  Standard stereo headset. </p></li></ul><p>  Now about what is clearly lacking in the above list.  First of all, it is a memory card.  But in the device of the budget segment it is not to be expected.  Therefore, this accessory will have to be additionally purchased.  Also, unlike similar Chinese smartphones, the protective package on the front panel and the silicone case are not included in the package.  They also have to buy separately. </p>

    <h2>  "Iron" device </h2><p>  The Alcatel One Touch phone is built on the basis of MT6575 processor solution from the Taiwanese developer MediaTek.  It is based on one core of the A9 architecture, which operates at a frequency of 1 GHz.  As expected for the most budgetary solution, there is no graphics adapter in this CPU, and all operations associated with processing the image on the screen are transferred to the processor.  All this significantly reduces the computing potential of this smartphone, but for most everyday tasks a single-chip microcircuit is enough.  Watching video in 3GP, AVI and MPEG4 formats, listening to music, surfing Internet portals, unpretentious <br>  games and navigation - the Alcatel One Touch phone will handle everything.  Its price is more than affordable and today is about 2000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The graphic part of the gadget and the camera </h2><p>  The screen size in this device is only 3.5 inches.  This is very small at the moment.  At the same time, its resolution is 320 by 480. The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using outdated technology and is capable of displaying over 256 thousand of all kinds of color shades.  If we take into account the cost of the device and its positioning by the manufacturer, then its characteristics are not so bad.  Only one camera is integrated in the Alcatel One Touch phone.  A photo <strong> </strong>  with its help under normal lighting you can still get an acceptable quality.  In all other cases, one should not expect a miracle.  There are no additional options such as autofocus and a software image stabilization system for this smartphone.  The situation with video recording is even worse.  In this case, the resolution of the videos will be 640x480.  The videos will be of very poor quality and you won‚Äôt understand anything about them. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  A modest amount of memory is installed in the Alcatel One Touch phone.  Reviews of real owners indicate both a lack of RAM and a small capacity of the built-in drive.  In the first case we are talking about 256 MB, and in the second - 512 MB, of which only about 100 MB the user can use at his discretion.  This is only enough for 3-4 full games.  If the problem cannot be solved with RAM, then the capacity of the internal drive can be increased by 32 GB by installing an SD card.  The place for its installation is located behind the battery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design solutions and ergonomics </h2><p>  One cannot expect any special design solutions from an economy-class smartphone.  The body of the device is made of ordinary plastic with a glossy finish.  He simply attracts fingerprints and dirt.  Scratching it is not difficult.  In general, without a protective sticker and cover, the owners of this gadget, as noted earlier, simply can not do.  <span>The overall dimensions of the</span> smartphone are 115x62.3 mm.  Its thickness is 12.2 mm and its weight is only 118 g. The following smartphone elements are displayed on the front panel: a speaker (its grille is located above the display), a screen and three ordinary touch <span>control buttons.</span>  On the left side of the device are two mechanical volume control buttons, and the lock and off buttons are displayed on the upper edge.  Nearby there is an audio jack for connecting an external sound system.  Bottom are the opening of the earpiece microphone and the USB connector.  On the back side there is one single camera.  It should be noted right away that the dimensions in this device are not as impressive as those of modern flagship devices.  Therefore, it can be controlled with only one hand without any problems.  An additional grouping of mechanical buttons in the upper right corner of the gadget greatly simplifies this task.  The ergonomics of the device are well thought out and complaints from ordinary users does not cause. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone repair alkatel one touch" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/614228.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  An external battery with a capacity of 1300 mA / h is used on this entry-level device.  Such a constructive solution greatly simplifies the repair of Alcatel One Touch phones, since it can be done independently without contacting a service center.  All you need is to purchase a new battery and replace it with the old one.  So, the indicated battery capacity on average is enough for 2-3 days of battery life with an average load on this smart gadget. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The Alcatel One Touch phone operates under the outdated version, both morally and physically, of the Android version with serial number 2.3.6.  And this is a tangible drawback of this device.  In the foreseeable future, the 5th version of this OS will be released, and, most likely, there will be compatibility problems.  New software may no longer be installed on this device.  You can, of course, upgrade the OS version to 4.0 by installing third-party firmware, but this does not fundamentally save the situation.  Even a later version of Android is outdated, and compatibility issues are not completely resolved.  The rest of the software on this gadget is standard.  These are proprietary utilities from Google and more.  There are also standard programs such as "Gallery", "Calendar" and "Calculator".  The developers did not forget about social services.  In this case, we are talking about ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù, ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù and ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äù.  But social networks will have to be installed separately. </p>

    <h2>  Device Communication Capabilities </h2><p>  Impressive communication capabilities are implemented in this device.  Among them are the following: </p><ul><li><p>  Full support for GSM and 3G networks.  With their help, you can make calls, exchange text or multimedia messages and receive information from the Internet. </p></li><li><p>  You can also access the Internet via Wi-Fi.  Moreover, in this case, the <span>information transfer</span> rate will be significantly higher than in the previous one. </p></li><li><p>  Another important wireless way to transfer data is Bluetooth.  Its main task is to transfer small files (up to 10 MB) to similar mobile gadgets and devices. </p></li><li><p>  With navigation in this smartphone, things are very bad.  GPS and GLONASS are not supported.  There is only an A-GPS system.  She uses mobile towers to determine the location on the ground only approximately. </p></li><li><p>  The main wired method of transmitting information is USB.  It allows you to connect to a PC to exchange data with it.  This interface also allows you to charge the battery. </p></li><li><p>  The developers did not forget about music lovers.  A 3.5 mm jack is provided for connecting external speakers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone alkatel one touch Price" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/614226.jpg" width="400"></div>

    </li></ul><h2>  Pros and cons of a smartphone based on reviews </h2><p>  Now consider the shortcomings that the Alcatel One Touch phone is not without.  Owner reviews highlight such of them: </p><ul><li><p>  Very little memory, both operational and built-in.  But if it is impossible to solve the operational problem, the internal drive can be significantly increased by installing a memory card. </p></li><li><p>  Very weak 2MP camera.  And this drawback cannot be eliminated in any way. </p></li><li><p>  Deprecated OS version.  You can reflash the device and update the "Android", but in this case the system software will already be third-party developers. </p></li><li><p>  CPU performance is poor. </p></li></ul><p>  But all that was said above crosses out one plus - this is a low price.  Only 2,000 rubles need to be paid for the Alcatel One Touch phone.  Reviews of the owners of the gadget pay attention to this.  Consumers understand that they are buying a budget smartphone, and therefore do not expect anything supernatural from it.  For their tasks, according to the owners, this is a great gadget.  He easily copes with most tasks, whether reading books, listening to music or surfing the Internet. </p>

But after all, his price is appropriate.  Therefore, this is an ideal solution for those who need an inexpensive, but functional device.  We hope that the Alcatel One Touch 4007D phone will serve you for a long time! </p>
