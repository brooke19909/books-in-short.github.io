    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No less interesting is the history of the village of Repino itself.  Previously, it was called Kuokkala, which means ‚Äúhook‚Äù in Finnish.  Even in ancient times, this corner of the world was not empty.  In <span>the Sestra River</span> , they were actively engaged in fishing. </p><p>  Then the residents of St. Petersburg noticed the territory, because the land plot and landscapes of Repino are simply magnificent.  It was from this moment, namely from the 1870s, that various architectural structures and summer cottages began to appear in Repino.  A little later a railway appeared here, after which summer cottages became a mass phenomenon. </p><h2>  What is interesting can be seen in "Penates" </h2><p>  The most important attraction in Repino is the Penates Cottage Museum.  Russian artist Ilya Repin lived in this building with his wife.  For thirty years, a creative family lived in this cozy and beautifully equipped house with various outbuildings. </p><p>  Unfortunately, today <span>tourists are</span> not able to see the original design and interior, because the building was completely burned down during the war.  Nevertheless, caring architects exactly restored this Repino landmark in order to preserve the memory for many years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Repino Attractions Photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1946198.jpg"></div>

The interior of each room is amazing and original.  Even the gates leading to the courtyard are distinguished by a special architectural design. </p><p>  The story of a creative family is attractive and intriguing.  Once a week, an open day was held here.  On this day, the house could be visited by anyone who longs for communication with famous people.  The artist helped guests feel at home.  They themselves could go into any room, enjoy the treats that the owners of the allotments must have prepared for dear guests.  In a unique way, the dining room was equipped on which the inscription was visible: "Open the doors and go in."  In the center of the room was a table, the middle of which was spinning non-stop, so that each guest could be treated to the desired dish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Repino Komarovo Leningrad Region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/1944884.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In summer, the museum-cottage is open from 10.30 in the morning until 18.00, and in winter from 10.30 to 16.00.  Entrance to the territory costs 200 rubles. </p><h2>  House of Writers in Komarovo </h2><p>  On the street Lieutenants House 31 there is another very curious attraction: the House of Writers.  The building was built back in 1956.  The building was inhabited by Soviet writers who could indulge in a muse in this building calmly and without excessive noise and create their works, which were later read by people of the entire USSR. </p><p>  Locals said that from all the windows of this building the sounds of typewriters were heard daily.  Usually this lasted until lunch, and at that moment even passers-by died down so as not to disturb peace and not distract writers from the creative process. </p><p>  The rooms <span>of the writers' house</span> were tiny; they were arranged poorly.  Nevertheless, the creators were comfortable working in such conditions, because one person relied on a separate room. </p><p>  You can go inside the house if you first agree with the administrators of the Writer's House.  This will allow you to fully plunge into the atmosphere of the institution. </p><h2>  Chukovsky cottage </h2><p>  Chukovsky's dacha is located on Kronstadtskaya Street, house 10. A site in the English village style has been completed.  During the writer's life, Korney Chukovsky visited many poets of that time.  Therefore, in this place it smells of history, the spirit of the muse is felt.  Currently, tourists are only given the opportunity to see the place where the cottage was, since in 1986 the building and everything that was on the territory adjacent to the building burned down.  To this day, local authorities are trying to achieve the restoration of the former dacha of the famous poet. </p><p>  Officials all the time tried to reduce the importance of the house of an outstanding writer.  Each time they tried to prove that this was not Korney Chukovsky‚Äôs summer residence.  Nevertheless, there is plenty of evidence that it was a popular writer who lived at this point in the village.  This fact was confirmed by local residents and those who had the opportunity in life to communicate with Chukovsky.  After some time after much debate and discussion, Chukovsky‚Äôs summer house mysteriously burned to the ground. </p><p>  In the photo of the Repino sights from those times, you can see how interesting and extraordinary this area looked. </p><h2>  <span>Central Park</span> in Repino </h2><p>  Description of Repin's attraction, such as the central park, is quite interesting.  It is large enough, it was originally built on a wasteland.  In one of the parts of the park there is a canal that flows into the lovers' pond.  Famous writers, poets and composers liked to walk around this park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Repino Attractions Description" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/1944867.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The wide streets shine with greenery, along the entire perimeter of the park there are benches on which you can sit while enjoying nature.  It occupies a fairly large area, so it is worth going there all day to take a leisurely stroll through the most beautiful surroundings. </p><h2>  Attractions in Komarovo </h2><p>  All the sights of the Leningrad region in Repino and Komarovo are difficult to list.  A popular and frequently visited place in this area is the <span>Komarov necropolis.</span>  There is a tourist attraction on Ozernaya street.  It is here that the oldest cemetery is located, where you can visit the graves of famous prose writers, poets, composers, scientists.  The grave of Akhmatova is the Repino attraction, which is most visited in the Komarov necropolis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="repino sights the grave of Akhmatova" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/1944880.jpg" width="600"></div>
