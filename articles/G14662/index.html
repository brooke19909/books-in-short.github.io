Completely dissimilar landscapes are concentrated on a rather small peninsula.  The exotic nature of the <span>southern coast of Crimea is</span> intertwined with the volcanic rocks of Karadag in the east and the endless steppe and sandy beaches in the west. </p><h2>  Western Crimea, pos.  Deer </h2><p>  The westernmost point of Crimea is Tarkhankut.  The peculiarity of these places is crystal clear water, <span>white cliffs</span> and clean air.  This part of the peninsula is the least populated and wild. </p><p>  The village of Olenevka is located closest to the cape, only five kilometers away.  It is in the vicinity of this village that all the beauties that the <span>Tarkhankut Peninsula</span> is known for are located <span>.</span>  It is an ideal holiday destination for those who love silence and solitude with nature.  Due to the lack of industrial enterprises and large highways, this area is considered environmentally friendly. </p><p>  This cozy village was chosen by divers, surfers and other amateurs and professionals.  In 2016, the Crimea-Extreme festival was held for these sports in Olenevka.  The sea on Tarhankut is incredibly clear, the entire underwater world is clearly visible. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the sea, Olenevka is washed by an estuary with salt water and healing mud.  If you look at the map of the area from above, you can see that the village is located just on the shore of <span>this estuary.</span>  A lane of the cleanest sandy beaches separates the estuary from the sea.  The sand here, like in the Maldives, is snow-white.  The beauty is incredible.  The road to the sea beach from Olenevka will take about 10-15 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Olenevka, Crimea, hotels near the sea </h2><p>  In this wonderful village there are no large sanatoriums or boarding houses.

But how to choose housing to your liking?  To do this, read the reviews of vacationers.  Tourists celebrate positive and negative points and thereby help determine the choice of a place to stay. </p><p>  As for Olenevka herself, there are simply no negative reviews about her.  The cleanliness of beaches, crystal water and the unique steppe air of these places amaze everyone without exception.  Vacationers call local attractions ‚Äúbewitching beauty‚Äù, and Olenevka's beaches are compared with the best in the world - the beaches of the Maldives. </p>

    <p>  Almost everyone notes the special cordiality of local residents and staff of all hotels, and this is important.  Hospitality means a lot on vacation.  After a decent welcome, I want to return again and again to places where you are welcome. </p><p>  In all reviews, tourists write about the amazingly delicious cuisine of local restaurants and cafes.  For a fairly modest fee, you can taste real culinary masterpieces. </p><p>  Olenevka is a quiet place for family holidays, but one must be prepared for this situation.  Fans of noisy holidays, discos, modern clubs will clearly not be delighted with such a holiday.  There are no noisy embankments, expensive resorts and pensions of the European level. </p><p>  Remoteness from the main attractions of Crimea - this is perhaps the most negative moment in vacation on the western coast of Crimea. </p><p>  Some of the minuses include the remoteness of housing from the sea: whatever one may say, the estuary cannot be called the sea.  By the way, many, on the contrary, note this as a positive factor, so it's up to you. </p><p>  And, perhaps, vacationers call the pricing policy of local boarding houses, hotels and private mini-hotels the biggest plus.  Compared with other parts of the Crimea, housing here is quite cheap and quite high quality.  Prices for products in markets and restaurants are adequate. </p><p>  Those who love wildlife, pacification and crystal clear sea water must visit this wonderful corner of Crimea. </p>
