The country's largest bank accepts 9 out of 10 receipts, which allows Russians to send and receive transfers throughout the country.  But periodically, even the leader of the banking sector has problems with the transfer.  Sberbank urges customers not to refuse the services of the company in such cases and is trying to resolve the issues that have arisen. </p><h2>  Types of payments in Sberbank </h2><p>  Customers can use the following services to send funds using a financial institution: </p><ul><li>  Payments to legal entities.  These include not only contributions for utility bills, but also transfers to the accounts of private commercial organizations, as well as state-owned companies. </li><li>  Transfers to individuals - intra-bank "Hummingbird" or international Money Gram. </li><li>  Transfers in foreign currency.  This can be credited to the account of both an individual and a legal entity. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="pctechmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="translation problems" class="if uuid-2723338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2723338.jpg"></div><p>  Sberbank clients may have problems with any of these transactions, but more than 75% of claims are related to operations of individuals. </p><h2>  Payment Methods </h2><p>  Sberbank customers can make a payment or transfer in several ways.  This may occur: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  at the bank office; </li><li>  through terminals and ATMs; </li><li>  using Internet banking "Sberbank Online"; </li><li>  through the mobile application; </li><li>  using the service of SMS-informing "Mobile Bank". </li></ul><h2>  Problems sending payments at the bank office </h2><p>  About 1/3 of complaints about problems are connected with the incorrect sending of funds at additional offices of the company.  The reasons that the money has not been credited to the account are usually associated with the following: </p><ul><li>  lack or insufficient amount of details; </li><li>  incorrect data; </li><li>  technical problems; </li><li>  operator error. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, problems with payments at Sberbank arise for customers who have not provided an identification document (for example, when sending transfers) or details for crediting funds.  Provided that all data is presented and its completeness, operators are always ready to accept payments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paymaxxpro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to solve problems with Sberbank" class="if uuid-2723373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2723373.jpg"></div><p>  Incorrect details are a common reason why the payment is returned to the sender‚Äôs account or does not arrive as intended.  If the payer is not sure of the correctness of the information provided, it is not recommended to transfer.  If the conditions are ignored, the funds will be returned to the account of the sender (or bank), or will be transferred to one of the intermediary accounts.  To return the funds, the client will need to contact the office in which the operation was performed, with a passport and write a statement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Technical failure occurs in 3% of cases.  It may be associated with the work of one or more banking programs.  If such problems of Sberbank led to a delay in the receipt of funds, the client will receive a notification in the form of SMS information, or a call will be received from an office employee indicating further actions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.americanmerchant.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="problems with payment" class="if uuid-2723349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2723349.jpg"></div><p>  Operator error arises due to the heavy workload or inattention of the employee.  In this case, problems with Sberbank lead to a negative attitude of the client: the service was not provided at the proper level.  In this situation, the employee who made the mistake is required to apologize and do everything to increase customer loyalty, for example, resolve the issue within 24 hours. </p><h2>  Problems when paying at terminals and ATMs </h2><p>  Remote service channels are ready to accept customer payments 24/7.  But not all citizens are aware of how to pay this or that receipt or transfer funds. </p><p>  In 89% of cases, delays in payment at terminals occur due to the fault of plastic card users.  Most customers enter erroneous data without checking the information provided.  As a result, funds are credited to the account of another individual or organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abbyy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment through Sberbank" class="if uuid-2723385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2723385.jpg"></div><p>  What should I do if problems with Sberbank arise due to the fault of the payer?  The action algorithm is simple: </p><ol><li>  Save all checks. </li><li>  Contact the contact center of the bank.  The number is indicated on the back of the plastic card or on any of the ATMs. </li><li>  If the support service operator cannot solve the client‚Äôs question, you need to come to the bank branch. </li></ol><h2>  Payment in a mobile application or in Sberbank Online: causes of failures </h2><p>  In 9 out of 10 cases, Sberbank‚Äôs clients actively using modern payment services have problems associated with rush from the senders themselves.  But sometimes a payment in a mobile application or Internet banking does not arrive at the recipient's account for another reason.  This may be due to the following: </p><ul><li>  <em>Incomplete transaction status.</em>  Sending is considered successful if, after confirmation, the electronic message ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù appears.  Other transfer statuses are saved in the payment history under the name "Draft." </li><li>  <em>Low speed internet.</em>  Hangup of the payment for more than 5 minutes leads to its cancellation.  It will also be displayed in the history under the status of "Draft." </li><li>  <em>Cancellation by the client.</em>  Sometimes users instead of the "Confirm" button click "Cancel", which leads to the suspension of the transaction. </li></ul><h2>  Solving problems when sending payments: features </h2><p>  When the funds have not been credited to the account, the bank may accept the application.  This is possible in such cases: </p><ol><li>  If funds were transferred between customer accounts.  Employees are authorized to conduct operations with visitors who have presented a passport. </li><li>  If the status of the operation is ‚ÄúPending confirmation‚Äù or ‚ÄúAccepted for execution‚Äù.  Payments with the status "Completed" are considered completed.  The Bank is not entitled to withdraw funds that have already been transferred to another person or organization. </li><li>  If, when sending through Sberbank, problems are associated with a technical failure.  In this case, the client receives a check on which this reason is indicated.  It must be presented at a visit to the bank. </li></ol>
