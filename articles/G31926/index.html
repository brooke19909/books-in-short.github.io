    <p>  Which is better - plane, bus or train?  Moscow - Rome is a fairly popular route not only for tourists.  People come to Italy both for shopping and for business trips.  Between the <span>capitals of Italy</span> and Russia, the distance is 3827 km.  This path can be overcome in several popular ways.  Choosing a route, you should take into account the individual and financial characteristics of passengers. </p><h2>  Airplane </h2><p>  Every day, flights from Moscow to Rome fly both Russian and foreign airlines.  The total journey time without transfers takes less than four hours.  Of course, a ticket "Moscow - Rome" is quite expensive, its price starts at 16,000 Russian rubles.  For passengers who want to save money, there are domestic flights, but with a change.  The total travel time will take about 10 hours, but it will cost half as much. </p><p>  There is one more option organized by Baltic Airlines.  Here the transplant will take place in the Latvian capital, and the total travel time will be 7 hours.  The savings are the same as in the previous version. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bus </h2><p>  To purchase a <span>ticket "Moscow</span> - Rome", you will have to turn to travel agency services for help.  In the summer it’s easier, since there is a huge selection of flights.  But there are pitfalls.  Firstly, this is the cost of the ticket, and it starts from 230 euros, which is much more expensive than a flight.  The other side of the coin is not the most comfortable transport for traveling long distances. </p>

    <h2>  Personal car </h2><p>  Bridging the distance between Rome and Moscow by car requires a lot of time and effort in preparation.  After all, it is you who decides where to stop, when to refuel and relax.  A properly composed route is 90% of the success of such a trip.  It is important to note every place to stay, car services, <span>gas stations</span> and even attractions in different cities, so that the trip was boring and memorable.  You should take into account many little things, because you have to cross more than one border, and sometimes even stand in lines.  How to get from Moscow to Rome by train?  If the previous options do not suit you, then as an alternative, you can consider rail transport. </p><h2>  France </h2><p>  Where does the Moscow - Rome train depart from?  Ticket price, travel time and other details should be studied in advance, this will help to plan your trip in advance.  There are no direct trains on the route Moscow - Rome.  There is only an express train that runs between Russia and France for 150 years, Moscow - Nice.  This is a very popular route with comfortable wagons and all the necessary amenities for a 48-hour trip.  Another caveat to consider when buying tickets for this train is that the train arrives in Verona, Milan and Genoa at night or early in the morning.  For convenience, you can use the services of hotels with which there are absolutely no problems in the country.  And then you can conveniently get to Rome. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, there are enough options to get to your destination with transfers.  During such a trip, you can optimally choose a route that will expand your horizons and see the sights of Europe.  While the direct train Moscow - Rome is only a dream, you can take advantage of other available travel options from the Russian capital to Italian. </p><h2>  Austria </h2><p>  One of the most popular routes is traveling through Vienna.  The Austrian capital can be accessed directly from Moscow.  And from Vienna there are direct trains to many <span>Italian cities.</span>  This method is very favorable due to the small number of transfers that require proper organization and can tire a passenger. </p><h2>  Germany </h2><p>  An equally interesting option is a trip through Germany.  From Munich you can directly get to the capital of Italy.  But to get there from Russia, you must first come to the capital of Germany, and only then to Munich.  If you are interested not only in Rome, but also in other remote <span>cities of Italy,</span> it should be noted that the country's railway is very well developed.  This allows tourists to easily travel to any, even the smallest, settlement. </p>
