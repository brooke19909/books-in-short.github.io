    <h2>  Ziggurat </h2><p>  Let's start with the most important and famous attraction of the water park - an attraction called Ziggurat.  Built in Mesopotamian architectural style, a high (about 30 meters) massive tower is a real "temple of entertainment" that will impress everyone who decides to visit the Atlantis water park.  This building stands out even among the many architectural styles and technologies collected in the cities of the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates.  The Ziggurat tower complex consists of 3 levels, on which 7 unique water slides are located, which have no analogues.  Four slides are built using Master Blaster technology, which involves the use of the most modern ideas and technologies in the field of water entertainment and outdoor activities.  <span>The</span> attraction <span>water slide</span> can easily compete with such a popular roller coaster: ups and downs, sharp turns and thrills are guaranteed to all visitors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Leap of Faith Water Slide </h2><p>  The most extreme slide in the water park is undoubtedly “Leap of Faith” (this is exactly what the name of the Leap of Faith attraction sounds in translation).  This slide is extremely popular among both extreme visitors and amateurs to tickle their nerves with thrills and a bright burst of adrenaline in their blood.  Aquaventure Water Park (Atlantis) invites visitors to this attraction to take only one step, but it will be a "step into the abyss."  Daring to experience the unknown element, you will rush along an almost vertical descent, gaining decent speed from the start, and fly into a tunnel 60 meters long, which passes through a transparent aquarium populated by dangerous sharks.  The main thing is not to close your eyes, otherwise the impressions of this flight will be incomplete.  However, adrenaline from several seconds of almost <span>free fall</span> and sliding along a long tunnel will boil in the blood for a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Shark attack </h2><p>  Shark Attack is another popular and unusual attraction that invites you to visit the Atlantis water park.  Here visitors swim along a rather long transparent tube on an inflatable raft.  At first glance - a harmless, perhaps even a little boring attraction ... But there is one small addition - the tunnel has transparent walls, and the entire body of water around is teeming with real sharks and other representatives of marine fauna!  It seems that you only have to reach out and you can touch these dangerous predators, separated from you only by a wall of transparent, but very strong plastic.  But even a constant reminder to yourself that predators can not do harm does not save from the <span>release of adrenaline</span> into the blood when one of the sharks with an open mouth swims a meter from the raft.  This is not all that the Atlantis water park has to offer: tourist reviews advise you to go down to the foot of the Ziggurat tower, made in the form of a spacious room with transparent wide windows around the entire perimeter, through which you can watch sharks and people swimming through the tunnel "Attack of the sharks." </p>

    <h2>  Shamal </h2><p>  The Shamal attraction is located in the Ziggurat tower, from the top of which you will find an extreme descent in a spiral-shaped closed pipe along a winding track, after which you will land in the intermediate pool, from where you can continue the trip along the even more interesting Plung slide. </p><h2>  Plung </h2><p>  After a short rest in the pool, the descent from the Ziggurat tower can be continued along the The Plunge hill - another exciting attraction with which the Atlantis water park abounds.  This is a real <span>rollercoaster</span> in a water format - on an inflatable puck visitors will have to overcome extreme highs and dizzying falls that cause a sensation of breaking all the boundaries of attraction.  A lot of emotions and a great mood are guaranteed! </p>
