Indeed, rest, for example, in Antalya, is in many ways different from rest in Bodrum.  If you plan to spend your vacation on the coast of the Aegean Sea and are looking for a comfortable, but at the same time inexpensive hotel, we suggest you consider the five-star Green Beach Resort Hotel as an option for accommodation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green beach resort hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/981985.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Reviews of tourists from Russia, we note immediately, for the most part are positive.  So, many travelers liked this hotel, and they were satisfied with their choice.  But find out all the details in more detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  The overwhelming majority of guests with their rooms at the Green Beach Resort Hotel (Bodrum) were completely satisfied.  So, in their comments they say that the apartments here are quite spacious, bright and comfortable.  All equipment worked properly.  If any breakdowns occurred, then after contacting the reception the malfunction was eliminated as soon as possible.  Judging by the reviews of our compatriots, the rooms in the main building are especially good.  As for the apartments in the bungalow, some tourists complained about the dampness.  In addition, a number of guests said that they should not take rooms on the ground floor of the main building.  The fact is that sometimes you can smell the sewer.  Otherwise, travelers had no complaints.  So, cleaning, according to them, was carried out every day and quite high quality.  The maids did not forget to change towels and bedding, as well as update supplies of bath-toiletries in the bathroom. </p>

    <p>  Some tourists also considered the fact that the hotel does not catch Wi-Fi very well as a drawback.  So, you can always connect to it, but the connection speed leaves much to be desired.  However, according to our compatriots, they still managed to use the mail and call up relatives and friends using Skype, Viber, or another messenger.  So in general, this did not become a problem. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  In their comments, many travelers pay attention to the fact that they managed to get the keys to the room at Green Beach Resort upon arrival no earlier than two in the afternoon.  This is due to the fact that the hotel is quite large, and almost always completely full, so the maids just do not have time to prepare the apartments for the arrival of new residents earlier.  In this regard, experienced tourists recommend that those who are just leaving for this hotel, if they have an early arrival, put bathing accessories and towels in a suitcase so that they can be easily reached.  After all, as soon as you arrive at the hotel in the morning, the administrators will immediately put on your bracelets, and you can leave things at the reception and go for breakfast, and then to the pool or immediately to the beach.  Moreover, our compatriots recommend not trying to somehow put pressure on the administrators or offer them money in order to settle earlier.  After all, this is the policy of the hotel, and you only need to come to terms with it.  Moreover, you do not have to spend half a day sitting hungry at the reception, as you can immediately begin to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green beach resort hotel 5 Bodrum" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/981980.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory and location </h2><p>  As for the territory of the hotel Green Beach Resort Hotel 5 *, reviews of which we are reviewing, then tourists found it quite large, green and very well-groomed.  In addition, our compatriots note that everything is very well planned here.  So, regardless of which building you live in, it will not take you much time to reach the beach and other entertainment and infrastructure facilities.  In addition, many guests recall with delight that the hotel is located on a hill.  Therefore, both many rooms and most of its territory offer a magnificent view of the Aegean Sea. </p>

    <p>  The location of the hotel complex was also quite successful by travelers.  So, from here, for just one dollar, you can take a minibus to Gundogan.  Here you can visit one of the many restaurants, take a walk along the promenade, drop by a night club or buy souvenirs.  From Gundogan, again by minibus, you can get to Bodrum.  The cost of the trip is two dollars. </p><h2>  Food </h2><p>  As for food at Green Beach Resort Hotel, reviews of tourists on this subject contain sometimes conflicting opinions.  So, some guests express dissatisfaction with the variety of menus.  But still, most guests assure: if you take into account that this hotel, although it belongs to the five-star category, is quite budgetary, the choice of dishes here is quite consistent with this fact.  So, according to them, in the main restaurant you could always try poultry, fish, beef, a variety of casseroles, snacks, salads, fresh fruits and, of course, delicious sweets.  Moreover, everything is prepared very high quality.  It's impossible to stay hungry here.  However, many guests nevertheless agree that the hotel administration should think about opening another buffet restaurant.  The fact is that in the midst of the holiday season the hotel complex, as a rule, is almost 100% full.  But the main restaurant is not objectively designed for such a number of guests.  In this regard, sometimes tourists had to wait for a while until the table was empty, or to stand in line for a particular dish.  In general, such a situation, as our compatriots note in their comments, is characteristic of many hotels in Turkey.  However, tourists still hope that the five-star hotel will be able to solve this problem. </p><h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  In their comments, travelers recall that Green Beach Resort Hotel operates on an all inclusive basis.  So guests can get local drinks in the hotel bars for free.  This can be done before 11 pm.  After that, drinks will have to be paid separately.  In addition, for an additional fee, you can enjoy freshly squeezed juices and alcoholic beverages produced not in Turkey (rum, tequila, whiskey, etc.).  However, most guests were satisfied with the soft drinks they offered, as well as beer and wine.  There were no complaints about their quality in the reviews. </p>

    <p>  In addition, a number of travelers were satisfied with the fact that alcoholic drinks were not served to the beach bar.  This can significantly reduce the possibility of unpleasant situations with drunk holidaymakers. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  This item plays a very important role for most tourists.  Indeed, many travelers come to Turkey mainly in order to have a great time, basking in the rays of the gentle sun and swimming in the azure waters of the sea.  As for the Green Beach Resort hotel we are considering, here, judging by the reviews of our compatriots, a beach holiday is sure to succeed.  So, from residential buildings to the coast to go very close.  The sea here, according to tourists, is very clean.  The hotel's private beach is pebble.  You can go into the water both from the shore and from the pier.  The beach has comfortable sun loungers and parasols, as well as a bar where you can enjoy soft drinks and snack on fast food throughout the day.  However, our compatriots note that in the midst of the holiday season, when the hotel is full, as they say, to the eyeballs, sometimes there is a need to come to the beach early in the morning and take a sunbed.  The fact is that if you go to the sea later, for example, after breakfast, then it is likely that you will not be able to find a free sunbed.  In addition, experienced travelers note the fact that the beach towels issued at Green Beach Resort are small in size.  So, according to tourists, you can wipe them, but lying on them is not very convenient.  Therefore, they recommend that everyone staying here on vacation grab a large <span>beach towel</span> from their home or purchase it directly on the spot, especially since there are many shops here, and the prices are quite reasonable. </p>
