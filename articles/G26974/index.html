How much joy and pride in the eyes of the baby.  Still: he himself made with his own hands something new, something that had not happened before, and he did it!  Children like to build.  Crafts for a child of 2-3 years old hand-made production are very important: this is both a way to declare oneself as a person, and knowledge of the world.  And if something suddenly breaks down (disassembled toys: dolls that are left without hands, and cars without wheels) - this is also a creation, because in order to do something, you need to find out how this something works.  So the world is known.  With the participation of adults and primarily parents, he is known faster. </p>

    <h2>  Features of young children </h2><p>  Remember the song from the funny children's cartoon "Caution Monkeys"?  She perfectly characterizes the <span>psychological characteristics of</span> those who "climbed out of the cradle": two or three year old men.  Hyperactivity and the inability to focus on a long period on something specific at this age is the norm.  After all, the mental processes in a child are still involuntary.  Therefore, when planning a lesson with your baby, choose simple crafts.  For children 2-3 years old, needlework should not exceed 15 minutes.  Time is given with a margin, because concentration of attention at this age is possible only for 3-5 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What crafts for a child 2-3 years old is better to choose? </h2><p>  1. Do not require sitting in one place for more than 15 minutes: we must remember the line from the song mentioned above about a pound of explosives. </p><p>  2. Easy to do: the benchmark for the proverb about perseverance and work is premature. </p><p>  3. Those that can be finished in 15 minutes.  Pick up the craft that you manage to do during this period of time, so you can teach your child how to finish the job. </p><p>  4. Choose a work option that will certainly be interesting, and the final result will impress the baby. </p><p>  5. Developing crafts for children 2-3 years old - an ideal option for an <span>integrated lesson.</span>  Therefore, try to combine needlework with the development of speech, logic, and self-service skills. </p><p>  The main condition for engaging in creativity: the baby should do the work, the mother only prompts, directs. </p><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  Creating masterpieces with <span>finger paints</span> is an exciting lesson for the baby.  When a child learns not only to stain himself with paint, but also to slide a finger on paper, his hands will get stronger, give him a thick (for convenience) brush.  By 2 years, we already have an experienced artist who has passed the stage of marasmus and has come to the stage of kalyak-malyak and lines.  Feel free to start drawing with his pen the little men from the song "Point, dot, comma - a crooked face emerged."  By two and a half - three years, the baby will be able to draw his first cephalopod himself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  All mothers know how important it is to develop <span>fine motor skills in</span> the baby‚Äôs hands.  Modeling is one of the ideal lessons for its development.  It is best to start the child in the modeling in a year.  First, introduce the baby to the modeling material.  Yes, by the way, you should pay attention to the optimal choice of what you need to sculpt crafts with your baby.  For a child of 2-3 years old, the ideal material is dough.  You can cook it yourself, or you can buy it in stores that specialize in selling children's goods.  There you can buy <span>related products</span> for modeling: rolling pin, stacks, dies and molds for cutting figures. </p><p>  So, we begin modeling lessons with simple tasks: knead the dough, roll a bun, pinch off small pieces from it. </p><p>  Next, we teach the child to roll a cake from a dough using a rolling pin, cut out figures using cake molds (you can combine the lesson with an applique by sticking figures on a cardboard sheet). </p><p>  Prepare a template with a simple pattern for class.  For example, a tree, and the child will gladly paste leaves on it. </p><p>  By the age of three, your baby will have fully mastered the role of a sculptor and will be able to sculpt plain figures from three or four separately made parts. </p>

    <h2>  Applique </h2><p>  For classes, you will need ready-made parts that need to be glued, a base and glue (ideally starch or flour paste).  The option of applying leaves of trees is possible if you are doing autumn crafts.  For children 2-3 years old, classes should be carried out in order of increasing complexity. </p><p>  The first stage is the child‚Äôs acquaintance with the glue, its properties and the algorithm of work: first we smear the detail with glue, then we attach it to the paper and press it. </p><p>  It is important to immediately draw the attention of the child to the fact that with one hand he holds the part that greases with glue. </p><p>  When all the difficulties of the craft of the pastor have been completed, you can proceed to a more creative process: composing compositions from previously cut senior elements. </p><h2>  Construction </h2><p>  The <span>activity is</span> very useful, because, in addition to fine <span>motor skills of the hands, it</span> develops the <span>spatial thinking of the</span> child.  Of course, the kid himself can not cope with the role of the designer.  But there is always a mom, a dad who will help to do something interesting.  There are ready-made sets - crafts for a child of 2-3 years, allowing you to collect figures from several large parts. </p><p>  But you can do without them: to collect chestnuts and cones for a walk and make a funny man.  Take an unplanned lesson right on the walk. </p><p>  Other things are also suitable for designing: tangles of thread, cardboard basics from toilet rolls, all kinds of boxes and boxes.  One has only to show imagination. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  At the age of 2 to 3 years, children's thinking develops visually and effectively, therefore creativity is important, in which the child receives skills in handling objects, labor, self-service, and speech. </p><p>  The main thing is not to forget the rule: the child should like what he does. </p>
