Traveling in Europe is a comfortable trip.  Do not be afraid to organize it yourself. </p><h2>  Amsterdam... </h2><p>  And immediately there are numerous associations with this city.  For some, this is art, magnificent architecture, for others, freedom of expression through clothing, music and nightlife.  A city free of prejudice attracts thousands of tourists.  Many people think about how to plan their vacation or trip in order to reach the nearest cities as much as possible for an overview of Western Europe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": Anestiev, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amsterdam Embankment" class="if uuid-2557724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93836/2557724.jpg"></div><h2>  Car rental </h2><p>  If you flew to Amsterdam and are going to Brussels, then you can rent a car directly at the airport, thereby saving on transfer and travel to the city.  You can pick up a car in advance through the Expedia aggregator. </p><p>  From the documents you must have a driver‚Äôs license, passport and a personal bank card, from which the amount of rent and security deposit (about 200 euros) will be debited.  Almost all companies charge an additional insurance fee for young drivers whose age is less than 25 years old and, in addition to age, they will take a service fee for less than one year, a maximum of 25 euros per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sfexaminer.com" data-author=": Joshua Sabatini, "><img itemprop="image" alt="rent a car at the airport" class="if uuid-2557144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93836/2557144.jpg"></div><p>  Also, when drawing up a lease, rental companies provide an unlimited number of kilometers included in the price, but do not forget to inform the manager that you plan to travel outside the country.  And return the car with a full tank, as the rental companies calculate fuel at about 4.5 euros per liter. </p><p>  At Hertz, when choosing an economy class car, they can give out a Nissan Micra 2018 car with a good multimedia system, including navigation.  Fuel consumption is an average of 4.8 liters per hundred kilometers, which is extremely important when traveling in Europe.  The average cost of gasoline is 1.5 euros per liter. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  In the city of Amsterdam you can easily and easily get around by car.  But not very cheap parking rates.  The center is completely free of parking!  For this, the authorities organized convenient intercepting parking P + R (park and ride) on the outskirts of the city.  You leave the car in one of 7 parking lots and go to the center by tram or bus.  The main thing when traveling to the center and back is to make CheckInn / CheckOut a ticket when boarding and leaving the transport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amsterdam.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="park and ride Amsterdam" class="if uuid-2557125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93836/2557125.jpg"></div><p>  From Brussels to Amsterdam the distance by car is covered in 2.5 hours.  This is about 215 kilometers, taking into account the absence of traffic jams, of which there are more in Brussels than in Moscow.  In this regard, consider the time of departure from the city and do not plan on morning and evening rush hours.  It is also better to make a couple of three stops in wonderful cities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Route </h2><p>  When planning a route from Amsterdam to Brussels by car, you have the opportunity to freely choose interesting places, as well as cities, where you can make both short and long stops to go shopping and take pictures of the sights. </p><p>  You can create your own tour Amsterdam - Brussels by car through the cities: Amsterdam - The Hague - Rotterdam - Breda - Antwerp - Mechelen - Brussels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": djedj, "><img itemprop="image" alt="shops and attractions" class="if uuid-2557836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93836/2557836.jpg"></div><h2>  Track </h2><p>  The E19 and A27 routes through which you go are in excellent condition.  They are clean, easy to read markings, road signs and signs.  In addition, these routes are free.  There is only one paid site through the Liefkenshoek Tunnel, next to Antwerp.

For cash payment you should go to the mini market, which is located at the gas station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": ElasticComputeFarm, "><img itemprop="image" alt="gas station" class="if uuid-2557867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93836/2557867.jpg"></div><p>  We will dwell in more detail on several cities from the list above. </p><h2>  Antwerp </h2><p>  Halfway there will be a port city, the diamond capital of the world - Antwerp.
