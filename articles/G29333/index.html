However, these findings were not based on scientific knowledge and were purely guesswork.  In the Middle Ages, the development of this teaching was stagnant.  This was due to the dominance of religious dogmas and scholasticism.  So, in the Christian world for a long time the creationist point of view was in the lead.  Despite this, some scientists expressed their opinion about the existence of monsters, as evidenced by the finds of fossil remains.

    <p>  In the process of accumulating facts in the 18th century, a new direction appeared - transformism, in the framework of which the variability of species was studied.  Representatives of the teachings were such scientists as J. Buffoni, E. Darwin, E. Geoffrey Saint-Illervo.  Their evolutionary doctrine in the form of evidence had two facts: the presence of transitional interspecific forms, the similarity of the structure of animals and plants in the same group.  However, none of these figures spoke about the reasons for the changes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And only in 1809 did the evolutionary teachings of Lamarck appear, which was </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The evolutionary teachings of Lamarck" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/31244.jpg" width="220"></div>  reflected in the book "Philosophy of Zoology."  Here for the first time the question was raised about the causes of changes in species.  He believed that species themselves were changing due to the changing environment.  Moreover, he introduced gradations, i.e.  transitions from lower to higher forms.  This evolutionary development, according to Lamarck, is inherent in all living things and proceeds from the pursuit of perfection.

    <p>  Observations of the natural world led him to two main points, which are reflected in the law of "non-exercise - exercise."  According to him, organs develop as they are used, after which there was an ‚Äúinheritance of favorable properties‚Äù, i.e.  favorable signs passed from generation to generation, and subsequently either their development continued or they disappeared.  However, Lamarck‚Äôs work was not appreciated in the scientific world until the publication of the book by C. Darwin ‚ÄúOn the Origin of Species‚Äù.  The arguments presented in it in favor of <span>evolutionary development</span> made it very popular.  However, this scientist was a supporter of the heritability of acquired characters.  However, the contradictions found were so serious that they contributed to the revival of Lamarckism as Neolamarckism. </p>

(STE).  It does not have a clear date of origin and a specific author and is a collective work of scientists.  Despite the fact that the authors had a lot of divergences of views, some provisions were not in doubt: the <span>elementary unit of evolution</span> is represented by a local population;  material for evolutionary development is recombination and mutational variation;  the main reason for the development of adaptations is natural selection;  neutral traits are formed due to <span>gene drift</span> and some other positions.

    <p>  Currently, a large number of scientists use the concept of "modern evolutionary theory."  It does not require a single <span>concept of evolution,</span> and at the same time its main achievement is the fact in which saltation changes alternate with gradual ones. </p>
