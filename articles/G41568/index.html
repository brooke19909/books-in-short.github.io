Many cities and villages are far from railway lines.  In this case, you can get to these places by taxi or by bus.  The first option can not afford everyone, so the most common - the second.  Buses depart from the <span>bus station,</span> which is a complex of facilities designed to serve passengers.  One of the largest is considered to be the Shchelkovsky bus station in Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bus station" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/347697.jpg" width="600"></div>

Over the course of its work, the building has been repeatedly updated and repaired, as the bus station management tries to create the most comfortable conditions for passengers to stay.  So, in 2008, <span>the lighting system</span> was completely replaced by a more modern and new one.  In the building of the bus station is a waiting room, cafe, office space.  Luggage storage is also available.  In addition to the main building, there are platforms, as well as access to them.  After replacing the lighting, the waiting room, aprons, as well as the surrounding area are illuminated by LED lights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Schelkovsky bus station schedule" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/347700.jpg?1393964358684" width="600"></div>
