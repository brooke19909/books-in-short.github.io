The main condition is the availability of the required number of players.

    <h2>  Game features </h2><p>  "Fool" is the game that is most popular in the countries of the disintegrated USSR.  This is a fascinating entertainment that requires good memory, logical thinking and the ability to build the right tactics, strategy.  Its essence lies in the fact that a deck with 36 cards is used. </p><p>  Of course, you can also play 52 cards without using jokers.  In this case, the number of participants may be eight people.  When a deck of 36 cards is used, they are arranged in the following order: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, B, D, K, and T. Otherwise, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are still added to them. </p><h2>  "Fool" flip </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fool flip game" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/444514.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  ‚ÄúFool‚Äù is a game in which seniority of suits is not provided.  Its essence is that each player is dealt 6 cards.  It is mandatory to set the trump card of this game (of a certain suit).  It is important that this card is visible throughout the round.  Therefore, after distribution, the entire deck is placed on top of the trump card.  It is possible that this card will be an ace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The game "stupid fool" has the main goal - to get rid of all the cards.  One who could not do this is declared a loser.  Accordingly, he is called a fool.  A draw is not excluded, which is possible if one player fights off the move of another and as a result there are no more cards left.  It is worth noting that this option must be negotiated.  Some players find that a draw is not possible.  So the last one to fight back is the loser. </p><h2>  Rules of the game </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="game cards fool" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/444515.jpg" width="425"></div></h2><p>  "Fool" is a game that is considered one of the simplest, not requiring specific skills.  Any person can take part in it.  There are no restrictions, but randomness can affect the outcome of the game. </p><p>  The rules of the game should be explained only when the participants have decided which kind of "Fool" they like.  In fact, there are two options for this entertainment.  The first is a "fool" thrown;  the second is transferable. </p><p>  At the beginning of the game, you must shuffle the cards and deal them one at a time to each participant.  In the case when all the players are involved (that is, 8 people at the table), it is necessary to establish a trump card.  It will help determine the last card in the deck.  The game begins with the person who holds the trump card of the least value.  It is necessary to go strictly clockwise, and the second game begins with the one who lost, that is, with the "fool".  This tradition is popularly called ‚Äútraining,‚Äù but another combination can be agreed upon.  You can walk "from under the fool."  It is worth noting that when a player has beaten all the cards, they are removed in a separate pile called ‚Äúhang up‚Äù.  If this was not possible, the participant must take everything for himself.  It is important to know that a person cannot draw more than six cards. </p><p>  Thus, ‚ÄúFool‚Äù is a fairly simple and interesting game. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fool game" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/444512.jpg" width="526"></div>
