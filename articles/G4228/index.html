  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is sodium bisulfate?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sodium hydrosulfate is an <span>acid salt of</span> sodium and sulfuric acid.  This substance is designated by the formula NaHSO4.  Sodium hydrosulfate is a transparent crystals that do not have a specific odor.  The molar mass of this substance is 120.06 grams per mole, and its density is 2.472 grams per centimeter cubic.  It melts at a temperature of +186 ¬∞ C.  When a substance is heated, two polymorphic transitions can be observed - at a temperature of +140 ¬∞ C and +170 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  Sodium hydrosulfate can interact with alkalis, passing during the reaction to sulfate.  So, when it interacts with <span>sodium hydroxide, sodium</span> sulfate and water are formed.  With strong heating of this substance (up to +250 ¬∞  and more), it splits into sodium pyrosulfate and water. </p><p>  In the normal state, sodium hydrosulfate does not react with other substances, however, when sintering at temperatures above +450 ¬∞ C, it is able to interact with salts and oxides. </p><p>  The practical value of this substance is great: it is used in non-ferrous metallurgy (as a flux), it also acts as a reagent in the conversion of oxides to sulfates.  It is a strong denaturator.  It is widely used in cooking (officially registered as a food supplement E514). </p><p>  However, despite all its importance in human life, sodium hydrosulfate can be dangerous: being a strong alkali, this substance is very corrosive, and if it comes into contact with the skin, it can leave severe burns, causing considerable damage to the eye mucosa.  The greatest danger is its entry into the gastrointestinal tract.  Inhalation of substance vapor is also extremely harmful. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the negative effect of sodium hydrosulfate on the human body, this substance is marked with the international symbol ‚ÄúDanger‚Äù, which is an orange square, cut by two diagonal <span>black stripes.</span>  This sign indicates the danger of the substance not only for humans, but also for the environment, as well as the restrictions imposed on its production. </p><p>  To obtain sodium hydrosulfate, it is necessary to conduct a reaction between concentrated sulfuric acid and <span>sodium hydroxide,</span> and sulfuric acid should be in excess.  As a result of this reaction, sodium hydrogen sulfate and water are formed. </p><p>  However, before undertaking to obtain this substance, you need to get sodium itself.  Obtaining sodium is not a very complicated procedure, and some of the methods are possible even at home. </p><p>  One of the earliest methods for producing sodium is the reduction reaction <span>of sodium carbonate</span> (Na2CO3) with coal at high temperature (about +1000 ¬∞ C).  Its result was the production of pure sodium and the release of carbon monoxide.  Carrying out this reaction was not too laborious, but due to the release of carbon monoxide it became very dangerous. </p><p>  Therefore, another method for its preparation was invented - electrolysis of molten <span>sodium chloride.</span>  The advantage of this method is not only its relative safety, but also lower than during recovery, the heating temperature of the substance: +600 ¬∞ C instead of +1000 ¬∞ C.  This method can be used at home - if, of course, there is the possibility of heating sodium chloride (ordinary table salt) to a specified temperature. </p><p>  Based on sodium - the most chemically active element of the periodic table - a substance is obtained that is related to sodium hydrogen sulfate and is no less important for humanity.  This substance is sodium hydrosulfide, an acid salt of hydrogen sulfide and sodium.  Represents white crystals, is designated by the formula NaHS.  It is obtained by passing hydrogen sulfide through a solution of sodium sulfide, as well as by passing hydrogen sulfide through a solution of sodium hydroxide. </p><p>  Sodium hydrosulfide reacts with alkalis and acids, is easily oxidized by oxygen.  When melted, it turns black.  It is used quite widely: it is part of the product used to remove excess layers of the skin, is common in the textile industry, and is used as a raw material for the production of many dyes, butyphos. </p>
