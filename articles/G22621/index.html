Top Royal Star Hotel 4 * called an optimistic hotel, located near the cemetery.  A feature of the institution is its location in the immediate vicinity of the cemetery and the complex of funeral services, including a morgue, etc. But, as the authors of the reviews note, not a single hotel room faces this sad place, so only the most zealous Feng Shui adherents can feel some discomfort here. .  The hotel is located quite far from the beach, guests say, but relatively close to shops and the bus station. </li><li>  <em>Excursions.</em>  There is a gathering place for excursion trips nearby.  Employees of the travel agency "Anex Tour" provide all the information (in English) about bus routes to Sitges, Figueres, etc. Vacationers highly appreciate this service. </li><li>  <em>Nutrition.</em>  Many speak positively about the food provided at the hotel.  The guests especially like melons, pineapples and watermelons, as well as snacks (fudge, marmalade, nuts and chips) and desserts.  Portioned ice cream of 3 varieties is served during breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Wine for lunch or dinner can be bought in bottles and left in the wine refrigerator for several days if it is not drunk immediately.  The bartender will hang a tag with the guest number on the unfinished bottle and put it until the next time in the wine cabinet, where no one will touch it.  For breakfast, according to guests, they cook a variety of smoothies made from various ingredients, including celery and green fresh cucumbers.  The food at the hotel, according to vacationers, is very plentiful.  Breakfasts are quite monotonous, lunches and dinners, on the contrary, are distinguished by an extraordinary wealth of assortment. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  <em>About entertainment.</em>  According to vacationers, the hotel in March looks like a pension for pensioners.  At this time of year, for youth, entertainment is absent both in the hotel and in Lloret in general.  Entertainment programs during this period are defined by reviewers as suitable for older people rather than youth. </li><li>  <em>SPA</em>  Residents are pleased to respond to the services of the spa complex, which is located on the ground floor and is equipped with several changing rooms with toilets and sound showers.  The indoor pool, warm enough, roomy and shallow, can be used for free.  Sauna and steam room can be used after payment (6 euros for half an hour stay for an adult).  You should pre-register at the reception, where they issue a magnetic card, with which opens the door to the compartment with a steam room and a sauna.  Tourists say that sometimes, taking advantage of the fact that often the children loosely close the door to the magnetic lock, other guests go there.  Pretending they do not understand English, they can soar at someone else's expense until they are expelled.  Magnetic cards in the spa, according to many tourists, are not very convenient.  Often they jam or demagnetize, causing the door to jam. </li><li>  <em>The rooms.</em>  The guestrooms are ordinary standard rooms with a balcony.  The audibility in them is very good, the residents are sharing, therefore, those who are not lucky with noisy neighbors will be lucky.  Room cleaning, according to guests, as well as towels are changed daily, without reminders.  A significant drawback of the stay is the presence of uncomfortable mattresses in the rooms. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="h top royal star hotel 4 food" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/1999026.jpg" width="365"></div></h2><ul><li>  <em>The Internet.</em>  Wi-fi in this hotel is paid, its cost is 5 euros per day.  You can use the Internet for free for 15 minutes a day.  Guests are mostly dissatisfied with his work, they advise that it is better to buy a SIM card, which will be cheaper. </li><li>  <em>Terms of stay</em> .  Upon arrival, the hotel guests say, the city tax will be charged: up to 1 euro per person per day.  She will not be returned back.  The hotel staff does not speak and do not understand Russian.  Communication is possible in English. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In general, guests are satisfied with their stay at this hotel.  The vacationers include the convenient location of the institution, the cleanliness, high quality of the food provided, the friendliness of the staff.
