    <h2>  What is the legend of Hersonissos? </h2><p>  This town is one of the oldest on the island of Crete.  By the way, he, and not the current capital of Heraklion, is the tourist capital of the island.  It received its name in honor of one of the Greek peninsulas.  The natural landscapes of these places are amazing: along the edge of the coastline, the bizarre rocks of Lasithi, on which the waves of the Aegean Sea are broken, rise.  Here and there are exotic bushes full of bright and unusual flowers, the air is filled with many pleasant floral-fruity aromas, which add a special twist to the brackish smell of the sea.  The wonderful Mediterranean climate pleases tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The first settlements in the Hersonissos region date back to the 2nd millennium BC.  e.  They say that it was here that the Minoan civilization was born.  During archaeological research, traces of the Minoan settlement were discovered.  It was located in the Anissaras beach area, where Mitsis Serita Beach 5 * Anissaras is now located.  The two resorts are only 5 km away. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to the island either by air or by water, however, most Russian tourists prefer the latter.  Regular or charter flights depart from Moscow and St. Petersburg and other large cities of Russia to Crete, the number of which increases during the summer holidays.  The international airport is located in Heraklion.  Therefore, if you bought a tour to the Mitsis Serita Beach <span>5 *</span> hotel <span>(Crete / Hersonissos / Anissaras),</span> then you need to buy tickets to Heraklion, and from there by road (by taxi, bus or rented car) to get to your destination.  By the way, the most ideal of the above is a car rental.  It can be useful to you during the whole rest.  If you have international rights and enough money to rent (about 30 euros per day), then without hesitation, choose this option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mitsis serita beach 5 anissaras" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/532305.jpg" width="295"></div>  Staying at Mitsis Serita Beach 5 * (Anissaras), you can by car make independent excursions to the countless sights of the island.  If car rental is unacceptable, you can include transfer services in your tour package.  In this case, the travel agency employee will be waiting for you at the airport, who will comfortably deliver the guest to the territory of the Mitsis Serita Beach 5 * hotel.  The distance between the capital and Anissaras is 20 kilometers.  Taxi services cost about 50 euros, and a bus costs 3.5 euros.

    <h2>  Children's entertainment </h2><p>  In Greece, children are especially reverent.  The staff wants to provide them with maximum comfort.  For the kids in this wonderful hotel, there are as many as two swimming pools, there are water slides, swings, sandboxes, slot machines, children's animation throughout the day and much more.  You can use the babysitting service at any time. </p><h2>  Compliments </h2><p>  Another nice point in the concept of the hotel are compliments.  They are made to the newlyweds on the first day of arrival in the room (you need to submit a marriage certificate), as well as birthday people. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Unfortunately, Mitsis Serita Beach cannot boast of its own beach, as it is rocky and unable to provide safe access to the sea.  Despite this, there are many water and beach activities.  Especially popular in Crete are diving and snorkeling.  Umbrellas and mattresses are provided free of charge to guests of the hotel in question, however, many tourists prefer to use municipal sandy beaches, in which the above inventory will need to be rented. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The city of Anissaras is an open-air monument.  It was here that about 2000 years ago there was the oldest Minoan settlement.  This is evidenced by unique archaeological sites.  Staying at the Mitsys Hotel, tourists can sign up for many interesting excursions.  However, you can make an exciting and informative trip on your own, of course, if you rent a car.  How can one not visit the Palace of Knossos and inspect the ruins of the legendary Labyrinth, from which Theseus managed to take away his savior Ariadne? </p><h2>  Mitsis Serita Beach 5 *: reviews are positive and not very </h2><p>  In principle, the guests of the Mitsis Serita are satisfied with the friendly staff, excellent service and concierge service.  Of course, they sometimes have some complaints, but this does not apply to the hotel itself, but to the beach.  The hotel administration, fully aware of this drawback, found an alternative solution by filling the huge pools with purified sea water.  Swimming in such a tank is a pleasure.  By the way, many Europeans prefer to relax at the pool rather than at sea. </p>
