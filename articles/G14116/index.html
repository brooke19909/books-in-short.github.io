    <h2>  Legends about these places </h2><p>  According to legend, Ermak knew that the small Tatar town of Abalak should become the dwelling of God.  In 1585, the squad of the Cossack chieftain defeated the Tatar army near this settlement.  On the same day, Nicholas the Wonderworker appeared to Yermaku and announced that this place was holy.  Information about this event is recorded in the Siberian Chronicle.  The eighties of the XVI century is considered to be the beginning of the development of spirituality here. </p><p>  Another legend says that in 1636 the Virgin Mary appeared to a resident of the settlement (poor widow of Mary).  She said that a church dedicated to the Icon of the Sign of the Blessed Virgin Mary should be erected here.  And on different sides of it two more churches will appear - the Monk Mary of Egypt and St. Nicholas.  The widow told about the sighted Tobolsk archbishop Nektarii, he gave a blessing for the construction, and soon work began to boil in these places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Church erection </h2><p>  In the same year, the Znamenskaya Church was erected on the territory of Abalak.  However, after 44 years, the shrine burned down.  And in 1683, Tsar <span>Fedor Alekseevich</span> issued a decree - to build a stone temple here.  The new cathedral with four pillars and five domes was consecrated in 1691.  By the way, this unique example of Russian architectural art is recognized as one of the most distinctive monuments.  A model for him was one of the churches of Moscow. </p><p>  In the early fifties of the XVIII century, the church was partially rebuilt.  The pillars and five domes of the temple were removed, the top was brought down under one large dome.  The changes also affected the premises: an apse appeared on the east side, and a narthex on the west side.  Immediately after the changes, the church was consecrated again. </p><p>  At the same time, on the right side, the architects erected the church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  And in 1952, the construction of the church of St. Mary of Egypt began.  That is, a large temple complex on this territory appeared long before the establishment of the Holy Znamensky Abalaksky monastery here. </p>

    <h2>  The appearance of the monastery </h2><p>  By decree of Empress Catherine II in 1783, <span>a monastery was</span> established in the Abalak parish <span>.</span>  The question arose: where did the monks come from?  The novices of the Epiphany monastery located in the <span>Perm province</span> decided to go to these places <span>.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For some time there was no fence around the Abalak Monastery.  It was erected only at the beginning of the XIX century.  At that time, a large construction site continued: a fraternal corps, numerous utility rooms and, of course, a bishop's house appeared on the territory of the complex.  The construction of the monastery hotel was completed.  It was built on the donations of the widow of General Zryakhov.  It ended in 1904. </p><p>  At the beginning of the last century, 22 monks from the <span>Valaam monastery</span> transferred to the Abalak monastery of Tobolsk <span>.</span>  They arrived at a new place with Hieromonk Anthony.  By the way, among them was Archimandrite Arkady Gusev, whose fate is very sad.  In 1923, he resisted the seizure of church shrines, was imprisoned and executed in 1937. </p><h2>  The spiritual center of Siberia </h2><p>  The Abalak complex is an amazing place.  For a long time it was a place of pilgrimage.  They came here to bow to the miraculous icons. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the Znamensky Abalak Monastery is one of the main spiritual centers of Siberia.  Historians say that in 1918 the whole family of the last ruler of the Russian Empire visited here.  Those in Tobolsk exile, Nikolai II, his wife Empress Alexandra, children Olga, Tatyana, Maria, Anastasia and Alexei prayed within the walls of this complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Many researchers associate this place with another significant historical figure - Grigory Rasputin.  Information has survived to our times that during his last visit to the city of Tobolsk, he defended his service in this quiet monastery. </p><h2>  Educational activities </h2><p>  In tsarist times, clergymen conducted active educational activities.  Especially for the foreigners of Western Siberia, a school operated at the Abalak Monastery.  Here the children of Mansi, Khanty and Tatars learned to read and write.  The monks taught children and crafts that could be useful in adulthood. </p><p>  By the way, these traditions are sacredly honored here today: the monks are involved in social activities, help drug addicts who visit the monastery in the hope of healing.  The novices correspond with the prisoners, helping them to strengthen themselves spiritually.  And during school holidays, the Abalaksky monastery in Tobolsk accepts difficult teenagers: three times a year the Chance camp opens here. </p>

    <h2>  Monastery and revolution </h2><p>  Seven years after the October Revolution, the monastery was closed, and the monks were repressed.  In Soviet times, a forge, a garage, a house of culture and a boarding school for children were located on this territory.  Later, a transfer camp for the People‚Äôs Commissariat of Internal Affairs was opened here. </p><p>  It was after this that a chapel appeared on the territory of the temple complex, the dungeon of which is terrifying.  On the left side of the basement are marble tombs, covered with lids with small windows.  If you look through these windows, you can see dozens of skulls, including children's ones.  All of them were discovered during restoration work.  But the worst thing is not the number of remains, but their condition: on a significant part of the skulls you can see terrible wounds. </p><h2>  The return of the monastery </h2><p>  The procedure for returning the Abalaksky monastery to the canopy of the Orthodox Church began in 1989.  Then he was in a deplorable state: temples and monastery buildings were almost destroyed, and all the remaining church shrines and household items were looted.  In the early nineties, the entire architectural ensemble was transferred to the Tobolsk-Tyumen diocese.  The complete restoration of the Abalak monastery was completed only in 2007.  Then crosses and domes were erected here, consecrated. </p>
