Many continue to support it, annually creating cozy and warm slippers, boots, shales and even high boots for themselves and their loved ones. </p><p>  There are several popular ways of making such shoes, which have almost become classics of the genre, but restless designers and craftsmen continue to delight knitters with new developments.  One of them is crocheted hexagons.  The scheme for creating motives and their assembly is proposed in this article.  Examples of the distribution of colored yarn and model modifications are also provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hexagons crochet patterns and description" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1457267.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Materials for knitting slippers </h2><p>  In addition to the obvious advantages (originality of finished products, cost savings, realization of creative potential), making shoes for home is also useful because it allows you to recycle the remains of multi-colored and variegated yarn.  As a rule, most of the craftswomen sooner or later discover that they have accumulated a huge number of skeins, glomeruli and coils.  Usually, such a yarn has not only a different color, but also a composition, and even a thickness.  Crochet a hexagon pattern is great for linking all these strings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Color can be changed in almost every row or come up with a different system.  If there are many small colored glomeruli and one unnecessary skein, then the midpoints of the hexagons are made variegated, and the last two rows of each motif and the binding of slippers are knitted with the main color.  By the way, in the case when it is not possible to clearly distribute the remaining yarn for knitting the right amount of identical fragments, it is possible to make completely different hexagons.  The main thing is that the colors are combined with each other, and the binding was made with a thread of the darkest color. </p><p>  Adherents of the classic style and calm shades will like monochromatic crocheted boots made of hexagons (the motif scheme can be almost any). </p><h2>  What to use for the manufacture of soles </h2><p>  Various types of dense fabrics serve as a basis for indoor shoes.  However, the most durable is natural and artificial leather.  These materials have elasticity, so the sole will be comfortable, and not "wooden".  As a rule, leather elements do not wear out for several years, however, it will be necessary to make sure that the upper part of the product is sewn stronger to the lower.  On the inside of the slippers, stitch or glue a layer of some natural and warm fabric: fleece, flannel or batting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hexagon slippers crochet pattern" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1457269.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why felt </h2><p>  Felt insoles are often used as an alternative, they also serve for a long time and at the same time are significantly cheaper than leather.  Among their advantages are the following: </p><ul><li>  They are easy to find and buy. </li><li>  Felt is easy to pierce with any needle, so it‚Äôs easier to work with. </li><li>  It does not require the placement of a lining inside the product, as it is quite warm in itself. </li></ul><p>  If the craftswoman has stockpiled flaps of canvas or furniture fabric, she may well use them.  Some publications offer patterns for knitting soles from yarn.  However, it should be borne in mind that the life of such slippers will be short-lived: they will wipe in just a few weeks. </p><h2>  Simple crochet hexagons: diagrams and description </h2><p>  Consider the principle of manufacturing a dense hexagonal motif.  You need to start with a chain of 3-4 air loops (VP), like any circular knitting.  It is more convenient for some craftswomen to make a loop of thread as an initial stage.  In fact, there is no big difference in how the center will look, the main thing is that it be neat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hexagon crochet boots" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1457268.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  1st row: 3VP (this is the beginning of each row), 1 double crochet (CCH), * 1 VP, 2 CCH * (repeat 5 times), 1 VP. </p><p>  2nd row: 3 VP, 1 CCH, 1 CCH under the arch from the VP of the previous row, * 1 VP, 1 CCH in the arch, 2 CCH, 1 CCH in the arch * (repeat 4 times), 1 VP, 1 CCH in the arch . </p><p>  This is the whole description of knitting a hexagon, since then you only need to continue to expand the motive.  An attentive knitter will notice that the formation of new CCH occurs when 1 CCH, 1 VP and 1 more CCH are knitted into one arch (from 1 VP). </p><p>  In the same places angles of motive are formed.  When changing colors, the stripes will repeat the outline of the figure.  Crochet a hexagon can be openwork. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hexagon crochet pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1457264.jpg" width="406"></div>

    <p>  Here a slightly different principle of expansion of the canvas is used: first, a round element is knitted, and in the last row six angles are formed. </p><h2>  Crochet a hexagon: knitting and connecting motifs </h2><p>  The following figure shows the openwork hexagons, the shape of which is formed from the second row. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet hexagon patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1457266.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <p>  This is due to the fact that at six points between the "bushes" (the main element of the motive connected by the CCH), not one, but three air loops are performed.  In the next row, not one, but two "bushes" are knitted into this arch.  The described algorithm is repeated until the fragment reaches the desired size.  This crochet hexagon pattern is best for working with colored threads. </p><p>  To connect the individual elements into a single web, several methods can be used: </p><ul><li>  Sew with a needle. </li><li>  Knit one row of RLS, capturing the edges of two parts (the seam will be voluminous and stiff). </li><li>  To connect an additional row of VP and RLS, picking up the loops of two hexagons. </li></ul><p>  The first two methods are quite simple, but the third will be more clear after studying the instructions.  Start with 1 sc, which is knitted in the last row of one of the elements (in the corner), then, without tearing the threads, go to the corner of the second part and also perform sc.  After 3 VP, start a hook under the VP of one and the second part and knit 1 sc.  Next also follow 3 VPs, the algorithm is repeated. </p><p>  The resulting seam comes out smooth, completely loose and flat.  Often it is performed with a thread of the background color, so a peculiar frame forms between the motives. </p><h2>  How many hexagons will be needed for slippers and boots </h2><p>  The photograph shows that ordinary slippers consist of three motifs: one serves as the toe of the product, and the other two form the heel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hexagon slippers crochet pattern" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1457265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To assemble short boots, you need more parts.  In addition to the main three hexagons, you will need to connect two more for the leg.  If desired, you can raise the boots to any height: each level will consist of two new parts. </p><p>  Before you start crocheting a hexagon (patterns may be different), it is worth considering the thickness of the yarn.  If it is small, then the number of motives will increase. </p>
