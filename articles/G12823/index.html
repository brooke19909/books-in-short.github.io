  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony Xperia XZ1: reviews, reviews, specs, and ease of use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is unlikely that there is at least one person who has not used Sony equipment.  Its assortment includes televisions, headphones, music players, speakers and much more.  Of course, the niche of smartphones also did not go unnoticed.  To date, the company produces modern gadgets that can compete with some flagships.  That is what the Sony Xperia XZ1 smartphone has become.  Reviews about him, however, are not only positive.  The fact is that the manufacturer consciously does not follow fashion trends.  His smartphones do not use frameless technology.  But it is she who is now at the peak of popularity.  But this has its own plus - all gadgets are presented in an exclusive design.  They can not be called a copy of the "apple" products, which, undoubtedly, like most buyers. </p><p>  So, it's time to move on to the main thing.  Let's get acquainted with the characteristics of the smartphone Sony Xperia XZ1, reviews and features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ringkestore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia xz1 compact reviews" class="if uuid-2840434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2840434.jpg"></div><h2>  Xperia XZ1 line </h2><p>  Under this name, two models are presented.  Conventionally, they can be called "senior" and "younger".  The latter includes a device with a Compact index.  And the ‚Äúsenior‚Äù in the line is the Sony Xperia XZ1 (G8342) Black smartphone.  Expert reviews show that both of these gadgets are worthy of customer attention.  For example, the model has excellent characteristics, but it has compact dimensions.  It is ideal for those who do not like big "shovels."  But the "senior" device can safely be called the flagship.  It implements: a large screen with high resolution, support for LTE networks, a powerful processor, an excellent camera with the ability to shoot in 4K.  And this is not all that this model can interest a modern user.  More details about the features below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Since the owners of Sony Xperia XZ1 in reviews often discuss a set of components, this is where we start our review.  Choosing packaging, the manufacturer chose a sleek design.  And this, of course, is not a minus.  Many buyers believe that a bright design is needed only when the gadget cannot interest a potential buyer with the ‚Äúfilling."  The name of the ruler flaunts on the front panel.  Below, in smaller letters, the brand of the company is printed - Sony.  The full name is available only on the side face.  It was decided to refuse any pictures and photos of the smartphone.  The box is pretty simple.  The background color is white.  On it clearly marked all the inscriptions. </p><p>  Having removed the packaging cover, you can see the Sony Xperia XZ1 itself.  In the reviews, the owners pay attention to the fact that the set of components is more than modest.  The box contains only the power adapter and cable, which is both part of the charger and a means of connecting to a PC.  Documentation is also provided.  It includes: warranty card, certificate and user manual.  There are no additional elements such as a screen film, a cover is not included.  They will have to be purchased separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia xz1 dual reviews" class="if uuid-2840435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2840435.jpg"></div><h2>  Dimensions and features of the case </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (we will review the owners' reviews later) differs in size from the model with the G8342 index.  The "younger" device is designed for that category of customers who prefer small, but productive smartphones.  In a small housing by modern standards, the manufacturer was able to place a very competitive "filling".  However, about this a little later, and now we will pay attention to the size.  So, in the Xperia XZ1 Compact, the case height reaches 129 mm.  Moreover, its width is only 65 mm.  Special attention should be paid to the thickness.  This indicator (9.3 mm), although not minimal, is optimally selected, so that the phone does not look bulky.  But there are prerequisites for this.  The reviews of the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (G8441) focuses on the rather angular shape of the case, in which there is not even a hint of roundness.  These phones look a little rude, but this does not apply to the Xperia XZ1.  Many users find the design of this model rigorous, which is great for respectable people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.skinomi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia xz1 compact g8441 reviews" class="if uuid-2840443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2840443.jpg"></div><p>  As for the Xperia XZ1 G8342, the dimensions of this phone can be safely called standard.  With a length of 148 mm, the width of the hull was 73 mm.  There is no discomfort during operation.  It is convenient to hold the smartphone.  An adult can control the phone with the fingers of one hand.  Such sensations also arise due to the rather small thickness.  If in the compact model this indicator reaches almost 10 mm, then in the ‚Äúolder‚Äù one it does not exceed 8 mm (7.9 mm).  According to this criterion, the Xperia XZ1 G8342 has a definite advantage over the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact smartphone, user reviews confirm this.  However, the increased thickness in the "younger" model is quite justified.  This was a necessary measure, since in terms of equipment it is practically not inferior to the "older" one. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  A few words about the features of the case have already been said, now let's pay attention to the design.  Most comments say the phone looks unusual.  It shows the style.  And this is definitely a plus, since at present most of the gadgets on the market are copies of the "apple" flagships.  According to this criterion, Sony has remained true to its traditions, even slightly to the detriment of modern trends.  Thanks to this, smartphones look original and unusual and at the same time are not without appeal.  It is worth noting that not everyone likes the angular style that is used in the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (G8441) smartphone.  User reviews vary.  Some praise the manufacturer for their individuality, while others want to see changes that are consistent with modern fashion.  As they say, how many people have so many opinions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Considering the design of the model, it is worth highlighting several features.  The first thing that catches your eye - two speaker holes.  They are displayed symmetrically on the front panel - above and below the screen.  Near the top speakers there is an ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the selfie camera, an indicator and sensors.  Users also enthusiastically accepted that the fingerprint scanner is mounted in the lock button.  It is located in the middle of the lateral face on the right side.  Below it, a standalone camera control key is displayed.  On the one hand, this is an advantage, since you can take pictures even when the screen is locked.  But some reviews of the Sony Xperia XZ1 Dual sound and comments.  The fact is that the place chosen for her is not the best.  Owners say that during interaction with the gadget they constantly touch it. </p><p>  The design of the rear panel also has features.  The first thing that many people pay attention to is the lack of plastic inserts and characteristic grooves.  The fact is that the back cover of the Xperia XZ1 G8342 is made of a single sheet of aluminum.  The surface itself is matte and quite pleasant to the touch.  Many users have a question: ‚ÄúHow do antennas work?‚Äù  Everything is very simple.  The antenna of the NFC module is hidden behind a glass cover, on which there is also a flash.  This decision is definitely a win.  And the usual grooves that most devices have are also present in this gadget, however, they are hidden on the side faces.  Plastic plates are located only on the upper and lower ends.  The rest of the case is made of metal. </p><p>  Speaking of design, we need to talk about color solutions.  In the lineup, the manufacturer presented four options.  Romantic natures will love the pink.  It looks original blue and silver.  But black is definitely designed for stylish men. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iglaz.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony xperia xz1 64gb reviews" class="if uuid-2840436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2840436.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews and screen specifications </h2><p>  The indisputable advantage of the smartphone Sony Xperia XZ1 Dual (reviews confirm this) is that Gorilla Glass 5 (2.5D) completely covers the front panel.  The characteristics of this glass guarantee no scratches during interaction.  Many users claim that there is no need to use a protective film. </p><p>  As for the characteristics, they will impress even the most demanding customer.  In the "older" model, the screen size reaches 5.2 inches.  A slightly smaller display (4.6 inches) in the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact.  The feedback on these two screens is positive.  The latter is inferior not only in size but also in resolution.  Unlike the ‚Äúolder‚Äù (1920 √ó 1080 px), its maximum reaches only 1280 √ó 720 px.  Pixel density also varies.  In the compact model, it is 319 ppi, and in the full Xperia XZ1 - 423 ppi. </p><p>  IPS-matrix provides high-quality image, wide viewing angles.  Smartphones have a decent range of brightness.  You can adjust it either manually or automatically due to the presence of sensors. </p><p>  The manufacturer did not forget about multitouch technology.  The screen is capable of simultaneously distinguishing up to ten touches.  In the reviews, the owners identified one important advantage - the phone can be controlled even with gloves on.  Color rendering is somewhat oversaturated - red shades prevail. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The Sony Xperia XZ1 gets only positive reviews when it comes to performance.  Both the ‚Äúsenior‚Äù and ‚Äújunior‚Äù models run on a powerful processor Qualcomm brand.  Smartphones are equipped with the Snapdragon 835 chip. It copes with the tasks set perfectly.  The devices are fast.  The system works without freezes and crashes.  Such results were achieved due to eight Kryo 280 computing modules, on which the processor is based.  With an increase in load, they are able to accelerate to a frequency of 2450 MHz.  The chipset is manufactured using a 10-nm process technology.  No less productive is the graphics accelerator.  Model Adreno 540 ensures the smooth operation of animated images. </p><p>  Evaluating performance, one cannot but pay attention to memory parameters.  "RAM" in gadgets four gigabytes.  But in the comments, users noticed that only 1.5 GB would be available.  But this is more than enough for a full-fledged work.  As for the built-in, the smartphone Sony Xperia XZ1 - 64 GB.  Reviews show that with such a volume, the need to use a memory card disappears by itself.  In the compact model, storage is a little smaller - 32 GB. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobilezonemoga.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony xperia xz1 black g8342 reviews" class="if uuid-2840438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2840438.jpg"></div><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The models under consideration are equipped with excellent cameras.  The main used 19-megapixel module.  Its type is IMX400.  There is no need to talk a lot about the quality of shooting, since most smartphone manufacturers install Sony optics in their devices.  The main camera lens is wide-angle (25 mm).  Aperture level f / 2.0.  Due to the fact that the module is equipped with its own memory, you can use the super slow motion mode for shooting.  Focus hybrid, automatic.  It works quickly, without errors.  There is a digital 8x zoom.  Manufacturers did not forget about the stabilization system.  They used their own development SteadyShot. </p><p>  The resolution of the front camera in the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù and ‚Äúolder‚Äù are different.  In the latter, it is more, is 13 megapixels.  Sony Xperia XZ1 reviews say the camera takes quality pictures.  The level of detail and color reproduction at height.  Wide-angle lens (22 mm).  There is no flash, however, there is a stabilization system.  In the "front-end" menu, the use of filters is activated by default.  This is liked by the female half of humanity, as the skin on the face is automatically smoothed, so textures and defects disappear. </p><p>  In the "younger" model, the selfie camera module has a lower resolution.  Its resolution is limited to 8 megapixels with f / 2.0 aperture.  When comparing photographs, the difference is, of course, noticeable.  It manifests itself in color reproduction and sharpness.  However, the pictures taken by the compact model cannot be called substandard.  In the comments, owners rate them fairly high. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dpreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia xz1 compact owner reviews" class="if uuid-2840439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2840439.jpg"></div><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The device runs on the Android operating system of the eighth version.  When shell updates are released, the phone immediately offers to download them.  The interface design is standard for gadgets from Sony.  However, more emphasis was placed on a clean shell, so the company limited itself to installing its own utilities, almost without affecting the appearance. </p><p>  The interface is fast, clear.  The shell is light.  Sony installs only a small number of its own programs, so there is nothing superfluous.  The keyboard on the phone is standard.  The device is connected to Google.  All utilities can be downloaded from his store.  Due to the shell there is a large selection of programs that will work perfectly on this phone. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Most of the discussions and questions were caused by the indicator of autonomy.  Indeed, a rather modest battery is installed in the Sony Xperia XZ1 Dual.  In the reviews, users express doubts about the battery life.  Currently, few devices of the middle segment are equipped with batteries with a capacity of less than 3000 mAh.  However, this manufacturer continues to install 2700 mAh batteries on its smartphones.  However, even with the fact that their capacity does not increase, the life is quite acceptable.  With an average load, you can safely count on 24-hour operation.  These results are achieved through the use of innovative technologies that are designed to save power. </p><p>  So, what numbers do the owners indicate in their comments: </p><ul><li>  In games - 8 hours. </li><li>  Reading mode - 17 hours at low brightness. </li><li>  Video playback - 11 hours. </li></ul><p>  Surprised this unit performance in game mode.  The fact is that when compared with gadgets with more powerful batteries, the Xperia XZ1 is the undisputed leader. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony xperia xz1 dual reviews" class="if uuid-2840441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2840441.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Having described all the features of the Xperia XZ1, let's summarize.  In most comments, users give the gadget high marks.  Of course, not without criticism.  A few comments were made about the design.  However, such assessments are purely individual, as they say, a matter of taste. </p><p>  The advantages in this smartphone are more than enough.  First of all, a productive platform that provides the work of all modern applications.  Also, the owners drew attention to the bright and loud sound reproduced through two speakers located on the front panel.  During operation, they are not covered by hands, so the sound is not muffled.  All mechanical buttons have a clear response, have a soft stroke, which ensures ease of use. </p><p>  The assortment includes devices with one SIM card and two.  The latter are intended only for sale in Russia.  In the hybrid slot, you can install a SIM card and a memory card.  For a compact model, the manufacturer chose only one option - single-character.  The difference in cost between the "senior" and "younger" devices is an average of 10 thousand rubles. </p>
