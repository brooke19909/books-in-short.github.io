Externally, this structure resembles the world famous Taj Mahal.  Therefore, you can safely refuse to travel to Agra and enjoy the beautiful architectural lines in Delhi.  Although it is better to see both. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tomb of humayun" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/844963.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A few common words </h2><p>  In the tourist guides in Delhi, the tomb of Humayun is always mentioned.  This is a prominent architectural monument, in which lies the remains of the great Mughal emperor from the Timurid dynasty.  For the deceased, his wife Hamida Banu Begum ordered the monastery to be built.  The object was built for eight years - from 1562 to 1570, and the architect Mirak Giyathuddin and his son Said Muhammad supervised the work. </p><p>  If you look at the mausoleum, it may seem that it looks like a middle link between the earlier construction of Gur Emir <span>(tomb of Tamerlane)</span> and the later - Taj Mahal.  The Humayun Tomb, a photo of which can be found in our article, is one of the <span>UNESCO World Heritage</span> Sites.  Therefore, she deserves a guest of the Indian capital to give her a little attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Humayun Tomb photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/844964.jpg" width="503"></div>

This is the first mausoleum built in India and surrounded by a garden.  By the way, many tombs of that time stand in the middle of an amazing park with artificial canals and fountains.  This is due to the fact that in Islam it is believed that paradise is located in a large garden, divided by a river.  So the rulers tried to create a little paradise on earth for their ashes. </p><p>  Humayun himself was emperor twice, with a break of fifteen years.  He first took the throne after the death of his father, the founder of the Mughal empire of Babur, and then regained the power taken by Sher Shah and his son.  He began the second reign with the strengthening of the state, which fell apart.  The son of Humayun Akbar the Great, born in exile, became the next monarch and went down in history as a wise reformer.  The death of Humayun himself was premature: going down the <span>marble stairs</span> to the library, he got entangled in the floors of his dressing gown and fell, crashed to death.  It is possible that detractors pushed him, but this version remains only a hypothesis without confirmation or refutation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Humayun tomb how to get" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/844965.jpg" width="393"></div>

A true masterpiece of the <span>Mughal era,</span> it rises to a height of 44 m. The building was erected from red brick and has the shape of an octagon on a wide pedestal.  The top is crowned with a double marble dome of white and black with a crescent moon.  Immediately striking stone <span>lattices on the windows,</span> skillfully carved by masters, graceful columns and arches.  Wealth is fascinating, but a note of sadness is captured in it: after all, this is a grave, and their loved ones were sad for the people who rested here. </p><p>  The tomb, in which not only Khumayun and his wives lie, but also many representatives of the Timurid house, is symmetrically surrounded by lush gardens.  The sarcophagi of the ruler and his harem are located in the central hall of the second floor, others are resting on the ground floor in the rooms.  Also on the territory of the complex there are several smaller tombs, which are inferior to the main mausoleum in beauty and grandeur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Humayun's tomb where is located" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/844966.jpg" width="367"></div>
