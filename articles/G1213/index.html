Photos, prices and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the former USSR there was no person who did not dream of spending a vacation in Abkhazia.  This region attracted nomenclature workers, and Bohemia, and ordinary citizens.  And this is not surprising - the magnificent nature, Caucasian hospitality and the Black Sea coast attracted tourists from all Union republics as if with a magnet. </p><h2>  A little bit about the country </h2><p>  At present, Abkhazia is a separate state, the independence of which is recognized by Russia and several other countries.  It is located on the Black Sea coast, borders on the Russian Federation (the Krasnodar Territory and Georgia).  Small in area, this country is very picturesque - on the one hand it is surrounded by majestic mountain ranges, on the other - the Black Sea coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia hotels" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/467204.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  <span>The climate of Abkhazia</span> depends on the area.  Coastal - mild, the average air temperature is 15 degrees, in the summer the thermometer does not drop below 22. In the mountains, the climate varies depending on the zone - the eternal melting snow lies at an altitude of about 2300 meters. </p><p>  The capital is the city of Sukhum.  The population slightly exceeds 80 thousand people - this is almost a third of all residents of the republic.  In total, there are 8 cities in Abkhazia, which are the centers of the districts, and about 500 villages and towns.  The population, according to 2011, is about 250 thousand people, and this figure tends to gradually decrease.  Abkhazia is famous for the number of centenarians - it occupies a leading position in this indicator throughout the territory of the former USSR. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  The tourism sector is recognized as one of the most important for the development of the regional economy.  This country has a favorable location near the sea, pure nature and magnificent landscapes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gagra abkhazia hotels" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/467205.jpg" width="350"></div>  Most resorts have inherited almost all of the infrastructure since Soviet times - the buildings of boarding houses and sanatoriums were built in the USSR, so many of them need major repairs or reconstruction.  Gradually, the tourism industry is developing - the facilities are being renovated, transport is being developed, and service is being improved.  One of the most hospitable countries is Abkhazia.  Hotels offer tourists a comfortable stay on the Black Sea coast.

    <h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Air transport in the country is practically not used - this is due to the fact that the IATA world organization does not recognize the independence of Abkhazia, therefore, flights to the country are not carried out.  Most tourists get to Abkhazian resorts through Russian ones - to get from Adler or Sochi by taxi or by minibus.  Crossing the Russian-Abkhaz border is easy - you can go directly to the other side of the bridge over <span>the Psou River</span> in shorts and slippers and find yourself in another country.  The main <span>mode of transportation</span> for movement within the country remains automobile. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Vacation spot </h2><p>  What does resort Abkhazia offer?  Hotels take tourists throughout the year - in summer you can enjoy a beach holiday, in winter - ski.  The country has developed a network of resorts - Avadhara, Gagra, Pitsunda, New Athos, Ochamchira and Gudauta ... Each of them has its own characteristics, for example, Avadhara is a resort town located at an altitude of 1600 meters and having sources of mineral waters. </p><p>  Gagra - the famous resort, famous throughout the CIS and attracting many tourists in the summer - there are excellent beaches and scenic spots.  Pitsunda is also well known to most people - this resort village, which has only recently received the status of a city, is located 25 kilometers south of Gagra.  New Athos is also located on the Black Sea coast.  In addition to the natural beauties, there are many cultural and historical attractions, monuments and museums.  Ochamchira and Gudauta are small coastal towns offering travelers unforgettable views and secluded relaxation. </p><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Almost every resort in the country offers tourists several hotels to choose from.  Some of them have not changed much since Soviet times, either in terms of service or quality of decoration.  Others, on the contrary, meet all modern requirements.  Accordingly, the cost of living in them is also different - from 600 to 3000 rubles per person per day. </p><p>  Abkhazia (hotels, resorts and hotels including) is the most hospitable place in the Caucasus.  Here, infrastructure shortcomings are more than compensated by the cordiality and friendliness of the staff.  In addition, in resort towns, almost every local resident offers tourists his own housing for rent.  You can order food - the hosts are happy to feed guests with local delicacies (for an additional fee, of course).  It is worth remembering that, as in any resort, it is better to reserve places in advance - at the height of the season, many encounter difficulties with accommodation.  Summer prices are higher than winter prices - this is due to the seasonal loading of hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Gagra, Abkhazia: hotels </h2><p>  Gagra (or Gagra) is a resort city in which the tourist infrastructure is well developed.

    <p>  Recently, new hotels and small private hotels have begun to appear at the resort, which offer guests comfortable rooms, excellent cuisine and a whole range of services, including transfer to Adler airport or train station. </p><p>  What other accommodation options does Abkhazia offer?

The new Iren Hotel and the Dolphin Club Hotel can serve as an example of the development of tourism infrastructure in one of the regions of such a country as Abkhazia. </p><p>  Mini-hotels are small, often inexpensive <span>private hotels</span> with only a few rooms and minimal service. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Abkhazia is in demand among Russian tourists.  Vacationers stay in hotels and pensions, as well as in the private sector, renting rooms and premises from the local population.  According to the majority, it is better to choose Abkhazia hotels for accommodation - reviews of tourists living in the private sector are most often not the most flattering. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia Ldzaa Hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/467209.jpg" width="600"></div>  Housing conditions are much worse, food can be different - depending on the hospitality of the owners.

    <p>  Fruits and vegetables must be washed thoroughly, it is recommended to drink only bottled water.  Stay on the beach should be limited, especially in the early days - the likelihood of sunburn is quite high.  It is recommended to wear bathing suits only on the beach, it is better to walk around the city in ordinary summer clothes.  When moving into the private sector, it is advisable to immediately discuss with the owner all living conditions in order to avoid misunderstandings related to the payment of additional services.  Hotel reservations are best booked in advance - there are always plenty of people willing to visit this sunny and hospitable country. </p>
