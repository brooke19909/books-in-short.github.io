  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most beautiful places in Rostov-on-Don and the best attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our article we want to talk about Rostov-on-Don.  The city is not only the capital of the Southern Federal District, but also just a beautiful region.  All guests will certainly be interested in visiting the most beautiful places in Rostov-on-Don.  There are a lot of attractions in the city, so let's recall the most significant of them. </p><h2>  central Street </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful places in Rostov-on-Don can be safely called Bolshaya Sadovaya Street.  Main street has a long history, which began in 1781.  In those days, she had a completely different look.  Later, the first kerosene lanterns appeared on it, and then water was piped and an electric tram was launched. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dic.academic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great Garden Street" class="if uuid-2595567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2595567.jpg"></div><p>  Locals nicknamed one of the parts of the street ‚ÄúRostov Broadway‚Äù because it houses unique houses that have survived to this day: the State Bank, the Moskovskaya Hotel, the City Hall, Margarita Chernova‚Äôs house. </p><h2>  City Embankment </h2><p>  Many citizens rightly believe that the most beautiful place in Rostov-on-Don is the embankment.  It is decorated with numerous monuments, flower beds.  The embankment has long become a favorite vacation spot not only for residents, but also for guests.  In fine weather, it offers stunning views.  The embankment in Rostov-on-Don is named after Fedor Ushakov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov embankment" class="if uuid-2595573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2595573.jpg"></div><p>  On it, guests of the city can see a number of iconic sculptures: ‚ÄúCastle Tree‚Äù, ‚ÄúNakhalenok with Grandfather Schukar‚Äù, ‚ÄúRostovchanka‚Äù.  Not so long ago, completely new monuments appeared on the right bank - ‚ÄúFisherman‚Äù, ‚ÄúGregory and Aksinya in a boat‚Äù, ‚ÄúArtist‚Äù, ‚ÄúDon-father‚Äù.  Each tourist tries to take a photo on the background of famous sculptures.  On holidays, the city embankment becomes a place of folk festivals. </p><h2>  Paramonovsky warehouses </h2><p>  The most beautiful places in Rostov-on-Don include Paramonovsky warehouses, which are an obligatory item in the list of attractions for every tourist.  The monumental structure now looks more like ruins, but even in this form it is impressive in scale.  The walls of the buildings are made of high-quality red brick and look like castle ruins.  There are many keys that create waterfalls and ponds.  Now it‚Äôs hard to imagine that only a hundred years ago this place was incredibly prosperous.  Thousands of people worked in warehouses.  The history of the building began in the 19th century.  The local port at that time had a huge commodity turnover; wheat and other products were shipped from it to England.  The number of shipments grew every day, so the idea came of building a complex of large warehouses on Khlebnaya Wharf. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="big-rostov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paramonovsky warehouses" class="if uuid-2595575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2595575.jpg"></div><p>  Buildings were erected in different years: from 1850 to 1980.  In the new premises not only grain was stored, but also wool, coal and food.  The engineers, under whose supervision the construction was carried out, found an ingenious solution for maintaining low temperatures in warehouses.  For cooling buildings used water from local ice-free streams.  She was directed through pipes running through the rooms.  In such a simple way, it was possible to maintain the optimal temperature for storing products in warehouses, because spring water has a temperature of +9 degrees throughout the year.  Now the buildings have turned into ruins. </p><p>  And yet, even now, this beautiful place in the city of Rostov-on-Don is very popular not only among tourists, but also local residents.  It is customary to arrange wedding photo shoots. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The list of the most beautiful places in Rostov-on-Don is quite impressive.  Among the attractions worth paying attention to the Botanical Garden.  In the vast steppes of the region, trees were always appreciated.  Therefore, in 1915, after moving to the city of Warsaw University, it was decided to lay a garden in order to be able to study the vegetation of the southern regions of Russia.  Thanks to the employees of the establishment, new species of shrubs and trees were distributed.  Years passed and the garden became a favorite place for locals.  It is difficult to find a more beautiful place to relax and walk.  Currently, the park, spread on the banks of the Temernik, is 200 hectares.  It is divided into thematic zones, each of which is interesting in its own way.  In total, up to 5 thousand plants grow in the garden.  It contains an amazing collection of tropical and subtropical flora brought from Australia, Asia, America (North and South).  The pristine Azov steppe is also impressive, a section of which has been preserved in the park.  The garden has its own museum, where you can admire the huge herbarium and an impressive collection of seeds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.metro.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2595569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2595569.jpg"></div><p>  The park has walkways and an ecological health trail.
