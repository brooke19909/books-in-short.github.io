But did you know that they are also used for observations in climatology, meteorology, geology and volcanology?  For this, powerful telescopes with a huge mirror are needed.  Such a device exists in Russia, it is called the "Large Azimuth Telescope" (BAT). </p><h2>  Where is the observatory of the RAS </h2><p>  The largest astronomical observatory is located in the mountains of Karachay-Cherkessia.  This is the land of mountain beauty.  To see a large telescope, you have to go to the Zelenchuksky area.  The complex stands on Pastukhov Mountain between two settlements - the village of the same name and the village of Arkhyz.  So, for example, from Krasnodar to Nizhny Arkhyz go only 346 kilometers. </p><p>  From Zelenchukskaya village you need to go towards Arkhyz.  Along the way, you will meet a small beautiful church and a market selling souvenirs.  After driving a little less than a kilometer, you will hit the barrier.  It is open during sightseeing hours. </p>

    <p>  Good quality road.  You climb higher along the serpentine road.  Tour bus drivers always park at the observation deck so that travelers can take beautiful photographs against the backdrop of the Abishir-Akhub mountain range above the Bolshaya Zelenchuk River.  You can already see the dome of the main observatory of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Astrophysical complex </h2><p>  A special astrophysical observatory was opened in the USSR in 1966.  It was developed and created for collective use by the large azimuthal telescope, as well as the RATAN-600 radio telescope.  Its feature is that the diameter of the antenna is 600 meters.  In the Soviet years, it was the largest and most powerful telescope in the world. </p><p>  These devices were commissioned in the 1970s, it should be noted that they are relevant today.  With their help, objects of both near and deep space are investigated by the method of ground-based astronomy. </p><p>  Today, the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the <span>Russian Academy of Sciences is</span> also the largest space observation center in the state.  The height of the dome of the observatory is 53 meters.  For repairs, domes of machinery and mechanics use a gantry crane with a cobra.  The moving part of the telescope has a weight of more than 650 tons, and the weight of the telescope fully is 850 tons. </p>

    <p>  The complex is divided into two large sections: upper and lower. </p><ul><li>  Lower platform: Zelenchuksky district, the village of Lower Arkhyz.  The observatory there has laboratory and residential buildings, a dormitory and management services. </li><li>  Upper platform: 17 km away from the village along the serpentine road up the Pastukhov Mountain, there is a large telescope located at an altitude of more than two kilometers.  There are two more small telescopes.  The Zeiss-1000 telescope has a mirror diameter of 1 meter, the Zeiss-600 has a mirror diameter of 0.6 meters. </li></ul><p>  At 20 kilometers from the village of Nizhny Arkhyz, the observatory has another object.  This is the RATAN radio telescope.  There is also a laboratory building and a cafe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How does an observatory with a telescope </h2><p>  Beautiful views around the village of Arkhyz.  The observatory does not work every day.  There are special days for excursions: Friday, Saturday and Sunday, from 9:30 to 16:00.  The tour does not last long.  If time is left before the start, then it is a sin not to walk around the neighborhood.  Books, magnets, postcards with pictures taken with a large azimuthal telescope are sold in the lobby of a scientific institution.  Sometimes in a small special room show an interesting documentary about the stars. </p>

    <h2>  Excursion in the astrophysical center </h2><p>  Visiting the observatory is strictly regulated, only forty minutes.  During this time, a guide (a researcher at the SAO RAS) will tell you how the BTA was created and many interesting facts.  For example, for this telescope, a mirror with a diameter of six meters and a weight of 42 tons was needed.  It was then poured back in Leningrad.  According to the technology, it was necessary to wait about two years for it to cool.  But our scientists were in a hurry.  And on the way to Arkhyz (Zelenchuksky district) it cracked because it had cooled earlier than it should.  Then they created a second mirror.  For him, they managed to pave a specially new, wide road to the mountains to the village of Arkhyz.  The observatory received a mirror, which even today serves the benefit of astrophysics. </p>

    <p>  During the tour you will climb the spiral staircase.  And on the top floor you will be waiting for the treasured door leading to the largest telescope in Russia, which monitors the universe and various galaxies.  The observatory has its own website.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that while sitting at home with a laptop, you can observe the views from the telescope in real time. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Having visited Zelenchuksky district and its attractions, you will not only visit the ancient mountainous regions, but will also become one step closer to the world of stars.  The resort Arkhyz is amazing and unique.  The observatory opens up amazing space views for scientists!  For curious tourists there are guided tours with the opportunity to look through a telescope.  The path to the stars is closer than you think.  Immerse yourself in the starry and mountainous worlds! </p>
