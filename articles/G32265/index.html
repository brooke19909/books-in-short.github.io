    <h2>  Bonus Program Overview </h2><p>  In May of this year, a unique bonus program was launched.  It represents a certain system for calculating virtual points.  You can earn them while buying fuel at gas stations "Rosneft", "TNK", which are official partners of the organization.  Accrued bonuses, according to the terms of the program, can be spent on the purchase of products and services of the Rosneft network.  The loyalty card (how to get it, we will describe below) in this case plays the role of an electronic medium that can accumulate and write off earned points. </p>

    <h2>  Bonus accrual: how it goes </h2><p>  Scoring is performed according to a certain scheme.  For example, for the purchase of every 2 liters of gasoline, only 1 bonus is credited to the card.  For every 20 rubles spent on payment for goods, services of the company and its partners, only 1 point is also awarded.  The same number of bonuses can be obtained for every 200 rubles when paying for goods and services with a card. </p><p>  When paying the purchase amount in installments (cash and bonuses), points are awarded only for the amount paid by real funds.  Bonuses for points spent are not credited. </p><p>  Moreover, points do not count towards the purchase of tobacco and alcohol products.  This is precisely the rule that Rosneft established.  A loyalty card, by the way, can be used just like a regular bank card.  However, to pay for other goods and services not provided for by the action, it must be replenished from the account of personal funds. </p>

    <h2>  Is there a credit limit on the bonus card? </h2><p>  According to the rules of the promotion involved in the loyalty program, the card does not imply a credit limit.  The calculation of interest on the personal funds of the participant, which he put on the card, is also not provided.  But the annual maintenance of such banking plastic does not require any payment. </p><h2>  Can I earn points by number? </h2><p>  Each program participant is assigned a special number.  It is necessary in order to control the accrual and deduction of points of each client.  However, one number will not be enough if for some reason you forget the card at home.  In order for your account to be replenished with bonuses, you must present one of the three cards issued during registration in the project. </p><h2>  Rosneft (gas station), loyalty card: validity points </h2><p>  Points accrued for certain services are valid for 36 months.  It is during this period that the protesters should take advantage of them.  If this is not done, the bonuses are burned and canceled. </p><h2>  How can I find out the number of points received? </h2><p>  To find out the amount of bonuses earned on the account, it is enough to submit a request to the employees of the TNK or Rosneft gas stations.  The loyalty card (how to find out how many points we will describe in more detail) in this case will be a kind of key.  With its help and with the assistance of a gas station employee, you will learn about the number of points. </p><p>  If you do not plan to go anywhere yet, to get similar information it is enough to register on the official page of the komandacard.ru program.  After the authorization procedure, you can find out the status of your account through the "My Account".  And finally, you can always call the hotline 8 (800) 775-75-88 and specify the details.  It is also recommended to contact this person if you want to know the number of points accrued when paying for goods and services of Rosneft partners. </p><h2>  What happens to bonuses when you lose a card? </h2><p>  In case of loss of the package or the main card, the program participant is entitled to receive a new basic set.  However, in this case, he will have a completely new bonus account.  If you wish, you can link the previous and new accounts without losing the previously accumulated bonuses. </p>
