    <h2>  St. George's Cathedral </h2><p>  This temple is one of the new architectural attractions of the capital region. </p><p>  St. George's Cathedral in Odintsovo was built relatively recently in 2007.  At the moment, it is considered one of the largest in the Moscow diocese.  Particularly noteworthy is the bell tower of the temple 72 meters high.  The main relic of the cathedral is a particle of the relics of St. George the Victorious. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúConfectionary shop‚Äù </h2><p>  In the village of Gorki, everyone can make a kind of journey and find themselves in an old store of sweets. </p><p>  The Confectionary Museum of the Russian dessert reconstructed the interior of a provincial shop of the late 19th century.  For this, his enthusiastic employees carefully studied the description of shop windows, advertising media that were used more than 100 years ago, as well as marketing moves and other features of the sale of candy, chocolate and other goodies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The museum holds master classes in the preparation of sugar flowers and other confectionery wonders.

    <h2>  Church in Grebnevo </h2><p>  The temple was built in the early 19th century by order of Countess Zubova.  A wooden church near the place where it is located has existed since 1673.  During the Napoleonic invasion, the temple was desecrated by the French, but after the liberation of the village of Odintsovo it was consecrated anew.  A century after its foundation, the Grebnevskaya Church was rebuilt and gained its modern look.  Since the late 30s of the last century, the temple did not function, and it reopened the doors to believers only in the spring of 1991. </p><h2>  "Slides" </h2><p>  On the territory of the Odintsovo district there is a government facility, closed to tourists.  This is the Gorki estate, which at the beginning of the 20th century belonged to the famous Russian industrialist Savva Morozov.  On the eve of World War I there was built a spacious house in the style of classicism, where Maxim Gorky spent the last years of his life.  It was in Gorki that he wrote his famous novel, The Life of Klim Samghin.  Herbert Wells and <span>Romain Rolland</span> came to visit him there <span>.</span> </p>
