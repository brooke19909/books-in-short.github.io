    <p>  Tax planning at the enterprise involves a series of measures that will help optimize taxation or, in other words, will reduce the level of taxation by legal means.  The manager should pay particular attention to the deliberate and regular planning of tax revenues.  Otherwise, an unplanned activity for a business entity may have such negative consequences as a decrease in the size of the company's current assets, loss of financial stability and a decrease in the possibility of further development. </p><p>  Tax planning at the enterprise should already be carried out when creating the company, taking into account the choice of areas of economic activity and the business sector. </p><p>  The process itself should be carried out through specific activities carried out at all stages of the organization‚Äôs functioning. </p><p>  The main methods of tax planning should be outlined as a mandatory item in a business plan.  The main purpose of this document is to present the legal ways of optimizing tax payments and calculating the achievement of the necessary company performance. </p><p>  Thanks to long-term planning, the company management can choose the best tax regime for their company.  In the process of implementing the relevant measures, financial and economic policies are being developed to reduce the <span>tax burden</span> on the enterprise. </p><p>  So, as a method of tax planning can serve as an indication of the conclusion of transactions and taxes.  Depending on the chosen direction, the company's specialists are determined with the tools to achieve the best results in this direction. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Holding requires special attention.  At the same time, tax planning at the enterprise at the stage of its creation, as well as in the process of functioning, differs. </p><p>  To achieve the most positive results of the company, it is necessary to constantly work out a number of points. </p><p>  Firstly, the optimization of the <span>taxation of an enterprise</span> begins with an analysis of the taxation model of the company‚Äôs taxation, identifying strengths and weaknesses in a given area. </p><p>  Secondly, to obtain a complete picture of the company‚Äôs activities, the organizational structure is considered, a list of major buyers, suppliers and other contractors is compiled. </p><p>  The third stage of tax planning at the enterprise involves the study of all contractual activities, as well as <span>primary</span> tax accounting <span>documents</span> . </p><p>  The next stage is the calculation of the <span>tax burden of the</span> company.  The result of a qualitative passage of this stage can be considered the choice of the best method of carrying out economic activities.  Before making a decision, the company management should thoroughly analyze the consequences and possible results from the implementation of the selected taxation model. </p><p>  The last step in tax planning is the direct application of the selected taxation model with a detailed <span>calculation of the volume of</span> tax payments, as well as the development of all accounting documents in accordance with the new direction of activity. </p><p>  One of the ways to optimize the taxation of the company can be considered the presence of <span>highly qualified specialists</span> who will ensure the proper maintenance of primary documentation and timely reporting to tax authorities.  This will help to avoid additional costs in the form of fines. </p><p>  In no case should one confuse the optimization of tax revenues with their minimization.  Their main difference is that the first is achieved by legal means, and the second is not.  It is the minimization of taxation that pays great attention to the tax authorities. </p>
