    <p>  The second beach is located 7 km from the hotel, in the Hadaba area.

Flight schedules can be found at the reception.  Hadaba, as a rule, is visited by tourists who are fond of exploring the underwater world, because in these places it is really beautiful and diverse.  Therefore, going to the beach in the Hadaba area, be sure to bring a mask and snorkel with you.  It‚Äôs also important not to forget about special shoes, because the bottom of the sea is covered with coral reefs.  True, it is worth noting that it is forbidden to attack them in many places, and for diving there are special bridges that go 40-60 meters into the sea.  Here, tourists have the opportunity to see many rare and colored corals, admire the colorful fish and butterfly fish, and also look for a hole with an evil moray.  Do not neglect the night walk along the Red Sea - it looks very mysterious and majestic. </p><h2>  Options for a pleasant pastime: photo </h2><p>  Throughout the day, pleasant music is heard throughout the Sharm Holiday Resort 4 *.

Both those and other hotels have something to offer.  So, let's start with the people who came to Egypt, namely in Sharm el-Sheikh, on a business visit.  Indeed, many industries in this country are so well developed that Russian businessmen want to gain experience from the Arabs or to establish cooperation with them.  For such purposes, the hotel has a conference room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã950 m¬≤.  At the same time it can fit up to 300 people.  The hall is equipped with comfortable chairs and other equipment for conferences and business meetings.

Sharm el Sheikh, although not rich in all kinds of attractions, but in its vicinity there are plenty of them.  So, you should definitely visit the Monastery of St. Catherine, located near the Sinai Mountain.  According to the Bible, it was here that God presented the Ten Commandments to Moses.  The uniqueness of the monastery lies in the fact that here, almost under one roof, there are a Christian church and a mosque.  True, only the Slavs are allowed into the first. </p><p>  Another beautiful place in Egypt is the Colored Canyon, which is 5 km long, 3-11 meters wide, and up to 30 meters deep.

It has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 km¬≤ and is part of the Ras Mohammed Nature Reserve.  The park has more than 125 species of plants, including <span>mangroves.</span>  Walking around the reserve, you can see many storks, gulls and raptors. </p><p>  Among the famous natural sites of Egypt, it is worth noting the hot springs, located near the highway that leads to Sharm El Sheikh.  These springs have long been used by people to treat diseases such as rheumatism and osteochondrosis.  Here are the famous Pharaoh baths and the Moses baths. </p><h2>  Sharm Holiday Travel Reviews </h2><p>  Clean rooms, friendly staff, green areas, delicious food - all this is Sharm Holiday Resort 4 *.

    <p>  Perhaps it‚Äôs worth starting with the hotel rooms.  According to vacationers, all rooms are spacious and clean.  Furniture and plumbing are quite suitable for use.  It is also encouraging that there is no need to run after the staff with a request to remove or change clothes - this is done regularly.  In the reviews of vacationers there are no complaints about the equipment in the room - everything always works. </p><p>  Many positive words in the reviews of Sharm Holiday guests can be read about the <span>food at the hotel</span> - a sufficient variety and quantity, fresh products, plenty of fruits and pastries.  The only thing that some complain about local alcohol is that it is not very tasty. </p><p>  Especially praised the animation at the hotel.  Some vacationers say that the hotel was so fun that I didn‚Äôt even want to have fun in order to go to the beach or eat.  Additional services are also pleasing - at any time you can go to the sauna, gym or book a massage. </p><p>  As for the beaches, the only negative point that slides in the reviews of vacationers is that the number of sunbeds does not correspond to the number of tourists.  There are fewer people on Hadaba beach, but there is not always a desire to wait for the bus and spend time on the road, especially if there is heat on the street.  But the rest of the characteristics of the beaches of vacationers pleased - a sandy entrance to the sea, a bright and diverse underwater world, a bar right on the beach and the presence of all the necessary equipment for relaxation. </p>
