When contacting the bank‚Äôs information support service or bank branch, it‚Äôs difficult to get an answer different from the recommendation to carefully read the rules for using <span>a Sberbank credit card.</span>  <span>User reviews</span> make it clear that these rules are far from being as transparent as we would like.  But what kind of pitfalls does an ordinary card holder encounter? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card rules" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41680/1303843.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Grace period: myth or reality </h2><p>  Paragraph 2 of the information - terms, rules for using a <span>credit card of Sberbank of Russia.</span>  The grace period is the period during which interest is levied on preferential terms.  Perhaps this is the most tempting that is in the "plastic".  After all, this is the middle dream of a Russian person - a freebie.  In fact, free cheese can only be found in a mousetrap, and funds, even after fifty days, will still have to be returned.  Otherwise, interest for the entire period from the moment of purchase will be accrued in one day.  In addition, do not flatter yourself too much about the term, because the maximum term for preferential lending at the bank's client is only one day a month. <br><br>  So, again: what must be remembered in order to use the bank‚Äôs funds for free?  Rule one - never withdraw funds from the card in cash.  This is also confirmed by customer reviews.  The <span>grace period</span> does not apply to such operations.  The next important point is the deadlines for depositing funds.  It is extremely important to pay attention to this point too, as  untimely payment amount is equated by the bank to completely absent.  The due date always starts from the countdown date and is twenty days.  That is, <span>a bank client</span> whose card account was opened on the first day will always pay the twentieth.  If the card was received after the tenth day, the date will always be different, depending on how many days in the current month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Cash withdrawal </h2><p>  Sberbank credit card rules mention cash withdrawals twice.  First, in the terms section, where it is indicated that the grace period does not apply to such operations, and the very next day after cash withdrawal, interest will begin to accrue on their amount.  It is calculated from the calculation: the annual interest rate divided by 365 days a year and multiplied by the withdrawal amount, including a one-time cash withdrawal commission. </p><p>  The second time - in the paragraph describing what constitutes a cash withdrawal commission and how much it amounts to.  In fact, it‚Äôs just a fee for the bank to agree to cash funds from a credit card.  If you use the self-service devices of the issuing bank for withdrawal, it will be 3% of the amount, but not less than 390 rubles.  That is, if the client wants to withdraw the last hundred rubles that remained on the card, he will not be able to do this, because  there are not enough funds in his account to pay the commission for the operation. <br><br>  Oddly enough, receiving funds through a bank employee with a passport is also impossible.  However, as well as the transfer from this card to some else. </p>

    <h2>  Card payment system and currency transactions </h2><p>  There is still a small nuance that should be taken into account before receiving a card, or rather, before processing an application for its release.  This issue will be significant for those who plan to carry out transactions in foreign currency on the card.  For this, contrary to popular belief, there is no need to travel abroad, many purchases are made on the Internet.  And here it is very important to choose the right card payment system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This information cannot be found even with all the desire, even if you read the rules for using Sberbank credit card from beginning to end.  Mastercard is an international payment system that operates in two hundred and ten countries of the world.  "Visa" is also a payment system, but an American one.  The main currency of the Visa system is the dollar, while the MasterCard is the euro.  Having a ruble credit card of Sberbank and paying with it in a currency different from the currency of the account and the payment system, the client loses funds on a triple redundant conversion - first in dollars or euros, and only then in rubles.  Therefore, in Europe it is more profitable to pay with a Mastercard card, and in the USA - with a Visa card. </p>

    <h2>  Credit limit </h2><p>  In this sense, the rules for using Sberbank's Credit Momentum credit card are somewhat different.  At first glance, the card has some advantages, and there are absolutely no drawbacks: you can get it on the day of treatment and, without wasting time, start using it immediately after setting the credit limit.  In addition, your data are not indicated on the card, which means that even in case of loss, third parties cannot try to use the funds available on it on the Internet. </p><p>  But do not forget about the limitations associated with this card.  The first of these is the maximum amount of the credit limit set on the card.  If on a regular credit card it can be up to 600 thousand rubles, then on Credit Momentum cards - only up to 120 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Features of operations </h2><p>  The next point is associated with the features of conducting operations on cards of this type.  So, for many, it may be an unpleasant surprise that the operation of issuing cash in third-party banks with credit momentum cards is not performed.  This means that the use of these cards for cash withdrawal or deposit operations is not available in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, where Sberbank branches have not yet been built and no ATMs have been set up. </p><p>  If the client often has to perform operations on the Internet, then he will be interested to learn about another limitation in the use of Instant cards.  Transactions for paying for goods and services via the Internet are carried out in 3D Secure mode, which means that for each operation it is necessary to use a one-time password, which is sent to the phone number connected to the mobile bank. </p>

    <h2>  Protect funds with 3D Secure </h2><p>  This is an attempt by the bank to additionally make sure that it is the cardholder who makes the payment.  3D Secure is not an absolute protection of money on a card during operations without using a card, for example, a one-time code can be intercepted by computer viruses.  However, the system allows you to reduce the risk of financial loss to the client, at least in cases where the active card or data indicated on its front and back sides just fell into the hands of a third party.  This is a drawback or a virtue - everyone can decide for himself, but it is important to remember that not every site is ready to provide this degree of protection.  This means that not all online purchases will be available. </p><p>  These features apply to debit cards, too, but in order to fully understand how to properly use the discussed product, it is best to mentally include this information in the rules for using a Sberbank credit card. </p>

    <h2>  Annual Service Fee </h2><p>  Even if the client carefully read the rules for using a <span>Sberbank</span> credit card <span>, the Master</span> of Gold Cards in his tight wallet proudly gleams with gold every time he looks at it and does not portend any troubles, there is a chance of an unpleasant surprise.  Because the reviews say: more and more you can encounter a situation where one fine day suddenly on the card account becomes three thousand rubles less.  Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is about the worst - about scammers and robbery.  We have to block the card and start collecting documents for contacting the police.  But here it turns out that the bank simply withheld a fee for servicing a bank card.  To the question of where such a commission amount comes from, the answer will remain the same: it was necessary to carefully read the rules for using a Sberbank credit card. <br><br>  Indeed, when there is a need to urgently make a purchase, and there are not enough funds on the account, a credit card seems to be a good option.  At such moments, you rarely have to think about what commission the bank will keep for its services.  The amount of the annual service fee varies for cards of different classes.  So, for example, the accounts of instant cards and those cards of the Gold class that are issued on a pre-approved offer will be kept by the bank absolutely free of charge.  A standard card, usually gray, Master Card Standart or Visa Cassic will cost 750 rubles in the first year of use, and 450 rubles for each in the following years. </p>

    <h2>  Rules for using a Sberbank credit card: psychological aspect </h2><p>  The analysis of the main aspects and difficulties that a person has when studying the document ‚ÄúRules for Using a Sberbank Credit Card‚Äù has come to an end.  The bank offers to leave comments and suggestions on the official website in the feedback column. </p><p>  The last thing I would like to note is the psychological aspect of using credit cards.  He was perfectly described in a caricature sketch where a certain character pays a percentage on his cards, like tithing to a church or tax.  And, in essence, it‚Äôs not entirely clear what exactly he pays for.  After all, that sofa, which he bought with the help of a card, has long been broken and vegetates in a landfill.  And the total amount of credit card debt is the same, because I don‚Äôt want to pay five thousand a month to completely close the <span>credit line,</span> when a good bank favorably allows you to pay only one and a half.  And someday it will turn out to close the card, now I would have to deal with pressing issues. </p>
