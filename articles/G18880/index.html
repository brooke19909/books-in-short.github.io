Almost always, these are positive feedback from satisfied customers.  There you can also find a lot of his works and see in what unusual but very beautiful style he captures such important moments for everyone as a wedding, engagement, anniversary, etc. </p><p>  Alexander is very anxious and painstakingly approaches work with each client separately.  He carefully discusses all the nuances of a future photo shoot so that the client could not have any further disappointment.  Thanks to this, all the photographs taken by Alexander are high-quality, vivid, and the emotions of the main characters in them look very lively and real. </p><h2>  The cost of work </h2><p>  The contract with Alexander for 4 hours will be approximately 26 thousand rubles.  You can hire him to capture your entire holiday or conduct a solitary photo shoot away from prying eyes.  Also, Alexander can go to work in another city or even in another country with you, but the cost of such work will need to be discussed separately. </p>
