  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3D Origami Star - Yin and Yang Game</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today we will learn how to fold the figure "eight-pointed origami star." </p><p>  First of all, before you start folding origami, you need to choose the material.  There are many different types of paper.  In the shops you can even find special sheets for origami.  Typically, paper is not taken too thick to be easily folded.  You can take old newspapers or magazines.  Wrapping, also suitable and revitalize your craft. </p><p>  However, if you are going to add origami for the first time, it is better to practice first.  To do this, you can take a regular sheet for the printer.  So, we need to get from the rectangular format - square.  This is done very simply: we take one edge of the sheet and apply it to the opposite edge so that they coincide.  Then we bend and cut off or tear off the excess.  It is better to cut off, of course, so that it is smoother and more accurate.  As a result, we get a square of about 20x20 centimeters.  You can take less and more.  But we must not forget that we will have to fold the paper several times, so we do not need to take a sheet that is too small or too large. </p><p>  Now, from this square blank, you get a voluminous <span>origami star.</span>  You need to start collecting this model with the basic ‚Äúpancake‚Äù form.  To do this, bend the sheet along the second diagonal, he already has one.  Then make horizontal and vertical central folds.  The intersection point of the diagonals and the folds will give us the center of the figure.  Next, bend in turn each corner of the square to the center.  The "pancake" is ready.  A volumetric origami star consists of several such blanks.  We move on. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The upper corner, which we had previously folded to the middle, is bent left up to the edge of the workpiece.  Bend, ironing the folds well so that the fold line is clearly visible.  Then we straighten and this same angle is now added up to the right.  Then deploy again.  At this corner, two intersecting folds turned out.  Now we take the corner again and bend it up so that the fold line is higher than the intersection line of the two previous folds.  And so that the part of the sheet that we bent was equal to about two-thirds. </p><p>  We do the same symmetrically with the bottom corner.  But make sure that the bent part is the same as the upper corner.  We simply bend the remaining left and right corners outward so that a smaller square appears in the middle of the figure.  Then you need to bend the figure in half horizontally.  We turn the received detail.  Now bend the entire figure in half vertically.  Extend.  Turn the figure over to the other side.  This is not a voluminous origami star, but only a blank. </p><p>  The resulting figure has the shape of two squares rotated forty-five degrees relative to each other.  We position the figure so that the upper square lies flat.  The corners of the bottom square "stick out" from the middle of its sides.  Next, we very carefully make the following folds: from the upper edge of the left corner of the lower square to the lower edge of the right corner of the lower square.  Add up on our own.  Straighten.  We make three more such folds in turn with each corner of the lower square.  Each time we fold inward from ourselves.  Straighten.  The figure should remain clear fold lines.  Do not forget to carefully smooth the folds.  But we do everything carefully so as not to tear the paper. </p><p>  Gently pull the center of the star forward so that a three-dimensional volumetric origami star is obtained.  This model is universal and suitable for decorating the Christmas tree, and just for decorating the interior or gift wrapping.  You can choose any color of paper, the main thing to remember is that the sheet is not too dense. </p><p>  You can also make two identical eight-pointed stars and glue them so that you get one origami bulging three-sided star. </p>
