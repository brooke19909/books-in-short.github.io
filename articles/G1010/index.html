  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reims, France: description, history, attractions, an overview of the best hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  By Russian standards, the epithet "large" cannot be applied to France and Reims.  And the "city of kings" is not famous for this.  The region in which Reims is located is called Champagne, and the champagne House Pierre Perignon made here by French winemakers has no equal in the world.  But gourmets will be more interested in it, but those who appreciate the beauty of ancient architectural masterpieces, seek to understand the hidden meaning of messages encoded in ancient relics and legends, will attract France and the city of Reims with their historical monuments of culture and art, of which there are a great many. </p><h2>  Main attraction </h2><p>  When planning a long-awaited trip to France, you, of course, will be interested in its centuries-old history, which in some periods was closely connected with Russia.  In particular, Reims became the site of the coronation of Queen Anne, and her husband Henry I was crowned there earlier, in 1027.  This was the beginning of the tradition, according to which all subsequent sovereigns of the French kingdom were crowned directly in the Reims Cathedral, with the exception of Henry IV (Navarre).  Therefore, the value of this magnificent work of architecture is very difficult to overestimate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reims Cathedral" class="if uuid-2953746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953746.jpg"></div><p>  If we turn to more ancient events, the history of France and Reims goes back to 816, when Louis I, nicknamed the Pious, chose the cathedral of this city as the place of his anointing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And in 496, the sacrament of the baptism of the Franks King Hlodwig with his comrades-in-arms and the army took place here.  At the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th centuries, Saint Remigius was widely known in France and the city of Reims, who, as a bishop, baptized Clovis.  This event is associated with the tradition of a sacred vessel with an inexhaustible world, with which an angel embodied by a dove appeared to Remigius.  A few drops of myro were always combined with oil, intended for the coronation procedure of each monarch. </p><h2>  Three Reims Cathedrals </h2><p>  According to sources, the emergence of Christianity in France and Reims occurred around the 1st century AD.  e.  The date of construction of the first cathedral is considered to be 380, but its location was different. </p><p>  A century later, on the site of the current cathedral in Reims in France, the original church was erected in honor of the Virgin, which lasted until the fire in 1210.  Citizens and fathers of the city decided to build a new church within a year. </p><p>  It is this work of architecture dedicated to the Blessed Virgin that we have the opportunity to admire at the present time.  For more than 70 years of construction of the temple, 4 architects were replaced.  Their names were originally immortalized on the floor of the cathedral, but after 500 years the inscriptions were removed.  The architects surpassed themselves in the construction of the Gothic cathedral, and the magnificent building is the pride of France and the city of Reims. </p><h2>  The fate of the temple </h2><p>  The French are very careful about the monuments of antiquity.  Despite the fact that the cathedral is considered one of the main attractions of Reims and France, and therefore they tried to improve it in every way for more than 500 years, its appearance has remained almost unchanged.  And today we could appreciate its pristine splendor, if not for the revolution of 1793, and then the First World War. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The French Revolution damaged the famous stained glass windows of the cathedral, but they were subsequently restored.  However, in 1914, during artillery shelling, these masterpieces of art were almost destroyed, as were the rare statues that were the pride of the cathedral. </p><p>  For France, Reims, Reims Cathedral it was a matter of honor to restore the lost masterpieces made by architects of the Middle Ages.  The bishop‚Äôs palace was almost completely given over to workshops where restoration of what else could be saved took place.  The painstaking work to restore the sculptures continues to the present.  As for the stained-glass windows, it is only thanks to the found drawings that they again adorn the windows of the cathedral.  Their restoration, and sometimes complete reconstruction, is the merit of specialists of our time, including the Russian artist Marc Chagall. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Kb11pGK-bIM" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb11pGK-bIM" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/1/4/9/9/11499.jpg"></div><p>  In 1938, residents of Reims, France and other countries witnessed the opening of a magnificent cathedral.  And although many sculptures of antiquity were lost, they were replaced by copies that are almost identical to the originals. </p><h2>  Architectural Features of the Cathedral of the Kings </h2><p>  Among the sights of France and Reims, the famous "Royal Cathedral" can be called the pearl of medieval architecture.  It was designed by architect Jean d'Orbe in the canons of high Gothic architecture, its length is 138 m, width reaches 30 m, and the arch goes up to 38 m. The main facade is considered to be western, which is decorated with two 80-meter ‚Äúguards‚Äù.  On the south side of the complex is a bell tower with the famous ten-ton bell called "Charlotte".  There is also a second additional bell of smaller sizes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Reims Cathedral is considered the largest in France.  Its construction lasted more than 70 years, so the author of the project did not live to see its completion, however, the successors of the master d'Orbe followed the original architectural plan. </p><p>  The simplest inspection of sculptures and various reliefs located throughout the facade takes a long time; there are a total of 2300 of these masterpieces. Studying the subjects that inspired the sculptors is a separate issue.  Here, even drainpipes are presented as various kinds of chimeras and other otherworldly creatures. </p><p>  On the left side of the cathedral is world famous thanks to numerous photos of the sights of France and Reims "Smiling Angel".  Its creation dates from the beginning of the XIII century. </p><p>  One cannot but mention the sculpture of Atlanta, which impressed Victor Hugo in creating the novel Notre Dame de Paris with its Quasimodo. </p><p>  The interior of Reims Cathedral is truly impressive with a variety of plots: Jesus and the Virgin Mary, the royal gallery, headed by Clovis I, Saint Remigius, the Last Judgment and so on.  There is little cursory inspection: in order to penetrate the atmosphere of the ancient cathedral, it is necessary to carefully study its masterpieces. </p><h2>  Masterpieces of stained glass art </h2><p>  All travelers who have visited France and Reims have only enthusiastic reviews about the stained glass windows of the Cathedral of Our Lady.  Works of art that have survived the revolution and war today are over 700 years old, and the restored masterpieces are not even 50. </p><div class="photo" data-original="frugalfirstclasstravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stained Glass of Reims Cathedral" class="if uuid-2953754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953754.jpg"></div><p>  A rose-shaped window, stunning with its refined beauty, adorns the west side of the cathedral.  It presents the plot of the Assumption of the Mother of God. </p><p>  A rose window on the north side gives viewers a picture of the creation of the world.  These two stained glass windows have been preserved since the construction of Reims Cathedral. </p><p>  Ancient and medieval kings, as well as bishops who served in Reims, peered into the visitors from the nave: only 16 of the 36 stained glass windows of the 14th century have survived to our time. </p><p>  The small window (XIII century), located on the western side, was especially affected during the revolution of 1793.  This work of stained glass was not subject to restoration, and was replaced by a stacked window made of stained glass.  However, it did not survive in 1914.  By a lucky coincidence, the artist Jacques Simon was able to restore the window with the original story ‚ÄúThe Litany of the Virgin Mary‚Äù from the old drawings found in 1939. </p><p>  The same master restored in 1937 a rose-window on the south side in the likeness of a northern rose. </p><p>  And in 1954, the artist Simon was invited by the Champagne Wines Corporation to create a thematic stained glass window in the style of the 13th century.  The master coped with the task: today you can see a work of art, where John the Baptist stands next to St. Vincent and the creator of the unsurpassed variety of champagne "House Pierre Perignon". </p><p>  At different times, they worked on other damaged stained-glass windows: Marc Chagall and the daughter of Jacques Simon - Brigitte. </p><p>  1991 was a landmark year for Reims Cathedral: it added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites along with three other attractions of the ‚Äúcity of kings‚Äù. </p><h2>  Reims today </h2><p>  Reims can be called the historical center of the Champagne region.  It is located in the northeast side of France, occupies the first place in terms of population in the region, but does not have any administrative status. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="HgEd7o75LMc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEd7o75LMc" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/1/5/2/3/11523.jpg"></div><p>  The regional center is Chalon-en-Champagne, and the economy of the region is determined by the drink, bearing the same name with the region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grapeescapes.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Champagne cellars" class="if uuid-2953837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953837.jpg"></div><p>  The climatic conditions in the region and, accordingly, in Reims are very favorable for the cultivation of those grape varieties from which the famous French champagne is obtained.  There is no sharp temperature difference, the humidity is moderate.  And although winter temperatures can sometimes be knocked out of the usual framework, however, in general, they do not cause significant damage to the vine.  The summer months are characterized by dry weather, interspersed with thunderstorms.  The third part of the year is rainy. </p><h2>  UNESCO Heritage </h2><p>  Photos and descriptions of the sights of France and Reims testify to the rich history of both the country and the city.  UNESCO noted the value of the four architectural sites of the "city of kings."  An indisputable masterpiece is Reims Cathedral.  However, no less historical value is the Tau Palace, or otherwise the Palace of Tau. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pl.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of tau" class="if uuid-2953767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953767.jpg"></div><p>  It was here that the future monarchs of France found shelter and rest before the anointing ceremony.  The royal vestments were also held at the Tau Palace, as was the subsequent coronation feast. </p><p>  The palace was named because of the location of the complex, very similar to the drawings for the letter of the Greek alphabet "Tau".  In historical documents, the palace was first mentioned in 1131.  The most ancient buildings of the Palace of Tau were demolished.  In 1207, a decision was made to move the chapel to the oldest part of the palace.  Then, at the end of the XV and the beginning of the XVI centuries, the concept of the building was changed in the direction of Gothic, and after another 200 years it was given some gloss in the Baroque style.  It is this view that many tourists today admire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ee.france.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the halls of the Palace of Tau" class="if uuid-2953775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953775.jpg"></div><p>  The First World War did not pass Tau Palace: the fire destroyed many of the valuables stored here since ancient times.  The effects of the elements were eliminated only after the end of World War II.  Restoration work required a lot of effort and lasted until 1972, and after they were finished, tapestries, sculptural works that were previously in the cathedral, and with them ritual objects used during the coronation, are exhibited in the palace. </p><h2>  Patron saint of francs </h2><p>  There are many answers to the question of what to see in Reims and France.  In particular, another architectural monument inscribed on the UNESCO list as a value of world significance is the Abbey of St. Remigius.  The time of its foundation is the 13th century.  An abbey was erected where, according to legend, Saint Remigius, famous for his holiness, was buried. </p><p>  The well-being of the Abbey was based on the legend that before the baptism of Clovis I, Saint Remigius was handed over by an angel who turned into a dove, the so-called Holy Vial of Peace.  Subsequently, a few drops of the contents were added to the oil, which was necessary in the ceremony of the anointing of the next monarch.  This vessel is today stored in the Abbey.  Of course, residents of the city and its environs often visited the Abbey of St. Remigius in the hope of joining its miracles. </p><p>  The time and the change of historical scenery did not spare the ancient building: it often underwent changes, something was destroyed, new buildings were erected at this place.  In 1792, the revolutionary population expelled the host monks from the monastery, and where prayers were read, they first began to receive the wounded, and then, after the hospital was closed, an almshouse was formed.  Then the hospital was organized again in 1903.  Today, the Abbey has become a museum of Saint-Remy, which exhibits objects related to the history of the city, including those discovered during archaeological research, you can also see exhibits representing the military theme there. </p><h2>  The resting place of the saint </h2><p>  In France and Reims, interesting facts related to ancient history are found at every turn.  For example, it is enough to walk a few steps from the complex of the Abbey of St. Remigius and you will find yourself in the basilica bearing the name of this saint.  Once there, in the abbey church, services were held.  And here pilgrims flocked to pray at the tomb of St. Remigius.  She is still in the basilica today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="saintrafe.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tomb of St. Remigius" class="if uuid-2953803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953803.jpg"></div><p>  The church began to build (according to some sources) in the first decade of the XI century.  The basilica was erected 30 years later, and in October 1049, Pope Leo IX consecrated a new temple.  After almost 100 years, she underwent reconstruction: the building was transformed in the Gothic style.  For a long time, the basilica fulfilled its mission, but in 1793 the French revolutionaries did not spare the historical building and the relics in it.  Of course, the basilica was closed.  Then it lost its former significance and became the church of the city parish.  Then came 1918, and the German artillery did not care that their shells fell into a historical architectural monument. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alrishalesyeuxdemavie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basilica of St. Remigius" class="if uuid-2953799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953799.jpg"></div><p>  Only after 40 years, the basilica of St. Remigius was restored to its former splendor by restorers led by Henri Dene.  This French architect restored the old building, and now for 60 years worship has been held here. </p><h2>  Ancient and medieval monuments </h2><p>  The views in the photos of France and Reims are represented by monuments of both the Middle Ages and very ancient times.  The Mars Gate dates back to the 3rd century AD  e.  They are dedicated to the warlike god Mars, as well as the temple, from which only fragments remained. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mars Gate" class="if uuid-2953808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953808.jpg"></div><p>  The height of Mars Gate reaches 13 meters, and their width is 33 meters. </p><p>  The list of attractions in Reims is complemented by the Le Verg√®re Museum Hotel, where you can see an exposition representing the historical period from antiquity to the present day, in particular the work of Albrecht D√ºrer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="interpolart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum Hotel Le Vergere" class="if uuid-2953833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104478/2953833.jpg"></div><p>  You can not ignore the town hall of Reims, which is an architectural monument of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  This is not an exhaustive list of city attractions.  In order to get acquainted with all its monuments of architecture and art, you will have to pay a visit here more than once. </p><p>  And if you have a question about where to stay, knowledge about Reims hotels will help you.  There are a lot of them in this city, and the prices in them are also very different, for every taste and budget. </p><p>  For example, the L'id√©ale Folie is just a kilometer from the promenade and 1.5 km from the Opera Reims Theater.  Great neighborhood, but the price is consistent with the quality provided.  And the quality is estimated at 10 points out of 10. </p><p>  Another comfortable hotel with luxury apartments is located just 500 meters from the garden complex of Pierre Schneiter, and if you are a lover of walks, then after 7 minutes you can already walk in Patt d'Ua Park.  Do I need to mention free Wi-Fi and parking?  And you can get to the embankment of Les Hauts literally in 3-5 minutes. </p><p>  You can pre-book a room in any hotel in the city via the Internet, or check in immediately upon arrival. </p><p> And the last question: "Leaving France and Reims, what to buy?"  The first answer is champagne.  This is the best gift for yourself and loved ones.  It‚Äôs somehow not even interesting to talk about various souvenirs and magnets: there are a great many of them in the city and in all historical buildings.  The second most important gift from the French city can be a publication with reproductions of cultural and art monuments: you will be happy to recall the time spent in the "city of kings" flipping through this book. </p>
