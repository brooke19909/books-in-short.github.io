    <p>  This artificially created water body is located in Central America.  The canal connects the borders of the Atlantic Ocean with the Caribbean Sea.  The length of the isthmus at a deep water level is about 82 km, and the width is 150 m, while the vessels pass through three locks along the way, after which they end up in the artificial lake Gatun.  Further, after passing a few more steps and Miraflores (a natural water reservoir), the cars go out into the bay.  All this way is the Panama Canal, the year of the official opening of which is one thousand nine hundred and twentieth. </p><p>  The construction of this facility was of great importance for the development of economic relations between the countries of Central America, as well as for the sphere of navigation.  The canal allows such huge vessels as container ships and tankers to pass, while saving more than 10,000 km of track.  Posting works are carried out by a <span>special service, the</span> time spent on the entire segment, on average, is about 9 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Great construction</strong> </p>

    <p>  The Panama Canal, the year of the official opening of which marked the implementation of the ideas of many minds of the 19th century, began its history at the end of 1882, when its construction began.  At the head stood the great French engineer - Count Ferdinant de Lesseps, who at that time had the experience of successfully laying the <span>Suez Canal.</span> </p><p>  The company laying the waterway was discussed at the International Congress in 1879 in France, after which it received a concession from the Colombian government for a period of 99 years.  This activity was based on subscriber loans, with the price of one share at 500 francs. </p><p>  According to historians, Count F. de Lesseps was a skilled diplomat and orator, but his last creation - the Panama Canal (the year of official opening is indicated above) - had a deplorable outcome for him, possibly due to underestimation of the initial cost of the project.  To attract a large number of investors, the engineer presented figures that were almost halved, which, of course, could not but affect the success of the work progress. </p><p>  <strong>Panama Scam</strong> <strong></strong></p><p>  After the start of the construction project was inspired, the work manager had to go through many unpleasant moments.  Critically, there was not enough money, since the first loan did not raise even a third of the planned funds.  There weren‚Äôt enough working hands, in addition to unsanitary conditions and an outbreak of malaria, typhoid and dysentery that carried people away.  The hope was weak, and if someone asked him the question: "What is the year of the official opening of the Panama Canal?"  - surely the engineer could not give an answer. </p><p>  The Lesseps family tried to remedy the situation, and the project was changed at the insistence of engineer F. Buno-Varigli, who proposed the use of gateways.  The famous builder A. Eiffel was also called, but after 8 years only two fifths of the work was done.  To continue the project, loans were issued that did not require permission from the authorities, but the government of T. Roosevelt and the Chamber of Deputies did not approve this financial transaction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the year of the official opening of the Panama Canal" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14124/244264.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Subsequently, in 1892, a global scandal erupted, and construction managers of the isthmus were convicted.  Count F. de Lesseps was released from prison due to his advanced age, and his son, the younger Lesseps, the minister, several managers and A. Eiffel were sentenced to different terms. </p><p>  The year of the official opening of the Panama Canal was justified for the name Lesseps, his name was cleared of the stigma of fraud.  Time has proven that this great man had selfless goals and principles. <strong></strong></p>
