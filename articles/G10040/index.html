In order for the picture to turn out natural and spectacular, you need to correctly focus on the depicted object, and this will help you to know the basic rules of composition. </p><h2>  Colors </h2><p>  It is scientifically proven that every color has an emotional effect on a person.  So, warm colors (red, orange, yellow) and their shades are associated with the sun and summer.  Cold colors, such as purple, pink and blue, visually distance objects from the viewer.  They are associated with water, winter and cold. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to saturation, if you want the composition of the frame in the photograph to evoke certain feelings in the audience.  Use soft colors to create a sense of nostalgia and peace.  If you want to attract attention, create a sensual frame that people will remember for a long time, give preference to bright colors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dekettdigitalphoto.weebly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frame composition" class="if uuid-2721181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2721181.jpg"></div><p>  Professionals warn beginners from mistakes when choosing colors.  To make the photo harmonious, do not put bright color spots away from the most important object.  This will confuse the viewer and prevent people from correctly perceiving the frame. </p><h2>  Contrast </h2><p>  Photography should attract attention.  To keep your eyes ‚Äúclinging‚Äù to the image, follow the tips below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Light objects are usually taken on a dark background, and vice versa. </li><li>  If you are photographing people, discard the brown and yellow background.  Otherwise, the picture will be unnatural. </li><li>  If the idea does not require that, do not use colorful backgrounds, as they distract attention from the main object. </li></ul><p>  Remember that all objects must be in some kind of balance.  Therefore, when placing a bright object in one part of the picture, make sure that there is something in the other that will also attract the attention of the viewer.  It can be an action or a color spot. </p><h2>  Texture and patterns </h2><p>  A pattern in photography is a repeating object with which a frame composition is created.  In photography of the interior, landscape or architectural monument, you can use this technique.  Textures in combination with light and shadows add some zest to the picture.  With their help, you can focus on various materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ladnydom.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frame composition in interior photography" class="if uuid-2721197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2721197.jpg"></div><h2>  Odd rule </h2><p>  Experienced photographers advise placing an odd number of objects in the frame.  It is believed that this will help the viewer to focus on important objects.  In some cases, of course, this rule cannot be used: for example, if you are shooting a family portrait. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location of objects </h2><p>  The composition of the frame should be constructed in such a way that the important elements of the photo form simple geometric shapes, such as squares or triangles.  This will allow you to focus on the depicted objects.  Such advice is given by professional photographers. </p><ul><li>  Rectangles and squares cause a feeling of stability. </li><li>  Circles and ovals are associated with a calm and cozy atmosphere. </li><li>  The triangle located at the bottom of the frame creates the illusion of stability.  If you put this figure on top of the photo, you will feel a sense of instability. </li></ul><p>  We have already talked about color balance in the frame.  Do not forget that the items must match each other in size and volume.  If you have placed a large object in one part of the picture, then use the angle to focus on the subject in another part. </p><p>  In some cases, the composition of the frame in the photograph needs to be built using the laws of symmetry.  Sometimes the main subject is placed in the center to create an unusual picture.  The composition is centered (an important object is located exactly in the middle), which means that other objects can be placed symmetrically to each other.  If you are shooting a landscape with water, then the rule of symmetry is simply necessary to apply!  Choose a perspective so that the objects and their reflection are symmetrical, and take one of the best shots in your life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.landscape2art.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo composition" class="if uuid-2721205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2721205.jpg"></div><h2>  Golden ratio rule </h2><p>  If we turn to historical data, we can understand that the ancient Egyptians knew about this rule.  The world-famous artist Leonardo da Vinci worked on the study of the properties of the golden section.  What is the essence of the rule?  It is necessary to visually ‚Äúdivide‚Äù the frame into 9 equal parts.  Line intersection points are called attention points.  It is here that the main object of the frame should be located.  You can achieve an interesting effect by placing the horizon at the level of one third of the picture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Professionals advise not to neglect the rule of the golden ratio, because its use will make the photo harmonious.  By the way, in modern cameras it is possible to display such a grid, which facilitates the work of photographers. </p><h2>  Lines </h2><p>  Professionals advise building the composition of the frame using diagonal lines.  This technique is considered one of the most effective, with its help creating high-quality images.  The essence of the technique is to arrange all the most important objects along the diagonals.  This will allow you to "direct" the viewer's eye in the right direction. </p><p>  The human brain perceives the world from left to right and from bottom to top.  People study photographs in the same order, so put important objects in the lower left of the picture.  This will allow you to correctly emphasize the composition in the frame.  The photos presented in this article illustrate this technique. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frame composition" class="if uuid-2721209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2721209.jpg"></div><p>  Lines do not have to be straight.  Using smooth curved lines, you gently ‚Äúaccompany‚Äù the viewer to the main element of the frame.  You can "direct" the gaze of people using intersecting lines.  If the intersection point is in front of the object on which you want to focus, then it will play the role of an arrow.  If the lines intersect outside the frame, then an illusion of free space is created, depth and perspective are added. </p><h2>  Format </h2><p>  When arranging the composition of the frame, remember that for vertical objects you should use vertical frames, the same applies to horizontal objects.  The first option is suitable for shooting portraits, high-rise buildings and towers.  Refer to the horizontal composition if you are shooting a landscape. </p><p>  An interesting way to distinguish a plot-compositional center using the borders of a frame is a technique called ‚Äúframe in frame‚Äù, or framing.  As a frame, you can use windows, hanging branches, doorways and arches. </p><h2>  View and shooting point </h2><p>  Experienced photographers know firsthand how important it is to find the right angle.  Professionals give some tips on how to choose the most suitable shooting point. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stmed.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frame Composition Rules" class="if uuid-2721224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2721224.jpg"></div><ul><li>  When taking a portrait, position the camera at eye level.  If you are photographing a person at full height, place the shooting point at the level of the model‚Äôs belt. </li><li>  Watch the position of the horizon line: it should not divide the frame into two equal parts.  It will be difficult for the viewer to focus on an important object if it is literally divided in half. </li><li>  The camera should be located at the level of the displayed object.  If you photograph an object or person from above, it will seem too small, and vice versa. </li></ul><h2>  Perspective </h2><p>  If you take a photograph without caring about observing the rules of composition, then the picture will turn out two-dimensional.  However, professionals learned to convey volume, or depth of space, or perspective, using three plans: front, middle and back.  Consider this technique in the landscape.  Put small objects like stones in the foreground, trees and shrubs in the middle, and mountains in the back. </p><p>  There is another way to convey perspective.  To do this, put the main object in the foreground or middle ground, and blur the background.  Photographers are advised to use the maximum open aperture to blur naturally. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adventurebikerider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frame Composition Basics" class="if uuid-2721226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2721226.jpg"></div><p>  With experience, you will learn how to convey the depth of the frame using colors and shades.  A sense of volume appears if you place darker objects in the foreground.  It is known that light objects seem farther away, and dark ones seem close. </p><h2>  Traffic </h2><p>  When constructing the composition of the frame, many details must be taken into account, among them - movement.  If you are shooting an object that is not in a static state, you must leave free space in front of it.  The frame will look as if the object had just ‚Äúentered‚Äù into it, an illusion of space will be created. </p><h2>  Practice </h2><p>  Experienced photographers advise beginners to use every opportunity to practice shooting.  The basic techniques for constructing a composition can be learned in a fairly short time, but it is necessary to develop personal experience in creating photographs and constantly increase the knowledge base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativelive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Composition in a photo frame" class="if uuid-2721230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2721230.jpg"></div><p>  This article presented only the basics of frame composition.  This does not mean that all of the above recommendations must be followed implicitly.  You need to know the rules by which the composition is built, and their deliberate violation will allow you to create unique frames. </p>
