Today, the technology took over.  On the screen of any mobile phone, the number of the incoming call is displayed, and if you save it in the notebook, the name of the owner will also be visible.  As a result, even before picking up the phone, a person knows who is calling him and can decide whether to pick up the phone at all. </p><p>  On the one hand, all this is very convenient.  Well, if only because you do not need to introduce yourself once again.  On the other hand, in the event of a conflict, a person may not pick up the phone and it will be very difficult to communicate with him.  Often, for this very reason, many begin to wonder how to hide a number on MegaFon.  After all, the only way to call and remain unrecognized.  This service is called the <span>‚Äúanti-</span> identification <span>number‚Äù,</span> and you can connect it both once and for an unlimited period. </p>

    <h2>  One-time number prohibition </h2><p>  Basically, of course, cell phone customers prefer to call without hiding.  Therefore, it is the one-time prohibition of determining the number that is most popular with them.  It is very easy to use.  It is enough to dial the combination # 31 # before the desired number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Or you can select ‚ÄúCall management‚Äù in the phone‚Äôs settings menu and indicate that the number should not be determined.  Depending on the model, the name of the item may change slightly, but it is present in almost all mobile devices.  It is important to remember that the <span>phone number</span> will not be determined until you cancel the option through the same menu.  And of course, even knowing how to hide a number on MegaFon, you should not abuse this service unnecessarily. </p><h2>  Unlimited Anti-Caller ID </h2>

Naturally, it‚Äôs not very convenient to dial the above combination each time.  And then how to call a hidden number?  MegaFon proposes to connect Unlimited Anti-AON for such situations.  While this service is active, the <span>number will</span> not be <span>automatically</span> detected on the phone display. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  To connect the service, just dial the combination * 848 # or send SMS to the number 000848. You can also contact the company's employees in the contact center, service office or leave a request on the site for help.  True, in this case, you will need to provide your <span>passport data.</span>  And, of course, like any other service, "Unlimited Anti-AON" can be connected through the "Service Guide". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Issue price </h2>

A fee even for a one-time prohibition of number identification was introduced in order to prevent telephone hooliganism.  Most often, such actions are characteristic of children and adolescents, whose mobile account is replenished by parents.  It is unlikely that in this case such behavior will go unnoticed. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So, for a one-time prohibition of determining the number from the account, 5 rubles will be charged for each call (both when dialing a combination and when connecting via the phone menu).  For "Unlimited Anti-AON" the <span>subscription fee</span> is 30 rubles per month.  Moreover, it is debited at a time, on the day of connection, regardless of whether the subscriber used the service or not.  Connecting and disconnecting is free of charge if you do not seek help from company employees. </p><h2>  Service Deactivation </h2>

This also applies to the anti-determinant.  In the case of a one-time prohibition of determining the number, it‚Äôs enough just not to dial the desired combination, and your number will be displayed, as usual.  And if it was installed through the menu of the device, you just need to uncheck the corresponding item.

    <p>  ‚ÄúUnlimited Anti-AON‚Äù can be disabled in the same way as it is connected using USSD, sending a short message or through the ‚ÄúService Guide‚Äù.  In addition, you can contact the company's employees in the contact center or service office.  To disable the service using USSD, dial * 848 * 0 #.  Or you can send an SMS with the text "stop" to the number 000848. </p><p>  It is worth noting that if you need to call once without hiding your number, it is not necessary to turn off Unlimited Anti-AON.  It will be enough to dial * 31 # in front of the desired telephone, and the called party will see who is calling him.  And it will be completely free. </p><h2>  Features of the service </h2>

It is included in the basic package of services, regardless of the tariff plan.  Therefore, it operates without any restrictions, and anyone can use it.

    <p>  However, the cellular company warns: despite the fact that the called subscriber will not see the numbers, the system determines it in any case, and in the case of illegal actions, all data will be immediately submitted to the relevant authorities.  This is usually done if threats to the lives and health of others have been voiced over the phone, or in the case of fraud. </p><h2>  How to find out the hidden number? </h2><p>  MegaFon, understanding those customers who constantly receive calls from an indefinite number, has provided the opportunity to expose such a bully.  So, you can clarify such information in the office of the company.  Any employee with access to the database will be able to inform the owner of the SIM card about all calls received.  You need to have a passport or a driver‚Äôs license with you.  But since it‚Äôs not convenient for everyone to drive to the <span>office, MegaFon has</span> developed a special service called SuperAON. </p><h2>  Service "SuperAON" </h2><p>  The appearance of this service has allowed many subscribers to deal with annoying calls once and for all.  Indeed, thanks to her, there will not even be a question about how to determine the hidden number of MegaFon or another cellular company.  It is enough to connect it using any of the available methods, and everything with each incoming call on the display determines the number of the person who is calling. </p>

You can also use your personal account by selecting the "Options, Tariff and Services" section.  Those who cannot figure it out on their own will always come to the aid of the company's consultants in the office or contact center.

    <p>  After the SuperAON service is activated, 5 rubles a day will be debited from the account every day.  The very same connection and disconnection of the service is free.  After the desired number has been recognized, most people prefer to turn off SuperAON (you can do this via USSD * 502 * 0 #, by sending a message with the text "STOP" to 5502 or through the "Service Guide").  Again, you can turn to a call center or the nearest service office for help. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the fact that most of the cellular company‚Äôs customers know how to hide their number on MegaFon, they are in no hurry to use this service.  After all, it‚Äôs actually very convenient when, picking up the phone, a person knows who he will talk to.  In addition, it is obvious that, having missed an important call, you can always call back later.  With an undetectable number, it is very difficult to find out if the right person called you.  Often the owner of a mobile phone is just uncomfortable talking, for example, on a bus or at a meeting.  As soon as the opportunity arises, he will immediately call you back. </p><p>  Anyway, calling from an indefinite number is simply impolite.  Therefore, even if you know how to hide the number on MegaFon, do not rush to use the anti-identifier. </p>
