    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  For starters, a couple of interesting facts about the city.  Few people know that its name comes from the local dialect, and is translated as "pomegranate."  An interesting fact is that the name of this territory was given in honor of the ancient Greek goddess of fertility (Artemis).  And pomegranate is a symbol of prosperity and fertility. </p><p>  Today, the city, which is located on the Mediterranean coast between Antalya and Alanya, due to the Mediterranean climate, has become one of the most popular resort towns in Turkey among young people and couples with children. </p><p>  Sandy beaches equipped according to the international standard, which almost every year receive the prestigious Blue Flag award, due to clean water and safe swimming, are the main reason for the high rating of this resort area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resort has more than two hundred hotels, built for those who want to spend their vacation time on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, which is the warmest in Europe. </p>
