    <h2>  General recommendations for tourists </h2><p>  All Russians living in the eastern part of the country flock <span>to Primorsky Krai in the</span> summer <span>.</span>  The recreation facilities located here are so diverse that there is a decent choice for each of you.  It is especially crowded on the sea coast in August-September, although the beach season closes here at the end of October.  This is easy to explain, the summer air temperature on the coast is higher than in Sochi, but the weather is very moody.  In June, fog and rain, in July unbearable heat, in the first half of August typhoons are not uncommon.  But then comes the golden season, the velvet season, in which there is no end to those who want to visit the Primorsky Territory.  Recreation centers sell all packages in advance, so do not be surprised if camping will be the only option.  This option is actively practiced by the residents of Vladivostok themselves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are many people resting in this way.  It’s inexpensive and simple: we arrived by car, set up tents and enjoy your vacation.  If you can only afford a weekend trip, this is the best option.  Living in a tent for a week or more is already an amateur.  On the other hand, if you take care in advance, you can book a ticket to one of the best bases.  A huge number of them will make a decent choice for people with a wide range of incomes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation centers of the Primorsky Territory in winter" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/679426.jpg" width="600"></div>

Tourists do not have meals at the base, but there is a grocery store and there are places for cooking.

    <h2>  The picturesque bay of Triosier </h2><p>  Indeed, one of the most beautiful bases of the <span>Sea of ​​Japan.</span>  It has recently opened for tourism, as it was part of the border zone.  So the beauty of these places has not yet been touched by man.  Add to this the lack of industrial centers, and you will realize that you simply cannot find a better place to relax. </p><p>  What is Triozerye Bay?  These are stunning hills that are covered with dense green forest.  These green dunes hide untold treasures, there are a huge number of mushrooms and rare plants.  The coastal waters are full of fish, so even a novice fisherman will not leave without a catch.  Why is this bay so poetically named?  Because on the coast itself, three stunning lakes were created by nature.  These are natural pools, in which the water warms up very quickly.  It is because of this that families with children really like local recreation centers, swimming in the sea can be dangerous, but here you can splash around at least all day. </p><h2>  Holidays in Triozerye </h2><p>  The recreation center "Triozerye" is a rest in a bay of tremendous beauty.  Nearby is a beach 2 km long, and on the contrary - three fresh lakes.  Just next to the base is a sandy strip 100 meters wide.  For vacationers, houses are provided both year-round and exclusively summer.  There is an option to stay in tents that can be installed on the sand strip.  Food vacationers organize themselves, for this special places and equipment are provided.  The base has showers, a volleyball court, tennis court, and a Russian bath. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Bay of Dreams" </h2><p>  A map of the Primorsky Territory provides us with information that there is another excellent recreation center in this bay, which is located 40 km from Nakhodka.  This is an amazingly beautiful place.  The sea with emerald water, quartz sand on the beach, picturesque and mysterious rocks surrounded by impregnable taiga forest.  This is the best setting for a summer holiday, and the cleanest air is truly healing. </p><p>  To accommodate tourists there are three capital buildings with all amenities.  The rooms have bathrooms, furniture, TV.  Vacationers are given the right to use the parking lot free of charge, and medical assistance is provided.  There is also an outdoor shower and pool, sports and playgrounds, you can additionally rent saunas with fonts and gazebos with barbecue facilities.  The price includes breakfast and lunch, dinner can be ordered additionally. </p><p>  More quiet and calm are the Vek and Sea Breeze bases, which are also located in Triozerye Bay.  These are great places to retire with a family or a group of friends.  Food is organized at the request of the guests, you can cook it yourself.  There is a rental of sports equipment and water equipment.  In general, you can have a great time for fairly modest money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center ocean" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/679432.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Closed "East" </h2><p>  This is truly one of the most secluded holiday destinations.  This plays into the hands of others, except for visiting tourists; none of the outsiders can enter or leave the territory.  This is an isolated case, if you do not take into account the elite cottages on the beach.  The recreation center "Vostok" is located near Cape Unapproachable.  On its territory there is a two-story summer-type hotel for 20 people.  Bathrooms and showers are located on the ground floor, divided into male and female.  But since the hotel is designed for only 20 people, this is not such a big problem. </p><p>  There is a grocery store where you can buy the necessary products, a large kitchen will allow you to cook dinner, without disturbing the rest of the guests.  If something is not in the store, you can place an order. </p><p>  Most of all, those who are delighted with hiking will enjoy it here.  The hilly terrain offers for excursions.  Not far from the base is the famous Mount Sestra and a sandy beach.  Diving equipment and a variety of sports equipment are offered for vacationers, and you can have fun at the disco all night.  If outdoor activities and tourism is your motto, then here you are. </p><h2>  Slavic Bay </h2><p>  It includes the bays of Nerpa, North, Cormorant, which sheltered many beautiful recreation centers.  But one of them I want to note especially, is the recreation center "Slavyanka".  It is located on the coast and is very suitable for families because of the shallow water.  For accommodation of tourists 60 wooden houses on the beach are offered.  This is an amazing place where you can relax in harmony with nature.  Self-catering, and the absence of noisy parties only adds a highlight to your vacation.  But you will be offered a large number of excursions to the most beautiful natural monuments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="andreevka recreation center" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/679433.jpg" width="578"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Recreation centers of Primorsky</span> Krai in winter </h2><p>  Almost any of the local bases can be visited all year round, but the ski resort is especially interesting.  It is located in a picturesque place of the Ussuri taiga of the Primorsky Territory, 16 km from the village of Shtykovo, among centuries-old pines and cedars, next to the Kuchelinovsky reservoir.  It is amazing at any time of the year, but if you decide to visit the recreation centers of the Primorsky Territory in winter, then you better not find a place. </p><p>  There are four ski slopes with a total length of 3100 m on Mount Kuchelinova. Equipment rental is available.  You can come for one day, and in order to warm up, use the dining room.  Or move into one of the provided houses.  The recreation center "Eagle" is an amazing place of silence and tranquility, majestic slopes and stunning forests.  The unique air, drunk with the aroma of taiga, allows you to forget about illness and fatigue.  You can get to the recreation center by personal transport or by using the services of travel agencies. </p><p>  Among the activities - not only skiing.  You can rush with the breeze on the inflatable supersanks - tubing, visit the skating rink or rent cross-country skiing.  If you are cold, you are invited to take a steam bath in the bathhouse, have a good rest, and then go on an excursion into the forest.  Together with instructors you will take an amazing journey deep into the taiga.  For fans of difficult trips or seasoned hunters, this is an unforgettable adventure. </p><p>  In the summer, there is the opportunity to fish on the shore of the reservoir, ride catamarans, as well as walk and sunbathe.  Sports fields will help make relaxation more memorable. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Whatever recreation center you choose, the impression of it is invariably positive.  The abundance of holiday homes allows you to choose the level of comfort that is acceptable to you.  Tourists note that, despite the cost of the permit, the rest is great.  Judging by the reviews, students and pensioners, athletes and people with disabilities come here with pleasure.  All of them find the conditions suitable for themselves and get wonderful impressions.  Especially experienced tourists note the beauty of the local nature, mild climate and stunning clear sea.  Looking through numerous reviews, it is difficult not to notice that there is not one in which to complain about poor staff or an impolite attitude.  Apparently, exclusively friendly and welcoming people work at the bases of the Primorsky Territory.  Of course, the level of service at many bases is far from 5 stars (although there is an exception - elite cottages on fenced beaches), but, as tourists emphasize, this makes the rest more natural, without any artificial gilding. </p>
