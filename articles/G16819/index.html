    <h2>  Repair of the refrigerator "Don".  Common breakdowns </h2><p>  Having studied the reviews of qualified masters, we can conclude that the units of the Don company break extremely rarely.  In general, problems can occur only with freon oil.  It is used for filling into the compressor.  After a certain operating time, capillary tubes may become clogged.  Naturally, this affects the operation of the unit.  If this failure occurs, then the temperature regime will be observed only in the freezer, but not in the refrigerator. </p><p>  Repair the device will not be a problem.  To do this, simply replace the capillary tube and oil. </p><h2>  Refrigerator Don: customer reviews </h2><p>  In their reviews, customers highlight a bright and original design.  Ergonomics also deserve praise.  The space inside the chambers is divided correctly, due to which many products are placed in the refrigerator.  It is also worth noting that in two-chamber models, a freezer is conveniently located. </p><p>  Using modern technologies, the manufacturer was able to achieve optimal conditions for food storage.  Also, reviews provide inexpensive maintenance and repair.  This refrigeration equipment breaks extremely rarely, however, if this happens, then the replacement of failed parts will not require large financial investments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spare parts for refrigerators don" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1925448.jpg" width="520"></div>
