    <p>  Man is the highest creation of nature, its ruler.  People fly into space, do science, create and destroy, improve and simplify.  However, humans, by their anatomical and physiological structure, belong to the class of mammals.  From animals, the only difference is the presence of reason.  If civilization, everything that man has created over the millennia of his presence on Earth, will perish, then from our most varied requests: spiritual, aesthetic, social, creative, only physiological needs will remain - that which is characteristic of the entire animal world. </p><p>  In <span>human behavior there</span> are two sides that are very connected with each other: regulatory and incentive.  It is the motivation associated with <span>needs and motives that</span> makes a person behave appropriately.  The main source of a person‚Äôs activity is his need, they stimulate behavior, direct him to find what he wants.  Need is a condition of an individual when he needs certain conditions that he lacks for normal development and existence.  We can say that a person is constantly in a state of need for something, which is each time filled with specific content (the subject of need). </p><p>  No matter how high the spiritual aspirations of a person, he needs to eat in order to maintain vitality;  sleep in order to restore them;  drink in order not to die from dehydration;  satisfy the instinct of reproduction so that the human race does not disappear. </p><p>  No matter what heights progress has achieved, without the full satisfaction of these basic natural needs, the quality of life of each individual will be low.  At one time, the theory of psychologist Abraham Maslow from the USA became popular.  He deduced the theory of human needs, the so-called "pyramid of needs."  The scientist argued that physiological needs are the most important, basic.  If they are not satisfied, then this can lead to the destruction of the whole organism, illness, death, finally.  In order to survive, a person needs quite a bit, but in order to feel comfortable, <span>be healthy</span> and live long, you need a little more. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Anatomical - physiological needs of a person is a set of conditions under which you can survive: </p><p>  - physical existence, if there are no calamities, hunger strikes and serious illnesses; </p><p>  - thermal comfort, a safe level of radiation (constant normal body temperature); </p><p>  - clean <span>air (composition</span> that does not lead to anomalies of the genetic plan); </p><p>  - drinking water with the necessary set of chemicals; </p><p>  - good, calm sleep and lack of stress; </p><p>  - healthy, high-calorie, tasty food. </p><p>  Only when these needs are met do they need security, recognition, etc.  If a <span>person has good</span> sleep, nutrition, and his thirst for water and oxygen is quenched, then he will have physiological needs of a higher level.  These include sexual needs.  Without it, no one will die, but the dissatisfaction of intimate desires leads to a violation in the human psyche and even to deformation of the person. </p><p>  Satisfying basic needs is a very important part of life, but if you leave only that, then what makes us different from animals?  We can feel the physiological needs of our body without the help of other people.  We will definitely feel hunger, fatigue, <span>lack of air</span> or water.  But how to satisfy the thirst for fame alone, with whom to share creative success, the triumph of sports victories? </p><p>  The spiritual need for faith and love, a sense of conscience, selfless service to the idea and people, the desire for knowledge, creativity, perfection, self-realization - this is characteristic only of man. </p><p>  Human needs are a broader concept than physiological ones.  It includes all spectra of a person‚Äôs spiritual and rational activity.  These needs are unlimited, and a person can satisfy them only in a society of their own kind. </p>
