Rest in Melikhovka</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not only the residents of our country, but, of course, guests from near and sometimes far abroad, most likely, more than once I heard about a great vacation in the Rostov region.  The recreation facilities of this region actually correspond to the requirements of all, even the most moody, travelers.  Why so?  What is the secret of such amazing popularity? </p><p>  This article will not only tell its readers in detail about vacations in the Rostov Region (recreation facilities will be given as an example), but will also share some secrets on how to plan a vacation so that it is remembered by every vacationer only on the positive side. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The Rostov Region, which provides the most wonderful <span>seaside vacation</span> , is located in the south of the East European part of Russia, in the Lower Don basin. </p><p>  Geographically, it is part of the Southern Federal District.  It is worth picking up a map to note that the region borders on the Voronezh and Stavropol regions, the Krasnodar Territory (in the north), Kalmykia (in the south), the Volgograd Region (in the east) and Ukraine (in the west).  It is washed by the warm and rather shallow Azov Sea. </p>

    <p>  Rostov-on-Don is the administrative center of the region, the area of ​​which is quite impressive and amounts to 100.8 thousand km².  Administrative units, 15 cities and 37 settlements, are located at a fairly close distance from each other. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The <span>Don River</span> flows <span>through the</span> territory of this region of Russia <span>, the</span> length of which is 1870 km.  One cannot but pay attention to the fact that the local Tsimlyansk reservoir is considered one of the largest in the country. </p><p>  The tributaries of the Don - the Manych and <span>Seversky Donets rivers</span> - are also popular with vacationers, due to the huge number of fish and the amazing nature of the region. </p><p>  Also there are numerous forests and lakes. </p><h2>  Why is rest in the Rostov region (recreation centers, hotels, motels, housing rented for a long term) so in demand? </h2>

    <p>  According to experts, the territory of the Sea of ​​Azov in the Rostov Region is the most climatically unique corner of the Russian Federation.  Residents of the plains of Russia are usually very easily, gently and painlessly tolerate acclimatization when visiting this place. </p><p>  Such rest (Rostov region) will especially benefit the kids.  The Sea of ​​Azov is warm and shallow, the coast is clean, the fruits are ripe and familiar, which means that in principle no troubles can be expected.  Summer is usually dry, windy and hot.  In winter it becomes cloudy, but not very cold. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in the eastern regions, summers are hotter and winters are colder than in western ones.  This is still worth considering, especially when planning a vacation in the offseason. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  January is the coldest month, with an average monthly air temperature of about -5 ° C ... -9 ° C, in July - about + 22 ° C ... + 24 ° C. </p><h2>  When is it better to go on vacation to the Rostov region? </h2><p>  According to experienced travelers, the best time to organize a vacation in the Rostov region (recreation centers here, by the way, work year-round) is, of course, summer. </p><p>  But May is the best time for sightseeing and sightseeing tours. </p><p>  July and August are hot months, they will delight those who decide to opt for outdoor recreation, on the shores of the Tagansky Bay or by the river.  It should be noted that lately, rest on the Don (Rostov Region) has become more and more popular. </p>

    <p>  In September, it is best to choose some ecological route.  For example, go for a walk in the forest for mushrooms and berries, or go fishing.  The most unfortunate time for a trip to the Rostov region can be called the period from October to November.  At this time of the year it’s still warm, but it often rains, it’s damp and overcast. </p><p>  Winter in these parts is neutral in temperature, i.e.  sharp changes are not observed.  There is also no great snow cover, which, unfortunately, does not make it possible to engage in any winter sport. </p><p>  The only positive factors for rest in the Rostov region in the cold season is the lack of noisy crowds of tourists and relatively low housing prices. </p><h2>  What is it, rest?  Rostov region.  Sea of ​​Azov </h2><p>  On the golden beaches of the Azov coast, you can enjoy clean sand and incomparable fresh air, filled not only with the aromas of the steppe herbs, but also with healing elements such as calcium, iodine, bromine. </p><p>  The Sea of ​​Azov is characterized by a stable and moderate water temperature, which allows you to regularly take sun baths in almost any quantity. </p>

    <p>  I would also like to dwell on such an amazing place as the village of Melikhovka (Rostov Region).  Recreation facilities, <span>motels, boarding houses</span> and hotels located in this place, as a rule, are very popular among vacationers. </p><p>  For example, on the picturesque bank of the Don River there is the Melikhovsky sanatorium.  Around the clock there are accepted for treatment and rest, both adults and parents with children.  For accommodation there are double and triple rooms with different price levels and the service provided.  There is a common room with a TV, a buffet, a library, a gym with exercise equipment. </p><p>  The sanatorium treats diseases of the nervous system and respiratory organs.  In the hydropathic institution there is an opportunity to enjoy pearl and ozonized baths, a bath with sea salt or needles, underwater massage, various types of showers (Charcot, circular, ascending), as well as ozokerite and mud therapy.  A separate massage room offers therapeutic, vacuum and cosmetic massages.  In the sanatorium, you can also undergo a course of treatment for osteochondrosis. </p><h2>  Do you like to fish? </h2><p>  Well, of course, there is far from Melikhovka in this area.  The Rostov region recreation facilities can, as they say, offer for every taste and budget. </p><p>  For example, not far from the village of Novostroenka (Neklinovsky district), near the river Wet Sambek, there is a suburban fishing complex “New Vasyuki”.  The territory of the base is quite large.  Today, cottages have been built on it, a private beach with access to the pond has been landscaped. </p>

They have a living room, kitchen, bedroom, toilet, bath and sauna, satellite TV, DVD player.  All rooms are heated, which makes it possible to stay there at any time of the year. </p><p>  In addition, the fishing base "New Vasyuki" has everything you need for both winter and summer fishing.  There are even rowing boats for hire. </p><p>  Fresh air filled with the aromas of the steppes and meadows, free access to water at any time of the day, peace and quiet make the rest pleasant and complete. </p><h2>  In the places of our ancestors.  Decent rest on the Don </h2><p>  The MELEKHOV country club is located 135 km from Rostov-on-Don and 10 km from the small town of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. </p><p>  On this territory, well-known director Sergei Gerasimov shot some scenes from the movie "Quiet Flows the Don". </p><p>  Later, in honor of the main character of this novel, <span>Grigory Melekhov,</span> it was decided to name the country club.  It was at this amazingly beautiful canyon lake with crystal clear water that the MELEKHOV club was opened in June 2007. </p>

    <p>  As you know, in ancient times, the coast of the Don was inhabited by Cossacks.
