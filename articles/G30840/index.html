    <p>  One of the best places for economical living, judging by the reviews of tour operators, and vacationers themselves, is Karon Village Hotel Bungalow 3 * located near the beach of the same name.  Having laid a hand on the heart, we can say with confidence that it combines all factors harmoniously and justifies 3 * in the name.  Of course, you will not find here a spacious pool and a huge territory for walking, but is it all so important on a paradise island surrounded by the waters of the <span>Andaman Sea ?!</span> </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Karon Beach is one of the largest in Phuket (about 5 km) and is located in the western part of the coast.  The distance to the city center is 20 km, and the airport is 45 km.  The beach is conditionally divided into two parts: small and large Karon.  The latter extends to Cape Sai, which separates it from Kata Beach.  Just a 10-minute walk from the large Karon beach, the Karon Village Hotel 3 * is surrounded by other complexes, souvenir shops and restaurants.  The center of vibrant nightlife, where young people prefer to relax, Patong, is only 5 km away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The residence complex was built in 1993, and the last restoration was carried out in 2013. The hotel covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã28,000 square meters.  m and consists of five hotel buildings and individual bungalows, the total number of rooms is 101. The architecture does not claim to be unique and extraordinary, but it is very pleasing to the eyes and neat.  All rooms in the hotel are divided into two categories: ordinary and bungalows, a total of 50. The area is small, but with a garden and a swimming pool, which has a special section for bathing children. </p>

    <p>  The bungalows in Karon Village Hotel 3 * <span>(Thailand, Phuket,</span> Karon) are located along it with a small gap.  Whitewashed walls and a <span>green roof</span> make them look like small fabulous houses, lost in the greenery of tropical plants. </p><p>  The internal and external design of the hotel is quite modest, but tasteful.  Preference is given to natural colors and natural materials - these are ceramics, stone, wood.  Lush palm trees and flowering exotic plants complete the picture. </p><h2>  Rooms &amp; Bungalows </h2><p>  The rooms are monotonous but neat.  The floor is covered with ceramic tiles, wooden furniture, there is a table and <span>folding chairs.</span>  Each room has a balcony, which allows you to enjoy the evening city in silence and cool.  Cleaning is done daily.  Both the rooms and the bungalows are equipped at the same level: a refrigerator, air conditioning, a TV with cable TV and several Russian channels, a connected bathroom with a shower (hot and cold water).  Karon Village Hotel 3 * (Phuket) does not offer its guests a luxurious stay, but in clean and comfortable rooms you can relax and spend time in comfort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  You need to keep in mind that there are no safes in the rooms, it is only at the reception desk, which complicates the stay a little.  It works on a schedule, so you need to either plan your expenses or have money with you.  Check-in is from 14:00, and check-out is until 12:00. </p><h2>  Holiday Prices </h2><p>  The cost of living depends on the choice of room.  To begin with, it is worth noting that Thailand is a resort country with a typical division by season and not season, in connection with this, the prices during the year will be slightly different.  So, according to the official website of Karon Village Hotel 3 *, for a regular room in a 2 or 3-story building, you need to pay 600 or 1600 baht per day in summer (from May 1 to October 30) and winter (from November 1 to 30 April) period, respectively.  An individual bungalow will cost a little more - 1000 or 2000 baht.  If you suddenly need an extra bed, then you will be sure to provide it for a fee.  In the summer season, an extra seat will cost 300 baht, and in the winter - 500 baht. </p><h2>  A restaurant </h2>

    <p>  The hotel‚Äôs star rating does not allow it to operate on an all-inclusive basis, therefore it offers its guests only breakfast in its own restaurant at certain hours: from 07:00 to 10:00.  The menu is fixed and somewhat monotonous.  The administration officially announces that there are no highchairs.  Lunch and dinner are available on site in the same restaurant for a fee, or in other institutions of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel and service </h2><p>  Karon Village Hotel 3 * has a nice clean pool with a jacuzzi and a children's slide.  It is not too big, but there is enough space to soak under the bright sun.  Around him are sun loungers and umbrellas surrounded by greenery.  Opening hours - from 10:00 to 19:00.  The service is quite modest.  In the room or right by the pool, the hotel staff provides massage services, including Thai (extra charge). </p><p>  Right at the hotel, everyone can rent a motorcycle or car for independent movement around the island or use the services of a travel agency to purchase sightseeing tours.  For an additional fee, laundry and ironing services are provided, as well as safe rental.  Pets are not allowed in the hotel. </p><p>  On the territory there is a small mini market where you can buy everything you need: from food to toiletries and, importantly, sun cream. </p><h2>  What is nearby? </h2><p>  The Karon Village Hotel 3 * (Phuket, Karon) offers mainly a place for an overnight stay and measured relaxation by the pool.  And for Thailand, this state of affairs is considered normal.  They come here primarily for the magnificent sandy beaches and warm sea, exotic excursions and outdoor activities.  If you belong to the category of tourists who prefer independent and fascinating trips to all guides and tour operators, then you will certainly be pleased with the proximity of some amazing places in Phuket to the hotel. </p><p>  First of all, beaches.  There are three main and most famous on the island: Karon, Kata and Patong.  It is not difficult to get to the first one, as already mentioned above, since the Karon Village Hotel 3 * is located on the second coastline.  The other two will be delivered by taxi or local tuk-tuk.  The distance is small, so the cost will be affordable: to Kata Beach - about 4 km, to Patong - 6 km.  In the first case, you will find yourself in a paradise, and most importantly, a quiet place, in the second - in the thick of events, where a bright and noisy life boils around the clock. </p><p>  Secondly, just 11 km away is the Butterfly Garden - an amazing and unique place.  Here all insects are observed and grown in natural habitat.  The admission fee is low - within 300 baht.  After an interesting walk, you can go to the on-site cafe and souvenir shop, the Museum of Silk. </p><h2>  Karon Beach: what to see? </h2>

    <p>  It occupies an intermediate position between the too noisy and cheerful Patong and the calm measured Kata Beach.  Karon is famous for its picturesque views and several interesting sights.  Of course, the territory is quite large, but if you find yourself there, be sure to pay attention to the following objects.  First, the temple of Suwan Khiri Ket.  A colorful and interesting building with sculptures of two snakes at the entrance, traditionally snow-white stone walls and a roof in red and gold colors.  He works every day and is ready to receive guests, but it would be nice for women to have a scarf with them.  It is located near the Karon Center, 500 meters from the beach itself. </p><p>  Secondly, Dino Park.  It is located on the border between <span>Kata Beach</span> and Karon.  An interesting place from where you can watch the bustle taking place on the street in coolness and silence. </p><p>  Thirdly, the market.  One of the most popular places near the beach.  It is located in front of the Buddhist temple, works on Tuesdays and Saturdays from four in the afternoon until 22:00.  The range of goods is definitely aimed at tourists and contains such a huge number of items that it is not possible to list them.  You will find everything here, from pleasant and sweet heart trinkets to natural Thai cosmetics, ointments based on snake venom, the finest work of wood, silk and much more. </p>

    <p>  But the Thai market would not have been without street food.  This is a special category of goods, without trying it, you will not feel the real taste of Siam.  Walking along the grocery rows of the market for our compatriots is akin to going to the museum.  A huge number of exotic fruits of a wide variety of tastes from amazing honey pineapples and mangoes to very specific durian - this is what you need to buy and try, especially since the prices are quite low.  Well, when buying souvenirs, do not forget to bargain, Thais treat this with a share of humor and are always ready to give a little. </p><h2>  Karon Village Hotel 3 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  For people planning their holidays, the impressions of those who have already visited the designated place and spent a certain number of days at the hotel are always of great interest.  Most guests note the good location and privacy, the silence that prevailed at night and did not interfere with sleep, which is important, because in Phuket, with the onset of twilight, life is just beginning. </p><p>  Tourists note the modesty of the hotel from a good point of view.  There is no pathos, everything is extremely concise, which leads to a low and affordable price for rooms and bungalows.  Service and housekeeping are of good quality, all the staff are friendly and calm.  As guests note, the Karon Village Hotel 3 * hotel (Phuket) is the best for those who are going to spend a minimum of time in the hotel, and it is also an ideal option for a budget holiday.  The price is fully consistent with the quality. </p><h2>  Separately about food </h2><p>  If you like rich and hearty breakfasts with a buffet, then you, according to visitors, are not here.  A modest but tasty scrambled eggs with a slice of bacon and tea or coffee with toast and jam.  The place where food is cooked can be called a restaurant with a stretch of the imagination, but few people were upset.  There are fruits, but in small quantities, and their choice is limited.  For the unpretentious - a good start to the day, but for the moody nearby there are many cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  However, a large mass of tourists who visited the Karon Village Hotel 3 *, left positive reviews.  If you are for a calm, modest and budget holiday without any frills, then here you are.  You can enjoy the full Thai cuisine at restaurants nearby, while entertainment and a stunning vacation will offer as many as three beaches. </p><h2>  Karon Village Hotel 3 *: who is suitable? </h2>

    <p>  All visitors almost unanimously answer this question - for couples for a romantic getaway and, to a lesser extent, for families with older children, as the service is not provided for small ones.  Privacy and a relaxing atmosphere in Phuket are great for honeymoon trips and relaxing together.  Indeed, here the world seems to freeze, and time flows slowly and carefree.  The scorching sultry sun, the turquoise sea and the snow-white creaking sand underfoot, paradise fruits and amazing cuisine will give you an unforgettable vacation. </p>
