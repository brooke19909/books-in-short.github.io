He was considered a sage, and he just did his job.  He photographed such great personalities as Albert Einstein, <span>Winston Churchill,</span> Ernest Hemingway, <span>Nelson Mandela.</span>  His bewitching portraits "breathe" with the characters of captured people. </p><h2>  Yusuf Karsh: biography </h2><p>  Southeast Turkey, a place that residents call "Bible Paradise."  In the ancient city of Mardin, where houses resemble an Eastern fairy tale, where fruit trees grow in abundance, where people of different faiths live peacefully for centuries, in December 23, 1908, Yusuf Karsh was born. </p><p>  But soon the idyll came to an end.  In 1915, the persecution of Armenian Christians grew into a terrible phenomenon - genocide.  Yusuf survived the execution of two uncles, the death of his sister from typhoid and farewell to his father, who was forced to serve in the Turkish army.  Authorities confiscated all property, including the house.  The family was given only one donkey and ordered to leave their native Mardin forever. </p><p>  Karshi found a new home in Syria, but parents wanted a better life for their son.  It was decided that the child emigrates to the United States by all means.  But it became known that the quota for the Armenians had been exhausted, and the boy was sent to Canada to uncle. </p>

    <h2>  First 4 million dollars </h2><p>  16-year-old Yusuf Karsh went ashore of Halifax on the eve of 1925.  George Nakash greeted his nephew in his native language.  Later, in his book of memoirs, he writes that these words became the only thing that was familiar in a strange world for him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They left the port in a horse- <span>drawn</span> sleigh <span>.</span>  On their harness hung bells that rang loudly, and people walked so happy that their joy intoxicated the young man. </p><p>  The snow-covered city of Sherbrooke, where George Nakash lived, became a refuge from problems.  Soldiers with machine guns didn‚Äôt go here, there was no poverty, disease and persecution.  Despite his eastern appearance, even classmates took the guy warmly and, in order not to suffer from remembering a foreign name, called him Joe.  Yusuf began to learn a new language, get used to the new climate and build a new life. </p><p>  Fortunately, everything that I had to go through in Mardin did not embarrass Yusuf; he absorbed tolerance towards others with his mother‚Äôs milk.  Father always said to his son: "If it‚Äôs hard to restrain yourself, throw a stone at the offender, but miss." </p><p>  After six months of <span>life in Canada, the</span> guy begins to work in his uncle's photo studio.  George gave his nephew the easiest camera, and Yusuf began to shoot everything around. </p><p>  One of the classmates secretly sent a picture to the contest - he won a prize.  The boy handed Karsh the well-deserved 50 dollars.  Yusuf gave $ 10 to his classmate, and sent the remaining amount to his parents.  He later admits that at that time, these $ 40 seemed to him 4 million.  And he walked happy for several weeks, proud of his act. </p><h2>  Boston.  John Garoe </h2><p>  The nephew's talent did not leave uncle indifferent, and George decides to send Yusuf to the famous John Garo.  The fashion photographer was part of the Armenian diaspora and gladly accepted the new student.  On Boyleston Street, the guy studied printing processes and features of photography. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  He watched Garo engage in dialogue with those he was filming;  visited museums and art classes.  His favorite place was the library and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. </p><p>  The entire elite gathered in the studio of Garot, a young photographer studied communicating with celebrities.  A six-month internship lasted 2 years, after which he returned to Sherbrooke.  At first he was an assistant to his uncle, then he worked as an assistant to John Powys, who subsequently left him his studio. </p><p>  Yusuf Karsh began an independent career in 1933.  He had everything except connections, money, customers and reputation.  Despite the fact that he knew how to talk with any person, regardless of his status and had a photographic talent, because of the Great Depression, he had to borrow small amounts more than once in order to support his own business. </p>

And he just wanted to make a good portrait. </p><p>  It is not known whether Churchill was dissatisfied, or forgot about the upcoming shoot, but he gave only 2 minutes to the process and started smoking a cigar.

The photographer decided to take a desperate step, he pulled out a cigar, darted to his camera and took just such a frame, which depicts an accustomed politician. </p>

    <p>  However, Churchill liked his impudence, and he allowed to take a few more pictures, but already smiling. </p><p>  This shot has become very popular.  Despite the fact that he received $ 100 for him, it was this photo shoot that brought him fame. </p><h2>  Portrait of greatness </h2><p>  In 1943, Karshu made a trip to England, where he made more than 40 portraits of the military.  After the Second World War, he collaborated with Life magazine, for which he shot celebrities. </p><p>  Thanks to connections and fame, Yusuf Karsh was able to transport the family from Aleppo to Canada in 1948.  Calmed down for their fate, he completely immersed himself in work.  For 10 years of hard work, he made the best portraits, and in 1958 he was included in the list of 10 greatest world photographers. </p><h2>  The greatest portraits of Yusuf Karsh </h2><p>  Seeing people through and being able to demonstrate it to others was his talent. </p><p>  She was chosen from the ballet group to play the role of Gigi.  When Yusuf photographed Hepburn, he noted her refined receptivity, to which Audrey spoke about her life during World War II.  A few years later, the Kremlin allows Karsh to make a portrait of Brezhnev, but with one condition: the photo should be as beautiful as hers. </p>

    <p>  He also photographed Ernest Hemingway.  According to Yusuf, he expected to see one of the heroes of his novel, but having met with him in 1957, he noticed a peculiar tenderness in Ernest.  He had not yet photographed such timid people - the man was brutally beaten by life, but at the same time invincible. </p>
