  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Real estate development trends in Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow is the leader in the number of houses that are commissioned annually.  And if earlier developers tried to "squeeze" a new house into the area crowded with buildings, now the creation of residential complexes is popular.  Realtors noted the demand for such <noindex>  <span>apartments in Moscow</span> </noindex>  .  And this is no coincidence.  After all, buying an apartment in such an area opens up a number of advantages for you. </p><p>  The choice of housing that matches the desires and possibilities.  Developers offer apartments from economy to luxury.  The buyer can also deposit money for his future apartment in a house that has not yet been commissioned.  This will save a lot.  The decrease in prices is also affected by the volume of construction of the customer.  There is a dependency: the more square meters put into operation, the cheaper they cost.  Large construction companies often create profitable social programs: they give out loans, allow them to pay money for an apartment in installments, and give discounts to pensioners and low-income families. </p><p>  Comfort.  The construction of a residential complex involves, in addition to the housing stock, the construction of shops, educational institutions, medical institutions, and pharmacy centers.  Everything is at hand.  One has only to leave the entrance. </p><p>  Thoughtful architectural design.  Roads, parking lots, gardens, playgrounds are placed organically.  Each square meter is used to the maximum benefit.  Separate zones are created for recreation, sports, and cars. </p><p>  Reliability.  There are always new communications in the new house.  But with point building, the new building is connected to the old system.  It is because of this that residents often suffer from breakthroughs in sewers, interruptions in the supply of electricity and hot water.  The construction of substations, new individual heating systems is mandatory for the construction of a residential complex.  A new pavement is also being created. </p><p>  Environmental friendliness.  Due to the size of the structure, residential complexes are most often located on the periphery.  This will allow you to live in an ecologically clean area, breathe fresh air at a relatively small distance from the center. </p><p>  Those wishing to purchase real estate in Moscow, taking into account all these advantages, choose an apartment in a residential complex.  And often people want to live away from the bustle of city life, buying apartments in picturesque places.  Sometimes the choice of buyers dwells on real estate in the suburbs.  After all, the presence of our own transport will allow us to get to work in Moscow in a quarter of an hour. </p><p>  In 2015, real estate prices in Moscow will largely depend on the situation in the foreign exchange market.  A significant drop in apartment sales is expected. </p></div></article>
