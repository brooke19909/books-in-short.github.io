    <h2>  What does shift work mean? </h2><p>  So, this is such a schedule of labor activity, in which the time spent by a person at work differs on different days.  It is installed on those institutions, enterprises and industries whose activities are carried out around the clock.  And the specialists supporting it are changing - some are going to rest, while others are stepping in.  Well-known examples include the fire, rescue, police and medical services.  Or blast furnace production - there the stoves have been working for several years without interruptions. </p><p>  But during shift work, the 40-hour labor week rule is also respected.  That is, all the labor time that a person was in his place, cannot exceed the mark of 40 hours. This is stated in article 91 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  That is, if a person has plowed for more than 13 hours for more than 13 hours, then he is on rest for the next four days.  They include two legal days off and compensation for overtime in the workplace.  And, of course, payment of work with a shift work schedule is directly related to this topic.  But more about that. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Payment </h2><p>  How is work paid for a shift work schedule?  Initially, it is calculated.  Either on the basis of salary, or using the so-called tariff hourly rates. </p><p>  Here is an example of the second case: an hour of human labor costs 400 rubles, for example.  For three consecutive days, he worked for 13 hours.  In this case, remuneration for work in a shift schedule is determined by a simple formula: 400 x 13 = 5,200 p.  for one day.  When does a person receive his money?  There are two options.  The first - immediately after the end of the shift.  It is usually practiced in cases where employees are not officially employed.  And the second option is once a month. </p><p>  If the institution has a salary system, then the principle will be slightly different.  Standard - advance payment and salary every 15 days.  And always a fixed amount.  With the exception of processing premiums, of course, they are always added.  And to calculate them, the accountant finds the tariff rate (per hour), and then the total monthly salary.  For example, a month a person is supposed to work 150 hours.  His salary is 52,500 p.  At an o'clock - 350 r.  If in a month he worked 10 hours, then the amount calculated according to the formula will also be added to the salary: 10 x 350 = 3,500 p.  That is, in this case, his salary for that period will be 56 tons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recycling Details </h2><p>  The main task of an accountant is to determine the number of hours that a person has been in his place in excess of the norm.  Based on this, the payment for work is determined with a shift work schedule. </p><p>  There is a weekly way of accounting.  You only need to know about the maximum standard <span>for the duration of the working week</span> for an employee.  All this is spelled out in regulatory enactments. </p><p>  If the company practices summarized accounting, then it will be necessary to determine the number of hours worked over the entire period.  And this nuance is very important.  Since hours spent by a person in a workplace above the norm go beyond the statutory framework.  And they are considered processing only at the end of the reporting period.  And for clarity, an example. </p>

    <h2>  Quarterly Periodization </h2><p>  So, a standard <span>workweek</span> lasts 40 hours.  If the time during which people worked in shifts is calculated in a cumulative way (+ accounting for the reporting period for the quarter), then the normal duration will look like this: </p><ul><li>  in March - 165 hours; </li><li>  in April - 187 hours; </li><li>  in May - 176 hours; </li><li>  total - 528 hours </li></ul><p>  And if a person worked 160 hours in the first month, and 186 in the second and third months, then the total will be 532 hours. 4 more than expected.  And in this case, payment under a shift work schedule will have to include compensation for overtime hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Amount of allowances </h2><p>  It is important to note that payment for work with a shift <span>work</span> schedule <span>overtime,</span> in theory, should be carried out in larger amounts.  This is spelled out in Article 152 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  The first two hours are compensated in one and a half size.  Subsequent time - in double.  Moreover, this is the minimum that the employer must observe.  And so he can reward employees for their overtime work in a larger amount. </p><p>  The minimum is determined based on the person‚Äôs hourly <span>tariff rate</span> .  Let's say 60 minutes of his work cost 350 rubles.  For four consecutive days, he stayed for three overtime hours.  Total - 9 hours are obtained in excess of the norm. Of these, six are paid in one and a half amounts, and three - in double.  Here's what it looks like: (350 x 1.5) x 6 + (350 x 2) x 3 = 5,250 rubles in addition to the salary. </p><p>  But it is more difficult to calculate the allowance if a person receives a salary in accordance with the official monthly salary.  How it's done?  The salary is divided by the standard number of hours for the whole year.  That is, in 12 months.  And if a person receives 40,000 rubles a month with a 40-hour work week, then he works 1974 a year. Total: 40,000 / (1974/12) = 243.16 p.  What happened is his hourly rate.  However, in order not to bother much, the accountant can resort to the method that was noted by attention at the beginning - to take into account the monthly salary and divide it by the number of hours worked. </p>

    <h2>  Rest Compensation </h2><p>  It is also worth noting attention, talking about how the work is paid for with a shift work schedule.  In addition to surcharges added to the main salary, the time that a person spent in his place in excess of the norm, he can be compensated by rest.  That is, an extra weekend.  And many prefer their money, taking the opportunity to organize a short vacation.  This nuance implies the 152nd article of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  However, this is not always possible.  After all, we are talking about enterprises operating continuously.  And it is far from always possible to allocate for one or another employee not only several, but even one unscheduled day off.  Therefore, material compensation is a priority.  And to get a day off instead of money, you need to make a written statement. </p><h2>  About restrictions </h2><p>  There are other nuances that a shift schedule implies.  Remuneration, of course, should be carried out without delay and in full, but even taking into account the double tariff for overtime, the employer does not have the right to involve citizens belonging to certain social categories in long-term labor. </p><p>  These include minors, part-time employees (who study and work) and pregnant women.  This is stated in the 99th article of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Also, processing should not exceed 4 hours for two consecutive days.  True, many violate this rule (also noted in article 99) - even employees, of their own free will, because they want to earn more.  But over the year, the amount of overtime should definitely not exceed 120 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Non-working days </h2><p>  The law designates dates that are officially weekends for everyone.  However, as mentioned earlier, there are enterprises operating continuously.  They are allowed to attract their people to work.  However, the <span>payment of holidays</span> with a shift schedule is different.  Moreover, according to several criteria. </p><p>  For night shifts, for example, there is a surcharge of at least 20% - this is in addition to the allowances that are already put on labor on holidays. </p><p>  If the rate is hourly, then a person simply gets twice as much as usual.  If in normal times 60 minutes of his work cost 300 rubles, then at the weekend the "price" will increase to 600 rubles.  That is the compensation.  If a person receives a ‚Äúsalary‚Äù salary, then for work on the day off he will be charged for one more day.  The principle is the same - in one case and in another case, they will transfer twice as much money.  This usually happens when paying for holidays with a shift schedule. </p><p>  The Labor Code also encourages people to distinguish between public holiday and ordinary.  If a person was called on the day when only he was supposed to rest, payment goes without compensation.  The only exception is the night shift. </p>

    <h2>  Night hours </h2><p>  Well, how the work is paid for during shift work on holidays is clear.  Finally, I would like to note the notorious night hours.  To do this, refer to the 96th article of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  It is said that the night time is considered to be from 22:00 to 06:00.  And people working in this period, in theory, work in conditions that differ from normal. </p><p>  Night work is paid by the hour.  And the amount is prescribed by the head in the local regulatory act.  Therefore, when signing a contract before applying for a job, it is necessary to discuss this point separately. </p><p>  Well, that‚Äôs all the information you need to know about remunerated remuneration.  The main principle here lies in the total calculation of hours worked.  And this is the main thing to remember. </p>
