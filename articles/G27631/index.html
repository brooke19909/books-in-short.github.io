    <p>  In the vicinity of Kokkini Hani you can see the ancient monastery of St. John the Evangelist.  It looks more like a fortress than the monastery of monks.  Its thick walls kept him from pirate raids.  His story is interesting.  Currently, five monks live in the monastery, who look after the territory of the monastery, are engaged in gardening and growing vegetables.  Services in the monastery are conducted daily.  This is how we briefly describe the rest in Kokkini Hani, which is accessible to everyone. </p>
