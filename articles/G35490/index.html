But who invented the iron for the first time?  What kind did they originally have?  The following article describes the history of the iron. </p><h2>  Ancient times </h2><p>  According to scientists, the history of the iron begins in antiquity.  <span>The Aztec tribes</span> most likely used ordinary stones for this purpose, which they put on clothes and left for some time.  The stone served as a press, and the clothes were smoothed out under its weight. </p><p>  To smooth out the folds, our ancestors stretched a wet cloth and dried in the sun.  The Greeks in antiquity not only smoothed, but also created <span>folds on clothes.</span>  To give the fabric originality, they invented pleating, and this effect was achieved with the help of heated metal rods. </p><p>  The Romans used metal hammers for alignment.  They mistresses "knocked out" the folds of <span>wet clothes.</span>  The Chinese in the IV century used a device that looked like a frying pan. </p><p>  The Slavs were not limited to one tool.  Ironed things with the help of a ‚Äúroller‚Äù - sticks with a handle - and a ‚Äúruble‚Äù - a corrugated board.  The clothes were wound on a ‚Äúroll‚Äù, and a ‚Äúruble‚Äù or, as it was called, a ‚Äúpralku‚Äù was rolled from above.  Through such actions, not only smoothed clothes, but also softened them, because the fabric consisted of coarse natural threads. </p>

    <h2>  Middle Ages: Coal Iron </h2><p>  As you can see, the need for an ironing tool was almost always.  Perhaps even <span>cavemen</span> used sticks or bones to smooth out the skin of a newly killed mammoth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Middle Ages, the history of the iron continues its course.  In Europe they used a brazier, which, most likely, came from China.  Hot coals were poured from above and, holding the handle, drove along clothes, smoothing wrinkles.  It was unsafe to do this, because the emitted coals could seriously injure a person and burn the product. </p><p>  In the XVI century, charcoal irons came to replace the braziers, they were also called steam irons.  Such devices had an opening case for coals, on top was a handle, and on the sides were small holes.  Some also had a pipe that provided better traction. </p>

    <p>  The bottom of the iron cooled much more slowly than in a brazier.  To prevent the coals from cooling, they blew into the side holes.  These irons were incredibly heavy, but sometimes to kindle the heat had to swing them in different directions.  The uniformity of the heating of the base was provided by a grill, which was laid inside, under the coals.  Steam irons, although more convenient than braziers, still often lost their coals and could ruin the fabric. </p><h2>  Cast iron </h2><p>  Gradually developing fashion and weaving.  The styles of outfits are becoming more complicated, and the fabrics are thinner and more tender.  Ordinary sticks with handles and dangerous frying pans are no longer suitable.  First, a heated pig-iron blank was put inside the <span>steam iron</span> (instead of coal).  After that, the design was completely replaced with a cast iron. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  True, such an instrument weighed about 10 kilograms, so it was used mainly for coarse cloth. </p>

    <p>  Smaller irons were used for thin fabrics.  Cuffs, hats, costume details were ironed with various tailor irons and curling irons.  There were even special glove irons, repeating the shape of the gloves.  Here is such a rich variety. </p><p>  Antique cast iron irons should first be thoroughly heated in an oven or on fire.  This lasted quite a long time, sometimes up to an hour.  Therefore, the inventors improved the much-needed device by making the handle removable.  In this case, two irons were already used: one was heated, and the second was ironed, which provided significant time savings. </p><p>  Solid cast irons were made in Russia until the middle of the 20th century, and the last produced iron with interchangeable handles dates back to 1989. </p><h2>  Works of art </h2><p>  In addition to useful functions, old irons had aesthetic.  Making such an ‚Äúaggregate‚Äù was a creative process.  Handles, lateral parts and tops were made in relief, often they were decorated with ornaments.  The surface was covered with other metals, such as bronze, to give greater grace to the cast iron block. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For especially noble families, irons were made to order.  They were decorated with copper and silver inserts, wooden carved handles. </p>

    <p>  To get such an instrument needed in the household, you had to spend a lot of money.  They were expensive and were an integral part of household life, passing from parents to children by inheritance.  In Russia and Ukraine, irons were placed next to the samovar, on a lace tablecloth, showing them like a beautiful vase or painting. </p><h2>  Irons on alcohol </h2><p>  In Germany, in the 19th century, irons working with alcohol were invented.  A metal box was attached to the device, into which alcohol was poured.  Thin tubes inside the iron were attached to a box of alcohol.  Fuel poured over them inside, then burned by hand and burned. </p><p>  Alcohol models were a true innovation.  They were easier, it was more convenient to use them.  In Russia, for such an iron, you could give 10 cast iron.  Yes, and no one wanted to translate alcohol in vain, so such an invention did not take root.  In addition to alcohol, there were also kerosene irons with a similar principle of operation. </p><p>  In Novgorod <span>A. Semenov</span> came up with a unit operating at the expense of water.  From above, a kettle was attached to it, which heated the water, and the sole of the iron was heated from it. </p><h2>  Gas irons </h2><p>  At the end of the XIX century, gas was actively used.  Irons appear which are heated by its combustion.  The gas cylinder was attached to the device, and inside it was connected to the burner with a metal tube. </p><p>  The design was supplemented by a pump, which was sometimes accompanied by a fan.  They were located on the lid of the iron.  For the mechanism to work, it was wound up with a key.  The fan started spinning, the pump pushed fuel from the barrel through a metal tube.  Many holes in the tube allowed gas vapor to enter the burner.  The iron was set on fire, and the heat from the combustion of gas vapor heated the sole. </p>

    <p>  The use of such a mechanism probably made life easier, compared to heavy weight cast-iron irons.  Only the safety of the device was called into question.  Negligent treatment, and ordinary carelessness led to frequent accidents - fires and explosions. </p><h2>  Miracle electricians </h2><p>  Electricity has become an incredible gift to humanity.  With its help, life was much simplified, and new devices were invented one by one.  The first electric iron was presented to the world by Henry Seeley on June 6, 1882. </p><p>  The basis of the design was a heating arc, hidden in the body of the device.  It was located between two <span>carbon electrodes,</span> to which current was supplied.  The design was by no means perfect, so you had to use the iron very carefully - you could get an electric shock. </p><p>  Later, the arc with electrodes was replaced with a spiral, which was much better insulated.  Modern iron manufacturers still use this design.  Only the details change, each year improving the once invented mechanism. </p>

    <p>  Thermostats were installed on household appliances that monitor the temperature, the metal base became glass-ceramic, various additional functions and modes appeared. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  In memory of the past, there are museums around the world where you can find old models of irons.  In Russia, in Pereyaslav-Zalessky, the iron museum grew out of an antique store.  It opened in 2002.  The director of the museum was actively buying up irons, having spent more than 30 thousand dollars on this.  Most of them were purchased at the Moscow Vernissage in Izmailovo. </p><p>  The collection is represented by about 200 exhibits.  Here you can find cast-iron, steam, and heating models.  The museum even hosts the iron festival several times a year. </p><p>  In the Ukrainian city of Zaporozhye, the Iron Museum was recently opened.  Employees of the "Equestrian Theater" came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcollecting old models of irons by accident.  After four years of collecting, enough exhibits have gathered to open the museum. </p><p>  The institution has about 300 irons, some of which were donated by the museum from Pereyaslav-Zalessky.  Here you can learn in detail about the history and development of a much-needed household appliance. </p>

    <p>  Museums of irons are also in the capital of Latvia, in the city of Grodno, in Belarus, in France, in Roubaix.  They are also collected in the USA, the Netherlands, and Japan. </p><p>  One of the largest museums is French.  It collected about 4,000 exhibits, including models of the 16th century.  The museum even has stylized linen rooms, as well as machines for ironing things. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The history of the iron goes back centuries.  Constantly improving, the devices changed their appearance.  The invention of irons has come a long way: from hazardous, coal-filled models to bulky cast-iron, from alcohol to electric.  Now the iron is an ordinary phenomenon and quite commonplace, but before they were not only used in everyday life, but also served as a decoration for the house.  Modern models use the design that was invented back in the 19th century, but still continue to change their appearance and details. </p>
