  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to install programs on iphone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Installing various programs on an iPhone is not easy, and sometimes dangerous.  Especially when it comes to third-party utilities.  If you do not follow the correct procedure in this matter, that is, the risk of installing the application incorrectly.  And even completely get unnecessary problems, such as problems with the phone.  With general information on how to install programs on the iphone, the user will reduce his efforts to a few simple steps. </p><p>  <strong>Option number 1</strong> </p><p>  First of all, we need to disable the built-in auto-lock function in the iPhone, which very often interferes with downloading utilities.  To accomplish this, the user needs to look into the phone settings.  There are such items as ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù and then ‚ÄúAuto-lock‚Äù.  We also need it: by disabling this function, you can no longer worry that the phone will go into sleep mode right in the middle of downloading some useful and necessary program. </p><p>  The easiest way to <span>install the program</span> on the iphone is to use the corresponding function of the phone itself.  Usually, the utility we need is already built in initially, so the owner only needs to run it.  The application is called Installer.  It helps both download the program and install it after that.  To perform this task, turn on the utility and see the window that opens with available applications.  Of these, the user is prompted to select the desired one, after which it will be necessary to confirm the solution by pressing Install again. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, the program will independently find and install everything you need, then it will reboot the device itself.  This completes the installation, and the downloaded utility is ready to work.  But, unfortunately, this list does not contain everything you need.  What if the user needed a utility that wasn‚Äôt in the device?  How to install programs on the iphone, which are not provided by the developer, is described below. </p><p>  <strong>Option number 2</strong> </p><p>  Of course, the necessary programs can be found and downloaded directly from the Internet.  Quite often, after saving to a computer, they have an archive format.  Before starting to work with it, the user will need to unzip the contents.  In any case, the final file must have the extension ‚Äú.app‚Äù.  Also, for this method, you need the iPhone Browser utility (or similar in function).  She will help us work with the internal contents of the iPhone. </p><p>  The procedure is as follows.  First, you need to connect the phone to the computer and wait for the latter to see the device.  Only after that, you can run the installed iPhone Browser.  When it opens, the window can be temporarily minimized, since first you need to move the file from the archive (the application for which everything was started) to a folder on the phone called Applications. </p><p>  Thus, we will come close to the main question - how to install programs on iphone.  After the preliminary preparation, very little remains to be done.  At this stage, we already have the desired installation file in the phone, but for the proper operation it is not enough just to install the program.  First you need to download through the above Installer another small utility - Mobile Finder.  Its purpose is to give the executable application access to the system.  So, install and run the specified program.  In the settings, the Application Launch function will be registered, which must be disabled. </p><p>  Next, you just have to go to the folder with the installed application and find there a file containing its name (but without the extension at the end of the name).  By clicking on the icon, we will see a menu in front of us, it contains the Modify item.  To set the access right, you need to check the boxes in front of all the items or leave the bottom two fields empty (if you need 755 rights).  Save the selection.  Everything, you can safely run our utility.  Now you know how to install programs on the iphone, while not spending so much time and effort. </p>
