    <h2>  In the Dahl dictionary </h2><p>  The Russian lexicographer in his multi-volume work outlined the meaning of this word briefly, concisely.  Arap is a black man from hot countries.  Therefore, by this word it was customary to mean a native of Africa.  But not every man with an exotic appearance in Russia was called arap. </p><h2>  Servant </h2><p>  Black people first appeared in Russia during the reign of Mikhail Fedorovich.  They did not scurry idly through the palaces.  On the contrary, they had a clear range of responsibilities.  Arap is a court servant of the 18th century.  One of the migrants who received such an honorary title was Pushkin's great-grandfather.  The writer dedicated to him the literary work "The Arap of Peter the Great." </p><h2>  How did Pushkin‚Äôs ancestor end up in St. Petersburg? </h2><p>  Arap is the godson of Peter I. The infant son of the Ethiopian king was captured by the Turks.  Then, somehow, he ended up in the Sultan Seral, from where S. Raguzinsky took him out.  In Constantinople, he stayed on royal orders.  What prompted us to bring an African lad from a distant, hot country to cold Russia is not known.  But according to historical documents, which Pushkin relied on in writing his book, Peter I was imbued with fatherly love for an Ethiopian boy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A guest from the African continent was baptized according to Orthodox traditions.  They called him Abraham (Abram).  Godfather, of course, was Peter himself.  The tsar did not spare even his own middle name for the pupil.  From now on, the arap was called Abram Petrovich. </p><h2>  Royal valet </h2><p>  Arapchonok showed an amazing love of science.  At first he served as a court servant.  But, appreciating the ability and resourcefulness of the godson, Peter made him a personal secretary and valet.  And later he sent to Europe to study engineering. </p><p>  By the way, his surname - Hannibal - was received by the St. Petersburg Moor in honor of the great commander.  He had the most direct relation to military affairs.  In particular, accompanied Peter during the Battle of Poltava.  When Hannibal mastered engineering, he returned to Russia, where he took part in the construction of the <span>Kronstadt fortress.</span>  <span>Abram Hannibal</span> showed himself excellently as a teacher.  He taught mathematics and became the author of a book on military engineering. </p>

    <h2>  After the death of the king </h2><p>  For several years, Hannibal was in disgrace.  This happened after the death of the king.  Alexander Menshikov suddenly rose, than were the dissatisfied with the close associates of the late tsar.  Hannibal sided with the protesters.  As a result, he was sent to Siberia.  But soon Hannibal returned to St. Petersburg and was even able to get a new appointment. </p><p>  Throughout his life, the famous Russian Arap led memoirs in French.  But before death, destroyed them.  Abram Hannibal is a bright figure in Russian history.  He is known not only as the ancestor of the great writer, but also as a nobleman whose attitude to serfs was extremely humane for the eighteenth century. </p>
