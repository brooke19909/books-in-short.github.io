  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Saxon Switzerland", national park: photos, reviews, how to get?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even in the middle of carefully built-up Europe you can find a ‚Äúpiece‚Äù of wildlife - this is the Saxon Switzerland National Park. </p><p>  Today, there are more than 2 thousand national parks located in 120 countries on the entire planet.  They are all completely different.  Some are very small, for example, Hamra (Sweden), which occupies only 0.28 square meters.  kilometers.  And there are huge ones, like "Northeast Greenland", under which 972 thousand square meters are occupied. </p><p>  But the most important thing that unites all these parks, their goal is to protect nature from the harmful effects of man.  People are allowed into such places, but under full control, to still preserve the natural heritage for posterity. </p><h2>  Germany and Europe </h2><p>  In Europe, there are about 300 parks, and in Germany there are 16. And this is an additional confirmation that even with a high population density, it is possible to preserve oases of wildlife. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.synnatschke.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saxon Switzerland in winter" class="if uuid-2294625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2294625.jpg"></div><h2>  "Saxon Switzerland" </h2><p>  This park area is located in Saxony, near Dresden (Germany).  Occupied territory - 93.5 square meters.  kilometers.  Here is a unique landscape, mainly mountainous, represented by Elbe sandstones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is believed that earlier on the site of the mountains was the sea.  At the end of the Cretaceous, the sea receded, and mountains formed under the influence of the wind and erosion processes.  Today, these are bizarre sand figures, dark gorges and narrow valleys. </p><p>  The park was founded in 1956, at that time the country had a program to restore and protect national natural zones.  The official foundation date is 1990. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, millions of tourists came here, and the authorities had to restrict access to the park.  There are areas where visitors are not allowed at all. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  You can get to the Saxon Switzerland park by train, from <span>Dresden for</span> some 30 minutes on the way.  The territory of the natural zone begins 15 kilometers from the border of the city, in a southeast direction. </p><p>  The Germans call the gates of the park the city of Pirna, in which only 40 thousand people live.  Most of the buildings in Pirna, like Dresden, were built precisely from sandstone mined from the Elbe Mountains.  <span>The park zone</span> extends up to the borders with the Czech Republic, where a similar park is located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="1photo1day.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Path in the park" class="if uuid-2294604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2294604.jpg"></div><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  In ‚ÄúSaxon Switzerland‚Äù unique plants grow.  And where access to visitors is limited, in the eastern part, rare animals live, such as a marten, otter, kingfisher, dormouse and black stork. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are special ecological trails in the park.  Where ordinary travelers can see snakes and vipers, deer and bats.  In ponds you can see trout and salmon. </p><p>  The park has many viewing platforms, which offer amazing views of the expanses and unique nature. </p><h2>  Bastei Fortress </h2><p>  Most reviews of Saxon Switzerland are related to Bastei.  This castle is located at an altitude of 305 meters above sea level, on the right bank of the Elba River.  This fortress was first mentioned in 1592.  Since 1800, tourists began to come here.  From the observation deck overlooks the winding riverbed and the K√∂nigstein fortress, the village of Reiten.  If you are lucky and the weather is clear, you will be able to see the entire territory of the German part of the park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bohemian-switzerland.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bastei Bridge" class="if uuid-2294607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2294607.jpg"></div><h2>  Bridge </h2><p>  An equally famous attraction of Saxon Switzerland is the Bastei Bridge.  It has been popular for over 200 years.  It was built in 1824 from wood.  After 2 years, the first stalls appeared on the bridge.  And in 1851 they carried out a complete reconstruction and built a sandstone bridge. </p><p>  The artist Friedrich Caspar immortalized this architectural creation on his canvas, and the photographer Krone German left a commemorative plaque on one of the rocks of the bridge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The path that runs along the bridge is called the Artists Trail.  This is a road of 112 kilometers.  With the increase in the number of tourists, protective fences appeared on the bridge, and a restaurant appeared instead of the hut. </p><p>  The length of the Bastai Bridge is 76.5 meters; it runs through the deepest gorge (40 meters). </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelnotesandbeyond.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koenigstein Saxon Switzerland" class="if uuid-2294610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2294610.jpg"></div><h2>  Fortress </h2><p>  <span>K√∂nigstein Fortress</span> in Saxon Switzerland is another popular destination.  It is located on a rocky plateau, the height above sea level is 240 meters.  In the middle of the castle is the deepest well in all of Saxony.  He also has the status of the second deepest well in Europe. </p><p>  The first mention of the structure was found in a letter from King Wenceslas I (Czech Republic) of 1233.  In those days it belonged to the Czech kingdom.  Due to the important commercial value, the fortress was expanded.  The castle was even visited by Peter I. </p><p>  In 1459, the borders were clearly defined, and the fortress passed into the possession of the Megrassen Margrave (border of the German Empire). </p><p>  During the First and Second World War, the castle served as a place where prisoners of war were kept.  Also in the Second World War, the art gallery of Dresden was hidden here. </p><p>  For visitors, the doors of the fortress were opened in 1955.  Now there is a military exposition, a restaurant and a souvenir shop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Dickelbers, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stolpen Castle" class="if uuid-2294617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2294617.jpg"></div><h2>  Stolpen Castle </h2><p>  Arriving at the park, you should definitely visit this impregnable castle, which was built in the XII century.  More precisely, it was cut down in a basalt wall.  The main problem for the builders was that they could not supply water to the castle.  For a long 22 years, the miners tried to break through the well, and they still succeeded.  For 1 day, it was possible to break through basalt by only 1 centimeter.  Previously, prisoners from high estates were kept here.  And in one of the towers contained the favorite of Augustus the Strong - Anna Cosel. </p><h2>  Mountaineering </h2><p>  The magnificent mountain landscape of Saxon Switzerland simply attracts climbers with a magnet.  However, at the beginning of the XX century, special rules were introduced in the park for mountain lovers, which are aimed at preventing the destruction of sandstone.  For example, the use of rings and ropes is possible only as insurance, but not for moving along the route.  No other auxiliary means on the territory of the Bastai Mountains can be used, the same wedges and magnesia.  All mountains that are allowed to climb are already equipped with safety hooks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bohemian-switzerland.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saxon Switzerland Valley" class="if uuid-2294606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2294606.jpg"></div><h2>  River, waterfall and tram </h2><p>  The Elba River flows through the entire park; it has a winding channel.  To get to the other side, moorings are equipped from which ships, boats and old wheeled steamers depart.  It is from the water that a beautiful landscape opens onto the majestic mountains, and the slow movement of water transport allows you to enjoy the local beauties as much as possible and take great photos. </p><p>  There are many excursions to Saxon Switzerland.  So, from the city of Bad Schandau you can go by mountain tram to the Lichtenheiner waterfall itself, although since 2010 only half the way, the rest will have to be walked. </p><p>  Previously, it was a small threshold.  In 1830, a dam was placed on the creek, which is opened to lower the accumulated water.  Today, the dam is opened every 30 minutes, but only for 3 minutes. </p><p>  The park has a unique tram line called Karnichtalban.  This is a monorail track that has several rides.  The starting station is the city of Bad Schandau.  The tram was launched in 2010, but due to frequent flooding, the line had to be cut, and the cars move along a shorter route - 7 kilometers.  However, over these kilometers you can see half-timbered houses, picturesque cliffs and the rapid flow of the river.  Therefore, even riding a tram, not a single tourist will leave without a photo of Saxon Switzerland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Bund Schandau" class="if uuid-2294622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2294622.jpg"></div><h2>  Resort </h2><p>  Band Schandau is not just a city on the border of the park and the Czech Republic, but a real modern resort.  The first references date back to the year 1445, and already in 1467 the locality receives the status of a city.  And since 1800 it is already an official resort.  The city is famous not only for hotels, but also for its own tram line.  The main attraction of the city is the central square, where buildings have been preserved since the Renaissance.  There is a botanical garden, where more than 1,500 unique plants are collected. </p><p>  Also in the city there is a ‚ÄúStone of the Ice Age‚Äù, on which there is an inscription that in this place the ice cover of Scandinavia ends. </p><p>  There are many rehabilitation clinics in the city, most of which specialize in orthopedics and treatment of the skeletal and muscular apparatus.  There are sanatoriums specializing in cardiovascular diseases and other pathologies.  In the clinics of Bund-Schandau frequent guests are world-class stars, in particular, Elbresidenz is a favorite place.  Some hotels even made films. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.8981957" data-lng="13.871632500000032" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/3/9/1139.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Saxon Switzerland is located on the border of two states: Germany and the Czech Republic.  If you go from Prague, the road will take 125 kilometers.  If you leave Dresden, then only 30 kilometers. </p><p>  If traveling from the Czech Republic, it is best to rent a car and drive along the E55 highway.  Approximate travel time is 1 hour 20 minutes.  If you get by public transport, you should go to the city of Bad Schandrau or Rathen, where, in fact, you can stop.  There are no direct trains in this direction, so you need to be prepared that you will have to make at least 1 change.  You will still have to take a bus from Bad Schandau to the park, and Rathen is located on the Alba River, and on the other side - the park. </p><p>  There is a train connection between Dresden and Rathen, and the journey time is 30 minutes.  The frequency of trains is every hour.  Already in the city you can catch a ferry and get into the park. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the goal of creating the park is completely contrary to tourism, Saxon Switzerland nevertheless has 400 kilometers of paths for pedestrians, while 75% of the territory is closed to visitors.  In addition, almost 50 kilometers are provided for cyclists, and 12,600 routes have been created for mountaineering enthusiasts. </p>
