    <p>  The structure of sociological knowledge by different authors is determined in different ways.  Thus, various approaches are reflected in the writings of Comte, Osipov, Sorokin, Durkheim and many others. </p><p>  For example, Sorokin represented the category of general doctrine in the form of a definition of a social phenomenon or of society itself, a description of its main characteristics, an analysis of the interaction process.  The structure of sociological knowledge, in his opinion, also includes a description of modern theoretical directions and teachings on the <span>methods of sociology.</span> </p><p>  In the system, Sorokin also singled out social policy, genetics, and mechanics as components. </p><p>  Social mechanics, he called the study of patterns that manifest themselves in social phenomena. </p><p>  Social genetics is the doctrine of the origin and development of both society itself and its institutions: family, language, religion, art, law, economy and other things.  In addition, this component studies the main historical trends that appear during the development of society and its institutions. </p><p>  Public policy is a formulation of methods, an indication of the means and techniques by which it is possible and even necessary to improve public life. </p><p>  According to the famous Russian sociologist Osipov, the structure of sociological knowledge is presented in a slightly different way.  In particular, it includes interdisciplinary and social studies.  The latter are methods, methods, statistics, mathematics.  The system also includes branches of sociology, social processes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another famous Russian sociologist, Yadov, expressed in his writings a slightly different view.  Thus, the structure of sociological knowledge that he proposed is the most suitable and applicable to practical sociological problems. </p><p>  Thus, Yadov singled out the general concept, special theories, and applied direction, which includes technology and research methods. </p><p>  General sociology, according to Yadov, focuses on the study of the social sphere, phenomenon or process in general and the use of acquired knowledge in practice.  The applied area specializes in the study of certain, individual aspects.  Technology and methodology is the study and use of methods, techniques, technologies in practice. </p><p>  <span>Modern sociology</span> is represented by a multilevel complex of theories, <span>types of knowledge,</span> interconnected with each other.  The following are traditionally distinguished as its elements: </p><ol><li>  Theoretical <span>Macrosociology.</span>  <span>This</span> industry is based on a specific socio-philosophical concept. </li><li>  Theories based on applied concepts used in the study of one or another subsystem of society. </li><li>  Microsociology based on empirical knowledge. </li></ol><p>  According to macro-sociological theories, phenomena and processes in society can be learned by understanding society as a whole.  These theories focus on exploring the scope of a particular human activity.  They study the types of social communities, the sphere of direct relationships (behavior, motivation, <span>public</span> communication <span>relations</span> , etc.).  Such theories, in particular, include Mead's <span>symbolic interactionism</span> , Garfinkel's entnomethodology, Homans exchange theory, and others. </p><p>  The structure of sociological knowledge includes methodological and worldview principles.  These include, in particular, the doctrine of the subject itself (or of a particular branch of the science of society), knowledge of methods, the development and application of techniques.  Among the principles, the doctrine of sociological knowledge itself, its levels, types and forms, as well as the research process, its functions and structure, is also singled out. </p>
