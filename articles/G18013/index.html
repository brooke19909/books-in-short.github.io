    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  As already mentioned, is the Best Delta in Mallorca.  And to be more precise - in a village called Majoris Desima. </p><p>  This place is very convenient from a tourist point of view.  Very conveniently developed transport links - just 10 minutes drive to the airport of Palma de Mallorca.  It, in turn, is located in close proximity to the city of the same name, which is the largest on the whole island.  There is where to walk and what to see, and this is important for tourists. </p><p>  And all the famous attractions are 15-20 kilometers from the hotel.  Mallorca Cathedral, Palm Yacht Club, Cala Major Beach, BCM Magaluf Club, Aqualand El Arenal, Aquarium, Es Portishol are just some of them. </p><p>  But the most important thing is that the hotel is in an idyllic location with incredibly beautiful landscapes, in addition, 800 meters from the beach, where guests can get on a specially designed free bus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  The rooms in Delta 4 * (Mallorca) are modern and aesthetically decorated.  The apartment is 26 square meters.  m, they all have a balcony and a bathroom en suite. </p><p>  Inside each such room there are two huge 2-double beds and one folding sofa.  There is a climate system (heating + cooling), a widescreen plasma TV with satellite channels, a radio, a dressing room.  In the hygienic room, by the way, there is not only a shower, but also a bathtub and a bidet.  Toiletries with a hairdryer are provided free of charge, as are towels and linen. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  What about the price?  Cost of living in Best Delta (Mallorca) varies depending on the season.  As an example, we can take the period of the end of summer-beginning of autumn.  A week of living in a room for two people in this case will cost about 45,000 rubles (without the all inclusive service).  This price includes 10% VAT, but additionally you will have to pay a tourist fee.  It is 1.65 euros per day per person. </p><p>  If guests intend to pay for the all-inclusive service, then they will have to pay an order of magnitude more - about 75,000 rubles.  You can order three meals a day, then it will come out about 20 thousand cheaper. </p><p>  This is the price for two.  But it is worth knowing that if there is a child with guests, then for him, in the case of an ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù order, you will have to pay extra from above.  Total week stay will cost approximately 95,000 p. </p><p>  But this is a supplement for food.  It is important to mention that children at this hotel can stay for free.  Moreover, a cradle is provided for babies up to 1 year old.  Also free.  Only if it is necessary, you need to inform the administration in advance. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  Basically, people staying in Delta (Mallorca, Spain) give potential guests only one piece of advice - be sure to come here at least once.  You won‚Äôt have to regret the decision made; a vacation will leave only pleasant memories. </p><p>  But still a few nuances are worth considering.  Firstly, it is better to ask for a room on a higher floor - from there the view is better.  Secondly, you need to take special shoes for the beach with you, since sea urchins can meet in the water, right near the shore, stepping on which you can spoil your entire rest.  And thirdly, it‚Äôs better to immediately agree with the administration about renting a car.  Having a car will give tourists a great opportunity to travel around the picturesque island as a whole.  And he is rich in such beautiful places that there will be enough impressions for a year in advance. </p>
