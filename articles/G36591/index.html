    <p>  The convenience of such a service is to provide the ability to automatically top up your own mobile phone account when achieving a minimum balance, payment of various bills and services, fines and loans.

After choosing this service and going through the necessary procedure, all previously set parameters, of course, are canceled.  All conditions and necessary information can be obtained on the organization‚Äôs website. </p><h2>  Reasons for disconnecting </h2><p>  The reasons for refusal can be a variety of factors.  The most unpleasant drawback when making payments to mobile phones is that if you don‚Äôt use the provided phone number for 3-6 months (depending on the circumstances of the agreement), the operator transfers it to another person who with the number will gain absolute access to your accounts through the ‚Äúmobile bank‚Äù ‚Äù, As well as a balance replenishment service.  This situation is the most important reason for disabling the auto balance top-up service. </p>

    <p>  So, we go into the message section on your phone, create an SMS message, where in the column ‚ÄúTo‚Äù we indicate 900 and enter the text ‚ÄúAutomatic payment‚Äì‚Äù without quotes.  Also, the message may be in the form of "Avtoplatezh‚Äì".  In cases when several payment cards are connected to the phone number, you must indicate at the end of 4 the final digits from the card number.  It is also possible to indicate the phone number for which you want to disable the offer, but this parameter is optional.  If you decide that it is better to send the entire text in full with all the characteristics indicated, your SMS will be as follows: "Auto payment - 7777777777 (XXXXX)", where 7777777777 is a phone number without 8 (or +7), and X is the final 4 digits from No. cards.  The sent message will be processed, and you will receive a message from the bank stating that the cancellation of the service was successful. </p><h2>  Disconnection through ATMs and terminals of Sberbank of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  This method is no less convenient than all the others.  For its implementation, it is necessary to visit the nearest ATM or terminal of the organization and perform certain actions to disconnect.  So, the algorithm of actions: the card must be inserted into the ATM and go to the "Disable auto payment" section.  Then follows the selection of the carrier and the entry of the direct telephone number.  Then, you must confirm your actions using the PIN code on the card.  If all of the information you entered is correct, the ATM will print a receipt to accept your application.  In the very near future, "Auto Payment" must be disabled.  After the necessary coordination, the service will be deactivated.  It should be noted that there is one caveat: if you mistakenly provide information, you will not be informed by the banking organization.  In such cases, you can repeat the shutdown operation using the previous method or go to the bank branch for support. </p><h2>  Disconnect through a bank branch </h2><p>  This method is suitable for those who for some reason are afraid to perform independent actions.  When you visit Sberbank, do not forget to bring your passport and all necessary documents with you.  If you don‚Äôt know how to disconnect ‚ÄúAuto Payment‚Äù from Sberbank via phone (or by other methods), bank employees will help to solve the problem. </p><h2>  Disconnect via telephone hotline </h2><p>  Another type of service deactivation is to make a direct call to the hotline number 88005555550, the call is free.  After connecting with the operator, it will be necessary to report all the necessary data.  To get the desired result, simply answer the employee's questions.  You will also have the opportunity to ask your own questions, for example, about the function of a mobile bank (Sberbank). </p>

After the operator answers, follow all instructions and answer the necessary questions with the obligatory indication of your telecom operator. </p><p>  - When contacting bank branches, go to a consultant with a question about how to disconnect Auto Payment from Sberbank. </p><p>  - If you disconnect online, if you have a registered subscriber account (on the operator‚Äôs website), go to your own office and go to the ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù section for further detailed and understandable instructions if you really want to disable the ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù service.  Sberbank will promptly fulfill your request. </p><p>  Remember that if you incorrectly specify your operator, you will mislead the system and cannot disconnect! </p><p>  Example: how to disconnect the "Auto payment" service from Sberbank of a Beeline operator?
