The island of Crete enjoys special love among travelers, whose culture is as attractive as the beaches of Hersonissos, the unofficially recognized tourist center of the island. </p><h2>  History of Hersonissos </h2><p>  There are many cities on Earth whose age is estimated in millennia, and not centuries or years.  Similar ancient settlements is full of Greece.  Hersonissos, located in the north of Crete - one of them.  Founded 3,500 years ago in the era of the Minoan kingdom, it reached its greatest prosperity during the reign of the Romans, and then the Byzantines. </p><p>  Even in antiquity, the inhabitants of the city were forced to leave it to re-establish in the depths of the island.  This was due to numerous earthquakes and pirate attacks, which alternately destroyed it. </p><p>  New Hersonissos was built 2 km from the coast on Mount Haracas, which was a natural observation point for the water surface.  The view opening from it made it possible to notice in advance a threat looming from the sea in order to hide in time from the enemy. </p><p>  For a very long time, the city remained a small provincial place where time seemed to stop until, in the 20th century, tourist investors paid attention to it.  The beaches of Hersonissos, its proximity to the capital of the island of Heraklion and the airport became the reason to start building hotels here. </p><h2>  City today </h2><p>  Today this place is well known in the world as a youth tourist center.  Those who are attracted to Greece, Hersonissos may slightly disappoint.  Here, unlike mainland tourism, an atmosphere of endless fun, club life, discos and youth movements reigns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For couples with children, the beaches of Hersonissos are available from May to July, since it is at this time that there is relative peace and quiet.  From July to the end of August, teenagers and students from all over the world come here to hang out and make new friends. </p><p>  In September, the velvet season begins, which is appreciated by those travelers who do not tolerate the heat and prefer a quiet vacation with warm weather. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in Hersonissos, almost no ancient architecture has been preserved.  The reason for this is the long Turkish rule, in which the new authorities did not consider it necessary to leave their cultural heritage to the locals.  If in the 19th century there was still an amphitheater, an ancient aqueduct and the remains of buildings of the Minoan and Roman era, then after the war and the liberation from the Turkish yoke, almost nothing remained of them.  The new Greek government allowed even the local population to use the stones left on the site of ancient buildings for their needs. </p><p>  But outside the city there are more than enough sights, as guests of the island note: </p><ul><li>  Lychnostatis is an open-air ethnic village.  It is located just half a kilometer from the city and is a working workshop where you can see how household items and weapons were made in ancient times.  This is one of the few museums where all exhibits can be touched.  Admission for an adult will cost 5 ‚Ç¨, and for a child under 12 years old - 2 ‚Ç¨. </li><li>  Skotino is a cave consisting of several halls in which <span>stalagmites and stalactites of</span> completely unimaginable forms are located.  Archaeological surveys carried out in the mid-20th century helped to find out that in the Minoan era it served to perform religious rites, since statuettes from bronze of that era were found here.  Not far from it is a church built directly into the rock.  She bears the name of the physician Paraskeva. </li><li>  Knossos Palace - the most famous landmark of Crete.  If you come to its ruins on Tuesday or Thursday, you can not only see everything for free (on other days the cost is 4 ‚Ç¨), but you can also get real archaeologists who will tell you about the history of the palace and about what they are working now. </li></ul>

The main thing that travelers of Hersonissos (Crete) may be of interest to is beaches that are here for every taste. </p><h2>  Heraklion </h2><p>  Already at a time when Knossos was the main city of Crete, Heraklion was its largest port.  He has a sad fate of cities, which have always been considered a desirable prey, so they were subjected to raids by pirates and conquerors and ruins. </p><p>  For example, in the 9th century it passed into the hands of the Arabs and was renamed Handak, becoming the place of the slave trade and a haven for pirates.  In the 10th century, Byzantium, dissatisfied with the robbery happening near the Christian world, conquered Heraklion from the Arabs, completely looting and destroying it, but after a hundred years the city was again restored in all its former glory. </p>

    <p>  His misadventures did not end there, so in 1645 the Turks again recaptured him.  This time they did not destroy Christian shrines, therefore, when in the 18th century the city was liberated from the yoke once again, it remained intact until the Second World War, during which it was bombed and badly damaged. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Today, two cities are very interconnected - the capital of Crete, Heraklion - Hersonissos.  Both of them are included in obligatory excursion programs. </p><h2>  Sand beach </h2><p>  Star Beach is almost the only sandy beach in Hersonissos, as its guests note in their reviews.  Entrance to it is free, but it is located on the outskirts of the city, and the walk takes about 30 minutes. But the lack of stones that abound in other beaches of Crete, the gentle slope to the sea and a gradual increase in depth make it the most popular among couples with children and older people. </p>

    <p>  The beach is preceded by a large amusement park, where entrance is also free, but it is forbidden to enter with your own food.  In the park there are several pools, one of which is children's with slides and small attractions.  Adult pools are ‚Äúdecorated‚Äù with waterfalls and surrounded by bars. </p><p>  You can sunbathe near the pools, renting sun loungers and umbrellas, and go down to one of the sandy beaches.  Everything is thought out here so that the guests of the park leave their money as much as possible while relaxing in it.  Although changing rooms, toilets and swimming pools are free, the aromas of delicious dishes that come from numerous cafes evoke hunger, so it‚Äôs simply impossible to eat on Star Beach.  Given that the Greek cuisine is really great, the portions are very large, and the service is excellent, such expenses are unlikely to spoil the mood.  The same applies to SPA centers, rental of ATVs, scooters and diving.  Entertainment and attractions are paid, but absolutely affordable. </p><h2>  Nana Beach </h2><p>  This beach is located in a cozy bay, which is comfortable even in windy weather, as it is quite closed.  Nana Beach belongs to the hotel with the same name, although the rest on it is available to everyone.  The territory of the bay is sandy, but the bottom is covered with small pebbles, which glides underfoot, so couples with children and older people who choose it for relaxation should be careful. </p>

    <p>  You also need to be prepared for the fact that the water in the bay is always a couple of degrees colder than in other resorts of the island.  This is due to cold springs, beating in the immediate vicinity of the coast, the water of which mixes with the warm sea and cools it. </p><p>  There are never many people on Nana Beach, which is his undoubted advantage, which his visitors note in their reviews. </p><h2>  Limanakya </h2><p>  The longest in the city is Limanakya beach.  One and a half kilometers long and 50 meters wide make it the most densely populated in the season.  It is especially suitable for children.  The sandy <span>coast, the gentle</span> descent into the sea and the true depth that appears at a considerable distance from the coast make it the safest in Crete. </p>

    <p>  Directly adjacent to it is a small marina, to which fishing boats moor, daily supplying bazaars, shops and restaurants with fresh fish.  Such a neighborhood does not scare away visitors, since the pier itself is quite picturesque, and the place for boats is fenced off from the swimming area. </p><h2>  Beach for nudists </h2><p>  <span>The nudist beach of</span> Hersonissos is suitable for those who love to sunbathe and swim naked, who do not mind the prying eyes.  If usually beaches of this type are located in closed bays or behind fences, then in Crete it is located in a rather lively and noisy part of the city, which is open for everyone to see. </p><p>  Its shore is sandy and pebble, in which pebbles prevail, and the entrance to the sea is rocky, so you should be extremely careful when entering the water.  For the convenience of vacationers, it, like the other beaches of the island, is equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><h2>  City Beach </h2><p>  This part of the coast is not very popular with guests of the city, as the lack of entertainment and the sandy and pebble area do not add to its fans, especially since the beaches of Hersonissos are located nearby, where there is everything necessary for a fun pastime. </p><p>  Basically, local residents rest here, who have little time to go to the further part of the coast, but this beach is quite suitable for lazy and picky people.  There are showers and changing cabins, sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><p>  In addition, the city beach of Hersonissos is quite quiet, there are no party-goers, music does not rattle, and nearby cafes and bars will help to cope with hunger and thirst. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The most popular attractions in the city are water parks and aquariums.  In the latter, children will be especially interested, as some inhabitants are allowed to stroke or hold in their hands, and if you come to the opening, you can watch how they are fed. </p><p>  Aquariums on the island were not created to entertain the public, but to preserve and increase the population of numerous species of fish, turtles and reptiles, whose life is endangered in the natural environment, although paid entry and donations from guests allow them to carry out scientific work. </p><h2>  Night life </h2><p>  No wonder this town is called a place with one street.  Indeed, all life here flows on the beaches and the promenade, which stretches along the entire coast.  The edge of youth tourism attracts teenagers and students from Europe.  It is especially popular with the Dutch and English.  For young people from the CIS countries, it is just beginning to become famous, since student tourism is also a new industry for domestic tour operators. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the nightlife of the city begins with the <span>sunset</span> and continues until it rises.  Discos work until midnight or a little longer, after which young people move to numerous nightclubs. </p>
