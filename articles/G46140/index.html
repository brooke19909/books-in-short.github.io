Or a boor called your phone.  If you record a telephone conversation with him, then in the future it can be brought to administrative or criminal liability.  The whole question is - can I record a conversation on the phone?  We will try to find an answer to it in this article. </p><h2>  Recording by OS Android </h2><p>  How to record a telephone conversation?  This question has been asked by many gadget users.  Some, having searched the Internet for the necessary information and tried a couple of programs, considering them not providing quality, abandoned this question, others continued to search, and still others began to develop programs. </p><p>  But is it really not known how to record a telephone conversation on a telephone?  It is known.  However, it should be borne in mind that some states prohibit recording telephone conversations at the legislative level, which is done by removing those drivers that provide this function.  Therefore, if you are the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù owner of such a gadget, then you only have to install the drivers yourself, which will require root access. </p><h2>  Voice Recorder </h2>

    <p>  In the program settings, you can choose where the recording will be carried out - it can be a microphone, voice, line, etc. Choose the recording quality, as well as its format.  The latter may be mp3 or wav. </p><p>  This program allows you to save recordings not only to Google drive, but also to Dropbox cloud.  In addition, a record is encrypted using a pin code to prevent wiretapping by third parties for which this record is not intended. </p><p>  On each page of application settings there are hints.

    <p>  By reviewing this program, we will end our discussion of ways to record a telephone conversation.  This is due to the fact that there are many programs and it is impossible to consider them all within the framework of one article. </p><p>  In this program, automatic recording can be activated and deactivated.  You can play with the format and quality of the recording.  Recording with unchanged settings is located in the CallRecords directory.  You can save it in the cloud.  Reviews about the program are mostly positive. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Thus, recording a telephone conversation can be carried out both by means of the telephone itself, and using third-party programs.  The above applications can help the user in the initial definition of programs, which are much more described in the article, but other applications have similar functionality to the described and often the same names. </p>
