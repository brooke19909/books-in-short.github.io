    <h2>  How to choose apartments in new buildings of Krasnodar </h2><p>  This matter should be taken with wisdom and careful attention.  Real estate in the city is in great demand not only among the indigenous people of Krasnodar and the region, but also among visitors from other regions.  There are several reasons for this influx of residents. </p><p>  Firstly, Krasnodar is one of the cities in which large expansion of both the residential sector and infrastructure is observed.  Many move to open their own business, because the region often receives public investment. </p><p>  Secondly, Krasnodar is a warm city.  Therefore, northerners often move here for permanent residence. </p><p>  Thirdly, to increase the influx of population into the region, the state is implementing a number of affordable housing programs for young families, in which new buildings in Krasnodar are also participating. </p><h2>  The advantages of real estate in this city </h2><p>  High demand is observed for new economy class buildings in Krasnodar.  As a rule, buyers prefer to buy apartments at the construction stage (then the price is several times lower than after putting the house into operation), and then rent the apartment (pay the loan on the proceeds if the apartment is mortgaged).  Or buy a studio apartment.  The latter type of apartments is often preferred by young families, moving to Krasnodar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>New buildings from an economy class builder are</span> characterized by a modern European layout of apartments.  A number of banks offer mortgages at the lowest interest rate - therefore, housing in Krasnodar is considered affordable. </p>

    <h2>  Neighborhoods of the city </h2><p>  In different areas of the city you can find new buildings from different developers of the city.  Everyone has different prices per square meter.  It is important that the developer does not have problems with documents: the developer‚Äôs website must have a project declaration, a building permit and the commissioning of a new building.  If there is no documentation on the site, it is recommended to contact the Department of Urban Planning of the Krasnodar Territory to check this developer.  If an answer is received about the existence of problems with the documentation of one or that the construction is being carried out with violations, it is not recommended to cooperate with the developer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  As mentioned above, when choosing new economy class buildings in Krasnodar, buyers prefer either an apartment at the construction stage (extension) or a studio. </p><p>  When choosing an apartment at the construction stage, the price for it is several times lower, but there is a certain risk: even a state developer may have problems that will lead to freezing of the construction. </p><p>  Studio apartments in most cases are offered by private developers on the highest floors of low-rise cottages or townhouses.  Most private developers have documentation problems.  Such construction projects are periodically frozen by a court decision, then resumed again (and most often frozen again).  Or even demolished.  Therefore, if there is a desire to cooperate with a private developer, first of all, you should contact the Department of Urban Planning of the Krasnodar Territory and find out information about this house. </p><h2>  Search for an apartment in Krasnodar </h2><p>  New buildings from the builder are full of offers and promotions of various sales departments.  You can search by yourself, or you can turn to a good realtor who will select the apartment you need according to the parameters and check the relevant documentation from the developer.  Of course, realtor services are not free. </p><p>  New buildings in Krasnodar can be found in different areas.  Usually choose closer to the place of work.  In any case, you should decide on the area and search based on the available funds. </p>

    <p>  When choosing an apartment from the developer, you should check the available construction documentation.  Bona fide construction companies have already posted it on the site.  And also it can be immediately provided to the sales department without any problems if the buyer wishes to personally verify and familiarize themselves with the content. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If a response like ‚Äúthis documentation is not yet available in the sales department, but it will be soon, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù is the first sign of an unscrupulous developer.  Especially when it comes to the document ‚Äúbuilding permit‚Äù (when the building is already under construction) or ‚Äúpermission to put the house into operation‚Äù (if the house has already been built and apartments are being sold). </p><h2>  Valuation Companies </h2><p>  The services of appraisers should not be neglected.  These offices have up-to-date information on the real cost of one square meter in different areas.  Therefore, if, when choosing a new building in Krasnodar, it happened to encounter a fabulously low cost of an apartment (especially if it is closer to the center), it is better to look for a catch.  Otherwise, he may come up when the buyer becomes the owner and will pay for the mistake of selling an apartment that hardly anyone will buy. </p><h2>  Signs of self-construction </h2><p>  Since the adoption of the 285 federal law of September 1, 2015, any structure that has the following features is recognized as self-building: </p><ul><li>  erected on a land plot that is not intended for this; </li><li>  construction is carried out or has already been completed without obtaining permission from the relevant authorities; </li><li>  the construction was erected in violation of the construction rules and established urban standards. </li></ul><p>  Of course, when choosing a new building in Krasnodar, it is very difficult to distinguish an unscrupulous developer from an unscrupulous one.  In this case, it is better to contact the already mentioned department of urban planning and find out information. </p><p>  This problem is relevant not only for Krasnodar and the region.  In fact, not a single region of Russia is immune from such a phenomenon as self-construction.  And to reveal the fact of violation in the bud is not always possible for the relevant structures. </p><p>  In addition, many unscrupulous developers go to tricks, erecting five-story cottages, design them according to the documentation as a four-story building, the top floor is designed as an attic and sold as a studio apartment, which, with due knowledge of jurisprudence, sometimes rolls.  But with a change in law, tenants may fall into disrepute due to the sudden recognition of the building as illegal. </p><h2>  Real estate of Krasnodar.  New buildings.  Apartment purchase </h2><p>  If a decision to purchase an apartment has already been made, an appropriate developer has been found, the documentation of which has been verified by the buyer, the department gives an answer about the absence of problems for this company and that the construction is carried out on completely legal grounds, the issue of purchasing an apartment should be considered. </p><p>  If the buyer has funds in an amount equal to the price of the apartment, you can immediately go to the sales department. </p><p>  If you are considering buying a home on a mortgage, you first need to go to a bank and talk with a loan officer for loans. </p><p>  After resolving the issue of granting a loan, the specialist will issue a list of documents to the credited person that must be submitted to the bank to purchase an apartment for a mortgage. </p>

    <p>  As a rule, if the developer is accredited with this bank, then some of the documents of this construction organization are already in the bank.  It remains to convey only a few.  It should be noted that the presence of accreditation in a bank (for example, in such large ones as VTB or Sberbank) is a sign of a bona fide company.  Especially if accreditation is obtained at both competing banks, which in itself is not so simple. </p><p>  Different banks have different lists of documents.  As a rule, those are issued free of charge (some in the sales department, some in the accounting department at the place of work), except for a conclusion on the appraisal of the acquired housing.  The cost varies from 4000 to 6000 rubles.  There are many appraisal companies in the city. </p><p>  Documents are provided to the loan officer.  After that, it is necessary to wait a certain period during which the documentation will be checked.  During this period, the borrower (the person who received the loan) and the co-borrower (the one who vouched for the person to whom the loan is issued) can be called up by the bank's experts and ask questions of a more precise nature regarding work, acquired housing, the amount for which the loan is granted, and loan terms. </p><p>  If there are problems identified during the analysis of the documentation provided, the bank may refuse to grant a loan without explanation.  This is another reason not to mess with unscrupulous developers. </p><p>  After approval of the loan, the required amount is transferred to the account of the developer, the buyer is given details on the loan repayment, conditions and payment schedules. </p><p>  The developer (or the representative of the developer) is sent to the nearest multifunctional center to obtain a certificate of ownership by the buyer. </p><p>  After receiving this document, you can go to the sales department or the housing and communal services to get the keys to the apartment. </p>

    <h2>  Errors in finding an apartment when moving to Krasnodar </h2><p>  New buildings from an economy class builder or luxury housing, it doesn‚Äôt matter.  90% of all who want to buy an apartment (not necessarily even in Krasnodar) always want to live in the center.  Such a whim. </p><p>  But few people understand that the center is: </p><ul><li>  high cost of purchased housing; </li><li>  the cost is far from economy class; </li><li>  a lot of noise; </li><li>  constantly busy streets; </li><li>  high smoke if the house is near a traffic intersection. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, in the search process, the buyer gradually moves away from the center to the outskirts, where the price is lower.  To some extent this is correct.  But one should not go away from accredited bona fide developers to private traders in the process of searching ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù.  From many applicants you can hear: ‚ÄúYes, accumulating an apartment with an official developer is unrealistic.  It's easier to give money to a private trader. ‚Äù  This is not an option, but self-deception!  And it‚Äôs important not to give in to your own error, so that you don‚Äôt pay for mistakes later. </p><p>  In the absence of the required amount of funds and a negative decision of the bank to issue mortgage loans, it is better to move away (for a while) from the issue of considering the Krasnodar economy building and consider buying secondary housing (from the owner, in already built houses).  Or save up more money, transferring the purchase for later. </p><p>  ‚ÄúMeasure seven times, cut once‚Äù - the proverb says.  In such a case as buying your own apartment, rush to anything. </p>
