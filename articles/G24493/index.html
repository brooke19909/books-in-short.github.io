Production and use of holograms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the age of modern computers, new technologies are moving further and further.  People are used to seeing holographic pictures on toys, on clothes, on packages.  But how many people know that there is already a 3D projector that creates holographic images visible to the eye without special glasses? </p><h2>  What is a hologram? </h2><p>  Good product packaging is nothing more than the face of a brand or company.  Of course, the goods are met by ‚Äúclothes‚Äù, but they are escorted by quality.  Then what is a hologram on a package?  The guarantee that the buyer acquires high-quality and original goods. </p><p>  To date, a holographic image to order is not very rare, because there are many reasons to use it both on packaging and on product cards.  What is a hologram?  First of all, an excellent, and most importantly, an effective way to protect products from fakes.  The hologram, a photo example of which is presented below, gives customers a guarantee that they are buying a real product, and not a fake one, because it‚Äôs illegal to fake a package or a card with a similar image on it. </p>

    <h2>  Where are holographic images applied? </h2><p>  So, a hologram is a guarantee <span>of product quality.</span>  It is also a great way to protect goods or documents from being tampered with.  For example, a hologram in a work book.  Such images on the packaging can save the product from opening.  Plastic bank cards are also protected with a hologram.  These images effectively enhance branding opportunities.  In addition, a hologram is one way to improve the appearance of <span>a package.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hologram production <strong></strong></h2><p>  Naturally, the development and production of such an image is carried out strictly individually.  Why?  Because the hologram is a kind of castle.  And if all the locks are copies of each other, then picking up a key (that is, making a fake) will not be difficult.  Therefore, in order to increase the level of protection of a particular product, it is necessary to create each logo from scratch. </p><p>  Making holograms is a rather complicated process, because they come in different types.  For example, self-destructing images.  Repeatedly, there were cases when fraudsters bought up a large amount of goods, removed labels and glued fake holograms in their place.  To prevent this, a self-destructive hologram was used.  This means that if the sticker is removed once, then it will not be possible to use it a second time.  As a result, the likelihood of a fake product is reduced. </p><p>  Interestingly, the hologram photo is also subject to manufacture.  That is, if you have a favorite photo, then you can order its holographic image.  The only ‚Äúbut‚Äù - it will still look flat, since the third, missing, measurement on paper will not be able to make up even a holographic survey. </p>

    <h2>  3D projector - what is it? </h2><p>  To date, a 3D projector, or three-dimensional projection system, has already been invented, which allows you to create realistic images in space that can move.  It can be photographs or drawings of any objects or even images of people.  The range that a similar 3D hologram can accommodate varies from the size of a basketball to the dimensions of a tank on a 1: 1 scale. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, such a technology is not just a display of three-dimensional images.  It allows people and virtual objects to interact.  For example, a person can rotate the image, visually show how the virtual system and so on. </p><h2>  Why do I need a 3D projector?  How is it useful? </h2><p>  In a 3D show, viewers do not have to wear special glasses.  All actions take place as in reality, only in a virtual environment.  The viewer sees both objects and people three-dimensional, regardless of the distance from the person to the image and the viewing angle.  And all this is available without 3D glasses! </p><p>  Among other things, such a projector is a visualizer of the most daring ideas.  It allows you to show the viewer anything you want, and at the same time as realistic as possible because the image has Full HD resolution, regardless of its size. </p>

    <h2>  Visualization of a person who for some reason could not come to the event </h2><p>  The 3D projector allows you to maximally realistically show the person who could not attend the meeting.  In this case, ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù means that it is as if a person is now standing on stage and talking to the audience.  That is very lively and believable. </p><p>  Therefore, even if a real speaker does not have the opportunity to participate in the show, his hologram will brilliantly cope without him.  Moreover, the copy will act in exactly the same way as the original, for example, interact with objects, freely pace the stage, address the audience, dance, sing and so on. </p><p>  In the auditorium they may not even recognize such a substitution and not realize that they have a copy in front of them until a double appears in their <span>field of vision</span> . </p><h2>  Show the viewer what does not fit in the auditorium without material and financial costs </h2><p>  Using 3D technology, it is easy to show objects of considerable weight, bulky and difficult to transport.  In this case, using a three-dimensional image of an object is much easier, more convenient and more rational than the original object.  Imagine what you need to demonstrate, for example, a tank from the time of the Great Patriotic War, being in a hall measuring 10 by 10 meters, which, among other things, is clogged with spectators.  You can easily scroll, reduce or enlarge a virtual image. </p>

    <h2>  Show simple things with simple examples </h2><p>  You will be able to easily demonstrate to the viewer a rather complex object, for example, a device for a <span>nuclear reactor</span> mechanism or a whole complex. </p><p>  Naturally, you can transport and install sophisticated equipment on a rotating platform.  We can assume that experience can be included in the lecture scenario, albeit with a lot of effort, time and nerves.  But with the help of a 3D projector, you will be able to disassemble a complex machine into its constituent parts, select a specific part and increase its size, then show the viewer how it works, in addition, you can show its principle of operation in the context.  3D technology allows you to do all this without any effort.  In addition, the item will be displayed in kind. </p><h2>  Visually show nonexistent or invisible </h2><p>  For the vast majority of people, the main channel for perceiving information is vision.  This makes visualization one of the most important properties of the latest technology, because with it you can show the viewer everything that is needed. </p>

    <p>  Visibility is especially appreciated when it is impossible to show a real object, since it is small or invisible.  For example, you can demonstrate to the audience the radio emission of the phone and its effect on the body, or show how the wound healing process takes place. </p><h2>  To delight the viewer - to arrange a spectacular show </h2><p>  Quite often, speakers set out to surprise the viewer, to show him something that he probably had not yet seen.  Usually, after setting such a task, people begin to puzzle what to show, and most importantly how.  Indeed, in the age of the Internet, it is very, very difficult to surprise the public.  A couple of artists and a 3D projector will quite cope with this task. </p>
