    <h2>  Dry on battery </h2><p>  The most popular way to dry oranges for decoration is to do it on a battery.  This method will become feasible only in the cold season, when the heating is working. </p><p>  You will need the following for this procedure: </p><ul><li>  corrugated cardboard; </li><li>  clothespins (preferably clerical, which hold well, but for lack of clothes you can also use clothes); </li><li>  awl. </li></ul><p>  Since all these attributes can be found in any home, the method can be called cost-free, unless you have to spend money on buying citrus fruits. </p><p>  The first thing to do when getting started is to cut out two identical plates from a cardboard approximately 10x30 cm in size. Next, take an awl and make holes in these cardboards.  The more holes there are, the better.  We lay out thinly sliced ‚Äã‚Äãorange slices on one of the plates and cover with a second cardboard.  On the edges you need to fix the resulting "sandwich" with clothespins.  How many will be needed, see for yourself, the main thing is that the slices should be tightly pressed by the paper and not fall out during the drying process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can install the design both horizontally and vertically, inside the battery.  This arrangement is even more convenient in that the heating takes place on both sides and at the same time much more citrus rings can be dried. </p><p>  In time, the process takes 2-3 days, depending on the thickness of the slices and the intensity of heating the batteries. </p><p>  So you have learned how to dry oranges for home decor.
