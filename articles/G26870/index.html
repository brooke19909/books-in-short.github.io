It allows you to quickly receive information about all operations, use the Internet bank and make quick transfers to other customers.  To access the features of the service, you need to know how to enable SMS alerts of Sberbank. </p><h2>  Service Features </h2><p>  "Mobile Bank" allows you to: </p><ul><li>  Find out information about a card account online.  Provided as part of the "Full" package. </li><li>  Send transfers in the amount of up to 8 thousand rubles per day. </li><li>  Receive codes for access and operations at Sberbank Online. </li><li>  Learn about the bonus program "Thank you" from Sberbank. </li><li>  Pay for certain types of services (for example, the Internet and mobile communications). </li><li>  Create payment templates. </li><li>  Manage the "Auto payment" service for utility bills, Internet and mobile communications. </li><li>  Block the card in case of theft. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="lt.garynevillegasm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="disable sms alert sberbank via sms" class="if uuid-3072639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3072639.jpg"></div><p>  Before you get access to all the features, you need to connect SMS alerts of Sberbank.  There are several ways to do this. </p><h2>  Tariffs of "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  Sberbank offers 2 service options: with and without a commission.  In the first case, notifications are received for each transaction on the account, for example, when withdrawing or depositing cash at an ATM. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ‚ÄúFull‚Äù tariff provides for a monthly usage fee of 0, 30 or 60 rubles.  The cost of the tariff depends on the bank card.  The Sberbank cardholder can find out information about the cost of the service at a branch or by calling the contact center. </p><p>  A free tariff called ‚ÄúEconomy‚Äù allows you to receive notifications when you log in and use Sberbank Online, send transfers and find out the balance of ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù bonuses.  But the client will not be able to see online the changes in the balance of the card when making income transactions. </p><p>  If the client wants to connect SMS alerts from Sberbank (through SMS to find out information about operations), you should select the "Full" tariff.  The first 2 months of use, the service is provided for free. </p><h2>  How to attach a card to a phone number? </h2><p>  There are several ways to link a phone number to a Sberbank card.  Any of them allows you to receive notifications from 900 after 4-6 hours from the moment of connection.  The work of the service does not depend on the connection option of "Mobile Bank". </p><p>  There are only three ways to enable SMS alerts from Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  at ATMs or terminals of a financial institution; </li><li>  in the department; </li><li>  using the help desk. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="lt.garynevillegasm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connect sms alert sberbank" class="if uuid-3072641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3072641.jpg"></div><p>  With any of the options, the service does not immediately become active.  After successful connection, the client will receive an SMS from 900. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number binding at Sberbank ATMs </h2><p>  The easiest way to enable SMS alerts from Sberbank is to use the terminals.  They, unlike the company‚Äôs offices, work around the clock and seven days a week.  Sberbank's ATM network is the largest in the country.  In total, there are more than 250 thousand devices in the regions of Russia. </p><p>  Zones with terminals are located next to Sberbank branches, in large shopping centers and municipal institutions.  SMS alerts from Sberbank can be connected to any device.  For this, you only need a customer card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jennifereremeeva.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable sms alert sberbank" class="if uuid-3072644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3072644.jpg"></div><p>  How to enable SMS alerts from Sberbank is described below: </p><ul><li>  insert a card into the bank terminal; </li><li>  Find the tab "Information and Services" in the menu; </li><li>  choose the Mobile Bank service from the list; </li><li>  Click "Connect Mobile Bank"; </li><li>  choose the tariff: "Full" or "Economy"; </li><li>  enter phone number; </li><li>  check and confirm the operation. </li></ul><p>  After connecting the service, the client has a check.  It is a confirmation of the operation.  On the check you can check the entered phone number and the last digits of the bank card. </p><h2>  Connecting SMS alerts in the office of Sberbank </h2><p>  If you have a passport, customers can contact the bank office to bind the phone number to the card.  The service is free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To assign a phone number in the bank office, the cardholder must take a service ticket.  It can be obtained in the electronic queue. </p><p>  After a call to a free specialist, you need to provide a passport and a Sberbank card, give a phone number.  The manager will fill in the data in the application.  Before signing the documents, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the indicated card and cell phone number in order to eliminate an error. </p><p>  After signing the documents, the client is given a copy of the application for linking notifications.  SMS alerts will be connected within a day from the moment of signing the documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable sms alert sberbank" class="if uuid-3071808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3071808.jpg"></div><p>  The method is relevant not only for customers from Russia.  Sberbank card holders in Belarus can also contact their local office to get their phone numbers connected.  This is a reliable way to enable SMS alerts in BPS-Sberbank.  The terms and conditions of connection are the same as for customers in the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Binding a phone through support </h2><p>  Without a visit to the bank, you can enable notifications from 900 using the Sberbank contact center.  To do this, you must: </p><ol><li>  Call the number indicated on the back of the card, for example, 900. </li><li>  Introduce yourself, give passport details, address and code word.  The code word is the control information that was indicated by the client when issuing a plastic card.  If there is no codeword data, it is recommended to take the client code.  This is a combination of numbers that is issued in the terminal.  It allows Sberbank card holders to use support services. </li><li>  Inform about the intention to tie the phone number to the card of Sberbank, give the data of the cell. </li></ol><p>  After a call to customer support, a message will be sent to the client about the connection of the mobile phone to the card.  Alerts will begin to work within 24 hours from the time of contact. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pngtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sms alert sberbank" class="if uuid-3072637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3072637.jpg"></div><p>  Contact the contact center can only the cardholder.  If the client is not able to name the code word, take the client‚Äôs code and provide mandatory information about himself, the service may be denied. </p><h2>  How to enable alerts through Sberbank Online </h2><p>  According to reviews on the Web, Internet banking customers often turn to employees for help, as they were unable to connect to Mobile Bank through Sberbank Online.  Cardholders want to know if alerts can be connected online without visiting a bank and using terminals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expresscomputer.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable sms alert sberbank instead of push" class="if uuid-3072633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3072633.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, service binding using Internet banking is not provided.  Sberbank Online features include only control of connected services.  Through online banking, plastic media owners can check which cards and how many numbers are tied. </p><p>  Disabling SMS alerts from Sberbank via SMS or Sberbank Online is also impossible.  To do this, the client must contact the company office or contact center. </p><h2>  Notification binding in the Sberbank Online mobile application </h2><p>  Those who use the mobile version of Sberbank Online want to know about the additional features of Mobile Bank.  Using applications downloaded and installed through the App Store or Google Play, the client gets access to the Internet banking functionality in his smartphone. </p><p>  SMS from Sberbank in this case comes in the form of a background notification of operations - push notifications.  According to reviews of the service on the Internet, not all customers are satisfied with receiving information in this way. </p><p>  Unlike SMS, push notifications are displayed even when the smartphone is locked.  This can be used by cybercriminals to find out the card balance or other data of a Sberbank client. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtogeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to enable sms alert bps sberbank" class="if uuid-3072636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3072636.jpg"></div><p>  How to enable Sberbank SMS alerts instead of push notifications?  You need to check the version of "Mobile Bank".  If the service package is "Economical", then notifications of operations will only be sent in push format.  With the "Full" service package, it is possible to disable push notifications, leaving only the usual SMS format. </p><p>  How to disable push notifications: </p><ul><li>  enter the application; </li><li>  go to the "Settings" tab; </li><li>  select push notifications; </li><li>  move left arrow if push notifications are active. </li></ul><p>  Push notifications allow you to receive information with an active Internet connection.  If the function is disabled, the client can only find out information on the card using SMS notifications. </p><p>  Notifications contain more information than SMS.  They indicate not only the time and amount of the transaction, but also the outlet (with the company logo).  Using a convenient search, you can find the operation by name. </p>
