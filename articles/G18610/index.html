Among his many promises to the people, the conclusion of peace in a war was particularly notable.  However, this did not happen.  And against the backdrop of a worsening economic situation, the revolution in the country was extremely difficult to avoid. </p><h2>  Common features </h2><p>  In short, the revolution in Germany 1918-1919 consisted of four stages: </p><ol><li>  From November 3 to 10. </li><li>  From November 10 to December. </li><li>  All of January - most of February. </li><li>  The remaining months until May 1919. </li></ol><p>  The opposing forces are here: the proletariat, together with the military and sailors, and the country's authorities with their armed forces. </p><p>  A huge influence on the revolution of 1918-1919 in Germany had a group of "Spartacus".  It was formed by workers in 1917 and was characterized by radical communist views. </p><p>  On October 7, 1918, she hosted a conference at which the preparations for an armed insurrection were discussed. </p><h2>  Background Analysis </h2><p>  The total causes of the revolution in Germany 1918-1919 were: </p><ol><li>  Problems in the agricultural sector. </li><li>  Maintaining a landlord system in land ownership. </li><li>  Too many aristocratic privileges. </li><li>  The need to eliminate the monarchy. </li><li>  The need to increase the rights of parliament. </li><li>  Contradictions between the elite of society by new social strata.  The first group included landowners, officials and officers.  The second includes representatives of the bourgeoisie, workers and middle classes. </li><li>  The need to eliminate the remnants of the political split in some countries. </li><li>  Huge human losses in the war. </li><li>  Card mode for the provision of food. </li><li>  Shortage of industrial products. </li><li>  The development of hunger. </li></ol><h2>  First stage </h2><p>  It is limited to the period from November 3 to 10, 1918. The key event before that was the uprising of sailors at the end of October.  The unrest was raised on the ships of the Navy.  The reason is the denial of access to the sea for the battle with the British flotilla. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tellerreport.com" data-author=": "><img alt="Sailors in Kiel" class="if uuid-3110685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3110685.jpg?1572890821"></div><p>  The rebels tried to eliminate.  The attempt was a failure and only worsened the situation.  And on November 3, in the city of Kiel, sailors staged an armed riot. </p><p>  Emissary Gustav Noske joined them a little later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.firstworldwar.com" data-author=": "><img alt="Gustav Noske" class="if uuid-3110679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3110679.jpg?1572890821"></div><p>  He became the leader of their movement and headed the Kiel Council, formed in those days, after which the uprising spread to different regions of the country. </p><p>  During this period, the features of the revolution in Germany 1918-1919 were identified: </p><ol><li>  Spontaneity. </li><li>  The lack of party leaders. </li><li>  The initiators and the driving force were workers, soldiers and sailors. </li><li>  Confrontation with imperialism and monarchy. </li></ol><p>  And on November 9, large-scale rallies and strikes were organized in Berlin.  Members of the Spartak group captured all the key points of the city, including prisons. </p><p>  Government leader Max Badensky immediately resigned.  The then Kaiser Wilhelm II left his post.  Imperious powers were received by the right social democrat Friedrich Ebert. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.britannica.com" data-author=": "><img alt="Friedrich Ebert" class="if uuid-3110690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3110690.jpg?1572890821"></div><p>  November 10 was created SNU - the Council of People's Commissioners.  He served as the interim government. </p><h2>  Division into movements </h2><p>  The events of the revolution in Germany 1918‚Äì1919, which determined its further development, were: </p><ol><li>  Assignment to the country of the status of the Republic. </li><li>  The fall of the Hohenzollern monarchy. </li><li>  The escape of William the Second to the Netherlands. </li><li>  The emergence of the Social Democrats in a leading position. </li></ol><p>  Then the mass left sector was divided into the following movements: </p><ol><li>  Social Democratic Party (SPD).  It was headed by F. Ebert and F. Scheidemann. </li><li>  Centrist Independent SPD.  Its leaders: K. Kautsky and G. Haase. </li><li>  The left course is Spartak.  His leaders: Karl Liebnecht and Rosa Luxemburg. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.thelocal.de" data-author=": "><img alt="Karl Liebnecht and Rosa Luxemburg" class="if uuid-3110682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3110682.jpg?1572890821"></div><p>  The first movement had the greatest power and led the revolution.  And on November 10, the Provisional Government was created from representatives of the first two movements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Second stage </h2><p>  It covered the period from November 11 to the end of 1918.  On the first day, SNU began active work in many areas: </p><ol><li>  <span>Compiegne truce.</span>  It was concluded with the countries that are members of the Alliance, and provided for the absolute surrender of the German side. </li><li>  The abolition of the military regime and demobilization. </li><li>  Translation to a peaceful format of production. </li><li>  Getting citizens rights and freedoms. </li><li>  The introduction of universal suffrage. </li><li>  Adjustment of the working day to 8 hours. </li><li>  Empowering unions to negotiate agreements. </li><li>  The emergence of the "Commission on Socialization."  It was headed by K. Kautsky.  Its main task is to assign state monopolies to large monopolies. </li></ol><p>  A new Constitution was to be adopted.  For this, it was necessary to form the Constituent National Assembly (STS) following the results of special elections. </p><p>  The previous state system was not affected. </p><h2>  All-German Congress </h2><p>  It was held in December 1918 from the 16th to the 21st.  The city is Berlin.  Workers 'and soldiers' councils from all over the country came to him.  It solved the dilemma of power. </p><p>  The leaders of the SPD and the NSDG gave priority to the formation of the simplified tax system.  And these councils should have been limited in power.  In other words, of the three currents that arose, the third (left - Spartak) under this plan lost many powers. </p><p>  Its representatives staged a rally in front of the building where the congress was held, and announced that the USSR was being created in the country - a socialist Soviet republic.  They even presented the corresponding petition. </p><p>  Their other goal was to remove the government of Ebert. </p><p>  The congress didn‚Äôt react at all to these actions and scheduled the elections to be held in the STS.  Then the "Spartacists" decided to create an autonomous revolutionary movement.  They left the Social Democrats and on December 30 formed the Communist Party - the KKE. </p><p>  The revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 in Germany took a new turn. </p><h2>  Third stage </h2><p>  It occupied January and part of February 1919.  Its main line is the KKE‚Äôs attempts to overthrow the government. </p><p>  The key events of this stage of the 1918-1919 revolution in Germany are as follows: </p><ul><li>  January 6.  Thousands of strikes in Berlin.  It was arranged by workers and soldiers.  The result was an armed massacre with the police.  The leaders of Spartak, K. Liebnecht and R. Luxemburg, also participated in it. </li><li>  January 10th.  Attempted to create the Bremen SSR. </li><li>  January 12-13.  Complete suppression of the uprising.  Many of his leaders have been arrested. </li><li>  January 15.  Executed K. Liebknecht and R. Luxembourg. </li><li>  January 19.  Elections in the STS.  The bourgeoisie won. </li><li>  February 6.  USN opened.  The place is the city of Weimar.  The purpose of the meeting is to develop the Constitution of the country (after long discussions it was adopted on July 31 of the same year). </li><li>  February 11th.  Friedrich Ebert becomes President. </li></ul><p>  These are the results of the third stage of the 1918‚Äì1919 revolution in Germany.  The reason for the defeat of the Communists is largely due to their small numbers and poor preparation for key battles.  They overestimated their potential. </p><h2>  The final stage </h2><p>  It began in mid-February and ended in May 1919.  It was characterized by scattered demonstrations of workers in different parts of the country.  The largest shares were held in Berlin and Bremen.  The goals of the strikes were identified as follows: </p><ol><li>  The increase in the number of unions. </li><li>  Improving the economic situation. </li><li>  Empowerment of workers. </li></ol><p>  A coup d'etat took place in Bavaria in April.  And there the Soviet government established itself.  Troops were quickly sent there to completely overthrow it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ciml.250x.com" data-author=": "><img alt="Suppression of the Soviet Republic in Bavaria 1919" class="if uuid-3110688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3110688.jpg?1572890821"></div><p>  The designated power lasted only three weeks.  Her strength was not enough to confront the arriving army. </p><p>  Its defeat became the point of revolution in Germany 1918-1919. </p><h2>  results </h2><p>  About 8-9 months, the country was shocked by numerous uprisings and riots.  Similar events took place in Russia in October 1917. </p><p>  The results of the revolution in Germany 1918-1919 are as follows: </p><ol><li>  The total elimination of the monarchical system. </li><li>  Approval of the status of the republic. </li><li>  The entry into force of bourgeois-democratic freedoms. </li><li>  Significant improvement in the quality of life of workers. </li></ol><p>  She also positively influenced the end of the war and the conclusion of the ceasefire, as well as the liquidation of the Brest Peace. </p><h2>  New constitution </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img alt="Weimar Constitution" class="if uuid-3110677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3110677.jpg?1572890821"></div><p>  Its development began on February 6.  But to finish work on it was possible only after the revolution of 1918-1919 in Germany.  And its adoption took place on July 31 in the city of Weimar. </p><p>  The new Constitution granted the country a new status - the Republic.  The president and parliament were now in power. </p><p>  The Constitution gained legal force on August 11.  Her key tenets are as follows: </p><ol><li>  The consolidation of the bourgeois republic with a parliamentary system. </li><li>  Granting voting rights to all citizens who are over 20 years old. </li><li>  Parliament is vested with legislative powers.  Elections are held every four years. </li><li>  The president has executive power and many rights.  For example, his powers included the introduction of a state of emergency, the formation of the government.  He also had the highest military rank - commander of the army.  He was also the prime minister of the country.  His term of office is 7 years. </li><li>  The federal state system began to represent 15 lands (they are also republics) with their own power and three free cities. </li></ol><p>  After the war, the German economy was in a deplorable state.  The country was in the grip of inflation and unemployment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuvo.org" data-author=": "><img alt="Germany after the First World War" class="if uuid-3110712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3110712.jpg?1572890821"></div><p>  And because of the notorious Versailles Treaty, 1/8 of the territory, as well as all colonies, was taken from her. </p><p>  New weapons were prohibited in the country, and the army was reduced to 100,000 soldiers. </p><p>  And only thanks to the new Constitution and the change of regime did the improvement of the situation begin.  True, the Germans had to adhere to austerity and take loans abroad. </p><p>  And the period from 1924 to 1927 is considered the time of stabilization of the situation in the country.  Since 1927, the intensive development of its economy began. </p>
