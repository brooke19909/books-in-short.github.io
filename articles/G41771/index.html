This model is available in several versions, while it is worth noting the fact that a 16 GB + 3G device was initially available exclusively for pre-order. </p><p>  All devices in this series have an IPS-LCD-matrix, the resolution of which is 1024 x 600 pixels, as well as 1 GB of its own RAM.  As the basis of the Wexler Tab 7I, the Rockchip RK2918 chipset was used, in which there is a full-fledged single-core processor of the Cortex A8 model with a frequency of 1.2 GHz. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The device is rectangular in shape, with rounded side ends.  Developing the design of the Wexler Tab 7I case, the developers tried to make the top part visually nested in the bottom, as a result of which small sides are formed at the top and bottom.  The back side, which is closer to the left and right side, is slightly bent.  At the same time, Wexler Tab 7I itself is offered in two colors - black and white. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wexler tab 7i" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/972587.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  Given the seven-inch diagonal of the screen, by itself it is quite large and has dimensions of 200 x 119, while its thickness reaches 15 mm.  The weight of this device is 380 grams, which can be called a very, very good result, since people who have a Wexler Tab 7I tablet left reviews in this regard rather flattering, saying that even while using the device they won‚Äôt felt no weight and increased thickness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  A certain part of the front panel, as well as the side faces, are made of specialized reliable plastic, while the rear panel is glossy plastic, which is why it is quite slippery.  Of course, in the process, the fingerprints will remain on the entire body, and they are quite noticeable, but the traces are erased very easily.  The only thing noted by Wexler Tab 7I 3G users is that every time you use the device, all traces appear again and again, as a result of which you have to carefully look after it.  In addition, when using this tablet, all kinds of scratches may appear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet wexler tab 7i reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/972590.jpg" width="477"></div>

    <h2>  Control </h2><p>  On the front panel there is a small indicator light showing the status of the battery, as well as the front camera.  The key for adjusting the volume is slightly recessed into the body, and on the upper end you can see the on / off button of this device.  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that, according to most users, this arrangement of buttons is inconvenient, since it is not possible to instantly find the right button the first time.  Also, do not forget that the signatures are not placed directly on the buttons, but on the side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the left and right ends of the Wexler Tab 7I 8Gb there are slots in which the speakers are installed.  The main elements are located at the bottom - a slot for an additional microSD card, a separate port for connecting <span>USB, a microphone,</span> a miniHDMI connector, as well as a standard 3.5 mm audio output.  Thus, this device can interact with almost any modern equipment, which can be called its undoubted advantage.  It is also worth noting that the Wexler Tab 7I reset button is located in this part. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Special attention is paid to widescreen display with an aspect ratio of 16: 9. </p><p>  The Wexler Tab 7I 3G 8Gb screen size is 7 inches;  physical size 154 x 89 mm;  Resolution - 1024 x 600 pixels.  The image on this device almost always looks extremely clear, and with the naked eye it is impossible to see any kind of pixelation.  For the manufacture of the matrix, specialized IPS-LCD technology is used, due to which about 16 million colors can be seen on the display.  It is worth noting the separately capacitive touch layer, which provides for five touches at the same time.  According to user observations, the sensitivity of the display to touch is average. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The screen differs from most similar models in sufficiently large viewing angles.  Thus, with a strong tilt, the contrast and brightness decrease somewhat, but this is not critical, and, in principle, you can easily view images. </p><p>  The downside of this device is that it lacks a specialized light sensor.  If necessary, it will be possible to set ‚Äúsleep mode‚Äù in the settings, that is, set the time after which the device will switch to this mode if the user is inactive.  In addition, it is also possible to change the font size.  According to user reviews and the opinion of some experts, the most optimal is to use a large font, as it will be the most suitable for resolution, as well as the diagonal of the display. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  As standard in modern tablets, there is an initially non-removable lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 4,500 mAh.  This device provides for specialized protection, eliminating the possibility of recharging or overheating, which is important enough for the operation of such equipment.  The manufacturer says that in the process of watching the video, the battery can work for eight hours if Wi-Fi does not work in parallel, and with constant reading it can be discharged after 10 hours of active use.  Of course, it is likely that the testing of this device was carried out at the lowest possible brightness of the backlight and other parameters, because in reality, users noted completely different indicators. </p><h2>  Indicators in practice </h2><p>  In particular, when the firmware was not installed in the Wexler Tab 7I, when the video was constantly watched, the battery went down for three hours, and this despite the fact that the speaker was not used, in principle, and the sound was output to the headphones.  If you just play music in this device, and again, use only headphones, you don‚Äôt have to worry about its performance for more than 20 hours. </p>

    <p>  At high volume and brightness, you can play on the tablet for no more than half an hour.  At the same time, Wi-Fi surfing can only be carried out for five hours, after which the device is completely discharged.  Thus, we can say that with normal use of the device, the initial battery charge will last no more than five hours.  Such power consumption is far from the highest, but the results are quite acceptable for a device of this class. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The device has a standard 1 GB of RAM, but by default only about 570 MB are at the user's disposal.  From time to time, this amount may not be enough to run certain applications, because quite often the device starts unloading applications from memory. </p><p>  To store the information necessary for the user, a standard Flash memory is provided, the volume of which is 8 GB, while the settings say that 500 MB is allocated for installing various memory applications, while 5.8 GB is allocated for storing additional data.  There is a slot for installing an additional microSDHC card, the maximum possible volume of which can reach 32 GB. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  This tablet provides for two camera modules at the same time, while the main one is designed for 2 MP, while the front camera even has only 0.3 MP.  Given that none of the cameras has focus, this can be called the most important disadvantage of this device.  The quality of even the main camera is mediocre and seriously loses to similar devices in its price category. </p><p>  The only thing that users note is that, in principle, even with such a front-facing camera you can communicate quite well through Skype. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The graphics accelerator is used by the GC800 Graphics Engine, which is unusual for modern users.  Immediately it is worth noting the fact that this device proved to be quite weak, and immediately after testing on games such as Nova 3, it showed its weaknesses.  Of course, games of this class can be launched, but you will hardly see normal textures, and in some cases you will have to use Wexler Tab 7I Hard reset.  The situation is not less sad with such demanding games, but again, if the game has a sufficiently large number of units, the number of frames per second can drop noticeably. </p>

    <p>  In general and in general, in its price category, this tablet can be called satisfactory in terms of performance, since similar devices do not differ in any technological breakthroughs in this regard. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  You can install applications directly through the Android Market, for downloading which it is enough that you had an initially registered Google account.  If you decide to download programs from the network directly to the device‚Äôs memory, then in this case it is also recommended to install a utility such as AppInstaller.  By default, a standard set from Google and certain additional applications, such as EBookDroid, Gismeteo and others, are also provided. </p>

    <p>  To surf the pages, there is initially an Android 4.0 browser.  Given the features of the processor, it is also possible to work with Flash.  Despite the fairly powerful graphics engines, as well as the presence of a far from the weakest processor, the browser can slow down a bit in the process of working with certain sites. </p><p>  Special attention is paid to users is not the best multitouch, as the page scale increases jerky.  Most likely, the reason for this is the chipset used, but in any case, users will have to come to terms with this small minus. </p>
