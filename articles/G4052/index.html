New theories and extraordinary versions are constantly appearing about where the first Adam and Eve lived.  We will try to analyze the scientific points of view. </p><h2>  We solve the school crossword, or the generally accepted scientific version </h2><p>  In school crosswords on history and in various tests, the question is: "The mainland, where, according to scientists, the most ancient people lived."  The correct answer is Africa.  Note that this is not a postulate, but only a theory.  It is no accident that in the tests the phrase ‚Äúaccording to the assumptions of scientists‚Äù.  What is the theory based on?  Were there other ancient continents that may have been the ancestral home of humanity?  Next, try to answer these questions. </p><h2>  Africa - the common ancestral home of human ancestors </h2><p>  Africa is the mainland <span>where</span> <span>ancient people</span> <span>lived</span> <span>.</span>  This statement was put forward in 1871 by Charles Darwin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient continents" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1479824.jpg" width="600"></div>  Then his version was not heard, since there was no serious evidence of this.  Now scientists have a lot of evidence that points to this particular continent.

By it you can not only recognize the biological father, mother, brother, but also all relatives on Earth.  DNA in all races is 99.9% similar, and only the remaining small percentage affects appearance, hereditary diseases, etc. </p><p>  This unique code contains a trace of the entire history of mankind: the greater the percentage of similarity of one race with another, the later they separated from each other. </p><p>  DNA studies have shown that Africa is the mainland, where, according to scientists, the most ancient people lived.  According to the representatives of the University of California, who studied the unique code of the inhabitants of all continents, 150 thousand years ago the ancestors of the first chromosomes lived on the border of modern South Africa and Namibia. </p><h2>  The resettlement of ancient people </h2><p>  Migration from Africa began about 50-70 thousand years ago.  From here, people headed to Asia, and then through India to Europe and America. </p>

    <p>  Resettlement did not go as fast as it seems.  For one generation, people have traveled several kilometers.  Forty years of trekking with overcoming several hundred kilometers of Moses with the Israelites in the Sinai seems like a sprint race against this background.  Due to the presence of different climatic conditions, distinctive signs of races have formed.  People reached Australia in about 5-10 thousand years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The time spread, of course, is very large, but more precisely it is impossible to determine due to limited information.  To make it more clear, this is not enough or much, let's say that the period of the history of mankind totals about 5 thousand years from the moment of writing.  Only from the Nativity of Christ to this day a little more than 2 thousand years have passed, which by the standards of human society is quite a bit. </p><p>  Archaeologists also believe that Africa is the mainland of the most ancient people, since it was here, in the Olduvai cave, that they found the remains of ‚Äúhomo habiles‚Äù and ‚Äúhomo erectus‚Äù, that is, a skilled and <span>upright man.</span> </p>

    <ul><li>  Altai, Russia - there are also ancient human remains.  The most famous archaeological site is Denisova Cave. </li><li>  Several places at once. </li><li>  <span>Java Island</span> in Asia. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what was the name of the ancient continent" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1479828.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How did people get to America and Australia? </h2><p>  Scientists, amateurs, as well as many skeptics who study the ancient continents, come to the conclusion that there was a single continent, which was subsequently divided under the influence of various factors.  However, official science denies this.  Indeed, the once united continent may have existed.  Judging by the maps, many territories separated by water are like broken parts of a single whole. </p><p>  However, according to geologists, the division of the continent occurred much earlier than the appearance and resettlement of our distant ancestors. </p><p>  If the question is what the ancient continent was called, Africa will be the answer, how did people get to America and Australia? </p><p>  In fact, there is nothing inexplicable in this - 30 thousand years ago, North-East Eurasia and North America were a single continent.  At the place of the Bering Strait there was a "bridge" on which people reached this continent.  From there, they entered South America, which is not separated by large water barriers from North America.  As for Australia, here it is about the same.  Through the island network of Southeast Asia you can reach this continent.  We repeat that there were no quick movements - they covered several kilometers in about 100 years. </p><h2>  Is Chitida the ancestral home of humanity? </h2><p>  There are several pseudoscientific myths and legends, according to which, the ancient continent, on which the first people appeared, was not Africa.  According to one of them, Chitida is considered such a continent - a sunken continent in the Indian Ocean in the middle between Asia, Australia and America.  It was opened by the colonel of the Bengal cavalry corps of Churchward in 1870.  While serving in India, he set up camp near Buddhist monks, who turned out to be hospitable people and allowed the unit to stay overnight.  The colonel asked them about various stories from the past, as he was interested in science and philosophy.  To his surprise, the monks brought him clay pots with texts that no one could decipher.  Churchward succeeded, and it turned out that they contain information about the most ancient people, the ancestors of all mankind on the continent of Chitid, which was a little larger than modern Australia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient continents" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1479825.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Its inhabitants had different skin colors, possessed abilities that were inaccessible to posterity: the gift of clairvoyance, telepathy, levitation.  They knew how to use the energy of the sun and crystals. </p><p>  The Chitida civilization lasted more than 4,500 years and was destroyed as a result of the collision of the Earth with an asteroid.  This disaster broke the mainland into several islands: Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Hindustan, Hawaii, the islands of the Indian Ocean. </p><p>  The "sensational" find of the colonel was unnoticed in the press.  This news was considered a newspaper duck and were not interested in it properly. </p><h2>  Rebuttal theory </h2><p>  Chitida's theory, as well as others like it, are refuted by modern science: </p><ol><li>  Oceanography data do not contain information that flooded continents exist at the bottom. </li><li>  If some islands are part of Chitida, why do not they contain any information about it? </li><li>  No evidence is presented to science, on the basis of which such "sensational discoveries" are made. </li></ol><p>  Such theories are pseudoscience that has nothing to do with real scientific knowledge.  There are many similar ‚Äúdiscoveries‚Äù and versions; they arise from the unproven basic theory of the appearance of the first Adam and Eve. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What ancient continent is considered the ancestral home of man?  For a long time on this issue will exist a variety of points of view.  However, the version with DNA seems to be the most convincing, since it is not based on the ancient remains of people that you can‚Äôt even find, not radiocarbon measurements, whose methodology is constantly changing, but a mathematical calculation of a unique human code.  It is impossible to fake and change.  Therefore, it is Africa - the mainland, on which the most ancient people appeared.  Only such an opinion today is supported by evidence. </p>
