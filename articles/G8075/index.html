  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of speech activity. Main characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Speech is a historically developed type of communication between people using language constructs formed according to certain rules.  The concept of speech activity characterizes a process consisting of interconnected actions, involving, on the one hand, the formation and formulation of thoughts using language tools, and the perception and understanding of language constructions on the other hand. </p><p>  In the study of <span>social communication,</span> various definitions are applied, often mutually replacing each other.  So, for example, the concepts of ‚Äúspeech activity and its types‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù often become synonymous.  In particular, this applies to the last two terms. </p><p>  It should be noted that in linguistics "speech activity" is considered one of the aspects - it is distinguished along with the language system and speech organization.  Some authors consider the term communicative process as a material that includes a set of separate acts of understanding and speaking. </p><p>  Speech activity has the following main <span>types: reading,</span> listening (listening), speaking, writing.  Such an understanding is included in the <span>methodology of teaching a</span> language (foreign, including). </p><p>  <strong><span>Types of speech</span> activity.</strong>  <strong>Speaking</strong> </p><p>  This concept characterizes any sounding speech.  Historically speaking is the primary linguistic form that arose much earlier than writing.  From a material point of view, oral speech is <span>sound waves.</span>  Pronounced is the result of the activity of certain human organs (the vocal apparatus).  Intonation is a combination of the pronunciation timbre, tempo (increasing or slowing down), duration, volume (intensity), melody.  Great importance in oral speech is given to the absence or presence of pauses, the degree of clarity in pronunciation, the ability to correctly place <span>logical stresses.</span>  Speaking, possessing intonational diversity, can convey the fullness of emotions, emotions, moods. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Types of speech activity.</strong>  <strong>Letter.</strong> </p><p>  This type of human linguistic activity is an auxiliary system of signs used to fix speaking (sound speech).  At the same time, the letter can be called an independent structure.  In addition to the function of recording speech (oral), the written system allows you to absorb the accumulated knowledge, expanding the scope of communication. </p><p>  The main purpose of the letter is to fix the spoken in order to preserve it.  This type of speech activity is used in communication between those people who are separated by time, distance.  It should be noted that the role of writing has decreased significantly due to the advent of the telephone. </p><p>  <strong>Types of speech activity.</strong>  <strong>Listening (listening).</strong> </p><p>  Listening is a process that involves both direct and indirect (using audio, radio, etc.) interaction between the listener and the speaker. </p><p>  In the first case (with direct contact), the interlocutors have the opportunity to use not only linguistic forms <span>(verbal communication),</span> but also non-verbal communication tools (facial expressions, <span>body movements, gestures),</span> which contribute to a more effective perception and understanding. </p><p>  <strong>Types of speech activity.</strong>  <strong>Reading.</strong> </p><p>  In accordance with simple definitions, reading is characterized as the process of extracting information from printed or handwritten text. </p><p>  This specific form of linguistic communication of people is one of the mediated types of communication.  Moreover, reading is not perceived as a one-sided impact on the reader.  It is not expressed by passive perception, assimilation of content.  Reading includes an active interaction between the recipient (reader) and the communicator (author of the text). </p>
