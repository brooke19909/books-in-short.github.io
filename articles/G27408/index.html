This is Hiroki Totoki.  His accession to the throne caused a number of serious technological (and not only) changes that somehow influenced the fate of the company and its products.  An example is the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium model, a review of which the user will meet in this information article.  To make it more interesting, we will not just talk about the model, but also consider its closest relatives.  These are Z5 and Z5 “Compact”, from which, in fact, the modification under the name “Premium” has grown. </p><h2>  How the subline appeared </h2>

    <p>  Sony Mobile Corporation, after many years of experience and experimentation, has come to the conclusion that the most effective lever for attracting new customers and preserving old ones is the use of branded "chips."  At the same time, it turned out that they needed to not only be created and implemented, but also regularly improved. </p><p>  An integral condition for the company's popularity in the international mobile arena is its orientation to the needs of potential users.  All three of these factors led Sony Mobile to create a line called Xperia Z5.  It also included a device called Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, a review of which became the topic of today's article.  Thus, the Z5 series was formed by three models.  This is a standard smartphone, as well as its modified (but also more expensive) devices, called “Compact”, and, accordingly, “Premium”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What common? </h2>

    <p>  If you carefully consider receiving information about the lineup, then it is easy to notice one simple fact.  So, the smartphone Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual, together with its predecessors, has become part of the concept, which the engineers and designers of the company called “The feeling of unity” with a light hand.  Which, in principle, has certain practical reasons.  Those who have long experience working with the devices of a Japanese company may say that there is no special difference between “Sense of Unity” and “Omnibalance”.  And indeed, at first glance it seems so.  But if you try to pick up the same Sony Xperia Z5 Premium phone and the <span>standard model,</span> then upon closer inspection you will see an amazing amount of the smallest differences. </p><h2>  Japanese approach to the creation of the apparatus </h2>

Thus, even when the same Sony Xperia Z5 Premium, reviews of which can be found at the end of the article, existed only on paper and in the wild heads of engineers and designers, the company's approach to the release of the new line was extremely clear. </p><p>  In words, it all looks somewhat confusing and ambiguous, so we will try to understand how a similar concept was applied in practice. </p><p>  So, the Premium model was equipped with a glass back panel with a mirror effect.  Her predecessors received a similar material with a foggy effect.  Why did the designers do just that?  In the first case, they tried to highlight the model, to show that this is really the same “Premium”.  In the second case, it was required to make the device as practical as possible.  And “fogged” glass is one of the ways that allowed this to be achieved, since now the device does not slip in the hand and gets less dirty. </p><h2>  Concept applied in Z5 </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Since the Japanese are the descendants of the samurai, and here experts do not forget to joke that even the masters of ancient martial arts themselves said that the smartphone should be an extension of the hand.  Probably, each of us would like to constantly feel the convenience and comfort when working with our smartphone.  This is not to say that Sony Mobile was able to achieve this in all of its creations, but in the case of the Z5 Premium it clearly did. </p><p>  It was pleasantly surprised that the color of the interface theme matches the color of the device itself.  In general, I would like to note the work of software engineers of the company, because they made the interface not only beautiful and efficient to use, but also as clear and comfortable as possible.  Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual, a technical review of which we will conduct a little later, now uses a fingerprint scanner to remove the lock, for example.  It can be found on the right side, it is mounted in the power control button.  By the way, it is impossible not to mention that it was the Z5 that became the first line (worldwide!), In which 3D-based ultrasound technologies are used for scanning. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Dual: camera review </h2>

    <p>  All three smartphones in the series are equipped with a camera that has the same resolution.  It equals 23 megapixels.  Focus refers to the hybrid type, that is, it is phase and contrast together.  Interestingly, the representatives of the Japanese company made a statement in which they mentioned that “Premium” will have the fastest focus on the subject, and it will be only three hundredths of a second.  To date, this figure is a record. </p><p>  At the same time, five times digital zoom can be used without losing quality.  In terms of front cameras, we do not have large differences.  All three devices of the line are equipped with modules with a resolution of five megapixels.  Video can be shot in the so-called 4K quality.  And it really pleases.  It's nice to see that the engineers for such smartphones did not significantly limit the possibilities.  The algorithms for creating photos and recording videos were worked out by the software department for glory.  Engineers made a bet in their work to ensure that there are no blurry photographs, as well as improve quality when zooming.  In general, there can be no complaints about the device. </p><h2>  Appearance Features </h2>

    <p>  We can say that the model is returning more to the rigor that was characteristic of the Z and Z2 generations.  The corps cannot be called solid otherwise.  It has an impressive appearance, its thickness is almost seven and a half millimeters (to be more precise, it is 7.45).  The sensations at the first <span>tactile contact are</span> quite pleasant.  And all thanks to the fact that the whole frame was made of a mixture of frosted glass and polished aluminum.  But there are some similar points with the Z5 and Z3 +. </p><p>  For example, the frame protrudes from the front and back surfaces by a fraction of a millimeter.  A similar move is used by many companies in their creations and is designed to help avoid the model slipping when placed horizontally on one or another surface.  In some ways, this solution should please users.  It is practical and sometimes very much helps out.  But it’s much nicer to feel a completely smooth edge in your hand.  As it was, for example, in the case of Z3. </p><p>  If we talk about color solutions, then there are four of them.  This is a black graphite option, white, green and, of course, gold.  The device is called in such vestment Sony Xperia Z5 Premium Gold.  As you can see, designers and marketers weren’t particularly wise with the name. </p><h2>  Sony <span>Xperia Z5</span> Premium: reviews </h2>

    <p>  It has been a long time since the model became available for purchase.  And this means that we can analyze the reviews of different people about the device.  Recall that the cost of this model is currently almost 60 thousand rubles.  The device is rightly called the flagship.  And for devices of this category, there is one characteristic feature - to collect the very best that was previously proposed in a number of other devices.  This, in fact, we can see on the example of “Premium”.  However, this does not mean that the smartphone has no shortcomings.  It has.  However, we will talk about them a little later, and now we will present the strengths of the device. </p><h2>  pros </h2><p>  The first advantage, of course, is the camera of the device.  The main module is 23 megapixels and the front one is 5 - why not beauty?  And if you take into account the fact that you can shoot video in 4K quality, then in general you can be very pleasantly surprised.  Powerful filling (you can read more about it in the technical specifications) allows you to easily cope with multitasking mode.  Although this is already a basic feature of even budget devices. </p><p>  More importantly, the cores handle a powerful load, which makes it possible to launch the most demanding toys.  You don’t see this every day, but it would be strange if the device for 60 thousand rubles did not allow this.  By the way, such a price was clearly charged to manufacturers, since there are no competitors in the model sector. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Among the disadvantages is the density of dots on the screen.  Many experts say that in this area indicators do not correspond to reality.  There are claims to the hardware.  Yes, the phone pulls the most powerful toys.  However, from time to time, due to severe overheating, the FPS decreases, which greatly affects performance.  Otherwise, everyone is happy with everything. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The device operates in the GSM bands, as well as UMTS.  LTE channels are provided for use, thanks to the corresponding module, the smartphone supports work in fourth-generation cellular networks.  For communication, two SIM cards are used, which must first be processed according to the NanoSIM standard.  The following are available from wireless interfaces: “Bluetooth” version 4.1, analog radio and Wi-Fi operating in the ranges a, b, g, n, ac.  Navigation in space is provided by three technologies at once: American GPS, Russian GLONASS and Chinese BeiDou. </p><h2>  OS, memory, hardware </h2><p>  “Android” version 5.1 is installed as the operating system on board the device.  The amount of internal RAM is three gigabytes.  Recall that as a chipset we have an integrated device from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 810 model, which has the name MCM8994.  Thus, the processor employs eight cores.  Half of them operate at a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz, and the second half at 2 GHz. </p><p>  The role of the graphics accelerator is played by Adreno 430. Once again, let's recall the cameras.  The front has a resolution of 5 megapixels, the main - 23. It is equipped, by the way, with an auto focus function.  Almost 22 gigabytes of read-only memory are available for the user, but its full capacity is 32 GB.  The smartphone supports the installation of external drives. </p><h2>  Display, sensors, battery life </h2><p>  The capacitive-type screen has a diagonal of 5.5 inches.  The display matrix is ​​made using IPS technology, multi-touch function is supported.  The set of sensors “contains” a barometer, <span>an ambient light</span> and proximity <span>sensor</span> , a <span>digital compass, a</span> pedometer, a microgyroscope and a fingerprint scanner.  The built-in battery is rated at 3430 milliamps per hour.  The mass of the device is 181 grams. </p>
