Pretty quickly she gained popularity and reached the most remote corners of the planet. </p><p>  It‚Äôs impossible to complete the puzzle without proper dexterity, even after doing a hundred manipulations, but relatively recently, specialists from <span>Google</span> Inc.  learned how to collect a rubik's cube in 20 moves.  They managed to achieve this phenomenal result with the help of a computer, which was given the task of analyzing all possible combinations. </p><h2>  Where did the Rubik's cube come from? </h2><p>  Back in 1974, the Hungarian architect and teacher at the Academy of Applied Arts Ern√∂ Rubik thought about the best way to learn <span>three-dimensional space.</span> </p>

    <p>  He wanted the new invention to help students study the world, and once a sensational thought occurred to him - to create a puzzle.  The task, it would seem, is elementary - to rotate the rows of the cube until each side becomes monochrome.  But the assembly diagram of the Rubik's Cube is not so simple and can take even several hours in time, without giving a result.  Students appreciated an <span>interesting invention</span> and were carried away by a new toy.  At that moment, the creator did not suspect that after many years, scientists would puzzle over a puzzle until they figure out how to assemble a rubik's cube in 20 moves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How global popularity came </h2><p>  At first, the original toy was not popular among investors.  It was believed that its production would not be profitable, since the assembly of the Rubik's cube can only be of interest to intellectuals.  Nevertheless, one small enterprise decided to invest in this unusual project, and the puzzle began to conquer Budapest. </p>

    <p>  A few years later, Tibor Lakzi, an intermediary of one of the German companies, arrived in the city, became interested in the original puzzle, which at that time was very popular among the townspeople.  Realizing that the spread of an amazing invention around the world can bring huge profits, he decided to promote a rubik's cube.  For novice businessmen Lakzy and Rubik, the main difficulty was finding investors.  But thanks to the economic education of Tibor and his commercial vein, the owner of Seven Towns Ltd Tom Kremer was soon involved in the project.  He took up large-scale production and distribution, which helped the cube become popular throughout the world. </p><h2>  "God's Algorithm" </h2><p>  Since 1982, competitions have been regularly held in many countries in which the main task of the participants is the rapid assembly of the Rubik's Cube.  In order to solve the puzzle as quickly as possible, it is not enough just to have good dexterity and quick wit.  A person should be aware of the optimal Rubik's cube assembly scheme, which allows to spend as little effort as possible.  The minimum number of steps necessary to solve the task, is the "Algorithm of God." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Many learned minds and ordinary amateurs tried to find a solution.  At one time it was believed that the minimum number of steps from any position was 18, but later this theory was refuted.  Many years were spent searching for the optimal sequence, and only in 2010, scientists were able to learn how to assemble a rubik's cube in 20 moves, regardless of what position the puzzle was in before assembling.  This is currently an absolute record. </p><h2>  Who is faster - a car or a person? </h2><p>  At the moment, the fastest of the people is the American student Colin Burns - he managed to solve the puzzle in less than 5.5 seconds.  And the robot, assembled by British engineers from the details of the <span>Lego Mindstorm</span> EV3 designer, coped with this task in 3.253 seconds.  The advantage of the mechanism is not only that the work of all its parts is more coherent than human actions.  Scientists gave him as many as 4 hands, which allow him to perform all operations 2 times faster. </p><h2>  How to learn to collect it </h2><p>  There is not one standard Rubik's Cube scheme that allows you to quickly learn how to solve this original puzzle.  Various assembly systems allow different approaches to the issue.  Which one to choose, it's up to you.  Of course, it is unlikely that without the computer capabilities of Google you will learn how to collect a rubik-cube in 20 moves, but learn how to find simple solutions in a short time.  The main thing is that you have enough perseverance.  No technique will help to solve the puzzle without problems if you are not ready to spend your valuable time on learning. </p><p>  But you should not give all this time to this toy.  Doctors noted an increase in the number of patients in psychiatric clinics after the appearance of the Rubik's Cube.  And traumatologists began to regularly encounter symptoms, later called "Rubik's syndrome."  It manifests itself in the form of acute <span>pain in the wrists.</span> </p><h2>  Assembly diagram </h2><p>  There are several schemes that allow beginners to quickly learn how to fold a Rubik's Cube.  One of them is attached to this article: </p>

    <ol><li>  First you need to collect a cross, the ends of which are continued on adjacent faces.  There is no universal method - everything comes with practice. </li><li>  Next, you need to complete the entire side on which the cross was assembled, and assemble a belt from the details around it.  It is important to ensure that each belt is monochrome. </li><li>  Now you need to collect the second belt and go to the opposite side of the cube. </li><li>  We assemble the cross on this side in the same way as at the very beginning. </li><li>  Finish the whole side. </li><li>  Now we put in order the corners of the cube - we make it so that the colors on them correspond to the colors of the sides to which they are turned. </li><li>  It remains only to correctly rotate parts having only 2 sides.  The cube is assembled. </li></ol>
