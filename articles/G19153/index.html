This area is planted with tall pine trees, which give coolness to the townspeople in the hot summer.  Here is one of the most beautiful green areas of the region - the Scarlet Sails Park.  Our material will tell about the history and features of this square. </p><h2>  Scenic Area </h2><p>  Most of the garden compositions appeared on this territory with the beginning of the reign of Soviet power.  It has become a good tradition to plant new squares and solemnly open them. </p>

    <p>  This happened in Voronezh.  Those who visited this city before the collapse of the USSR remember exactly the interesting and beautiful green town.  The park began its history on July 8, 1975.  The site for the object was chosen very well: the shore of the reservoir was planted with lush and tall pines.  These trees today delight the townspeople with a shady coolness in the summer.  Another advantage was the Voronezh Sea.  On the shore of the reservoir, people swam and sunbathed.  But in the early 1990s, sanitary services banned swimming, as the quality of the water did not meet the norm.  Since then, fishing here has been exclusively of sporting interest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New breath </h2><p>  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the park began to decline.  A beautiful and quiet square awaited several years of indifference.  In 2009, the object became municipal property. </p><p>  A year later, the square began to come to life.  On its territory held various festivals and competitions for citizens.  But the complex needed a general reconstruction and updating.  Therefore, in 2011, restoration work began. </p><p>  And already on September 15, the Scarlet Sails Park was inaugurated.  This event was dedicated to the 425th anniversary of the founding of the city of Voronezh.  Olivier Dame worked on the composition.  This is a French landscape designer and architect, working as an adviser in the Ministry of Culture of his native country.  Thanks to the light hand of the master, the park is characterized by Parisian airiness and luxury.  Then the professional set about another Voronezh square - Dynamo. </p>

    <h2>  Enchanting discovery </h2><p>  Olivier Damet successfully graduated from the Versailles school in his homeland.  Currently, all of France is listening to his ideas for arranging gardens.  Lucky and Voronezh to work with this outstanding architect. </p><p>  Scarlet Sails Park is an ode to naturalness and weightlessness.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe author was to use a minimum of artificial materials, so the object was decorated with wood.  The reconstruction was carried out day and night, but despite this, at the opening of the complex could not please visitors with all its beauty.  Lawns did not have time to turn green, and the flowers bloom.  But earned children's and sports grounds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A special highlight of the park was a specially bred and grown variety of roses, which were called "Voronezh".  Settled territory squirrels and birds.  For birds even built a special town. </p><p>  The opening ceremony was completed by a theatrical performance.  The audience was shown a performance, the main characters of which were the characters of the story of Alexander Greene "Scarlet Sails". </p>

In the park, a man rests from the bustle of the city.  The fact that in the territory of this small reserve it is forbidden to drink alcohol, smoke, use foul language and be intoxicated is also pleasing to visitors.  And guests of the complex note that on weekdays they observe these rules.  But this, unfortunately, can not be said about the holiday dates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Versatile relaxation </h2><p>  The territory of the park is uneven.  This 6.2 hectare plot of land is covered with hills and steep slopes.  But they are very convenient for travel. </p>

    <p>  Practicing and mass festivities Scarlet Sails Park.  Voronezh celebrates City Day in a special way.  Famous musicians are invited to this square, and the holiday ends with a traditional salute. </p><p>  You can sit calmly and comfortably in the chess house, which is also known as the library.  Many visitors come here with their books.  There is also internet.  But guests of the park note that the signal is very weak.  In addition, modern phones do not hold energy for a long time, and there is nowhere to recharge the gadget.  If you prefer outdoor activities, you can ride bicycles in the alleys. </p><p>  For fans of history in the center are stands with information about the different periods of the city's development. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations from the "experienced" </h2><p>  There are cafes and restaurants on the territory where you can eat.  But visitors are not happy with the price.  Therefore, those who have already visited the park more than once recommend feeding children at home before the start of the walk.  It is also better for kids to wear hats, since not all parts of the park are protected from sunlight.  There are a lot of attractions on the territory, but the ticket price bites, so it‚Äôs better to immediately explain to the children that there may not be enough money for all the entertainment. </p><p>  It has its own large parking lot for cars "Scarlet Sails".  How to get to the green corner?  The question that residents of the city does not arise.  But for tourists we‚Äôll inform you: several routes from different parts of Voronezh run to the complex.  There are buses (there are about 10) and trams numbered 4 and 11. You need to get off on Leninsky Prospekt.  Your stop is Arzamasskaya street.  From there, you need to walk three to four minutes to the entrance to the park. </p><p>  There is always an atmosphere of celebration and joy.  The mood is raised by street musicians playing and singing in a wide variety of styles.  Citizens say they come to Scarlet Sails Park for clean air from exhaust fumes and tobacco smoke. </p>
