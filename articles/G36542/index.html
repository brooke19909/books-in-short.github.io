    <h2>  Skioni </h2><p>  This peninsula of mainland Greece has a good reputation among tourists.  There are many historical places, natural attractions.  One of these pearls of the peninsula is the village of Nea Scioni.  This resort grew up on the site of several fishing villages, which were located at the ruins of the city described by the ancient historian Thucydides.  There, according to legend, after the Trojan War, the Greeks brought captive slaves, married them, and thus Skioni arose.  But in the Middle Ages, this city fell into decay, gradually collapsing, and in the end the inhabitants moved to nearby villages.  The main occupation of local, in addition to serving tourists, is fishing.  And two kilometers from the center of the village, on the cape, there is a 16th-century Orthodox chapel dedicated to the Mother of God of the Holy See.  There are ancient murals and an icon that is considered miraculous.  It was in this place that the new Scion Palace Beach Hotel 4 * hotel was built (Halkidiki, Kassandra).  In Nea Skioni, you can take a walk along the beautiful promenade, admire the marina with boats, boats and yachts.  Not bad and the local city beach.  It is quiet, and olive groves grow along the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Scion Palace Beach Hotel 4 * Halkidiki" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2123746.jpg"></div>
