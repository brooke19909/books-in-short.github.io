  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh: biography, years of rule, main events</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The grandfather of Vladimir Monomakh was the great Russian prince Yaroslav the Wise.  Is wisdom inherited?  Who knows.  But the memory of the great grandfather, Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh did not shame - his rule was one of the most calm and fair in the history of Kievan Rus.  The merit of Vladimir Monomakh is the unification of the Russian Zemstvo, the strengthening of centralized power, the cessation of strife, the creation of a strong army. </p><p>  No less famous is the ‚ÄúCharter of Vladimir Monomakh‚Äù and his ‚ÄúTeaching to Children‚Äù.  And for many, the name of this ruler is firmly connected with the cap of the same name, a symbol of the autocracy of Russia.  The reign of Prince Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh is the time of the creation of a strong state in which the army, culture, and economy developed. </p><h2>  Monomakh Ancestors </h2><p>  Of all his children, the great Yaroslav the Wise preferred son Vsevolod.  This was not a secret - for example, Yaroslav in his will gave instructions to bury Vsevolod in the future next to his own sarcophagus in St. Sophia Cathedral.  Two eldest sons - Izyaslav and Svyatoslav - were not awarded such an honor. </p><p>  Is this the reason for the change in the succession order introduced by Yaroslav the Wise?  Perhaps he wanted far from the eldest son to rule the Russian land?  Maybe I saw in it a huge potential?  Guessing about it now is useless, but in the Testament of 1054, Yaroslav clearly indicates a new procedure for obtaining power.  According to the document, the throne is now inherited not from father to son, but passes to the eldest in the family.  Thanks to this succession order, Vsevolod really got the opportunity to become a great prince, after his older brothers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vsevolod, the father of Vladimir, was famous for his scholarship - so, Monomakh later proudly said that his father was able to independently learn 5 languages.  Vsevolod surrounded himself with learned men, monks and nuns, collected a library of rare books.  His wife was the Byzantine princess, whose name history has not preserved.  The most common version is that she was the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomakh.  Hence the answer to the question why Vladimir Vsevolodovich received the nickname Monomakh - this is a generic name transmitted to him through the maternal side.  Translated "Monomakh" means "martial artist."  It is difficult to imagine a more suitable nickname for the Grand Duke. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh was born in 1053;  just a year later his brilliant grandfather dies.  The first 13 years of his life - everything that was allotted to him under the motto ‚Äúchildhood‚Äù - passed in Pereyaslav-Yuzhny, at the court of his father.  Vladimir was taught literacy, military affairs, the law of God.  The little prince was often taken with him for hunting - he was an excellent rider, was not afraid of a wild beast, his father's squad respected him.  Later, in his famous ‚ÄúVladimir Monomakh's Teaching to Children,‚Äù Monomakh wrote: </p><blockquote><p>  I visited the paws of a bear, and on the horns of the tour. </p></blockquote><div class="photo" data-original="kinohit.mirtesen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir Monomakh on the hunt" class="if uuid-3122785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114188/3122785.jpg"></div><h2>  13 years: childhood is over.  Independent reign in the Rostov-Suzdal lands </h2><p>  To take over the reins of this offspring of the Rurikovich had very early.  At 13, his father put him on an independent reign in the Rostov-Suzdal lands.  At that time it was far from the center of the world;  It was inhabited by people engaged in hunting and various types of fishing.  Christianity was the official religion, but the influence of paganism in those lands was still great - in lean years, bonfires were burned and sacrifices were made to the ancient gods, pagan songs were sung. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="churches in Suzdal" class="if uuid-3122818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114188/3122818.jpg"></div><p>  It was in such a "wild land" that young Vladimir came to reign with his retinue.  He immediately visited first in Rostov, then in Suzdal, then made a "raid" on the smaller cities of the principality.  Assessing these lands, seeing their perspective, Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh began to actively develop and build them up.  So, to his merits in this period of time include the strengthening of Rostov and Suzdal with new fortresses, the foundation of the new city of Vladimir-on-Klyazma, the construction of the first stone cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin in Suzdal. </p><h2>  Principality in Smolensk and Chernihiv </h2><p>  In 1073, Vladimir Monomakh was put to reign in Smolensk.  Having gained experience in the Rostov-Suzdal lands, he no less effectively became managing the Smolensk lands.  But this is a fairly short period - only 5 years.  Already in 1078, the life of Monomakh makes a sharp turn. </p><p>  In 1078, his father, Vsevolod Yaroslavovich, began to rule Kiev.  Vladimir, as his eldest son and right hand, was given control of the city of Chernihiv and the surrounding lands.  At this point, Vladimir was already quite an experienced warrior - by the age of 25 he managed to make 20 military campaigns.  The strong talent of the military leader came in handy just in time - in these lands raids of the Mongol-Tatars and Polovtsy were frequent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The right hand of the prince of Kiev </h2><p>  The next fifteen years, Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh - the main adviser to his father, the Grand Duke of Kiev, his hope and support.  Several times a month he rode the distance from Chernigov to Kiev on horseback, if his father needed his advice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="24smi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir Monomakh in the battle" class="if uuid-3122793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114188/3122793.jpg"></div><p>  A number of historians note the shortsightedness of Monomakh's father, Vsevolod, as a military leader.  Paying tribute to his cunning and quirky mind in matters of politics, with careful study, it became clear that all military victories during the reign of Vsevolod were won either directly by his son Vladimir, or under his direct leadership. </p><h2>  Justice Above All: Abandoning the Kiev Throne </h2><p>  In 1093, Vsevolod Yaroslavovich dies.  The years were hard - crop failure for several years in a row, a circle of death and illness.  Vladimir Monomakh - the eldest son of the late prince, is known for his wisdom and prudence, and many boyars of that time wanted to see him on the throne. </p><p>  But Monomakh always put law and decency in the forefront and was not going to challenge the rules of succession introduced by his grandfather, Yaroslav the Wise.  He without the slightest hesitation gives control to the elder in the family of the Rurikovich.  Such at that time was his cousin Svyatopolk Izyaslavovich, who was sitting in the small town of Turov.  Svyatopolk‚Äôs team was more than modest - it amounted to only 800 people, nothing compared to the military capabilities of Vladimir.  In the event of a military coup, Svyatopolk would have no chance, but Monomakh voluntarily removed himself from the political scene for many years. </p><p>  He went to rule Chernihiv, but a year later, in 1094, he gave this city to Prince Oleg Svyatoslavovich, the godfather of his firstborn, Mstislav.  Oleg expressed his claims to this city, but, not having the troops to take it by force, enlisted the support of the Polovtsy, who in exchange for help devastated the Chernigov land.  Monomakh decided not to shed the blood of Russian people in vain and voluntarily gives Chernihiv.  He himself is content with a modest by that standards Pereyaslavl principality. </p><h2>  Son of Monomakh against the son of Prince of Kiev </h2><p>  The forces and influence of Monomakh during this period are perfectly illustrated by the situation with Novgorod.  According to the testament of Yaroslav the Wise, this city had a special status.  The second most important after Kiev, Novgorod was not included in the list of estates passed through the birth ladder.  According to tradition, the son of the Kiev prince ruled in it.  At the time of Svyatopolk‚Äôs accession to the Kiev throne in Novgorod, the firstborn Monomakh, his son Mstislav, ruled. </p><p>  In 1102, Svyatopolk made an attempt to replace the son of Monomakh with his own offspring, but suffered a crushing failure.  The Novgorodians, who love the wise beyond the years of Mstislav, answered the Kiev prince: "If your son has two heads, then send him to us."  Svyatopolk did not risk it.  Thus, the tradition of transferring power in Novgorod was violated and the strength of Monomakh was once again demonstrated. </p><h2>  The death of Svyatopolk.  Rebellion of the people </h2><p>  In the spring of <span>1113, the</span> Kiev prince Svyatopolk dies.  Poisoning was suspected, but now most historians are leaning toward a version of death from an ulcer.  At the time of Svyatopolk‚Äôs death, ordinary people were in an extremely depressed state.  The main trouble - moneylenders, to whom the late prince was sympathetic.  Svyatopolk and his family, largely because of this, were extremely unpopular among the people. </p><p>  At that time, the moneylenders had a spread of 200-300% per loan.  A huge number of ordinary people could not pay off such loans.  They sold the money lenders the last thing they had - wives, children, and ultimately themselves.  As a result, entire families turned into free slaves from free people. </p><p>  Dissatisfied with the reign of Svyatopolk were merchants.  Shortly before his death, a ‚Äúsalt tax‚Äù was introduced, which significantly limited the possibility of trade. </p><p>  The result of the discontent of almost all segments of the population was the uprising of 1113.  On the day of the death of the prince, many moneylenders were killed, their wealth plundered.  Attacks on Jewish neighborhoods began.  The boyars and wealthy citizens were in a panic - what if the fury of the people would spread to them?  A new ruler was urgently needed - a strong, confident, respected and proven justice.  None of the existing Rurikovich at that time fit this description better than Vladimir II Vsevolodovich Monomakh. </p><h2>  Accession to the throne of Kiev </h2><p>  May 4, 1113 Vladimir Monomakh boyars filed a petition calling for the occupation of the throne of Kiev.  Vladimir was not the first in the line - ‚Äúby law‚Äù Oleg Chernigovsky, the oldest man in the family, was to become the new Kiev prince.  But no one opposed such a soft coup d'etat and did not dispute Monomakh‚Äôs right to the throne.  Thus, in 1113, Russia gains one of the wisest and most just rulers in its history. </p><h2>  The reform </h2><p>  Having received the right to a great reign, Monomakh first of all solves the problem of usury.  This question was urgent. </p><p>  He publishes a new law, the so-called ‚ÄúCharter on cuts,‚Äù which later became part of the Old Russian legislation of the ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù.  The new law prohibited taking more than 50% per annum from debtors;  if the debtor (or, in other words, ‚Äúprocurement‚Äù) worked for the creditor for 3 years, his debt, together with interest, was considered paid.  The ‚ÄúArticles of Association" reduced social tension in society.  The sympathies of the common people for the new Kiev prince were strengthened. </p><h2>  State gain time </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsbee.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monomakh hat" class="if uuid-3124321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/3124321.jpg"></div><p>  Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh during the reign established himself as a ruler, consolidating the position of Kievan Rus.  The period of reign of Vladimir and his son Mstislav is the last period of strengthening the centralized power of the Kiev princes.  By 1125, three-quarters of then Rus were in the hands of Vladimir Monomakh and his sons.  Weak attempts by relatives to change the situation, for example, the son of Svyatopolk Yaroslav, were stopped in the bud. </p><p>  By the time of accession to the throne, Monomakh was already 60 years old.  Wise, balanced decisions - this is what distinguished Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh.  Domestic and foreign policy was subordinated to one goal - strengthening the centralized Russian state </p><h2>  Dynastic marriages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="worldhistoryconnected.press.uillinois.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding Rite in Kievan Rus" class="if uuid-3122826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114188/3122826.jpg"></div><p>  It was with the aim of strengthening the role of Russia in the international arena that Monomakh actively used dynastic marriages.  He had many children, even more grandchildren - and for all the ruler tried to find a party that was profitable at that time. </p><p>  Monomakh passed off his daughter as a Byzantine, who depicted Leo Diogenes, the deceased son of Emperor Roman IV Diogenes. </p><p>  Three of his granddaughters, the daughters of the eldest son Mstislav, were married to foreign monarchs: for the kings of Norway and Hungary and for the Danish prince.  Another granddaughter, Eupraxia, became the wife of the nephew of the emperor of Byzantium. </p><p>  The son of Monomakh, Yuri Dolgoruky, married the daughter of the Polovtsian khan.  This was one of the most visionary marriages - the son of Yuri, Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky, in the future will have loyal allies in the person of the Polovtsy. </p><p>  Son Mstislav was married to the Swedish Princess Christine. </p><p>  Do not count marriages concluded by the daughters and granddaughters of Monomakh with Russian princes.  The great ruler tried to achieve family unity in all ways. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Monomakh was married at least twice;  most historians are still inclined to think that he had three wives. </p><p>  First wife, Gita of Wessex, English princess, daughter of King Harold the Second.  Monomakh had 5 sons from her marriage, and according to some versions 6 sons - Mstislav (future Grand Duke), Izyaslav, Svyatoslav, Yaropolk, Vyacheslav. </p><p>  The second wife appeared in the life of Monomakh when he was 46 years old.  He‚Äôs been widowed for two years already - the wife of Geeta died in 1097, according to legend, participating in a crusade.  History has not preserved the name of the second wife, it is only known that she was a Greek.  For 8 years she gave birth to Vladimir six children, including the founder of Moscow, Yuri Dolgorukov.  All her children bore Greek names.  In 1107, the Greek woman died. </p><p>  About the third wife of Vladimir Monomakh information has been preserved even less.  A number of historians generally deny her existence, believing that Monomakh was married twice.  But nevertheless, most of them are inclined to the version that the Polovtsian princess became the third wife of the prince who crossed the 50-year frontier, who took the name Anna at baptism.  There is no information about children from this marriage, but it is known that the third wife survived her husband for 2 years. </p><h2>  Literary heritage of Monomakh </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.colourbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient book" class="if uuid-3122820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114188/3122820.jpg"></div><p>  Vladimir Monomakh, like his father, was a literate man, well-read.  Only 4 of his creations have survived to our time: </p><ul><li>  "Vladimir Monomakh's instruction to children."  One of the most ancient Russian literary monuments.  The ‚ÄúTeaching‚Äù addresses the theme of faith, the adoption of Christian values, and helping those in need.  Vladimir also gives instructions on the importance of unity and centralization of power.  Being a wise politician, he saw what internecine wars and the thirst for personal power lead to, and tried to warn descendants. </li></ul><ul><li>  Letter to Oleg Svyatoslavich.  This letter, addressed to a cousin, Monomakh writes after the death of his youngest son, who died in a battle with Oleg.  Monomakh longingly asks why the brother did not repent before him, hopes for reconciliation and asks to send the widow of his murdered son to him. </li></ul><ul><li>  Chronicle of military campaigns.  A work in which Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh describes his brave campaigns in the first person.  The biography of the prince is generously strewn with victories.  He personally participated in 83 military campaigns. </li></ul><ul><li>  Charter of Vladimir Monomakh.  Old Russian code of laws restricting the rights of money lenders and the power of landowners </li></ul><h2>  Death </h2><p>  May 19, 1125 Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh completed his journey.  The main events of his life - the creation of additions to the "Russian Truth", the expulsion of the Pechenegs from the Russian land, the world with the Polovtsian khans - all this was aimed at strengthening the central authority in Russia.  He lived an extremely long 71 years at that time, and, according to eyewitnesses, worked all these years for the benefit of a strong Russia.  He was granted easy death. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev" class="if uuid-3122823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114188/3122823.jpg"></div><p>  The man who united the country, increased its military power, strengthened the position of Russia in the international arena, was buried with honors in Kiev, in St. Sophia Cathedral, next to his esteemed father. </p>
