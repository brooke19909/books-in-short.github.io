Sometimes it can be convenient, and sometimes it can get in the way.  Therefore, from this article you will learn several ways of how to block the Xiaomi bootloader, and you will understand why this is necessary. </p><h2>  Xiaomi smartphones </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.improgrammer.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to flash xiaomi with a locked bootloader" class="if uuid-2988916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2988916.jpg"></div><p>  The Chinese company Xiaomi was founded recently: in 2010.  Nevertheless, she instantly gained momentum and began to produce cheap and high-quality smartphones, which are in great demand every year.  In addition to the Redmi series, the company began to produce fitness bracelets, as well as power banks, laptops, televisions and other electronics.  Like any company, Xiaomi has its pros and cons.  The advantages include affordable prices, its own operating system and excellent technical specifications.  The MIUI operating system, which is the sole development of the company, deserves special mention.  It may be slightly unusual at first, but after a while, most users get so used to it that they no longer feel the desire to switch to other systems.  Many highlights, such as fingerprint locking, appeared in MIUI much earlier than in other companies.  The system is intuitive, so a person of any age can understand it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Phone Xiaomi Mi 8 was a real breakthrough in the line.  A high-contrast display, a thin body with rounded edges and the latest processor make life comfortable for users.  The smartphone allows you to take great pictures that are in no way inferior to those shot with a professional camera.  Despite all the advantages, Xiaomi has some disadvantages.  For example, minor flaws in the system or poor user support.  Otherwise, the Chinese flagships continue to win the hearts of customers and make their lives even more convenient and comfortable. </p><h2>  Xiaomi bootloader </h2><p>  How to lock bootloader Xiaomi Note 3?  First you need to decide what role the bootloader plays in the Xiaomi system.  Bootloader is a built-in component on Xiaomi devices, which is an analogue of the BIOS.  If you get the right to make changes to the system, you can directly influence various areas and programs.  The standard OS is protected from outside interference in the settings, so to unlock the bootloader you need to make a certain amount of effort.  In addition, the Xiaomi company blocks the bootloader in order to avoid introducing into the OS viruses that have recently begun to grow like mushrooms after rain.  If you became the owner of a smartphone on which you can perform various operations directly, then most likely you bought a fake.  Therefore, avoid entering personal data on such a phone. </p><p>  Why block Xiaomi bootloader? </p><ul><li>  In order to protect yourself and your data.  With the bootloader locked, malware will not interfere and forward bank card information to unauthorized persons. </li><li>  The presence on the phone of an unlocked bootloader is complicated by the removal of the lock from a stolen or lost phone. </li><li>  It is impossible to find a phone with a locked bootloader. </li><li>  For weekly verification.  When unlocking the bootloader, some programs can bypass this ritual, which means that you will not be able to restore the system in the future. <div class="photo" data-original="www.geekbuying.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi bootloader lock" class="if uuid-2988920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2988920.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to find out the status of the bootloader? </h2><p>  How to find out if the bootloader is locked on Xiaomi?  There are several ways to do this: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Through the phone settings. </li><li>  Using a personal computer on Windows or Linux. </li></ol><p>  The easiest way is to go to your smartphone‚Äôs settings, in the ‚ÄúAbout the device‚Äù section.  Next, click ‚ÄúKernel‚Äù and open the Softwareversion tab.  In it you will find the Fastboot line.  Under it you can see the status of the bootloader.  If it says lock, it means it is locked.  If unlock - unlocked.  You can also find out the status using a computer with the Windows operating system.  To do this, you need to download your smartphone in a special mode called Fastboot, and then connect it to your computer using a USB cable.  Next, you need to press the combination Win + R, after which the service window will appear on your screen.  Using the cmd command, a command line will be launched, in which you need to drive in the adb combination, and then confirm the execution of the command.  Next, you need to get information about the bootloader.  To do this, just enter ‚Äúfastboot oem device-info‚Äù, after which the program will return the result ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù.  In the first case, this will mean that the bootloader is locked, and in the second - unlocked. </p><p>  Another way to find out the status of the Xiaomi Mi 8 bootloader is to check it using the Linux system.  In this case, this can be done a little faster and easier.  Just enter the command ‚Äúadb - sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot‚Äù in the terminal.  In this case, the smartphone should also be in Fastboot mode.  The command to check the status of the bootloader is the same as on Windows.  Sometimes the system may give a ‚ÄúDevice Waiting‚Äù result.  This will mean that you did not log into the computer as an administrator.  A change of user should fix the situation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="guviblogs.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to block xiaomi bootloader via flashing" class="if uuid-2988917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2988917.jpg"></div><h2>  Xiaomi bootloader lock </h2><p>  Sometimes users need to get rid of the system to which access is open.  Many owners of Chinese smartphones ask how to block the Xiaomi bootloader.  There are several ways to do this.  The easiest - using a computer, without flashing.  This method does not require the deletion of all data, so it runs much faster.  What is needed to block? </p><ul><li>  Windows computer from the 7th version.  If you have an outdated operating system, then upgrade it before starting the process. </li><li>  Drivers for the phone that allow the computer to recognize it. </li><li>  A charged battery so that the phone does not interrupt the procedure in the middle. </li><li>  Official firmware on the phone.  Otherwise, you risk getting a ‚Äúdead‚Äù device that is unlikely to turn on again. </li></ul><p>  It is also necessary to remember that on some phones the second lock can cause errors in the system.  If you already blocked the bootloader, and then re-unlocked it, then it is better to take the device to a professional.  How does the blocking process go? </p><ol><li>  First you need to open the Fastboot program. </li><li>  Next, go to the section "USB Debugging" on the phone.  Usually it is located in the section for developers. </li><li>  After enabling debug mode, you need to connect the phone to the computer.  You need to do this using a pre-prepared USB cable. </li><li>  Open the command window in the folder with adb. </li><li>  You just have to enter the adb reboot fastboot command.  Next, type fastboot oem lock and press Enter. </li></ol><h2>  Flashing lock </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to lock bootloader xiaomi note 3" class="if uuid-2988927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2988927.jpg"></div><p>  There is another way to block the bootloader.  It is more time-consuming and requires the mandatory storage of all data.  How to block Xiaomi bootloader through flashing?  The following must be done: </p><ol><li>  Transfer all data to a computer.  Unfortunately, during the flashing process, absolutely all information will be deleted.  Therefore, it is important to copy everything: from photos to phone numbers and notes.  Additional copying to an external hard drive or cloud storage is also worthwhile if the data volume is very large. </li><li>  Download the official MIUI firmware.  You can find it on the Xiaomi company website.  Make sure that you are not downloading a third-party application. </li><li>  Download MiFlash.  With this boot program, a new OS will be installed on your phone.  In this case, it is also important to use only official versions. </li><li>  Run the bootloader and specify the path to the downloaded operating system. </li><li>  Then enable Fastboot mode on your smartphone. </li><li>  Connect it to your computer. </li><li>  Click Refresh and wait for your device to appear in the list. </li><li>  Wait for the operation to complete. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, the answer to the question of how to block Xiaomi bootloader via the command line is quite simple.  To do this, just install one program and download the latest version of the OS.  Perhaps the most difficult part is the need to copy all the data. </p><h2>  Possible problems </h2><p>  With any method, problems can occur during installation.  But for most of them there are already ready-made solutions: </p><ul><li>  If you have any problems while logging into your account, then instead of your username or phone number, enter your ID. </li><li>  A message marked Network Error may indicate a problem on the company‚Äôs server.  Clear your cache or change the IP address. </li><li>  If your system does not support locking the bootloader, then there is only one way out - to reflash the device. </li><li>  Sometimes the process stops in the middle.  In this case, reinstalling the drivers for the phone on the computer can help. </li><li>  The phone does not go into Fastboot mode.  For the command window to appear on the phone screen, you must simultaneously press the power button and volume down button.  Try again several times if this does not work. </li><li>  The computer does not see the phone.  This is a very common situation, which can be caused by a damaged USB cable or the lack of the necessary drivers. </li><li>  After blocking the phone does not turn on for a long time.  Not a good outcome, which immediately makes you think about what mistakes you made during the procedure.  However, you may have simply disconnected the cable too soon or the battery has run out on the phone.  Try to repeat the procedure from the very beginning. </li></ul><p>  After you have locked the bootloader and turned on the phone for the first time, do not expect it to start working immediately.  As a rule, the device needs time, so it can remain inactive for several minutes.  Many phone owners fear that locking the bootloader could have a detrimental effect on the speed of their phone.  But it only changes the user's ability to make changes to the MIUI system, making it closed to tampering.  Thus, a locked bootloader cannot slow down a smartphone to any degree, but it will definitely increase the security of your data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="midphones.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi bootloader lock" class="if uuid-2988919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2988919.jpg"></div><h2>  Unlock process </h2><p>  More often, users ask how to unlock Bootloader.  How can I do that? </p><ol><li>  Get permission to unlock.  The request can be left on the official website of the company by entering your personal account. </li><li>  Download the MiFlash utility. </li><li>  Open it and enter your ID and password. </li><li>  Click the ‚ÄúUnblock‚Äù button. </li></ol><p>  After that, you can install on your smartphone any firmware, including Russian-language, as well as any programs.  Sometimes an error may occur while applying for an unlock.  Follow the status of your application in your account or submit another application if enough time has passed after the first one. </p><p>  The Xiaomi bootloader version depends on the phone model and operating system.  Therefore, before unlocking it is better to update it. </p><h2>  How to flash Xiaomi with a locked bootloader </h2><p>  When you buy a smartphone, it already has firmware on it, which implies a certain version of the operating system.  However, this may not be convenient for everyone.  At the moment, there are many custom versions modified by users.  Often they are much more convenient than versions of official manufacturers.  The same goes for the MIUI OS.  It often contains unnecessary options and applications that cannot be removed.  So the good news is that you can always change it.  The user can find a wide assortment of firmware in both Russian and English.  The official version can always be downloaded on the Xiaomi website.  Unfortunately, if you have a blocked Bootloader (bootloader), then installing a new firmware will be impossible.  There is only one option - either unlock it, or buy an older version, on which access to the bootloader is still open to all users.  If you are afraid of malware interference, then after flashing, just lock Bootloader back. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi bootloader status" class="if uuid-2988926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2988926.jpg"></div><h2>  Expert Advice </h2><p>  As for the use of the bootloader in the Xiaomi system, there are many opinions.  What do experts advise?  They unequivocally recommend that you do not leave the OS open to interventions.  After this procedure, the user will not be able to install a ‚Äúnon-native‚Äù system or firmware with support for the Russian language.  But access to system files will be closed, which means that the probability of malware penetration will approach zero.  An unlocked bootloader is like a wound that can infect any infection.  Therefore, only an experienced person who understands the device of smartphones can carry out various manipulations. </p><p>  In addition, the MIUI system itself is reliably protected from tampering.  Therefore, with a high degree of probability, after changing the firmware, it can easily determine how Bootloader was unlocked, and impose a ban on any actions.  As a result, the phone will stop turning on, and you will have to spend some amount on repairs.  How to block Xiaomi bootloader?  This is best done with a complete flashing of the device.  This is a more complex method, but at the same time more reliable.  If you decide to block the bootloader using the ‚ÄúUSB Debugging‚Äù section, if you install custom firmware, your phone may completely stop functioning properly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phonearena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to flash xiaomi with a locked bootloader" class="if uuid-2988921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2988921.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Re-flashing, installing various programs not from official sources - all this can cause a breakdown of your smartphone or its incorrect operation.  Therefore, many users ask about how to block the Xiaomi bootloader.  There are two ways to do this: using the command line or using a complete flashing.  The first option is faster, in addition, it allows you to save all personal data.  And the second allows you to completely reinstall the firmware, thereby eliminating all errors. </p>
