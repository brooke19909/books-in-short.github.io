Usually this happens as follows: the device was turned off, and it cannot be turned on, since there is no reaction to pressing the power button.  The first thing to do is connect the device to the charger and leave it for half an hour alone.  When the time has passed, right in the charging mode, simultaneously press the Power and Home buttons and hold them for at least 15 seconds.  Maybe the problem will be resolved at this stage, but if, despite the actions taken, the iPhone does not turn on, you will have to carry it to the service center for diagnosis and repair. </p><p>  What is the cause of the trouble?  And how much will her decision cost?  There are several options.  Let's try to figure out what could cause such a nuisance, and what to do if the iPhone does not turn on.  By the way, this can happen with a brand new device, and with a phone released in 2008. </p><ol><li>  The battery comes first under suspicion.  It is she who fails most often.  Moreover, in older devices, the battery usually just runs out, and the iPhone 3g does not turn on mainly due to factory defects made during the assembly of the battery.  Despite the cost and good quality of most of the batteries, production is never complete without marriage, especially since these parts for phones are manufactured in China.  If it is determined that it is the marriage that causes the problems, the device must be replaced.  If the battery simply has outlived its life and can not cope with the load, you can replace it with a battery with increased capacity.  It will cost about 2000 rubles.  It is likely that the matter is not in <span>the battery,</span> but in the charger.  Most often they are not repaired, but simply replaced.  The original ‚Äúcharge‚Äù for an iPhone will cost 700 rubles or more.  If both the charger and the battery are OK, but the device does not charge, the bottom loop may be damaged.  Its replacement will cost from 1,600 to 2,600 rubles, depending on the prices of the service center. </li><li>  The next most common problem is mechanical damage.  Remember, maybe the iPhone does not turn on due to the fact that it was recently dropped?  And not necessarily on the eve - some breakdowns occur after a certain time, and not immediately.  Even if there is no damage on the case, this does not mean that everything inside the device is also good.  So, what could have happened as a result of the blow: <ul><li>  there was a breakdown in <span>the power circuit,</span> repairs will cost from 1,500 rubles; </li><li>  the charging controller has burned out, the replacement cost can vary from 1,500 to 4,500 rubles; </li><li>  the motherboard has deteriorated, you can change it for 7500 rubles or more. </li></ul></li><li>  The same problems may arise not from shock, but from moisture entering the housing.  It is not necessary to drop the phone into the water, it will be damp enough for a long time, for example, to walk through a wet park after rain.  Theoretically, it can be untwisted and dried, but it‚Äôs practically better to entrust it to specialists, because everyone can disassemble an iPhone, but not everyone can put it back together so that there are no ‚Äúextra‚Äù parts. </li><li>  The next reason that <span>iPhone 4 does not turn on</span> may be problems with the firmware.  This is due to the fact that there is no ideal software, there can always be some kind of flaw in it that will lead to such a nuisance.  If when you turn on you see the appearance of the brand name - an apple and nothing else, then most likely the device will have to be reflashed.  In this case, you have nothing to lose, so before you go to the service center, try restarting your iPhone by simultaneously pressing the Power and Home buttons for 15 seconds.  Maybe help.  If it does not help, then flashing is done in RecoveryMode mode. </li></ol><p>  In general, an iPhone is not a thing that can be repaired at home on a knee.  In any case, you will have to contact the service.  Information about problems with the device and the cost of repairs will simply help you choose competent specialists with normal prices for services. </p>
