The bulk of people dream of an apartment, a house by the sea, a car, go on vacation with their families, and get a decent education. </p><p>  Any goal can be achieved if you competently approach the process and engage in financial planning of your income and expenses.  Using the offers from the largest bank, you can not only get interest, but also guaranteed to realize their desires. </p><h2>  Goals at Sberbank Online: what it is and to whom it may be useful </h2><p>  The largest bank offers its customers the eponymous service, which is an investment deposit with various terms of service. </p><p>  For whom is it interesting?  For people who want to make a purchase at a certain time or accumulate a certain amount for specific purposes: achieving financial stability, paying for tuition, buying an exciting tour, or opening their own business. </p><p>  Who can take advantage of the offer?  Any customer who has debit or credit cards.  You can open the ‚Äútarget‚Äù in Sberbank through an online application from a stationary PC, smartphone, tablet.  You can contact the appropriate branch at any convenient time only to obtain the original contract. </p><h2>  Product benefits </h2><p>  The offer from Sberbank stands out from the rest as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  For one client, it is possible to create up to 20 goals of different types (car, real estate, leisure, etc.). </li><li>  Management and discovery takes place online.  No need to visit the office and provide documents. </li><li>  Ability to configure automatic recharge from the card.  Frequency can be set at your discretion: weekly, monthly, periodically as payments are received or payments are made.  Similarly, you can set the amount - a fixed size or as a percentage of the expense and replenishment operations. </li><li>  Your money works for you.  Opening a deposit implies interest accrual.  They can be automatically transferred to a savings account or debit card. </li></ul><h2>  For users of the mobile application </h2><p>  Consider the process of creating a goal from a smartphone or tablet. </p><p>  First of all, you need to install the Sberbank-Online program from the Play Market to the device. </p><p>  At the second stage, an account is registered: you must enter an identifier and password.  You can create them at the nearest ATM of Sberbank. </p><p>  After entering the application on the main screen you need to find the "Goals". </p><div class="photo" data-original="info-effect.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Create a goal on a mobile device" class="if uuid-3006647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3006647.jpg"></div><p>  The user is offered 11 types: from savings for the holiday, vacation and to the purchase of real estate.  Psychologists have long noted the effectiveness of visualizing their desires, so you can put a photo of their planned achievements.  In the appropriate fields, enter the required amount and date of receipt of the accumulated funds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the stage of choosing the type of deposit, three options are proposed with different requirements for the size of the down payment, interest rate and withdrawal conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Choice of terms of deposit service on the tablet" class="if uuid-3006640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3006640.jpg"></div><p>  A careful study of the descriptions will allow you to choose the best rate. </p><p>  At the last stage of creating a goal in Sberbank Online, the program will automatically calculate the recommended monthly amount of payments to achieve the planned amount by the required date.  If there are several valid cards, the choice of the one with which the transfers will be made will be available.  Interest is paid on a monthly basis, they can be sent to the target‚Äôs account or card.  Just select the option you want. </p><h2>  For web version users </h2><p>  The second method is intended for customers who use the official banking application through a browser.  The sequence of actions is practically the same: </p><ul><li>  Log in to your account and find the "Deposits and Accounts" section. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Creating a goal in Sberbank in a browser" class="if uuid-3006589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3006589.jpg"></div><ul><li>  At the top of the menu, select the ‚ÄúOpen Deposit‚Äù item.  In the list provided, select the appropriate service conditions.  Enter the required data: deposit term, down payment amount. </li><li>  Indicate where the accrued interest is transferred, and proceed to the next step. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Formation of conditions for servicing a deposit" class="if uuid-3006590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3006590.jpg"></div></li><li>  Read the terms of the contract.  If agreed, confirm the decision by entering the received code from SMS. </li></ul><h2>  Attention to future investors </h2><p>  Minor citizens can also use the remote deposit service.  They have the opportunity to deposit funds under general conditions: in a bank branch, through self-service terminals and ATMs. </p><p>  The source of income can be cash prizes, income at the place of work, benefits, scholarships, etc. Permits are not required to receive funds within these amounts.  If the deposit was replenished by family members, relatives, then the bank employees, upon receipt of the withdrawal application, will be asked to provide written permission from any parent or guardianship authorities. </p><p>  How to withdraw money from the purpose of Sberbank?  Money is received at a bank branch in person. </p><p>  It is necessary to focus on the terms of service.  As of November 2018, Sberbank offers three deposit options with various conditions: </p><ul><li>  "Recharge Online" - the rate will be 4.4%, the recommended amount of the first payment is 1,000 rubles.  Before the deposit expires, the client is not able to withdraw money, but can use the funds within the accrued interest. </li><li>  ‚ÄúManage Online‚Äù - the rate is 3.85%, the <span>minimum balance</span> is determined by the size of the initial recommended payment and amounts to 30,000 rubles.  During the term of the deposit, the amount over the client can withdraw ahead of schedule. </li><li>  "Savings account" - rate of 1%, there are no restrictions on the size of the down payment, you can use the funds in the account at any time. </li></ul><h2>  How to remove a target? </h2><p>  Situations in life happen different.  Therefore, investors have the opportunity to prematurely close the savings account while deleting the target.  You can perform the operation both through the Sberbank-online personal account in a browser, and through a mobile application installed on a user‚Äôs smartphone or tablet. </p><p>  For desktop or laptop users: </p><ul><li>  You are logged in to the account on the Internet banking site. </li><li>  In the section ‚ÄúDeposits‚Äù on the main page all the goals are posted.  In the desired item and in the "Operations" menu, "Delete Target" is selected. </li><li>  The operation is confirmed by left-clicking on the ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button. </li></ul><p>  For users of the mobile application: </p><ul><li>  You must open the program and log in to your account. </li><li>  Similarly, the search for the ‚ÄúDeposits‚Äù section is performed. </li><li>  To remove an unnecessary target, open the corresponding entry and click on ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù on the right side of the screen. </li><li>  In the menu that appears, select ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù and confirm the decision by clicking on the appropriate button. </li></ul><p>  If there is a balance in the savings account, it is closed and the target is deleted. </p><p>  We hope that now you can not only independently answer the question that these are goals in Sberbank Online, but also achieve your goal by planning your expenses. </p>
