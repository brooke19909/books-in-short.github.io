This country is located in the north of the African continent and is washed by the waters of the most gentle of the seas - the Mediterranean.  The coast of Tunisia is rich in picturesque bays, picturesque palm and orange groves, peerless sandy beaches and other beauties.  Thanks to all this, many thousands of tourists go here every year for a lot of positive emotions.  Indeed, in addition to water activities and beach relaxation, Tunisia also offers an informative vacation: excursions to local historical and natural attractions, including desert safaris.  By the way, it is on the territory of this state that the ruins of ancient Carthage are located.  Tunisia's most popular resorts are Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia and Hammamet.  Here I would like to dwell on the latter, since it is here that Prima Life Imperial Park 4 * is located - a magnificent four-star hotel, which is part of the Prima Life chain. </p>

    <h2>  Hammamet - the most comfortable of Tunisian resorts </h2><p>  This town, which is considered the most tourist in this African country, was once a favorite vacation spot of the British Prime Minister - Lord <span>Winston Churchill.</span>  And this, of course, is the best advertisement for the resort.  After all, this famous Englishman was distinguished by excellent taste, and the fact that he preferred to relax in Hammamet speaks only in favor of this town.  In addition to him, the resort was favored by the <span>French novelist</span> Guy de Maupassant, as well as the magnificent Oscar Ould.  The advantages of this place are wonderful natural parks, olive and jasmine gardens, the aroma of which extends over many kilometers.  There are also professional thalassotherapy centers (sea treatment), modern and superbly equipped water parks and hotel complexes, built in close proximity to each other.  A prime example is the Prima Life Imperial Park Aqua Life Yasmine Hammamet Aquapark 4 *. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Yasmine Hammamet </h2><p>  6 kilometers from the resort is the most comfortable tourist area, not only in the country, but throughout North Africa.  This is Yasmin-Hammamet.  Already from the name it becomes clear that the resort is immersed in jasmine gardens, and if you add to them orange and lemon plantations that grow along the entire coast of the country, even a person with a weak sense of smell can feel the fragrance of these plants several kilometers from the coast.  It hovers over the entire resort, turning it into a truly paradise, which Tunisia is proud of.  Reviews of tourists (Hammamet often becomes the subject of discussions on various portals) about the coast are almost always positive, even more so - enthusiastic.  As for the hotels, we must admit that the service in them is inferior to Turkish and even Egyptian ... But the prices here are quite affordable, which makes <span>holidays in Tunisia</span> accessible to people whose income level is below average. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Area </h2><p>  The resort begins with the yacht port Marina and stretches along the entire coast of the Hammamet Bay to the Medina - the central part of the eponymous resort city.  The zone has excellent infrastructure, everything is subordinated to the needs of tourists who rest here throughout the beach season, that is, from April to the end of November, although July and August are still the most popular months to relax.  Wide sandy beaches and turquoise clear water in the sea, warmed up by the southern sun to 25-28 degrees, are especially attractive for tourists.  Hotels in this tourist area are mainly located not on the water itself, but on the other side of the boardwalk, and their guests have to make short and very pleasant walks to the private beaches belonging to the hotels.  So, Prima Life Imperial Park 4 * is located just 150 meters from the sea shore. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Hammamet? </h2><p>  There are direct regular flights from Moscow to Monastir and the capital of Tunisia all year round, but planes fly to the airport of Enfid only during the beach season, or rather, in the summer months.  If you purchased a ticket to the hotel Prima Life Imperial Park (Tunisia / Hammamet), then it is most convenient, of course, to fly to Enfid, since it is located 48 kilometers from this resort, while you need to travel 65 kilometers to the Tunisian airport, and to Monastirsky - 85. Whatever city you fly to, you need to get to Hammamet-Yasmin by road: on minibuses, long-distance buses or taxis.  If tourists have paid in advance for the transfer to the hotel, then they will be met at the airport by a representative of the tour operator or the hotel complex.  Depending on the number of new arrivals, a trip to the hotel will take place either by minibus or by bus. </p>

    <h2>  General description of the <span>hotel Prima</span> Life Imperial Park </h2><p>  This hotel was built in 2004.  It is part of the Prima Life hotel chain.  Its total area is about six hectares.  The three-story snow-white building, built in the traditional Tunisian style, is located among the park area.  The hotel was assigned the category ‚Äú4 *‚Äù by the country's Ministry of Tourism, however, they must admit that it doesn‚Äôt even reach the ‚Äúthree point‚Äù in terms of quality of service (according to European standards).  Nevertheless, this does not mean that the service at the hotel is at a very low level.  In principle, picky tourists can even really like it here, because the Prima Life Imperial Park hotel has many advantages, namely: spacious rooms with furnished balconies;  many restaurants and cafes serving both local and international cuisines;  indoor and outdoor pools with water slides for adults and children;  balneological center and spa, etc. There are also many other services inherent in hotels of this type. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  As already noted above, this hotel is located 150 meters from the sea, on the second coastline, across the road from the boardwalk.  Near the hotel is the port of Marina, as well as an entertainment center.  From the Medina of Hammamet to the territory of Prima Life Imperial Park, only 10 kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In the three-story building of the hotel - only 237 comfortable standard-type rooms.  Some overlook the garden, others overlook the sea.  Among them there are single, double and triple rooms, equipped with comfortable upholstered furniture and necessary equipment for a comfortable stay of guests. </p><h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  All rooms have tiled floors.  They are equipped with a comfortable balcony and a bathroom with shower.  They have all the necessary toiletries and a hairdryer.  It features satellite TV with Russian channels, a direct dial telephone, central air conditioning, a fridge, a safe and a minibar (the latter two for a fee).  This is room service at the Prima Life Imperial Park Hotel (Tunisia).  The reviews of tourists (Hammamet, and this hotel in particular, are most often treated as affectionate guests of the city in individual comments) about the service at the hotel and on the beach testify to the increased attention of the staff to their guests.  And this to some extent compensates for the shortcomings in the structure of the hotel.  By the way, Internet access in the room will also have to be paid.  But in public places it can be used for free.  If guests have small children, a cot will be provided upon request.  Rooms are cleaned daily; linen is changed twice a week.  The same goes for changing towels.  Not as often as we would like, but such is Tunisia.  Hammamet, ‚Äú4 stars‚Äù on the facades of hotels which most often do not indicate high-quality service, is nevertheless considered the best resort on the entire Tunisian coast. </p>

By the way, in the mornings in the pool classes on aqua aerobics are held, and during the day you can play waterball.  In addition, there are a fitness center and a gym, a SPA salon providing balneological services, a sauna, a Turkish bath, a jacuzzi, massage, etc. There is a TV lounge and a games room, and animation is organized in the evenings (as for adults and children).  As for sports facilities, outdoor enthusiasts can go in for mini-golf, basketball, billiards, boccia, volleyball, football, table tennis, etc. Golf courses and tennis courts are located nearby.  But fans of gambling at a distance of one kilometer are waiting for a real casino.  For younger guests there is a mini club and a children's pool, as well as - for an additional fee - babysitting services.  This is the service that awaits tourists who decide to come to Hammamet.  Prima Life Imperial Park is always happy to welcome guests from Russia, despite the fact that many argue that the attitude towards our compatriots is biased and that Europeans are served much better.  Or maybe it's worth taking a closer look at yourself and adopting manners from Western neighbors? </p>

Umbrellas and deck chairs are free for guests, and for all other services - sports equipment, mattresses, etc. - you will need to pay. </p><h2>  Sunny <span>Tunisia:</span> tourist <span>reviews</span> , 2014. ‚ÄúHammamet - the best of African resorts‚Äù </h2><p>  In fact, vacationers who have the opportunity to compare this tourist area with other similar ones also located on this continent, believe that it is the best on the entire Mediterranean coast of North Africa.  Reasonable prices, magnificent nature, a wide range of services ... And let the hotel far from the "fives", the rest here can be called wonderful.  In addition, Hammamet attracts people who dream of thalassotherapy.  This type of treatment has spread since the time when Tunisia was under the rule of France.  We add from ourselves that the surest option to find out all the pros and cons of staying at a particular resort is to go there personally.  Try it - and then leave your comments! </p>
