    <h2>  Smart line </h2><p>  So, the MTS operator has several tariff plans, called by the single name ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù.  As you might guess, they are intended for use on smartphones - this is due to the features of these tariffs.  In particular, they offer the subscriber both an Internet connection within a certain amount of data, and a certain number of minutes for calls to numbers on their network and to numbers of subscribers of foreign operators.  Thus, by connecting to the Smart tariffs, the subscriber receives ‚Äúall at once‚Äù. </p><p>  There are four tariffs included in the line developed by MTS.  ‚ÄúSmart mini‚Äù (reviews of which will be given in this article) is the most ‚Äúbasic‚Äù among them, since it is available at the lowest cost.  At the same time, less data is available under this tariff than is provided by others - Smart, Smart Non-Stop and Smart Plus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The last three plans may also be interesting for the MTS subscriber, but in this article we consider the features that the Smart Mini (MTS) tariff has.  Feedback from those who use it directly will help us understand the issue in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Smart mini: calls </h2><p>  To begin with, the tariff plan that we analyze as part of this article assumes a <span>monthly fee.</span>  This means that the person who uses it is obliged to pay 200 rubles a month to the company.  With these funds, he receives a certain package of services.  They include, among other things, minutes for calls. </p><p>  If a subscriber wants to call MTS numbers that are assigned to his home region, he can do this without restrictions.  In turn, for communication with subscribers of his network located in other regions of Russia, the user receives only 1000 minutes per month.  As for communication with other operators, conversations with them are charged separately.  In particular, the home region is paid at a cost of 1.5 rubles per minute (additionally, over the above 200 rubles), and calls with numbers from other regions of the Russian Federation - 10 rubles each.  in a minute.  MTS has such tariffs.  Smart mini (reviews speak of it as an affordable plan with a favorable call cost) also presupposes the availability of free 50 SMS to the numbers of your region and the cost of each message at 3.8 rubles for sending to numbers of other networks across the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Smart Mini: Internet </h2>

    <p>  The tariff ‚ÄúSmart mini‚Äù (MTS), for which it is not difficult to find reviews, also makes it possible to use mobile Internet.  What is noteworthy, this service is included in the monthly fee of 200 rubles, which we mentioned.  The subscriber is provided with 500 megabytes of Internet for use on a mobile network.  In the event that it exceeds the specified limit, additional charging is not charged, but the connection speed drops significantly. </p><p>  In principle, if we talk about working with a modern smartphone, 500 MB may be enough only for a one-time check of mail or sending messages on a social network.  Obviously, MTS Smart Mini has a tariff for people who are not used to spending most of their free time on the network. </p><h2>  Roaming </h2><p>  According to the terms of the plan, which can be found on the MTS official website, Smart Mini (user reviews confirm this) supports the roaming service and communications with other countries.  The cost of services is determined per minute - a special table with prices depending on the direction of calls is available on the company's website.  Here you can see that a minute of conversation with the CIS will cost 29 rubles, with Europe - 49 rubles, and communication with other countries - all 70 rubles per minute.  SMS messages to numbers of foreign subscribers will cost 5.25 rubles.  This is the tariff for MTS "Smart mini". </p>

    <h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  What is attractive about MTS is the ability to order additional options and tips, some of which can be really useful.  For example, the tariff page contains information about opportunities to save on calls by connecting the packages ‚ÄúEverywhere at Home SMART‚Äù and ‚ÄúProfitable Intercity‚Äù.  They are designed for people who actively travel throughout the country, for whom it is difficult to be exclusively in the home region.  There are other features that can be connected to the MTS Smart Mini.  What options to use, you decide.  Here is just a list of services: the services of additional Internet traffic are available (500 MB or 1 GB over your tariff), and there is also the option to activate automatic replenishment of your account. </p><h2>  Tariff management </h2>

    <p>  You can read about how to manage this tariff plan on the page dedicated to it on the website.  Two methods are mentioned here.  The first is sending a short USSD request * 111 * 1023 # from the MTS number.  In response, you will receive instructions on how to proceed further if you want to activate this option. </p><p>  Another option is to manage the number through the so-called "My Account".  Everything is very simple here: register under your number, get a password and note which services you would like to use and which not.  All this is available on the MTS website.  Smart Mini can also be connected here. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  In general, we have informed you about the volume of services that a mobile operator provides to a subscriber connected to the Smart Mini tariff.  Therefore, everyone can form at least their own attitude to this plan and calculate how beneficial it is to work with it. </p><p>  As for the reviews, they are mostly positive, since unlimited calls within the network and the Internet are a really good offer for 200 rubles.  As for some negative assessments, you can only find them to the address of MTS.  For example, people often complain that they suddenly lost funds from their account.  Perhaps the subscribers were really mistaken and simply did not notice how they used any service.  Or it may be that the money from the account really disappeared through the fault of the operator.  In order to prevent such a situation, you need to abandon wireless online access on the MTS Smart Mini.  <span>How to turn off the Internet,</span> you need to look at your device model.  Most smartphones have a button to deactivate the mobile access point. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2>

    <p>  Undoubtedly, there are subscribers who would like to receive more than 500 Mb of Internet and 1000 minutes for calls within the network.  Accordingly, if they are willing to pay more, they can be offered alternative tariff plans from MTS. </p><p>  In particular, these are <span>Smart, Smart</span> Non-Stop and Smart Plus packages. </p><p>  The first costs 450 rubles, while with it the subscriber receives 3 GB of Internet and 500 minutes for calls to phones of other operators from their region. </p><p>  Non-Stop will cost 650 rubles.  It offers unlimited wireless internet and the same number of minutes to talk. </p><p>  SmartPlus differs in price (900 rubles per month), traffic volume (5 GB) and the ability to get 1100 minutes for calls to any number in your region.  The difference is also in the price of minutes for other people's numbers throughout Russia: if on Mini it is 10 rubles, then on Smart, Non-Stop and Plus it is 3 rubles. </p><p>  You can learn more about how to order services and what details are hidden in these tariff plans on the company's official website.  In principle, there is nothing new there, only the code for a short USSD request changes.  However, regarding work with Non-Stop and Plus, it should be noted that it will be more profitable to order additional options to reduce the cost of conversations with other people's networks in other regions of the country.  Also, if you feel that you do not have enough data packet (where it is limited), you can purchase the extension option. </p><p>  Such is the plan from MTS Smart Mini.  The company releases new tariffs regularly.  This, for example, "Second", "Night" and others, but the line of "Smart" remains basic, which indicates its success. </p>
