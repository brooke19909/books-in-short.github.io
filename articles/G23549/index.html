    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The Ciao Stelio Deluxe Hotel 5 * hotel is popular not only because it has all the conditions for a good rest.  Many fell in love with him for his attitude towards visitors.  The staff is not only polite and welcoming.  The people working here are real professionals.  They speak five languages, among which there is Russian, which cannot but rejoice.  In addition to him, they also speak English, German, Greek and Swedish. </p><p>  Also, if guests want, then they can be arranged to deliver drinks and food to the room.  Non-smoking rooms are also available.  There are even facilities for people with disabilities.  And on the upper floors you do not need to get on foot - there is an elevator for this. </p><p>  By the way, in brief it is worth mentioning one interesting feature that distinguishes the hotel The Ciao Stelio Deluxe Hotel.  Cyprus is a place of rest.  And many go to sea with children.  So, The Ciao Stelio Deluxe is an ideal place for people who want to spend their holidays in peace and quiet, as it is not allowed to check in guests with children.  Everything in the hotel is literally imprisoned for adults and, admittedly, wealthy people. </p><h2>  About arrival and booking </h2><p>  Hotel The Ciao Stelio Deluxe Hotel 5 * reviews receive mostly positive.  Largely because of this, this complex has become even more popular, because many people want to experience for themselves what the experienced guests talk about. </p><p>  But, since the hotel has only 52 rooms, you should think about booking a few months before the trip.  Especially if the trip is planned when Greece is in the midst of the summer season (that is, from April to October). </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  In the end, a few words are worth mentioning about the reviews that leave about The Ciao Stelio Deluxe Hotel.  The hotel, as previously mentioned, is new, so not all travelers managed to visit it.  But all those people who came here were impressed. </p><p>  Special attention is paid to cleaning.  Towels are changed daily, just like linen.  If the pillow seems uncomfortable (too flat or, conversely, large), then you can always ask to be replaced.  Aesthetes are especially pleased with the modern style in which all the rooms are decorated.  The apartments look interesting, original, even fashionable.  Linen, towels - you can see the hotel logo on everything. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the dishes served in the restaurant.  People who visited it assure that it is better to go there than to visit the institutions located in Larnaca itself.  Undoubtedly, other restaurants are not bad either.  But the one located in the hotel really corresponds to the level of five stars. </p><p>  And still all guests note the excellent location of the hotel.  And it's not just about the sea and the beach.  The city center, an airport nearby - all you need, plus well-developed transport links.  If anything, you can rent a car, the hotel provides such an opportunity for a very reasonable price. </p><p>  In general, if you want your vacation to be unforgettable, you should go here.  From such a holiday there will definitely be a lot of vivid impressions.  And there will also be a desire to return to these places again.  In any case, those guests who visited here last year, when the hotel opened, say they will definitely come to Cyprus again, and if they manage to ‚Äúgrab‚Äù the reservation - in this hotel complex. </p>
