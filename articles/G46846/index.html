There are a huge number of options to make a beautiful and original congratulations for men, using paper and other materials. </p><p>  For example, touching and beautiful postcards for February 23 with your own hands can be done in this rather simple way: </p><p>  The first thing to do is prepare the necessary materials.  For postcards you will need: </p><p>  - album sheet of paper </p><p>  -old postcards depicting a tank, ship or plane (optional) </p><p>  -glue </p><p>  -scissors </p><p>  <span>-color pencils</span> and felt-tip pens. </p><p>  You need to take a white album sheet of paper and bend it in half.  Next, you need to choose a card with an image, for example, of a tank.  The figure should be carefully cut and glued to the middle of the bent sheet.  With a simple pencil, you need to draw a horizon line and draw on the postcard the sky, clouds, small planes in the sky, the road along which the tank, bushes, trees travel.  At the bottom of the sheet you can write: "February 23 is a holiday of the most ...".  In this case, be sure to end the line with an ellipsis, because  on the page spread will be written all the definitions of a true defender of the Fatherland.  It is advisable to write this phrase using a red felt-tip pen.  All figures on the front side of the sheet must be painted.  To create the shadow of trees and the volume of clouds it is better to use felt-tip pens.  As for the definitions inside the card, it should be noted that it is better that they are located throughout the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe card and are written in different fonts (for originality).  It‚Äôs good if the color of the letters is also red.  The definitions for the defender of the Fatherland can be as follows: courageous, strong, courageous, courageous, fearless, muscular, etc. In a postcard it will look like this: "February 23 is a holiday of the most ... courageous, strong, courageous, courageous, etc. . ".  On the spread of the postcard in the lower corner you can sign, from whom this congratulation was presented. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Postcards on February 23 with your own hands will make the holiday joyful and enjoyable.  The main thing is to make them with love. </p><p>  Postcards on February 23 with your own hands can be done in another way. </p><p>  To do this, you will need: </p><p>  - color paper of one color to choose from (red, orange, golden, etc.) </p><p>  -scissors </p><p>  -glue stick </p><p>  album sheet </p><p>  felt-tip pens (orange and black) </p><p>  -decorative sparkles. </p><p>  In this case, you get a wonderful postcard on which the star will be placed.  This figure is one of the traditional elements that are usually depicted on postcards for the Defender of the Fatherland Day.  The inscription itself "From February 23!"  will be decorated in the style of St. George ribbon, i.e.  letters will be painted in orange-black stripes. </p><p>  The first thing to do is bend the white landscape paper sheet in half.  Then you need to go on to make a star.  So, first you need to draw an asterisk shape on a sheet of selected colored paper.  In this case, on each side you need to draw indents to create the volume of the figure, the thickness of which should be at least 1 cm. Next, you need to cut the figure.  Each indent should be bent in half.  The extreme part needs to be smeared with glue and attached to the album sheet.  It is advisable to stick the star in the middle of the card.  Now you need to go to the congratulatory phrase.  On a postcard you can write either ‚ÄúFrom February 23!‚Äù Or ‚Äú <span>Happy Defender of the Fatherland Day!‚Äù.</span>  These words are best placed at the top of the postcard.  In addition, each letter must be painted in the style of St. George ribbon with orange and black felt-tip pen.  Place under the star on the card must be decorated with sparkles.  To do this, smear the required area with glue-pencil and pour decorative spangles on top.  The front part of the <span>postcard with your own hands</span> on February 23 is ready.  At the U-turn, you can write warm wishes for the male defender of the Fatherland. </p><p>  There are a large number of ways to make good cards on February 23 do-it-yourself.  The above options are the simplest.  But, it should be noted that each, even the lightest, greeting card for February 23 will delight a man with his own hands, primarily because it is made with love. </p>
