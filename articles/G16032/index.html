    <p>  Land resources - this is the entire territory, which is outlined by certain boundaries.  They can be used by various subjects of the country, but, nevertheless, relate to natural objects.  Land is a means of production, which is used in many sectors of economic activity.  It is especially in demand in agriculture and forestry. </p><p>  The world land fund is 134 million kilometers.  This is 26.3% of the entire territory. </p><p>  Land resources have a certain structure.  11% are arable land, meadows and gardens.  That is, it is cultivated land.  About 23% of the land is pasture.  Forests and shrubs occupy 30% of the world's land resources.  Anthropogenic landscapes, that is, created by human hands, make up 3% of the total.  There are also unproductive lands, which account for about 33% of the land. </p><p>  Land resources are unevenly distributed.  For example, pastures occupy a large part in comparison with cultivated land.  This is especially true in Australia.  Russia, the USA, Ukraine, China, Kazakhstan, India and Canada account for the bulk of the land used for arable land, gardens and meadows. </p><p>  Forests mainly prevail in Russia, South and North America.  Asia is characterized by the presence of unproductive land. </p><p>  The structure of land resources may change.  There are two reasons for this. </p><p>  The activity of people leaves its mark on the distribution of these lands.  A lot of land is allocated for arable land, gardens and meadows.  They open up, forests are cut down, swamps are drained, deserts are irrigated.  So, over the past decade, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcultivated land has increased by 360 million hectares.  Some countries recapture the land of the sea, using the coastal zone.  This is the first reason for changing the structure of land resources. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also changing due to the deterioration of land quality.  This happens simultaneously with their expansion. </p><p>  The land resources of Russia are different in their qualities and properties (fertility, availability of minerals, forests and water bodies).  In this regard, they are used, focusing on these characteristics. </p><p>  Land resources in our country are divided into seven categories: </p><p>  1. Agricultural land.  They include all the land that is suitable for the production of <span>agricultural</span> products <span>.</span> </p><p>  2. Lands reserved for settlements.  They are located in the territories of administrative entities (cities, villages, etc.).  Their main purpose is the construction of buildings and structures necessary for the existence of settlements. </p><p>  3. Land allotted for use in industry, transport and other related industries. </p><p>  4. Territories of particular value.  <span>These are nature reserves,</span> historical and cultural sites, recreation areas and others. </p><p>  5. Forest land fund.  These are lands covered by forests or designated for use in forestry.  They are of particular value in terms of raw materials.  Forest is necessary for many sectors of the national economic complex.  It is also a resting place and energy source. </p><p>  6. Land resources occupied by water bodies.  This also includes hydraulic structures and areas necessary for their full functioning.  They satisfy the household, drinking, wellness and some other needs of mankind.  Such resources are necessary for the full work of many areas of the country's economic activity. </p><p>  Control over the use of all lands is carried out by the Committee on Land Resources.  Their rational consumption is very important for the conservation of the entire land fund and the surrounding nature as a whole. </p>
