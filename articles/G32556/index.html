There are both large and small, popular and not very.  I want to stop my attention on a reservoir with an amazing unusual name - Lake Ilmurzino.  Reviews about it are mostly positive, so not only the locals here come to rest in this area, but also tourists from other cities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ilmurzino lake" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1149688.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Briefly about the lake </h2><p>  How many can boast of encyclopedic knowledge about this reservoir?  We think not.  But this is unfair to the wonderful ecologically clean lake, which was lost in the Kushnarenkovsky district of Bashkortostan.  It is located very close to Ufa, the distance is only 33 km. </p><h2>  Village of the same name </h2><p>  Lake Ilmurzino is not the only representative of a unique name.  There is also a settlement of the same name, which has less than 300 inhabitants.  The village of Ilmurzino was founded by mountain Tatars in the 17th century. </p><p>  Its name comes from the name of the local Bashkir Ilmurza Yanbakhtin.  In ancient records of the village it is said that this is a "sensible village", suitable for "fishing and bestial" fishing. </p><h2>  What awaits tourists on the lake? </h2><p>  Lake Ilmurzino is artificial.  Earlier in its place was just a big career.  Perhaps that is why there is an opinion that it is saturated with useful trace elements.  And some vacationers believe that the water there is not "empty", but some special. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gently sloping shores with a smooth descent into the water will delight vacationers.  They are also equipped with sandy beaches with a parking place (parking is paid - 100 rubles per day, but not everywhere).  Some bring here inflatable boats and even pleasure boats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ilmurzino lake how to get there" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1149685.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The area surrounding Lake Ilmurzino is interspersed with a rare forest.  Over the water hangs willows and willows.  Fishing enthusiasts can satisfy their interests and enjoy fishing.  In parallel with this, you can listen to gull-thieves who are not afraid of anything here and come close to people. </p><p>  The water is clean and warm.  At the entrance to it knee-deep, you notice flocks of small fish fry, scurrying between the legs.  The water is clear and pleasant to the touch.  Those who stay overnight in tents have the rare pleasure of admiring the wonderful sunsets, but do not forget about the ointments from mosquitoes, since in the summer there are a lot of them in this area. </p><p>  The view around the lake is beautiful and well-groomed, however, changing cabins are few, so you should be prepared for a Spartan vacation in the proposed conditions.  But an ecologically clean lake and untouched nature compensate for some inconvenience. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Lake Ilmurzino is ideal for families with small children.  On a warm sunny day, they are happy to splash on a shallow beach.  There are no sanatoriums and recreation centers here, however, this does not prevent people from building tent camps on their own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near the coastline of shops and supermarkets you will not find.  The only place where you can buy food is a small tent.  But, according to vacationers, the prices in it are very high.  That is why it is recommended to take care of food in advance, the reserves of mineral water, juices and other drinks will not interfere. </p><p>  These shortcomings do not scare away local residents and numerous visitors.  Recently, thanks to the beautiful air and good beaches, Ilmurzino (lake) has become quite popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ilmurzino lake reviews" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1149676.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the pond? </h2><p>  You can get here by train to the Ufa station or by car.  This path is not difficult at all.  The movement starts from Ufa, then through the Zatonsky bridge (local name) along the M7 to the Podymalovskaya interchange.  Near it, you need to turn right and go to the sign "Ilmurzino". </p><p>  Having a map of the <span>Ufa region,</span> it‚Äôs easy to navigate.  You can get on a rustic asphalt road or on a dirt road directly to the lake. </p><p>  The only thing that I would like to wish to those who go to the lake is to look at the weather forecast for the coming days so that the rest leaves an indescribable feeling of communicating with the local nature. </p>
