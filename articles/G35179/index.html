It was in this country that the Iron Curtain was slightly opened.  Now, when new tourist destinations become available, Bulgaria remains a favorite for budget travelers.  Resting here is inexpensive, getting there quickly, there is no language barrier ... But names like Balchik, Sunny Beach, Nessebar and Golden Sands give rise to a nagging sense of nostalgia for childhood. </p><p>  Of course, all of the above resorts are not frozen in the distant seventies, and are booming.  In old hotels, the infrastructure improves, the level of service improves.  New hotels are also being built.  One such topic will be discussed in this article.  It is called Edelweiss Golden Sands 4 *.  As the name implies, it is located in the resort of Golden Sands.  In order to describe this hotel, we analyzed the reviews about it of those tourists who rested here quite recently - last summer. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the resort </h2><p>  The Edelweiss Hotel is located not in the very center of Golden Sands, but 800 meters north of the epicenter of general fun.  Also, reviews are encouraged by the fact that the hotel is actually located in the park.  Therefore, the nights at vacationers were calm, and in the morning they were awakened by the unique singing of birds.  The only minus of the location is a slight hill.  To the coast you need to go down the stairs.  To compensate for this inconvenience, the administration of the Edelweiss Golden Sands 4 * hotel in 2016 introduced a free shuttle to the beach of the Berlin Green Park Hotel.  But many tourists report that they used it only to get to Edelweiss, since a distance of 250 meters down can be covered in five minutes.  The hotel is on the third line from the beach.  On all sides it is surrounded by other hotels - the Morsko Eye Garden, Luna, Golden Beach and Berlin Green Park.  The airport is 30 kilometers away and the center of Varna is 17 kilometers away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Edelweiss Bulgaria" class="if" height="193" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1566543.jpg" width="600"></div>

And the hotel was last reconstructed in 2015, so the interiors of the rooms delight guests with brand new stylish finishes, modern fixtures and comfortable, practical furniture.  As for the height of the building of the Edelweiss Golden Sands 4 * hotel, vacationers' reviews do not give a definite answer.  From the street he looks nine-story.  But this building then decreases to five levels.  This building is built in such a way that from almost all the rooms on the upper floors you can see the Black Sea.  All rooms have balconies.  There are two elevators in the building (for the main building and five-story wing).  The territory of the hotel is very small, but well maintained.  Everything is thought out and functional there.  Directly in front of the building are swimming pools (for adults and children), which separate the residential building from the road.  And on the side there is a green landscaped park. </p><h2>  Number of rooms.  Room Categories </h2><p>  Edelweiss Hotel (Bulgaria) has 182 guest rooms.  The rooms here are of several types.  Their lion's share (158) belongs to the category of double standard.  There are also rooms for one and three travelers.  The hotel also has facilities of a higher class.  For those arriving with several children, accommodation is offered in one of the studio rooms.  In this one-room premise, in addition to the bedroom with one large and one narrow bed, there is also a separate living area with a sofa bed.  The studio equipment has a comfortable rest: cable TV, air conditioning, minibar.  The best category of hotel rooms is the apartment.  They consist of two rooms.  One of them is a cozy bedroom with a wide matrimonial bed.  The second very spacious room is a living room with a seating area and a kitchenette where you can eat.  Apartments are chosen by families with children whose parents want to sleep separately from their children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How is the food organized in the complex? </h2><p>  Edelweiss Hotel (Bulgaria) offers its guests a choice of breakfast, half and full board, as well as the All Inclusive program.  Morning meals are already included in the room rate.  The hotel stands in such a place that finding a suitable cafe is not a problem.  But still, many tourists decided to buy lunches and dinners upon arrival.  Moreover, it costs only 15 leva per day for one person.  Half board, according to tourists, is the best option.  After all, during the day you are usually on the beach (and on the waterfront there are especially many cafes and taverns) or on excursions.  And the dinners at the Edelweiss Hotel are very good.  Once a week, cooking shows are held when chefs offer gourmet dishes from different cuisines of the world.  They are fed in the main restaurant, which has a huge hall and a spacious outdoor terrace.  All meals are served buffet style.  The hotel also has two bars - in the lobby and by the pool. </p>

    <h2>  Beach closest to the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel "Edelweiss" is located on the third line.  As noted above, you can use the free bus that takes everyone to the beach and back.  But many tourists preferred to walk to the sea on foot.  There are three ways to get to the beach: by road;  on the steps that begin a little to the right of the entrance to the Edelweiss, and, finally, in a more gentle and safe way - through the territory of the Berlin Green Park Hotel.  It will take about five minutes to get down.  At the very beach is the Morsko Eye Garden Hotel.  You can go through his reception or, if desired, go around the hull.  On the coast, all beach ammunition is paid.  A sunbed with an umbrella costs 15 leva, and a mattress on a deck chair - 3. The name of the resort speaks for itself.  The golden sands of the beaches stretch for a wide strip for kilometers.  Gradual entry into the sea makes swimming safe for children and older people.  There are many water activities on the beach. </p>
