How much tax do citizens pay?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Russian Federation is a state in which there are many types of taxes.  Thanks to this (and not only), we are at the end of the list for ease of doing business.  What taxes does a person pay with us?  We are a country with one of the most complex tax systems.  But a detailed examination reveals that there are many nuances.  Let's find out what taxes are paid by citizens of the Russian Federation and what is included in these payments. </p><h2>  What does a citizen pay? </h2>

But with most of them we never have to meet, or we can learn about them one or more in our lives.  Taxes that are so rare will not be considered.  As part of the article, we list what you have to pay regularly.  So, a short list of taxes that citizens of the Russian Federation have to pay:

At the moment, one way or another, you can meet with 14 types of <span>mandatory payments.</span>  That's how much tax citizens pay!  Also, in general, some division should be made.  There are direct and indirect taxes.  The first include all those that were listed - the state openly and without the use of any secret mechanisms collects them from us - ordinary citizens.  Indirect are more complex in their implementation and allow to subject the country's population to additional taxation.  This mechanism can be implemented in the form of imposing additional payments on product manufacturers, which will transfer all costs to the shoulders of their customers.  These are the taxes that Russian citizens pay.  And if they are still engaged in entrepreneurship, then the amount grows significantly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what taxes does a foreign citizen pay" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/1090923.jpg" width="600"></div>

More specifically, about non-citizens.  They also pay all taxes that were indicated earlier, with small features.  Namely, all income is taxed at a rate of 30%, these are the taxes a foreign citizen pays.  So we can say that we have a specific protectionism in order to reduce the infusion of migratory labor. </p><h2>  Individual income tax </h2>

The rate in this case is 35% of the market value.  These are the taxes that citizens of our state pay even in such cases.  Information regarding these areas of life can be divided into two points: 
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  Winnings and prizes.  The fact is that according to modern legislation, for free transfer, it is necessary to pay 35% of the market value of the item received.  Therefore, when holding promotions or similar events, they are usually sold for a symbolic amount.  Even if the prize is an apartment or a car. </li><li>  Interest on deposits.  Here, too, is not so simple.  Interest is taxed at 35 percent, but with certain conditions.  So, only that part of them that exceeds the refinancing rate established by the central bank falls under the tax. </li></ol><h2>  Dividend Taxation </h2><p>  In recent years, investment in stocks and bonds has been popular.  They allow you to receive insignificant income in the form of dividends, and if necessary, you can sell securities and get your money.  It is clear that this could not remain without attention from the state.  Therefore, all income that is a dividend of securities is taxed at 9%. </p><h2>  Transport tax </h2>

So, it must be paid to everyone who has their own car (the exception to this are cars of people with disabilities that are not subject to taxation, as well as other preferential categories that are established by law).  It should be noted that payment rates are prescribed in the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, but they can be changed by local and regional authorities.  As a rule, they do not miss such a privilege because they are not satisfied with what is prescribed in the legislation because of too small amounts of payment.  Therefore, it is difficult in this situation to accurately calculate what taxes citizens pay, we can say that in this case they are rubber.  The vehicle‚Äôs engine power, which is measured in horsepower, serves as the basis for taxation.

The rate depending on the object ranges from 0.3-1.5 percent.  It all depends on the purpose of the land on which the tax is charged.  The cadastral value is taken as the base.  The object of taxation is the land itself.  If you do not make payments on time, then the owner will be charged fines and penalties.  Their size depends entirely on the amount that had to be paid.
