    <p>  The population of our planet is in constant motion, that is, it is reproduced through successive generations, it is changing qualitatively and quantitatively, including due to migrations - territorial movements.  Thus, the demographic situation on earth is formed.  The demographic problem, along with the environmental, food, energy, raw materials, as well as the issue of preserving peace and disarmament, require the common efforts of the world community for their solution. </p><p>  Rapid population <span>growth</span> in the world, a significant part of which (up to ¬æ) falls on developing countries with an undeveloped social sphere and a backward economy, creates a global demographic problem, the significance and importance of which were recognized by all states that realized that the arms race and the growth of armed conflicts , especially in these underdeveloped countries, lead to enormous material costs, worsening the chances of economic growth and social development.  The demographic problem in such countries is related to the problems of providing food, ecology, the provision of education, a shortage of natural resources, quality of life and employment.  A high percentage of young people in these countries (up to 40% of residents under the age of 15) will allow the tendency for high population growth rates to continue here.  Uncontrolled migration, as well as urbanization, are turning from positive to negative. </p><p>  In Japan, Europe and some CIS countries since the 80s of the twentieth century.  there is a demographic crisis, which manifests itself in a reduction in the working-age population due to slow growth, aging and <span>natural population decline.</span>  The demographic problem (i.e., a decrease in the active population) in these countries is being addressed through the influx of immigrants from different countries.  Demographic aging (over 12% of the population under 60 and more than 7% over 65) is a natural process based on improving the quality of life, medical success and other factors that contribute to prolonging the life of a significant part of the population.  So, the global demographic problem is: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  a) in the fast and poorly controlled growth of residents in developing countries; </p><p>  b) in the <span>aging of the population</span> in developed countries and countries with economies in transition. </p><p>  It is clear that the solution to so many problems is only possible through the joint efforts of the entire world community.  In 1969, within the framework of <span>the United Nations (UN),</span> the UN Foundation was established, which is engaged in activities in the field of world population and holds World Conferences under its auspices.  Over the past 30 years, three such conferences have been held: in 1974 - in Bucharest (Romania), in 1984 - in <span>Mexico City (Mexico),</span> in 1994 - in Cairo (Egypt). </p><p>  The main difficulties at the first World Conference were to solve the problems of migrants: the legal use of their labor by importing countries, the fight against discrimination in society and the labor market, the protection of their rights and the rights of their families. </p><p>  The period between the first and second conferences is characterized by an increase in the number of refugees in the world, which, along with other problems, was reflected during the conference in Mexico City (in 1984).  Then a new approach was proposed (and adopted), recognizing the diverse nature of international population movements. </p><p>  At the third International Conference in 1994 in Cairo, they adopted a 20-year Program of Action that takes into account the main requirement in world politics - to ensure sustainable development.  It emphasized that migration should be a positive factor that favorably affects the development factor of receiving migrant states. </p><p>  All conferences addressed mortality and fertility rates, population growth rates, urbanization and migration. </p><p>  The demographic problem of mankind <strong> </strong>  can be solved.  For this, according to the World Plan, first of all, social and economic transformations in developing countries are required.  Family planning programs will help improve population reproduction. </p><p>  The demographic problem with high birth rates in China is being addressed by birth control: a family is forbidden to have more than 1 child.  There are restrictions in the populous India, while in the developed countries of Europe (Germany, Denmark, France), on the contrary, various benefits are provided to families with 2 or more children. </p>
