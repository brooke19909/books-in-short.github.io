Not everyone takes car loans for this, but Uralsib Bank is a popular type of loan.  Because he, according to borrowers, has a lot of advantages. </p><p>  The feedback on the car loan of Uralsib Bank is positive, as borrowers can receive funds in the company without the obligatory connection of the CASCO insurance program.  In most Russian banks (95%), targeted loans for the purchase of a vehicle without hull insurance are not issued. </p><p>  The employees ‚Äôfeedback on Uralsib regarding car loan services is also positive.  Workers note that customers willingly choose a type of loan without hull insurance, despite higher interest rates.  Drivers can get borrowed funds for buying a car at 14.8% per annum and without insurance. </p><p>  The second type of loan for the purchase of a vehicle provides for CASCO insurance coverage.  But rates for customers are reduced.  Borrowers can buy a car at 10.9% per annum.  Lending terms under the Avtopartner program are also individual for each borrower.  The rate becomes known after filing an application with the bank. </p><p>  An important point when buying a car on credit is the provision of documents on the acquired property.  When applying, a client‚Äôs driver‚Äôs license, passport and income information are required.  Not all cars can be purchased under the car loan program.  It is necessary to check with the manager about the possibility to buy a vehicle using borrowed funds of Uralsib Bank before concluding a deal with the car seller. </p><p>  According to reviews, an alternative to acquiring a car with a car loan is a regular consumer loan.  It is distinguished by the lack of purpose.  That is, the client can spend borrowed funds for any purpose.  The program also does not require compulsory insurance.  The presence of insurance affects the interest rate, so customers are willing to connect a protection program. </p><p>  The interest rate on loans of Uralsib Bank is also set only after applying for a loan.  If the borrower is not satisfied with the conditions, he may refuse to issue a consumer loan. </p><h2>  Information on refinancing at Uralsib Bank </h2><p>  Refinancing is gaining popularity in all Russian banks, and Uralsib is no exception.

A month after the issuance of certificates lose their relevance, as interest is accrued on the balance of funds.  Feedback on refinancing loans from other banks of Uralsib Bank is positive.  Customers are pleased with the opportunity to receive funds to repay loans of other banks at 11.4%. </p><p>  But rates are not the lowest.  Some banks in Russia offer to get a loan at 9.9% per annum or less.  In addition, interest rates are set individually for each borrower.  This means that customers can receive borrowed funds at 12.5% ‚Äã‚Äãper annum or more. </p><p>  Refinancing of Uralsib Bank loans is impossible without obtaining documents.  Customers do not always respond positively about receiving certificates for services at another bank.  The reason for the negative statements on the network is the collection of fees for providing information.  This was expressed by those who wanted to receive refinancing on a loan from Uralsib Bank in another credit institution. </p><p>  When applying for documents to the Uralsib office, borrowers were faced with the need to pay 500 rubles or more to the cash desk so that employees could generate a certificate within 24 hours.  Otherwise, customers had to wait 30 days to receive the necessary documents without payment.  But at such times, an advantageous offer from another lender could lose its relevance, and clients had to postpone actions related to the change of financial organization for a month. </p><h2>  Commercial Bank Deposits </h2><p>  Without deposits, a bank cannot provide citizens with financial resources.  Therefore, the financial well-being of the lender depends on their volume.  The deposits of Uralsib Bank allow customers to accumulate on the target for several months with pleasant bonuses from the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="frombanks.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UralSib Bank reviews on loans" class="if uuid-3133829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3133829.jpg"></div><p>  The company offers 16 types of deposits for Uralsib customers.
