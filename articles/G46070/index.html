    <h2>  History of the Martisor </h2><p>  The legend tells how Spring came out of the woods at the right time and met a snowdrop, breaking through an undisturbed snowdrift.  She decided to help him reach out to the sun, pushing the snow and branches away.  Seeing this, winter got angry and sent a blizzard.  When Spring began to reach out through prickly branches to save the flower, she pricked herself and dripped blood from her finger directly onto the snowdrop.  He came to life.  It is the confrontation of Spring and Winter and the victory of a new life over a blizzard and a blizzard that symbolizes the mercisor.  White and red indicate snow and blood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to another legend, the young man met a snowdrop, which told him about the beginning of spring.  Winter did not like the fact that the small flower is not afraid of her and notifies about the arrival of a new season.  A great storm began.  The young man began to fight with her in the hope of protecting the flower, but could not overcome Frost and, having reached the snowdrop, covered him with his chest.  Drops of blood, flowing directly from the heart to the ground near the flower, gave the fragile creature the opportunity to escape.  The young man defended spring at the cost of his life. </p><h2>  Manufacturing methods </h2><p>  As is clear from the previous section, when creating a souvenir symbol, the most important thing is to comply with the corresponding light gamut.  As for how to make a mercisor with your own hands, that is, implementation methods, there are a lot of them.  The choice is determined by your imagination, materials at hand and the technique in which you know how to work.  In fact, all methods are quite simple.  Even if you have never done this before, making a souvenir is not difficult.  So, the options are as follows: </p><ul><li>  tassels, pompons, or humanoid thread figurines; </li><li>  any forms of beads; </li><li>  macrame; </li><li>  Crochet; </li><li>  paper crafts, including quilling technique. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a mercisor with your own hands" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/810395.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Used materials and tools </h2><p>  Before studying the sections that describe how to make a mercisor with your own hands, decide on what you will perform it from.  Depending on this, you will need to prepare the following: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  threads </li><li>  paper or cardboard; </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  a needle; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><h2>  How to make a mercisor with your own hands from threads </h2><p>  The easiest option is to make jewelry in the form of pompons or tassels.  To make circles or balls, do the following: </p><ol><li>  Cut a ring of appropriate size from cardboard or thick paper.  If you make a fluffy ball, you will need two blanks to make one part. </li><li>  Lay both parts on top of each other and thread the surface. </li><li>  Make an incision around the perimeter of the circle. </li><li>  Drag the resulting workpiece with a contrast or the same color thread. </li><li>  Make a second matching shade. </li><li>  Connect both parts. </li></ol><p>  You can use a single cardboard blank, which is enough to wrap the threads without subsequent cutting.  You will get a flat circle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a mercisor with your own hands from threads" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/810392.jpg" width="203"></div>

      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  Twist a cord of white and red (sometimes pink) threads, tying knots at the ends of the workpiece. </li><li>  Take a rectangle of thick paper or cardboard about the size of a business card, wrap the thread around the width of the rectangle.  This size corresponds to the growth of the future pupa. </li><li>  Tie a knot from one edge of the wound part, cut with scissors from the other. </li><li>  On the side of the nodule, at a short distance, bandage the resulting bundle.  This will be the head of the doll.  By the way, you can stop at this and make so, two brushes and connect them to the tourniquet made in the first stage. </li><li>  To get the chrysalis, continue to work.  Separate a small amount of thread to create the pens and bandage the workpiece again. </li><li>  At the ends of the handles, also pull.  One figure is left like that.  It turns out like in a skirt. </li><li>  The second pupa performs another constriction, dividing the lower part into two legs. </li><li>  Both figures are connected to a two-tone flagellum made in the first stage.  The souvenir is ready. </li></ol><h2>  How to make a do-it-yourself mercisor from paper </h2><p>  The easiest way is to cut out flat sheets of the desired shape from sheets of the corresponding shades (in the form of a circle, flower, etc.).  A more difficult option is to use the techniques of application, origami, quilling.  For the second method, blanking schemes will be required, for the third - narrow strips of paper and a tool for twisting them into souvenir elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a mercisor do it yourself out of paper" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/810393.jpg" width="600"></div>  So, they perform not only small crafts of two elements, but even more complex panels.
