    <p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  On the boxes in the center, wrap viscose threads in half of the coil for each. </li><li>  Take the thread for sewing and bandage it in the middle of the box several times with bundles of wound viscose.  This is best done using a needle with a thread that you need to pry between the box and the wound thread. </li><li>  Next, turn the box over to the other side and pry a ruler between it and the threads.  Then it is necessary to cut the wound threads strictly in the middle.  Do the same with another instance. </li><li>  In the process of the work, brushes with a disheveled appearance will turn out.  To give them smoothness and silkiness, they will need to hold them over boiling water.  In order not to burn yourself, you need to attach the blanks to a wooden stick and keep it that way for several minutes. </li><li>  The next step will be shaping the product.  To do this, step back from the fold of the brush by 1-1.5 cm and rewind the thread around it several times, fixing it with knots.  The same work needs to be done with the second craft.  The ends of the nodules must be varnished and, after drying, flatten them with your fingers. </li><li>  Next, you need to start aligning the edges of the brushes.  To do this, use a sheet of A4 paper.  It is necessary to wrap a brush in it so that its edges peep out.  It is best to roll up the paper while doing this.  Then you should trim the protruding threads of the brushes and trim the edges. </li><li>  It remains to do the smallest thing - put on decorative clips for brushes in the field of dressing them with threads.  And also attach rings to them for fastening to the sling. </li></ol><p>  After reviewing the step-by-step guide on how to make brush earrings correctly, you can make additions to them in the future.  For example, decorate with beads on chains or beads on threads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bead splendor </h2><p>  No less popular than the previous sample, earrings in the form of brushes, which are made of small beads.
