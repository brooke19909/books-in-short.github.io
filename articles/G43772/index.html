    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  <span>With sunny beaches</span> and luxurious sights, Italy will meet you.  Amalfi is located in the province of Salerno, on the coast of the beautiful Salerno Gulf.  The Capodichino International Airport (Naples) is located just 70 kilometers from the resort.  You can get to Amalfi by car, but the road to the resort is so difficult (many dangerous turns) that it is better to travel on it by public transport.  A bus from Capodichino Airport to Sorrento travels in just 70 minutes, a ticket costs 10 euros.  In Sorrento you will need to take a bus to Amalfi, which will take you to the resort for 2.6 euros.  The train from Naples to Sorrento takes one hour, and a ticket for it costs only 3.2 euros.  There is an opportunity to get to the resort by <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãtransport.</span>  To do this, take a taxi to the port of Beverello for about 25-30 euros and choose a suitable vessel.  It can be a steam or a boat.  The latter will take you to Amalfi in half an hour, the road will cost you 15 euros. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Amalfi, whose photo is presented in this article, was presumably founded in the 4th century by Konstantin the First.  It got its modern name in the middle of the 9th century, during the reign of the Amalfi clan.  It was the heyday of the city.  The most successful center of maritime trade on the <span>Tyrrhenian Sea has</span> constantly grown and developed: magnificent temples were built here, buildings of amazing beauty and style were erected, and magnificent gardens were planted on their roofs. </p><p>  It was in this glorious city that the Amalfi Maritime Law was created - a document according to which the rules of trade at sea were regulated.  It operated throughout Italy until 1570.  After some time, the reins of government took over the Duke of Salerno, in whose honor the local gulf was named.  However, then the importance of Amalfi as the largest seaport in the region began to weaken. </p><p>  After the Normans plundered it in 1100, and the Pisans in 1135, the welfare of the city was shaken.  <span>Indigenous people,</span> whose number exceeded 50,000, began to actively leave Amalfi in search of a better share.  The rest earned their living by the production of liquor, expensive paper, pasta and fishing.  In 1343, a monstrous storm occurred at sea on the outskirts of the city, destroying half of the buildings along with the inhabitants.  After the disaster, Amalfi began to be rebuilt, and by the 19th century the city's embankment was completely restored, having again built luxurious buildings on it, which then turned into comfortable hotels.  In 1852, an unusually beautiful road of 15 kilometers appeared in Amalfi, stretching across the city and called by many travelers the most romantic in the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Compass inventor </h2><p>  It is impossible to describe all the attractions of Amalfi (a city map is presented in the article) in a few words.  One of the most significant is the monument to Flavio Joey, the man who invented the compass.  All Italians are sure of this, despite the fact that many researchers attribute this know-how to the inhabitants of the Middle Kingdom.  But mentioning this in Amalfi is not worth it.  Accept that at the entrance to the city there is a monument to the man who invented the compass in the middle of the 13th century.  Many believe that without this device Columbus could not have discovered America. </p><h2>  The cathedral </h2><p>  Amalfi is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Sights of the city are of great historical value.  The hallmark of the resort is the cathedral, built in honor of St. Andrew the First-Called.  The architectural originality of this building is amazing.  It was built in the 9-10th centuries in a unique Norman-Byzantine style.  The majestic bell tower of the temple is decorated with colorful tiles.  You have to enter the cathedral through the huge gates forged in Constantinople in 1065.  On silver inlaid wings are still preserved images of Christian saints.  Any resident of Amalfi is sure that the relics of St. Andrew the First-Called are stored in the cathedral.  They lie in the underground room of the temple, under the marble sarcophagus.  Orthodox services are held daily over the remains of one of Christ's disciples.  In the square in front of the cathedral stands a monument to Andrew the First-Called. </p>

    <h2>  Cemetery </h2><p>  One of the most visited places in the resort city is the local cemetery, which is called the "Paradise Yard".  It is the burial place of many generations of local residents who lived in the city in time immemorial.  The cemetery was built in the 13th century by order of Bishop Augustaricchio for the burial of wealthy citizens.  Now it is one of the most valuable architectural monuments on the entire Italian coast.  The cemetery is decorated with a series of exquisite, sophisticated arches that are intertwined.  An elegant support for them are double columns made in a fanciful Byzantine-Arabian style.  The cemetery has a magnificent garden of palm trees and <span>orange trees.</span>  This ancient place is conducive to thinking about the eternal, it is very interesting to wander along its paved paths. </p><h2>  Paper museum </h2><p>  Italy has always been famous for producing exquisite and rare items.  Amalfi at one time engaged in the manufacture of expensive paper, which was then used for official documents.  Until the mid-20th century, dozens of paper mills functioned on the banks of a river flowing through the city.  Most of them were destroyed by flooding.  The Amalfi Paper Museum is one of the most interesting places.  Unique machines and samples of various old-fashioned paper using rags are displayed here.  The rarest books from fabulously expensive local paper are kept in the famous museum.  Since 1200, Amalfi has been known worldwide as the center of the paper industry. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The resort town with the rarest sights is rightfully proud of all of Italy.  <span>The Amalfi Coast</span> (Costier-Amalfitana) is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the whole country.  The city's beach is a strip of several hundred meters, consisting of pebbles.  On the one hand, it is limited by a pier, on the other, rocks.  There are no strong waves.  One part of the beach is municipal, the other, large, is private property and is divided between several coastal restaurants.  There is a rescue service, provided for a fee (15-20 euros for two) sunbeds and umbrellas.  Everywhere there is a shower with fresh water, so that tourists can freshen up in a sultry noon and wash off sand and salt.  Cold drinks and various dishes are brought to the beach from the bar.  Swim in the cleanest waters of the Gulf of Salerno - a separate, incomparable pleasure. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Amalfi is famous all over the world for its exquisite cuisine.  Restaurants of this glorious city hospitably open the doors to many visitors.  Among the institutions there are both simple, family and pathos marked with prestigious awards.  A fine restaurant is Trattoria da Baracca on Piazza dei Dogi, which includes seafood, pasta with fish, baked in the oven, and the best octopus salad in Amalfi.  There is another establishment on the coast - Lo Smeraldino.  It serves delicious fish with lemon and delicious pizza.  Restaurant La Caravella is marked by one <span>Michelin star</span> and for many years has been a leader among local establishments.  Peppercorn souffl√© made from lemon and mussels, stuffed with mozzarella and olives. </p>
