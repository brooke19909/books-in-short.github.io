The glorious past of the famous city is harmoniously combined with modern complexes and unspoiled natural beauty.  All this attracts a huge number of tourists from all over the world.  Some travelers go to see historical places, others swim in the clear sea and soak up the sun. </p><p>  In fact, Side is a very small city, but it won the title of one of the busiest resorts in all of Turkey.  In addition, it is a real open-air museum.  Here are the main archaeological values ‚Äã‚Äãof the country, which are carefully protected by local laws. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sural resort hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1467135.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Side has gained immense popularity among tourists because of the beautiful sandy beaches located a little to the west of the town.  There are always a lot of vacationers.  But in the east, the coast is always less crowded; here, relaxation is much more comfortable for those who do not like the hustle and bustle.  Therefore, in addition to the town itself, the resort also includes such settlements as Kumkoy, Kyzyligach, Cholakly and Kizilot. </p><h2>  Side Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing in the Sural Resort 5 * (Side), you definitely need to take such a great opportunity and see all the most famous attractions.  As in ancient times, the old part of Side is located on a small part of the peninsula.  The city is separated from the mainland by a moat and a wall.  Oddly enough, but to this day a lot of different objects have been preserved here. </p><p>  You can get into the archaeological complex through the perfectly preserved ancient main gates of the Hellenic period, from which there is a central street with columns.  Unfortunately, it was from the colonnade that fragments reminiscent of past beauty and grandeur were preserved.  Further, this street leads to public baths, it is in their building that the museum is currently located.  Behind it is an agora with the ruins of the Tiche and Fortune temple, inside which there is a circular room with twelve columns.  In the old days, pirates used this place to trade slaves. </p><p>  Of course, now it is quite difficult to imagine, but the ancient ruins of the theater, in which fights of gladiators took place, and monumental gates were built in the second century.  Once the theater could take up to twenty thousand spectators, it is the largest such building in all of Pamphylia.  Next to it is the Roman antique temple of Dionysus, near the entrance to which the restored fountain flaunts. </p><p>  In Side there are also three temples that have survived to this day, a fountain (an artificial grotto with a real source) and an aqueduct. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Side, as a famous resort, can offer its guests a lot of entertainment.  The city has just a huge number of discos that are open until dawn.  The most famous of them is Oxide.  Shopping enthusiasts can visit jewelry stores, carpet shops, and leather goods.  The best traders on Kolonnaya street.  Here you can safely shop and are not afraid of fakes. </p><p>  No less interesting for tourists will be visiting the museum located near the theater.  In it you can see various architectural details and elements of Hellenistic times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sural resort 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1467136.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Vacationers should definitely go on an excursion (or get on their own) to the amazing <span>Manavgat waterfall,</span> and then try delicious and fresh dishes from trout caught in the local river. </p><p>  You can also take a taxi to Aspendos and enjoy the Roman amphitheater there.  If your vacation falls on June or July, then you should definitely visit one of the performances of the annual festival of opera and ballet. </p><h2>  Sural Resort Hotel 5 *: reviews <strong></strong></h2><p>  Leading a conversation about one of the hotels of the famous Turkish resort in Side, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit here.  Sural Resort 5 * (Turkey, Side), is not in the center of the city itself, which is certainly very convenient for those vacationers who want to find a quiet and peaceful complex, where you do not have to sleep because of loud music at night.  Getting to the hotel is easy with public transport, but you can also order a shuttle service.  Such a service is available at the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel is quite simple and understandable, in the inner corridors it is impossible to get confused.  There are a sufficient number of elevators, near which there are never queues.  The territory of Sural Resort (Side) is quite spacious and well-groomed, it is noticeable that it is well looked after.  A lot of all greens: palm trees, shrubs, flowering plants.  A lot of kitties run around the territory, which the children strive to feed. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very friendly and efficient.  They settle in the rooms quickly enough, even if you arrive late at night.  The maids are very responsible for cleaning, the rooms are always clean.  Try to service the apartments in the morning while you are on the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sural resort hotel 5" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1467154.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rooms themselves are quite spacious.  They have everything you need, and in normal working condition.  If the view from the balcony is important to you, it is better to book rooms looking at the sea or the pool.  True, one should be prepared for the fact that in the evening it will be quite noisy, since the main scene for the evening animation is located near the pool.  But there are also advantages here.  Everything is perfectly visible, without even leaving the room, but simply conveniently located on the balcony. </p><p>  The hotel has excellent Wi-Fi, which is a rarity for Turkish hotels.  The speed of the Internet allows you to chat in a room with relatives on a scoop. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  What is the situation with food, according to tourists, in the Sural Resort 5 *?  Reviews of vacationers regarding food are very positive.  All guests of the complex note a variety of dishes, their number is not small.  In the main restaurant, there is never a queue for food.  All trays are regularly replenished if something ends on them.  The waiters are polite and eager to please the visitor.  The only problem is being able to communicate with them, since few people speak Russian. </p><p>  Tourists are offered a wide selection of fruits: watermelons, peaches, grapes, apricots, plums.  Soups are present on the tables.  All of them have a consistency of mashed potatoes.  Fans of modern diet first courses will love them a lot.  Those who are accustomed to hearty and rich borscht have nothing to do in Turkey.  They don‚Äôt cook such first courses here as we are used to seeing them.  Mashed soups are a traditional dish of any hotel.  It is difficult for the Turks to find competitors in the preparation of meat dishes, sweets and pastries.  Everything is very tasty.  Grilled fish deserves special praise.  She's just gorgeous here.  At the buffet there are many different salads and snacks. </p><p>  After lunch, ice cream is handed out at the hotel.  That's it for them every day lined up (but no more than ten people).  It‚Äôs just amazing, it‚Äôs hard to find it tastier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sural resort 5 side" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1467164.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, with all the variety of dishes, I want to note their local flavor.  All of them are very peppered, and cooked with many spices.  You need to get used to it.  Children, as a rule, do not want to eat this.  And the food from the children's menu is not quite suitable for kids - sausages, pasta, pizza.  Sometimes it‚Äôs hard for kids to find something not peppered. </p><p>  Turkish sweets are worthy of all sorts of praise; they are prepared in huge quantities here.  They should try everything.  But desserts in the European manner are not particularly tasty, they should not even be taken. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Sural <span>Resort Hotel 5 * (Side)</span> has its own beautiful beach.  The entire coast of Side is famous for its fine and white sand, including our hotel.  The shore in this place is gentle and flat.  And the sea is shallow and comfortable for children.  On the beach there are a sufficient number of sunbeds and umbrellas, they are always enough.  On the coast is always quite spacious and there is no huge concentration of holidaymakers.  The sand is clean, it is very pleasant to relax in such an environment.  On the shore there is a shower and toilet, as well as a bar.  The hotel's beach is very good for families.  The water in the sea is incredibly warm.  Both day and night, its temperature does not drop below 28-30 degrees.  Better place to stay with children is simply not to be found. </p><p>  The hotel has great animators.  It‚Äôs definitely not boring here.  Every day, musical evenings with belly dancing are arranged, the program of the Turkish night is very interesting.  In the daytime, the animators invite you to participate in sports and entertainment games (basketball, volleyball, water aerobics).  There is a good mini-club for children, the animation there is in German.  However, there is a girl who knows Russian well.  They play and entertain with children there with games.  The kids are especially delighted by the slides in the pools, it is simply impossible to get them out of there.  I would like to note that the hotel really has a huge number of children, probably not less than a third of all guests.  All the kids are very pleased with the entertainment, they are busy all day with something interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sural resort 5 turkey side" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1467166.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the evenings, you can watch a musical show in the amphitheater, which is translated into several languages, including Russian.  Animators work very well, never boring.  The complex has many European representatives (Czechs, Germans) resting, there are also Russians and Ukrainians. </p><p>  Near the hotel there are several shops with all kinds of tourist goods.  In addition, the hotel itself has shops with shorts and T-shirts for vacationers.  But there are no large entertainment and shopping centers nearby.  There is nothing interesting outside the complex; there is nowhere to go for a walk.  Therefore, you can wander in the evenings through the territory of the hotel itself. </p><p>  There are two minibus stops near the hotel, there are public transport in two directions.  One of the buses goes to Managavt, and the other in Side.  It is better to go shopping and in search of entertainment in Side.  There you can see not only many historical sights, but also visit the best restaurants, wander along the quiet streets of the town, ride the rides in the water park. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, we can recommend the Sural Resort 5 * hotel for tourists for a good rest.  Guest reviews confirm a decent level of this complex.  The hotel is perfect for couples with children for a relaxing and measured vacation.  But for active youth and shopping enthusiasts, it might be better to find a hotel that will be located in Side itself. </p>
