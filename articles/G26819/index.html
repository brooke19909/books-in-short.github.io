This is the second largest known resort of our country after Sochi.  But, oddly enough, quite a few tourists, even in the high season, come to Kislovodsk.  Sights, photos of which are replicated on postcards and posters, few Russians saw with their own eyes.  Probably the reason for this sad trend is that Kislovodsk is not standing on the Black Sea, like Sochi.  But not only thalassotherapy is alive.  In addition to the famous narzan, Kislovodsk has something to win the hearts of city guests.  This is not only a balneological, but also a climatic resort. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The resort is located in the region of Caucasian Mineral Waters.  It is located in the very south of the <span>Stavropol Territory,</span> on the border with Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia.  Kislovodsk is separated 64 km from Mineralnye Vody.  Another kilometer more - and now the peak of Elbrus.  The city is conveniently located in the intermountain valley at an altitude of 800-1050 meters above sea level.  The elevation of the terrain implies that even in the summer months you will not feel the oppressive heat on the streets of Kislovodsk.  But in winter you can buy a bronze mountain tan.  Therefore, Kislovodsk takes lovers of relaxation surrounded by snowy peaks and shining glaciers.  Sights, parks and museums of the city surround the majestic peaks of the Caucasus mountain range.  The Olkhovka and Berezovka rivers flowing into Podkumok surround the resort on three sides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Unfortunately, Kislovodsk does not have its own airport.  Stavropol, the capital of the region, is too far away - 234 kilometers.  If you plan to fly by plane, the nearest civilian airport is in Mineralnye Vody.  On minibuses No. 10 and 11 or taxi you should get to the railway station of this city, and only then take the train.  Using the passing trains to Vladikavkaz or Nalchik, you can get to Kislovodsk.  The sights of this health resort city will meet you right on the station square.  One of them is the Philharmonic, whose building was built in 1898.  Buses with minibuses go to Kislovodsk from Mineralnye Vody (travel time is about two hours).  And if you plan to come to the resort using your own vehicles, your path from Moscow will lie along the main highways M4 and M6.  The capital is separated from the famous mountain resort 1612 km. </p>

    <h2>  Climate and natural attractions of Kislovodsk </h2><p>  Due to its convenient location in the intermountain plain, this area boasts unique weather features.  There are 300 clear days a year.  Such cloudless weather is greatly facilitated by the high <span>mountains of the Caucasus</span> Range, which close the city from moist, rain-bringing trade winds.  At the same time, a significant elevation of the resort above sea level leads to the establishment of an alpine climate.  In winter, the city is compared with the Swiss Davos (by the amount of snow and sun, and not by the level of service).  In summer and autumn, the Russian resort is similar in its climatic characteristics to the Italian Merano.  The sun, calm weather, crystal mountain air and healing water of narzan glorified Kislovodsk.  Sanatoria took their first vacationers even before the foundation of the city itself - in 1798. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Archaeological excavations give reason to believe that this valley was inhabited seven thousand years ago.  In the early Middle Ages, the Alans lived here.  Scientists find traces of settlements and necropolises near Kislovodsk.  Kislovodsk itself, whose sights are very numerous, was formed in 1803, when the Russian emperor <span>Alexander I</span> decided to capture and annex the North Caucasus.  He issued a decree on the construction of military fortresses to protect the rights of the Russian population from the encroachment of local peoples.  One such outpost was the Sour Water citadel.  It got its name because of the narzan, which really tastes "pickled" in taste.  In 1812, the fortress was converted with the latest fortification equipment of the time.  The retired soldiers and officers settled with their families at the foot of the citadel.  They formed posad by their houses.  But the settlement acquired the status of a city only in 1903. </p><h2>  Citadel </h2>

    <p>  The fortress and the Museum of Local Lore located inside it are the most famous sights glorifying Kislovodsk.  A part of the wall with loophole windows and a tower have been preserved from the fortification building of 1803.  But it is reliably known that the citadel, towering on a cliff between the Berezovka and Olkhovka rivers, included five bastions bristling with guns, which were surrounded by a deep moat.  Inside the powerful walls were barracks, a kitchen, a stable, an arsenal and an infirmary.  A path to retreat was also provided - a secret underground passage.  The fortress of 1812 was mentioned in the ‚ÄúPrincess Mary‚Äù of Lermontov.  More has survived from this building: gates, corner tower, partially walls.  In 1965, in this sample of Russian military architecture of the 19th century, the Museum of Local History was opened, which has already collected 60 thousand exhibits in its collection.  The address of the fortress is Prospekt Mira, 11. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What treats narzan? </h2><p>  Yes, almost everything.  Allergies, organs of the gastrointestinal tract, gynecological diseases, urology.  Together with therapeutic terraincourt (walking in the area with a calculated slope and duration), bicarbonate and sulfate narzan has a beneficial effect on the well-being of people with cardiovascular ailments and respiratory problems.  Baths soothe nerves, treat skin diseases.  And just drinking sour water will not hurt anyone.  This explains the popularity of Kislovodsk among those who want to improve their health.  This resort has more than a third of all health resorts in the region.  There are many sources in Kislovodsk, they have waters of different temperatures.  What exactly to take and in what doses, the doctor will tell you in any medical institution. </p><h2>  Sanatoriums and pensions Kislovodsk </h2><p>  Healing water - narzan brought the widest popularity to the Caucasian resort.  At first it was used only externally.  In 1812, public baths were erected - a one-story building, which was later demolished.  But nevertheless, something remained of the ancient resort of Sour Waters - the source of Bogatyrsky has not dried up, and they continue to use it.  In 1903, the main narzan baths appeared.  Where does this name come from?  Indeed, under the majority of the territory of Kislovodsk, a river runs from a continuous narzan at a depth of six meters.  The main baths - the main health resort of the city - were built by architect Klepinin.  They are still valid.  In Kislovodsk, in addition to 39 sanatoriums, there are also eight guest houses.  In them you can not only heal, but just relax, making excursions around the city and its environs.  Pensions Kislovodsk are designed for tourists of different income levels.  They offer both standard rooms and duplex suites.  And in order to bring your body to normal as much as possible, you can buy a course in a sanatorium. </p>

    <h2>  Flower sights of Kislovodsk </h2><p>  In the resort, everything should be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing to holidaymakers.  And the local authorities of Kislovodsk have always adhered to this principle.  The first park of the city was laid by the soldiers of the fortress in 1823.  The initiator of its creation was the commandant of the citadel - General Ermolov.  By his order, the soldiers planted greenery and arranged the banks of the Olkhovka River.  Later, the new authorities developed new territories, built colonnades, openwork bridges and pavilions.  Nowadays, the parks of Kislovodsk are a real decoration of the city.  Some names are worth: ‚ÄúValley of Roses‚Äù, ‚ÄúSilver Stream‚Äù.  In the Resort Park is the lower station of the cableway and pendulum (at the pavilion of the Temple of Air).  Going up to the mountain Small Sedlo (1325 m above sea level), you can admire the wonderful view of the city, the valley and towering directly opposite Elbrus. </p><h2>  Interesting sights of the city </h2><p>  Wandering around the historical part of Kislovodsk is a pleasure.  There are many architecturally interesting houses.  This is especially famous for Resort Boulevard.  Each building here is an excellent example of Russian romanticism or French neo-Gothic.  And this is not surprising: after all, nobles came to Kislovodsk to rest, many had cottages here.  The Narzan Baths building looks like a palace from the fairy tale ‚Äú1000 and 1 night‚Äù.  You also need to pay attention to the Cascade Staircase and the Ladies' Whim Bridge.  The museums of Kislovodsk hospitably open their doors for inquisitive tourists: the historical-local history museum (in the citadel), the history of cosmonautics, theatrical and musical culture that we have already mentioned.  It should be remembered that such outstanding people as A.S. walked the streets of the city  Pushkin, M. Yu. Lermontov, A.P. Chekhov, Leo Tolstoy, M.I. Glinka, <span>Isadora Duncan,</span> N.A. Rimsky-Korsakov and others.  In Kislovodsk there is the so-called "Chaliapin's Cottage" and the museum-estate of N. A. Yaroshenko, a Russian artist. </p>

    <h2>  Places of worship </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the era of Soviet cultural enlightenment has particularly proved itself in the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.  In the thirties of the last century, all the churches of Kislovodsk were destroyed.  But now managed to restore the St. Nicholas Church.  The date of its initial construction falls on 1888.  After 120 years, in 2008, it was re-lit.  Now there is the main parish with the sonorous name ‚ÄúKavminvodsk Deanery‚Äù.  This Christian temple is located near the old citadel.  It was once surrounded by a cemetery.  But at present there is only one grave in his fence.  Under a beautiful slab of black marble lies the great Russian artist N. A. Yaroshenko.  Just a couple of tens of meters separate the grave from the former home of Nikolai Alexandrovich, the ‚ÄúWhite Villa‚Äù, which is also a landmark of the city. </p><h2>  Theaters of Kislovodsk </h2><p>  We have already mentioned the Philharmonic, where they still give concerts.  The building of this temple of culture was built in 1895 in the style of French Boz art.  The abundance of winged cupids and stucco molding distinguishes the philharmonic from other buildings.  You can call the theater and the so-called "Chaliapin Cottage."  Why is the name of this building given in quotation marks?  Because the cottage itself, built in the Art Nouveau style, belonged to a certain singer Semenov, and the legendary Chaliapin only stayed here when he came to rest in Kislovodsk.  But it is known that he gave concerts from the veranda of this house.  In the interior, which remained unchanged, there are paintings by K. Korovin and fireplaces, made according to Roerich's sketches.  Currently, on Saturdays at the Chaliapin's Dacha, theatrical Saturdays are held. </p><h2>  Natural beauty of Kislovodsk </h2><p>  In addition to narzan and a beneficial effect on the climate of the body, the city can boast of amazingly beautiful nature.  It is enough just to go outside, as the eye pleases the enfilade of Caucasian peaks.  A noisy river Alikonovka flows near the city.  It forms a dam lake, where you can swim in the summer months.  And the river is famous for the fact that it formed chalk and sandstone rocks of the most bizarre outlines.  The most famous of them is the Castle of Love and Cunning.  Not far from it are flowing five foam jets of <span>Honey Falls of</span> Kislovodsk.  The height of the largest of them is 18 meters.  And a little further rises the famous <span>Mount Ring.</span>  She got her name from a weathered arch in a stone monolith.  In ancient times, it was believed that if a rider slips at full speed through this ring, he will be invulnerable to the sword and arrows.  In the gorge of another river - Olkhovka, there is another rock - Lermontovskaya, with a waterfall named after the poet. </p>

    <h2>  The surroundings of Kislovodsk </h2><p>  If you are tired of making a daily leisurely promenade in the Narzan Gallery and taking pictures on the Lermontov site, then it's time to make a trip for Kislovodsk.  Excursions - the sights of the surroundings allow you to do this - are very diverse.  They can be ordered at your local travel agency.  Tourists are offered walks in the immediate vicinity of the city (Alikonovskoye, Olkhovskoye Gorges), as well as bus excursions to the Berezovskaya hollow, to the top of the Rome Mountain, where the Byzantine settlement used to be), to the Devil's Grottoes caves and so on.  You can go on a one-day tour to Kabardino-Balkaria, to the famous Valley of Narzanov.  Here, healing water springs right under your feet. </p>
