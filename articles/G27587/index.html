    <p>  The Astrakhan Khanate arose in the 16th century in the Lower Volga region.  This Tatar state was formed after the collapse of the Golden Horde and it is located on the right bank of the Volga.  Its capital - Hadji Tarkhan - was 12 km from present-day Astrakhan.  First, in 1460, the Big Horde was formed, which was the central part of the former Golden Horde.  Khan Mahmud, who was sitting in the capital, the city of Saraj, headed it.  His two sons did not share power, and Hasim, having gone to the lower Volga, created his own separate state.  It received full independence in 1502, after the victory of the troops of the <span>Crimean Khanate</span> over the forces of the Great Horde. </p><h2>  Profitable neighbor </h2><p>  Under Hasim, trade relations were established between Moscow, where Ivan III was sitting, and Hadji-Tarkhan.  Ships with salt went from the lower Volga to the capital.  All Russian history indicates that trade with Moscow is only beneficial for both parties.  There was a huge slave market in Haji Tarkhan, and goods from many countries were concentrated.  However, the Astrakhan Khanate has never been a strong independent power.  Being in a very convenient place, it has always been a welcome prey for neighbors and not only.  The Crimean and <span>Kazan Khanates, the</span> Nogai Horde, the state also formed as a result of the collapse of the Golden Horde and located in the interfluve of the Volga and the Urals, Khorezm - all of them were not averse to seizing the hands of a weaker neighbor.  Even Turkey tried to establish its control over the khanate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Double game </h2><p>  The accession of the Astrakhan Khanate was on the agenda.  All the rulers of this Tatar state fought a double game with Moscow.  Despite the clear benefits of trade and friendship with Russia, Khan Abdul-Rahman signed secret agreements with the Crimea and Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="annexation of the Astrakhan Khanate to Russia" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/569234.jpg" width="600"></div>  Although earlier, in 1533, under the influence of the “Russian party”, formed at its court and generously bribed by Russia, the Astrakhan Khanate concluded an expanded trade and political agreement with Moscow, in which it was about friendship and mutual assistance.  The direct annexation of the Astrakhan Khanate began under <span>Ivan the Terrible.</span>  The Moscow henchman Dervish-Ali and Abdul-Rahman from 1533 to 1556 replaced each other several times on the throne.

    <p>  Only in 1552-1554, another protege of the Crimea, Yamgurchi, managed to wedge themselves into their struggle, whose behavior, including the arrest and exile of the Russian ambassador, so outraged the then ruler of Russia that he made the first trip to the walls of Hadji Tarkhan in 1554 .  But the annexation of the Astrakhan Khanate was not a goal then.  They wanted to put him in a strong <span>vassal dependence</span> on Moscow, seizing the same Dervish Ali on the throne.  On the one hand, after the fall of Kazan, the Principality of Astrakhan, sensing vulnerability, ceased to behave provocatively with Moscow.  On the other hand, the joint actions of the Crimea and Turkey intensified, which provided support for Yamgurchi.  The robbery and reference to one of the Caspian islands, Ambassador Sevastyan Avraamov, so enraged Ivan the Terrible that a well-equipped 30-thousand army was sent down the Volga in strugs.  It was led by Ignatius Veshnyakov and Yuri Pronsky-Shemyakin.  Dervish Ali rode with this part of the army.  Prince Vyazemsky with a detachment of 2500 people and Danila Chulkov with a large group of Cossacks acted separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lack of pragmatism </h2>

    <p>  All Russian history teaches the enemies of our country not to offend her, but to behave with a great power respectfully, because the punishment will come.  The Astrakhan affair began in May.  All Russian troops had to meet and unite in the area of ​​the narrowest place between the Volga and the Don, called Perevoloka.  The detachments of the Nogai-Horde khan Ismail, whose help was the official version of the campaign, had to come here.  They did not come, probably because "the East is a delicate matter."  But all the same, the units of Vyazemsky and Pronsky completely defeated the defenders of the Astrakhan Khanate who had come out to meet them, among whom were the Janissaries.  Yamgurchi fled to Azov, leaving absolutely everything - wives (hansh), children, harem.  The capital was taken without a fight.  The henchman of Moscow was seated on the throne, solemnly swore allegiance to her. </p><h2>  Again the same "rake" </h2>

    <p>  But the actual annexation of the Astrakhan Khanate happened later.  And then either the tribute established for payment was excessive (1,200 rubles in silver, 3,000 2.5-meter sturgeons, duty-free trade throughout the khanate), or the air in the capital was like that, but Dervish-Ali, three times seated by Moscow on throne, secretly crossed to the side of the Crimea and Turkey.  By combined efforts, the group seeks the flight of Ismail, and, having finally become impudent, the Astrakhan khan expels a Russian governor from his capital.  Of course, they asked for it, and now the absolute and actual accession of the Astrakhan Khanate to Russia has become inevitable. </p><h2>  Punish and attach </h2><p>  The purpose of the second campaign to Astrakhan, begun in the spring of 1556, was the complete elimination of the independence of this khanate.  The combined army, in fact, was punitive.  It included archers and Vyatka militias, Don and <span>Volga Cossacks,</span> each marching independently in order to unite near Astrakhan.  The total number of troops did not exceed 3,000 people, which testified to the weakness of the arrogant khanate.  In fact, the city itself was taken only by the first detachment of the Volga Cossacks who arrived at its walls under the leadership of Lyapun Filimonov.  And, although in the course of the company, Dervish Ali managed to pat the forces of the Russian troops, the victory was complete, and Astrakhan without any contracts became part of Russia. </p><h2>  Next - Zauralie and the North Caucasus </h2>

    <p>  The annexation of the Astrakhan Khanate, whose date is August 26, 1556, was anemic and played a decisive role in the final decay of the remnants of the Golden Horde.  Gradually, they became part of Russia or recognized a vassal dependence on it: in 1557 - the Nogai Horde, then in the same year Bashkiria.  And in 1560, the border of the Russian state in the east already passes through the Urals, in the southeast - along the Terek.  In essence, the Kazan and Astrakhan Khanates, by their fall, paved the way for Russia to advance to the Urals, Terek and Kuban.  And then our country faced the issue of penetration into the Trans-Urals and the North Caucasus.  But this was a matter of Russia's foreign policy for the future, and in the 16th century Ivan the Terrible was annexed to the Volga region completely, which ensured duty-free trade.  In addition, the conquest of the Astrakhan Khanate ensured the protection of Russia's borders from the south, from the Crimean Khanate, a strong and constant enemy. </p>
