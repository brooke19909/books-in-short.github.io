    <p>  The founding date of the city of Ryazan is considered the XI century.  In fact, people in this area have lived since time immemorial, but the formation of the settlement and the assignment of its modern name to it occurred during that period.  The history of the Ryazan region is rich and rich in various events.  It was possible for these lands to experience the raids of the Tatar-Mongol troops and the princely feuds.  Against the backdrop of such significant events, it‚Äôs even a little disappointing that the most famous brands of Ryazan are ‚Äúmushrooms with eyes‚Äù and ‚Äúslowness‚Äù.  By the way, you will be surprised, but in the first case we are not talking about fly agaric.  One version of the origin of the proverb about mushrooms refers to the beginning of the history of the city.  Once the Ryazan land bordered on the steppes filled with militant nomads.  In the forests located on this side, civilians were not allowed to go, only border guards of that time.  One of the signs that make it possible to determine that there was an enemy - crumpled grass and downed mushroom caps.  It turns out that the gifts of the forest, although they did not have eyes, really helped guard the border. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  From the legends of antiquity today </h2><p>  The nature of the Ryazan Territory is striking in its beauty, and there are no questions why people once decided to build a city here.  An interesting fact - initially Ryazan was in a different place (today - Old Ryazan), the modern administrative center during the formation was called Pereslavl-Ryazan.  The capital of the principality was moved after another raid of the Tatar-Mongol khan and serious destruction.  In the Middle Ages, the official status and administrative subordination of these lands changed several times.  And only at the very end of the eighteenth century the Ryazan province was formed again.  But later the city and its environs once again became part of the Moscow region.  And only after leaving Ryazan again became the administrative center. </p><h2>  The nature of the Ryazan region: photos and unique facts </h2>

    <p>  Most of the region‚Äôs territories are located in the forest-steppe zone.  The Ryazan region is characterized by the alternation of hills and lowlands.  Due to such a variety of relief, there is a fairly rich world of wildlife.  There are no problems with water resources: in the vicinity of Ryazan there are many rivers and lakes.  Industry is well developed in the region, but there are no serious environmental problems.  Specialists are more worried about mostly peat and forest fires that are stably repeating in hot-arid periods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Animal and plant world </h2>
