Russian state insurance company</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it is necessary to find out the reviews of Rosgosstrakh employees about the employer.  And in general, what is this company in principle?  She quite often searches for new workers.  But why?  Should I trust Rosgosstrakh and get a job here?  What positive and negative aspects do applicants and employees see in cooperation?  Numerous reviews will help to judge all this.  Only if you believe everything that is written, it will not be possible to come to a consensus.  Therefore, it is important to emphasize for yourself only useful information.  And her and so many.  So what is Rosgosstrakh as an employer? </p><h2>  Company Description </h2><p>  The first thing you need to understand is what kind of company are they talking about.  The thing is that Rosgosstrakh is a very large Russian organization.  She is an insurance company.  It even has a separate <span>non</span> - <span>state pension fund</span> . </p><p>  It provides services for insurance of the population and property, forms the funded part of pensions.  Rosgosstrakh also has a bank of the same name.  But mostly organizations are spoken of as an insurance company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews of Rosgosstrakh employees" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1509293.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Should I get a job here?  What suggestions does the organization make to its applicants?  What turns out to be true and what is false? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Promises </h2><p>  Working at Rosgosstrakh is a good option for gaining work experience in a large <span>insurance organization.</span>  What are HR managers luring applicants for?  What promises does the company give to attract new personnel? </p><p>  In fact, they are all stereotyped and standard.  As practice shows, among promises that attract attention, we can distinguish: </p><ul><li>  work in a large and popular company; </li><li>  Friendly team; </li><li>  full benefits package; </li><li>  official employment; </li><li>  decent income; </li><li>  flexible working hours; </li><li>  comfortable working conditions; </li><li>  free education; </li><li>  prospects for career growth and self-development. </li></ul><p>  But is it really so?  Will the work at Rosgosstrakh really provide all these guarantees to job seekers and already employed people?  Or were such statements invented in order to simply attract the public? </p><h2>  Address </h2><p>  But before you understand all this, you need to find out some details about the company.  For example, some people are interested in what addresses Rosgosstrakh has.  To enumerate them for a very long time - in each city there is a huge number of organization branches.  Moreover, both the insurance company and the bank or private pension fund. </p><p>  It is enough to know what coordinates to contact in case of extremely serious and important questions.  Or rather, the location of the head office of the organization.  What does Rosgosstrakh offer?  Addresses, as already mentioned, are offered different.  But the main, head office is located in Moscow, on <span>Bolshaya Ordynka</span> street <span>,</span> house 40. This is where you need to contact for any global issues.  For example, with complaints or recommendations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rosgosstrakh osago" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1509294.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Phones </h2><p>  Another important point is the receipt of information about both employment and the work of the organization.  To do this, you need to know the phones of the company.  Rosgosstrakh has a lot of them - each branch has its own contacts.  And this nuance is worth considering.  Accordingly, the contacts will be specified for each locality in Russia separately. </p><p>  The Rosgosstrakh telephone for communication with the head office offers the following: 8 800 200 0 900. More precisely, it is a ‚Äúhot line‚Äù by which it will be possible to clarify almost any information about the work of the institution.  Only issues related to the employment of the population are not discussed. </p><p>  Rosgosstrakh phone for an appointment always indicates different.  It all depends on where the staff is required, as well as on the location of a particular point in the organization.  Therefore, it is impossible to say exactly what contacts to contact Rosgosstrakh for further employment.  You just need to pay attention to the ad text - all telephones and other important information for applicants will be indicated there. </p><h2>  Jobs </h2><p>  Rosgosstrakh has many job opportunities for employment.  Only, as practice shows, all are the same.  The thing is that most often the organization is looking for: </p><ul><li>  workers on the phone; </li><li>  sales managers; </li><li>  consultants; </li><li>  workers in offices. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, there are practically no managerial posts.  And everyone should remember this.  Some express their opinion that they are recruiting "their" people for leadership positions.  But there is no evidence of this.  However, like rebuttals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh St. Petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1509295.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The situation with vacancies is not much different from similar companies - everywhere ordinary employees are required, but not superiors and managers.  No wonder.  Although sometimes leadership positions still occur.  Only they close very quickly.  Therefore, finding a job in a company, you can only rely on an ordinary position. </p><h2>  Official employment </h2><p>  <span>The reviews of Rosgosstrakh employees</span> indicate that the company does indeed offer official employment.  This fact is some pleasantly surprising.  Indeed, not every employer will insist on the official registration of each employee. </p><p>  Rosgosstrakh is a large insurance company that values ‚Äã‚Äãits status and customers.  It also acts in accordance with established legislation.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that informal employment under the law is prohibited in Russia.  That is why every employee will be officially employed. </p><p>  True, some time will have to work without concluding a contract and putting down an entry in the work book.  This is a period of study.  After its completion, a decision is made on both sides - the employee looks to see if the vacancy suits him, and the employer considers the candidacy of a potential subordinate.  As a rule, many agree to cooperate with the organization. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  Rosgosstrakh (St. Petersburg or any other city - this is not so important) receives positive reviews because the company offers not only official cooperation, but also training at the expense of the company.  This is a mandatory period of time, which cannot be avoided. </p><p>  Many emphasize that during the training, the employees really explain the tasks that will have to be performed.  He is also introduced to the work team.  No additional or unnecessary work, all so that a person can get used to the new working conditions.  This is what pleases many job seekers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1509296.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The training period, as a rule, lasts about a week.  Sometimes even a few days.  After that, the final decision on further cooperation is made, followed by either the termination of the relationship or the conclusion of an employment contract in an official manner. </p><h2>  Working conditions </h2><p>  The Rosgosstrakh company offers all its subordinates comfortable working conditions.  And this feature is emphasized by many.  The thing is that the insurance company, as already mentioned, recruits personnel mainly for work either in retail outlets or in offices.  Therefore, "stand in the cold" do not have to. </p><p>  In offices and retail outlets, as a rule, all the necessary working conditions are offered - there is even a coffee machine and tea with sugar.  These are the benefits that some job seekers emphasize. </p><p>  The only drawback that is considered the norm in the modern world is a sedentary way of working.  And <span>monotonous work.</span>  You‚Äôll have to sit either at the office at the computer or in the department of the outlet waiting for customers throughout the working day.  Sales managers sometimes have to be creative, but usually without leaving the company‚Äôs department.  Not everyone is ready to put up with a sedentary way of working. </p><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  The next nuance is the work schedule.  Rosgosstrakh Insurance receives a variety of reviews for this feature.  There are both complaints regarding the work schedule and positive opinions. </p><p>  Many indicate that the company practices a 5-day work week.  That is, the employee will still have 2 days off.  But the time spent at work, more negative.  Why? </p><p>  The reviews of Rosgosstrakh employees emphasize that often employees have to stay in the workplace overtime.  And without any surcharges or rewards.  A similar situation is not uncommon.  Especially during periods when you have to serve a lot of customers. </p><p>  By the way, some are not happy with the fact that the company "Rosgosstrakh" (St. Petersburg or any other city, it is not so important what kind of area it is) is a constant flow of customers.  In particular, in a bank or non-state pension fund.  There are a lot of people in insurance departments. </p><h2>  Situation </h2><p>  The situation at the workplace also receives mixed reviews from Rosgosstrakh employees.  Some say that working in a company is simple, easy and enjoyable.  Everywhere a friendly and light atmosphere, there is no tension, only peace and quiet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="policy of Rosgosstrakh" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1509299.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Along with this, some emphasize that it is difficult to work at Rosgosstrakh.  The situation is tense, there are many customers, I have to deal with some problems every day and solve them.  All this should be remembered by every job seeker before employment.  Plus affects regular overtime work.  All this creates not the best working atmosphere. </p><p>  What to believe?  Rather, it‚Äôs better to be neutral.  The thing is that in reality, ‚ÄúRosgosstrakh‚Äù in some departments of the organization has a calm atmosphere, and somewhere there is a certain tension from the large flow of visitors and fuss.  Therefore, you will have to prepare for the fact that you will have to work under an employment contract under different conditions.  No one can say for sure what the atmosphere will be like in this or that office of the organization. </p><h2>  Social package </h2><p>  Rosgosstrakh (Moscow, St. Petersburg or any other city - not so important, the same rules apply everywhere) offers its employees a complete social package.  And indeed it is.  Only it is far from always easy to get it. </p><p>  Many emphasize that beginners are not offered a full social package.  For example, paid leave.  Only employees who have been working with an insurance company for at least a year can count on it.  But for lunch and sick leave with payment you can count on in full.  If necessary, they also let go of the session, albeit with reluctance. </p><p>  Accordingly, there are few complaints about the absence of a social package.  And it is pleasantly pleasing.  The reviews of Rosgosstrakh employees quite often indicate not only the organization‚Äôs shortcomings, but also its advantages.  And there are a lot of them! </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  Ambiguous opinions are left regarding the wages of workers.  Quite a lot of negativity is expressed by sales managers of certain products of the organization.  How can you generally describe the situation with earnings? </p><p>  Rosgosstrakh Insurance does not offer the highest official salary.  As practice shows, it turns out to be less than promised.  Because of this, some job seekers feel cheated.  Nevertheless, the insurance company does pay its subordinates. </p><p>  It is noted that delays in payments are available, but rarely and insignificant.  It can be said not critical.  And it pleases.  It is pleasantly surprising that <span>Rosgosstrakh</span> makes <span>payments on</span> time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1509298.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  There are prospects for additional earnings.  You can get bonuses and allowances for achieving this or that progress.  Lucky in this regard, product sales managers from the company "Rosgosstrakh".  The cost of each policy will be credited to the employee who issued the document.  At the end of the month, a person receives a certain percentage of each service sold and provided. </p><p>  Accordingly, the company really allows you to make money.  But you have to try.  A simple salary does not suit many.  Indeed, in reality it is not the highest. </p><h2>  Collective </h2><p>  <span>Rosgosstrakh (Moscow</span> or any other city is not so important) receives positive reviews for its work team.  Friendly people work here who are always ready to help out and come to the rescue.  Although some competition among individual workers is visible.  For example, sales managers.  But it is not conducted in the open. </p><p>  It is proposed to work at Rosgosstrakh with friendly and understanding staff.  There are not very friendly personalities, but there are very few.  The main thing is to get accustomed to the team from the very beginning.  Then work in an insurance company will be a pleasure. </p><p>  It is noted that Rosgosstrakh has a collective policy.  More precisely, the organization is doing everything to unite the team.  For example, it regularly arranges subbotniks.  They are usually indicated in a negative light, because you have to go to work again.  But this feature still has a positive effect on communication with colleagues. </p><h2>  Guide </h2><p>  But for the leadership reviews of employees of Rosgosstrakh are not the best.  The population often indicates that the bosses here treat their subordinates ‚Äúnot like people,‚Äù with injustice and even some rudeness and rudeness.  You cannot rely on leaders. </p><p>  For any mistake, even the smallest - a fine or reprimand with any punishment.  It is difficult to agree with the authorities.  Do not be afraid - all these are standard claims against most employers.  It is recommended that you simply be honest with your work.  And then skirmishes with the authorities will be minimal. </p><h2>  For clients </h2><p>  And how do customers see the organization?  This is also an important point.  A man bought the Rosgosstrakh policy.  Can he hope for a quality and fast service?  Yes, but not in all cases.  It is noted that life insurance is not in great demand, and when using the VHI policy, sometimes you have to wait a long time for payments for received medical care.  Also, some are not satisfied with how much the Rosgosstrakh policy costs.  Much depends on the specific conditions, but often reviews indicate the high cost of service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosgosstrakh addresses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1509297.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Special attention is paid to hull and compulsory motor liability insurance issued in the organization.  Rosgosstrakh OSAGO offers at affordable prices, but insurance does not cover all insured events.  It is recommended that you just carefully study the contract.  Then you can avoid most of the problems and questions. </p><p>  Employees of the company respond differently.  Someone says that he communicated with conscientious and professional staff.  Some, on the contrary, indicate communication with unfriendly people who do not understand anything in their work.  The company Rosgosstrakh OSAGO is in demand, but some employees can not answer some questions related to this insurance. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that as a company for customer service, Rosgosstrakh performs well.  The same goes for the role of the employer. </p><p>  The insurance company has both pros and cons.  If you are conscientious about your work, complaints and negative aspects will be minimized.  In any case, the applicant will gain experience in a large insurance company in Russia.  And, of course, stable earnings! </p><p>  Rosgosstrakh makes payments on time, but delays can sometimes occur.  Moreover, both in relation to earnings, and in relation to covered insurance.  This is normal and should not cause panic. </p>
