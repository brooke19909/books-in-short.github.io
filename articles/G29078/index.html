Indeed, this approach allows you to avoid a lot of difficulties and problems, and also in some cases to save money (for example, on air tickets).  Experienced tourists are advised to pay special attention to the choice of the hotel in which you plan to stay during your vacation.  Especially when it comes to an all-inclusive hotel.  Indeed, on its territory you will probably spend almost all of your time leaving it only for walks and trips on excursions.  Familiarizing with the reviews of those who have already visited this or that place and decided to share their impressions both about the pluses of this hotel and its minuses helps many travelers not to make a mistake in their choice.  This will allow you to make a closer to reality idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you on vacation.  However, the search and analysis of the comments of other tourists, as a rule, takes a lot of effort.  In order to save you time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized reviews of travelers from Russia who recently lived in the Jazz Aquamarine Resort during their <span>vacation in Hurghada</span> (Egypt).  It should be noted right away that the vast majority of comments are positive, and sometimes even enthusiastic.  Indeed, almost all the guests were satisfied with this hotel and are ready to return here again, as well as recommend it to all friends and relatives.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jaz aquamarine resort 5 hurghada" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1089993.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to the guests, the apartments here are very spacious, stylishly decorated, with a fresh renovation.  All furniture and appliances in the rooms are modern, in good condition.  Tourists also liked the spacious furnished balconies and terraces with a table and chairs where you can comfortably accommodate.  Travelers also note large comfortable beds on which they managed to get enough sleep.  Also, hotel guests were satisfied and soundproofed.  Even those guests whose windows overlooked the pool did not complain about the noise when the balcony door was closed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel jazz aquamarine resort in hurghada egypt" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1089994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  As for the work of the maids, then, according to some guests, it has its own characteristics.  So, according to them, in most cases, housekeeping is regular, but very mediocre.  If you want the maids to be more responsible in fulfilling their duties, then leave them a tip.  In this case, as tourists say, your room will always shine with cleanliness.  As for the change of towels, it is produced every day.  Underwear is updated several times a week.  Also, as expenditures, maids replenish supplies of bath accessories, drinking bottled water and the contents of the minibar. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Jaz Aquamarine Resort 5 * (Hurghada, Egypt), reviews of which we are reviewing, like most other hotels in this country, cannot offer its guests free Wi-Fi in the rooms.  According to the guests of the "Jazz Aquamarine Resort" wireless Internet in the hotel can only be used in the lobby near the reception.  Experienced travelers advise those who want to always be able to be online, to purchase, upon arrival at the airport or in Hurghada itself, a SIM card of a local mobile operator with an Internet package.  It will cost you about $ 15, but you can always be in touch and be able to chat with your friends and family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jaz aquamarine resort 5 hurghada egypt reviews" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1089995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  Many guests of the "Jazz Aquamarine" with pleasure several times went for a walk in Hurghada.  You can get to the city center from the hotel by taxi.  Such a trip is worth, according to our compatriots, quite inexpensive.  For the rest, tourists are not recommended to leave the hotel, however, guests do not particularly complain about this fact, since there are a lot of entertainments on its territory. </p><p>  So, about twenty pools are equipped here, half of which are equipped with a water heating system, which is very important for winter time.  Near each pool there is a sun terrace with comfortable sun loungers and parasols.  Also on the territory of the hotel there are several bars where you can always treat yourself to alcoholic or soft drinks. </p><p>  Tourists also note the presence of a mass of pretty places where you can take a walk and take beautiful photos as a keepsake.  In general, the territory of the hotel, according to our compatriots, is very large, green, well-planned and well-groomed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel reviews jaz aquamarine resort 5 Hurghada" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1089996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The overwhelming majority of tourists are concerned about this issue, especially when it comes to a hotel operating under the "ol inclusive" system, like the Jaz Aquamarine Resort 5 * we are considering (Hurghada, Egypt).  So, the food in this hotel complex, our compatriots, judging by their comments, were generally quite satisfied.  According to them, in restaurants working in the buffet format (and there are two of them), the menu is constantly changing, so you do not have to eat the same thing every day.  In general, the dishes here are very different - several types of soups, dishes of meat, fish, poultry, salads, snacks, vegetables, fruits, pastries, sweets, etc. There is also a children's and diet table. </p><p>  In addition, there are four √† la carte restaurants in the Jazz Aquamarine area - fish, Lebanese, Asian and Italian.  Here you can order dishes to your taste √† la carte.  Please note that reservations are required in advance for these restaurants. </p><p>  In addition, during the day, guests of the hotel can eat in one of the snack bars located by the pools and on the beach.  Here you will be offered pizza, burgers, etc. So it will simply be impossible to stay hungry in a hotel. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Like most five-star hotels in Egypt, Jaz Aquamarine Resort 5 * has its own beach.  It is here, according to our compatriots, quite large, sandy, clean.  True, some tourists were not very pleased with the fact that they would have to go through shallow water for about 500 meters to the depths.  However, many vacationers went swimming in the lagoon of a nearby abandoned hotel.  Here you can almost immediately find yourself in the depths.  Near the coast is a coral reef.  So grab a snorkeling mask with you or buy it already in Egypt. </p>
