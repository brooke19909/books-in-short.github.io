Therefore, not everyone can spontaneously plan their summer vacation.  As a rule, many families are not able to get out to relax at sea resorts.  But then the people of Kiev were very lucky with the local reservoirs.  These are pure fresh Blue Lakes.  Kiev in this regard is rich in such attractions. </p>

It is here that those who for some reason cannot plan a long vacation spend their time. </p><h2>  A few words about the pond </h2><p>  One of these favorite places for locals is Blue Lake.  Kiev is located just 20 km from it.  Near the pond there is the village of Podgortsy.  The name of the lake was not accidental.  The water in it is really clean, turquoise. </p><p>  <span>Blue Lake</span> was formed not so long ago, several years ago.  It arose on the site of a former sand pit.  And since then, the reservoir was very fond of the inhabitants of Kiev and surrounding areas </p><h2>  What awaits vacationers? </h2><p>  During the summer heat and scorching heat, a trip to the Blue Lakes (Kiev) will be an excellent option.  It is a good place for family holidays.  After all, there is everything you need - clean water, suitable for swimming, a convenient approach to it, wide sandy beaches, gentle plains nearby, a forest belt and developing infrastructure around the reservoir.  The bottom of the lake is flat, without stones and debris. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  And there is a small hilly area nearby, and the name of the nearby village is Podgornoye.  Recently, this place has become popular for hang gliding. </p><h2>  Illegal buildings </h2><p>  In recent years, private cottages increasingly surround the Blue Lake (Kiev).  Photos that show where this leads can be viewed in the media.  This problem is often covered in local newspapers.  As a rule, this construction is often judicial in nature, since the land surrounding the lake is mainly sold illegally. </p><h2>  Paid and free beaches: what's the difference? </h2><p>  The area near the reservoir is divided into two parts: paid and free. </p><p>  On a paid beach, you need to pay an entrance fee, and then vacationers will have their own sunbeds, plenty of space in the shade and in the sun, a cafe, two volleyball fields.  The free beach has the same thing.  Sun beds can be rented, there is enough space in the shade, there are several food services, catamarans are offered for entertainment.  But on the free beach there are always a lot of vacationers who come to the Blue Lake (Kiev) to soak up the sun. </p>

    <p>  Along the entire coastline, snacks, ice cream are sold, and hookah is even offered.  But staying overnight in a tent will not work here, as camping places are not provided.  It is also not allowed to make bonfires on the shore on their own.  These safety measures are taken in order to protect the nearest nature from accidental fire. </p><p>  You can come to Blue Lake (Kiev) by car.  Entrance to the territory is paid, the vehicle is left in a covered parking lot. </p><h2>  How to get to the Blue Lakes? </h2><p>  Getting to the lake is not difficult at all.  However, it should be borne in mind that due to the fact that the reservoir is artificial, it is not on many maps.  To get to the place of rest, you need to navigate the place or ask the locals. </p><p>  Arrive at Blue Lake (Kiev) by car.  To do this, when leaving the capital, you need to go along the Obukhov highway to 28 kilometers.  The road will take a little time - about 30 minutes.  You can also organize a cycling route along the same path. </p><p>  You can get to the Blue Lake by public transport.  To do this, from Kiev, take the metro to the Vydubychi station, and then transfer to the minibus and go towards Obukhov. </p>
