Stone walls with memories of the culture of our ancestors.  All this is about the greatest castle of St. Peter, located in the city of Bodrum, in Turkey.  This is a tourist attraction whose popularity among tourists is growing every year. </p><h2>  St. Peter's Castle: the history of construction </h2><p>  Bodrum Castle is a historical landmark, on the territory of which there were many different battles led by famous warriors.  The building is considered one of the most remarkable monuments of the city.  The full name sounds like this - the castle of St. Peter the Liberator of the Order of the Knights of the Hospital of St. John of Rhodes. </p><p>  The architectural structure was used as a fortress for more than six centuries and was one of the most visible military garrisons.  The complex was built around a small village.  Today, St. Peter's Castle in Turkey has turned into a historical museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blue-velvet-exploring-the-world.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Peter Bodrum Castle" class="if uuid-2573928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573928.jpg"></div><p>  It is believed that the king of Mausoleum from 377 to 353 BC, who led the kingdom of Caria, decided to move the capital from Milas to Halicarnassus.  Subsequently, the king's mausoleum was located in the fortress.  He was one of the seven wonders of the world.  But unfortunately, in 1402, as a result of several earthquakes, the great structure was destroyed.  The Crusaders used the remaining debris to erect the walls of the fortress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.orangesmile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mausoleum in Halicarnassus" class="if uuid-2573991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573991.jpg"></div><p>  It is believed that when the city was captured by Alexander the Great, most of the castle was destroyed.  Prior to this, the structure was a citadel or fortress.  The castle was built on the island of Zephyria in the 15th century by the knights of the Rhodes hospital.  The Zephyrion Peninsula is small, protected by cliffs in the eastern part of Bodrum harbor and connected to the mainland by means of an artificial embankment.  To this day, no one has an idea about why the knights built the fortress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itinari.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress in Bodrum" class="if uuid-2573927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573927.jpg"></div><p>  The castle has five towers and seven gates.  The highest tower is the French one, which rises 47.5 meters above sea level.  Other tower names: Italian, German, English and Serpentine.  From the castle of St. Peter the view is amazing.  There is no doubt that this place was once a historic fortress.  The first Grand Master of the Order was the Frenchman Philibert De Nailac.  In this regard, in the north tower of the castle you can find the royal weapons of France. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": Benjamin Claverie, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bodrum castle II" class="if uuid-2573984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573984.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main architects of the fortress was a German named Henrik Schlegelholdt.  The castle also preserved traces of Spanish and Italian culture. </p><p>  One of the main problems of the fortress was that it was subjected to constant naval attacks, which led to large losses and destruction.  The people began to realize that in order to protect the island it was necessary to create a navy.  However, the ruling leaders were deaf to the proposals of the people, and in 1480 the city was besieged and captured by the Ottoman Empire.  The Turks did not begin to rebuild the fortress, in connection with which in 1571 the Turkish fleet was destroyed by the Maltese knights.  The battle is known as the Battle of Lepanto. </p><h2>  Building a prison in the castle </h2><p>  In 1893, Abdulhamid II founded a prison in the castle of St. Peter.  The fortress has a complex prison system and a torture chamber.  After the castle was captured, they were buried underground and forgotten.  In 1909, two fanatical Islamic religious people were kept in prison.  They were sentenced to life imprisonment in connection with their uprising.  There is a suspicion that they were brutally tortured. </p><p>  With the advent of the new century, the people faced an increase in crime, mainly robberies.  Among the prisoners, one could meet many people involved in the activities of Robin Hood - they robbed the rich and helped the poor.  One of the most famous leaders called himself Efe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  They try to forget and not mention this period of the castle‚Äôs existence in historical references. </p><h2>  Museum History </h2><p>  There was a time when the castle of St. Peter was destroyed during historical battles, destruction and bombing during the First World War.  The museum has come a long and difficult path before becoming what it is today. </p><p>  The first reconstruction was done by journalist Peter Grockdorton in 1958.  He tried to recreate the story and shed light on what happened in the castle during its existence.  Professor George F. Bass from the Department of Scientific Navigational Archeology decided to help restore this building, make it beautiful and powerful, as in ancient times. </p><p>  Further, Hakki Gultekin, the former director of the Izmir Museum, undertook the reconstruction.  He decided to raise this issue at the government level in Ankara.  Helped him in this Azra Erhad, known for his Turkish translations of films such as the Iliad and Odyssey.  For the first time, the Turkish government provides a grant to the museum.  They allocated the necessary funds to restore the abandoned former prison, its catacombs and turn the castle into a museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.njcharters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of St. Peter" class="if uuid-2573931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573931.jpg"></div><p>  Under the leadership of director Nurettin Yardimchi from 1973 to 1975 and Ilkhan Aksit from 1976 to 1978, the restoration of the castle slowed significantly.  The English Tower was an exception, since the reconstruction was completed in 1975. </p><p>  As soon as in 1978 the museum passed to Oguz Alpozen, the process was resumed.  At that time, the future director participated in some underwater excavations that helped form the museum.  He was considered a professional underwater archeology and very well versed in what he did.  As soon as Oguz began excavating in Bodrum and in the museum, he realized that he was very passionate about the history of this museum and its past.  He wanted to know more about the shipwrecks in the area.  He also made sure that the results of the excavations that he found in Bodrum remained here, without falling into the wrong hands and museums. </p><p>  When excavations were carried out between the 60s and 80s, the world realized how many buried treasures and the greatest secrets of the world have yet to be discovered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mehmetbilgehanmerki.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Found remains" class="if uuid-2573965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573965.jpg"></div><p>  In 1993, they made shocking discoveries.  The remains of a prisoner were found right in front of the English tower.  It is believed that the bodies belonged to slaves or people who were tortured to death.  This confirms the historical opinion that torture rooms were located in the castle.  The victims remain unknown, and why they were placed in this place is also unclear. </p><p>  To date, 14 exhibition halls have been opened in St. Peter's Castle in Bodrum.  It mainly includes underwater artifacts. </p><h2>  Glass Hall </h2><p>  In 1986, a glass hall was opened, which houses an exhibition of glass and glassware.  The hall is dark, exhibits are illuminated from below.  This allows you to see all the markings and glass colors.  Presented samples date from the 14th century BC to the 11th century AD.  The hall has an aquarium, which is installed in a recess in the wall.  It has a small but detailed model illustrating underwater excavations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ulkemgazetesi.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Glass room" class="if uuid-2573961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573961.jpg"></div><p>  It presents a lot of fascinating objects and historical memorabilia that have their own history.  Many of the exhibits displayed here have been excavated in shipwrecks and the region. </p><h2>  Amphora Exhibition </h2><p>  An amphora is a simple Roman or Greek jug that is characterized by two handles and a narrow neck.  These bottles were mainly used for transporting products such as olive oil, olives, wine, grain, almonds and many other bulk products intended for transportation. </p><p>  The need for the manufacture of amphora arose when the cargo began to be transported on ships.  In order for the product not to take up much space, the sculptors began to create such cans from clay.  Such dishes have gained wide popularity.  Each manufacturer created its own unique design.  Thanks to this, historians identify amphorae and can determine to which century they belong.  Most of the pitchers were found in the Mediterranean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bodrum.bel.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amphora Exhibition" class="if uuid-2573953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573953.jpg"></div><p>  So that the amphoras would not break, they were tied and tightly stacked to each other.  This made it possible to transport much more goods at the same time and make good profits. </p><p>  Manufacturers left their logos or signatures on the pitcher's handles.  This helped determine where they came from.  For example, if the amphora is of Rhodesian origin, it has a pink print.  An amphora from Koan usually depicts a crab on a handle, and the head of a bull will be imprinted on an amphora from Krimiyans. </p><h2>  Princess Caria's Room </h2><p>  In the room of Princess Caria you can get acquainted with the rich history of Halicarnassus.  The Hekatomnid dynasty ruled Kariya from 392 BC until Alexander the Great with his powerful army captured the country.  Since then, the dynasty has not been able to recover and eventually fell into decay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Princess Caria's Room" class="if uuid-2573942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573942.jpg"></div><p>  In 1989, was discovered in a sarcophagus.  While archaeologists usually use brushes and shovels, an excavator was used here.  A rich woman was buried in the tomb.  This is evidenced by the large number of jewelry and jewelry found next to her.  It is believed that these riches belonged to Queen Ada, but there is no real evidence for this, and it was not possible to find out what kind of woman is in the sarcophagus. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Private or group tours can be booked online or locally.  However, familiarization takes place superficially and quickly.  Most visitors agree that exploring the attraction is better and more interesting on their own.  You will not get lost or get lost, there are signs everywhere. </p><p>  In the museum you can rent an audio guide for 200 rubles, which will tell you about the most interesting events. </p><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  Exhibition halls are closed for viewing on Mondays.  Visiting hours are from 9:00 to 16:30 from Tuesday to Sunday.  There are additional time limits for visitors, so from 12:00 to 13:00 some rooms may be closed.  The chapel and the Tower of England are always open, with no lunch break.  Before visiting, check if the museum or its parts are not closed for restoration work. </p><h2>  Reviews and recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  Having studied the reviews of tourists, we offer you the following recommendations: </p><ul><li>  In summer, St. Peter's Castle is very hot, so you should not visit the museum in the middle of the day. </li><li>  It is impossible to purchase water in the castle, so take your own supplies with you. </li><li>  The ticket price includes a visit to the Museum of Underwater Archeology. </li><li>  Wear comfortable shoes as sightseeing will take a long time. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="franks-travelbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bodrum Museum" class="if uuid-2573933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90272/2573933.jpg"></div><p>  In their comments, tourists note the beauty of the ancient world, its life and culture.
