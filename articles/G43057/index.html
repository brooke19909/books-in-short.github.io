MTPL reviews are rather contradictory, especially since many people did not resort to the help of specialized insurance companies, since it is simply important for them that the insurance policy is always in their glove compartment.  However, many people do not even know how to act after an insured event. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2>

    <p>  When it comes to compulsory insurance, many recall Rosgosstrakh.  Reviews about compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, as well as a wide advertising campaign, made the brand recognizable enough, but many people think about whether they really need this policy and whether it is worth it to draw up in this company. </p><p>  CTP is a compulsory insurance policy for any vehicle owner.  The main feature of this insurance policy is that <span>compensation for damage</span> and loss caused to the vehicle or to the health of its passengers is carried out if the insured person is responsible for the accident.  Rates for this policy are set by the state, and if the driver does not have this policy, then he is forbidden to appear on the road.  In other words, all companies offer (or at least are required to offer) the same cost, and it is not necessary to contact Rosgosstrakh.  Reviews of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance of many other companies are often quite negative, but in principle, now the situation in the insurance business is such that without any problems it is not always possible to get payments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How is payment made? </h2>

    <p>  The most important point that you need to learn about compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is that this policy governs the compensation for damage and losses that you specifically caused to any third parties, be it a vehicle or the life and health of those passengers who were in it.  By insuring your civil liability, in case of guilt, you completely lose any worries regarding the damage caused, and it is this type of insurance that Rosgosstrakh provides.  Reviews about compulsory motor third-party liability insurance indicate that compulsory registration of the policy is quite important, since the losses of an innocent person can be restored as soon as possible. </p><p>  In this case, the <span>car of the insured</span> person, as well as his life, health or property is not protected in any way by this insurance policy.  Compensation of damage incurred by you personally will already be carried out for your money or, in the case of a CASCO policy, by an insurance company.  It is for this reason that there is no reason to doubt whether it is necessary to draw up this policy, it remains only to choose whether to do this in a particular company or go on the offer that the Rosgosstrakh insurance company makes.  Reviews on compulsory motor third-party liability insurance indicate that CASCO in addition should be completed in any case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Any driver must have its own insurance policy, or at least it must be included in such a policy.  This rule is valid even if the car is simply driven from the car dealership to the place of registration, and the only exception in this case are situations where there are no restrictions on the number of persons who can drive the car in the CTP insurance policy, and this option is also provided by the insurance company Rosgosstrakh.  Reviews on this type of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance indicate that, in principle, there is no need for an ordinary car owner. </p><p>  If you do not have your own OSAGO policy, you do not have the right to drive on the road, nor can you even register your car with the traffic police.  Among other things, such a driver expects serious troubles if, in the event of an accident, he simply cannot provide this document. </p><p>  If you are driving a car, you should always have the original of this document with you, regardless of whether it is being drawn up by some other company or Rosgosstrakh.  The reviews on OSAGO payments say that although they can be inferior (whole payments sometimes have to be ‚Äúpulled out‚Äù in lengthy proceedings), it still helps in many ways to solve the problem of the driver or drivers who became participants in an accident through your fault.  If you have a policy, but you just forgot it at home, then in this case the inspector can send your vehicle to a parking lot, from where it can be picked up only if this document is presented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Insurance payments </h2>

    <p>  In accordance with the current legislation, certain standards for compensation for damage to the party that suffered losses due to an accident or the occurrence of any other insured event are fully regulated, that is, in this case, the Rosgosstrakh does not establish the rules.  Reviews on CTP payments indicate that this is not always observed, and often compensation is lower than the corresponding ones. </p><p>  The law establishes the maximum possible limit of payments for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, within the boundaries of which the insurance company will have to fully transfer compensation to the injured person or carry out restoration repairs of the car at its own expense to its original form. </p><p>  Also, in accordance with applicable law, a number of conditions are provided under which damage caused by the fault of the insured person simply cannot be compensated with the help of the Rosgosstrakh insurance policy.  Reviews <span>for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance (Moscow)</span> often say that you need to understand such subtleties in advance in order to demand payment from the insurance company, being confident that you are right. </p><h2>  Term </h2><p>  In the overwhelming majority of cases, compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is issued for one year, but in fact, if necessary, this policy can be issued for a period of three months.  If you have at your disposal a car that has been registered abroad, but at the same time use it in the territory of the Russian Federation, then in this case you should apply for this policy for the period of temporary use of the car (at least 15 days in any company, including Rosgosstrakh).  The insurance company (customer reviews OSAGO - source) may refuse to draw up a policy for a given period and impose a longer period, but in fact you have the right to demand a ‚Äútwo-week‚Äù policy. </p><h2>  Cost </h2>

    <p>  Unlike CASCO, the price of which can vary significantly between companies depending on their pricing policy, the cost of compulsory motor liability insurance is fixed and is determined in accordance with the coefficients and tariffs determined by the state.  In fact, this rule is a guarantee that insurance companies do not have the opportunity to underestimate or overstate the cost of this policy, even if car insurance is compulsory for motor third party liability insurance (Rosgosstrakh).  Reviews say that, in principle, the company meets this requirement, but, as mentioned above, to increase the cost they often obsessively offer to use additional services. </p><p>  MTPL price itself for each specific driver is determined separately, and in this case the brand of the insured car, the driving experience of the owner of the vehicle, the region where the car will be operated, as well as many other calculated points, are taken into account.  For each individual indicator, an individual decreasing or increasing coefficient is established, the volume of which is rather strictly regulated by various government decrees. </p><h2>  How does the policy work? </h2><p>  Initially, the legislation provided for only one calculation option - the injured party, which suffered losses due to an accident through no fault of its own, should have filed an appeal with the insurance company of the person who caused this damage.  However, recently it was decided to make certain changes to the procedure for obtaining insurance compensation so that the procedure for receiving money in the event of an insured event is not so complicated.  In accordance with these amendments, if during the accident there was no harm to human health, and at the same time most of the additional conditions are met, you can apply for compensation for damage to your insurer, since the ‚Äúdirect compensation of losses‚Äù rule works.  In addition, if the damage is not more than 50,000 rubles, then in this case it is not even necessary to call the traffic police, and the so-called European Protocol can be used. </p><p>  Consideration of claims for damages by the insurance company is considered for no more than 20 days, and this is important to consider when filling out the policy, as well as if you have a court with Rosgosstrakh (CTP).  The feedback from the owners of such a policy suggests that often delaying the consideration of the case for too long ultimately leads to the fact that it becomes much easier for the company to sue the payment in full if it previously refused to provide it.  At the same time, do not forget that for each day of delay the insurance company will have to pay a fine of 1/75 of the Central Bank refinancing of the amount of damage caused. </p><p>  The restrictions that are imposed on the top bar of insurance payments often lead to the fact that it cannot cover the entire amount of damage to the MTPL policy of Rosgosstrakh.  Reviews sometimes note that if the consequences of the accident are too destructive, then in this case the whole difference between the damage caused and the payment from the insurance company will have to be restored on its own.  It is for this reason that it is recommended to additionally issue another DSASO policy, which allows you to pay in any situation. </p><h2>  Is it that simple? </h2>

    <p>  At first glance, it seems to many that there are practically no ‚Äúpitfalls‚Äù here compared to CASCO, but in fact, even if this is so, you should not pay any heed to choosing a truly reliable and responsible insurance company, because no one will do it instead of you.  If you suddenly find yourself responsible for an accident, you will need to fully compensate for the damage, and there is no difference in whether the insurer will help you or not - the amount to the injured party should be paid in full, so many people get insurance at Rosgosstrakh.  OSAGO reviews suggest that this procedure should be approached thoroughly if you want really serious help from your insurer in the event of such an event. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the fact that in any case, experts recommend choosing policies with a limited number of people in insurance, as this allows you to significantly save on a policy being issued. </p><h2>  What are the advantages of Rosgosstrakh? </h2><p>  The company itself has been engaged in this field for more than 90 years, therefore, it guarantees extremely affordable and high-quality insurance regardless of what interests you - DSAGO, CASCO or CTP insurance.  Rosgosstrakh, reviews confirm this, in principle, it makes payments almost always, but there are a lot of problems regarding the amount, as well as all kinds of discounts and additional services, the first of which are not taken into account, and the second are imposed, but rarely provided. </p><p>  Recently, the company launched the electronic policy and customer support function.  This is also noted by reviews about the company Rosgosstrakh.  MTPL in this case contains an electronic signature and subsequently will be considered valid in the same way as a standard paper document, it is enough just to print it. </p><h2>  How to issue? </h2>

    <p>  Even if you have previously insured in the company for OSAGO, you can re-purchase this policy by receiving an electronic document through the official website of the company.  Just fill in the data, register in your account and pay for the order, after which you will be provided with an electronic policy.  In addition, the company also provides its customers with the opportunity to execute CTP insurance online, but at the same time receive a paper document later at one of the office representatives in your city. </p><p>  It is worth noting the fact that at the moment the purchase of an online insurance policy with the possibility of a further paper document is provided exclusively for residents of the capital and St. Petersburg, including the regions of these cities. </p><p>  If you‚Äôre not used to using a computer or don‚Äôt prefer this option, then you can visit one of the many offices throughout the country, regardless of which city you are in.  Among other things, the company also provides the service of calling <span>an insurance agent</span> to the office or home, which will answer any of your questions, as well as arrange on-site insurance if necessary.  You can also ask about <span>OSAGO payments in case of an accident</span> (Rosgosstrakh).  Reviews, of course, will tell you more details about the whole procedure, but you can find out the basic rules from the agent, as well as read the features of the contract you are drawing up. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, when making out insurance, you do not just get some paper, but you have the right to receive payment in the event that you become the culprit of the accident.  The company's online service allows you to make this process as comfortable and fast as possible, because through your account on the official website you can always check the status of the payout case or make a statement that an insured event has occurred. </p><h2>  Useful legislative changes </h2>

    <p>  There are several useful legislative changes that need to be taken into account during the policy process: </p><ul><li>  the maximum possible damage to property is 400,000 rubles, but this rule applies only to those contracts that were drawn up after October 1, 2014; </li><li>  the maximum possible harm to health or life after an accident reaches 500,000 rubles, but this norm is relevant only for contracts drawn up after 01.04.2015; </li><li>  reimbursement can be requested from your insurance company if only two people are involved in the accident, and the damage was caused exclusively to vehicles, while in other situations you will have to go directly to the insurance company of the person who is responsible for the accident; </li><li>  the maximum possible amount of damage for which it is possible to contact the insurance company without having to call the traffic police is 50,000 rubles if both drivers' OSAGO agreements were concluded after 2.08.2014; </li><li>  the deadline for resolving all issues after receipt of the application is 20 days, and the countdown begins immediately after the provision of a full package of documentation, and during this period the company must send a reasoned refusal, provide a direction for repair or make a payment; </li><li>  if the insurance company has an agreement with a professional technical service station, then in this case the victim has the opportunity to choose between direct cash payment, as well as sending his vehicle for repair in the event that he entered into the MTPL agreement after 1.09.2014. </li></ul><p>  These rules apply even if you are not issuing OSAGO in a company other than Rosgosstrakh.  Customer reviews suggest that compliance with each individual rule will need to be monitored as closely as possible so that in the event of any legal proceedings it would be much easier for you to assert your case. </p><p>  MTPL policy itself is mandatory, so you will need to issue it in any case, regardless of whether you choose Rosgosstrakh or any other company.  In this case, it is important to decide in order to choose a truly reliable insurer who will be ready to understand in each individual case and pay money in accordance with the law. </p><p>  In any case, it is recommended to buy policies only at truly well-known companies, as statistics have shown that approximately 2% of the total number of policies are fake (source - Rosgosstrakh, CTP, OMSK).     ,               ,      ,    -        . </p><p>         ,            . </p><p>  ,      ,        .          . </p>
