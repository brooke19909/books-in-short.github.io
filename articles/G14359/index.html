  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet on the phone through the computer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the Internet on the phone through a computer is a very common phenomenon.  For high-quality and uninterrupted operation of devices, it is necessary to make their competent connection.  Moreover, to connect phones and computers, users use a cable or "bluetooth", the inclusion of which is carried out in the mobile device itself. </p><p>  After connecting the phone, on the computer, go to the "Start" menu, then to "Settings", from there - to the "Control Panel", where you need to find the line "Phone and Modem".  Having selected "Modem", click "Add." </p><p>  To install the Internet on the phone through a computer, you must install a modem (in this case, the role of the mobile phone).  The installation process can be performed using a boot disk (if it is included with the telephone or cable) or a file containing the installation drivers. </p><p>  The next installation step is to select the desired modem from the list, in accordance with the model of the mobile device.  When you click "Next", the system will provide a choice of port on which to install the modem.  Typically, this is COM 1. In some situations, a window may appear on the screen warning of possible incompatibility between the modem and the installed operating system.  In most cases, users ignore this information and click the "Next" button.  At the same time, the system displays a message about the successful installation of the modem, which indicates that all the previous steps have been completed correctly.  Next, click "Finish" and proceed with the settings. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before proceeding, it is recommended that you check the connection again.  After that it is necessary to open ‚ÄúModems‚Äù in the menu ‚ÄúToolbars‚Äù.  Having selected an already installed device, you should enter its properties.  In the "Advanced communication parameters" an additional initialization command is specified.  In accordance with the instructions in the user manual, the necessary information is entered. </p><p>  To configure the Internet connection on the phone through a computer, you must create a new connection in the network connection menu.  To ensure proper (stable) operation, the system provides for a ‚Äúsetup wizard‚Äù.  In this open window, the line ‚ÄúConnect to the Internet‚Äù should be noted, after clicking the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button, you need to make a manual connection.  In order for the Internet connection on the phone through the computer to go smoothly, the settings must be made in accordance with the information contained on the websites of telecom operators. </p><p>  Communication parameters may vary depending on the type of connection, the operator, as well as the brand of the cell phone.  Many users often have difficulty trying to set up the Internet on a Chinese phone.  Before starting the action to change existing and introduce new parameters, you need to make sure that the Internet connection service is connected and available.  Depending on the mobile service provider, the parameters of the new profile are entered.  To do this, open the "Services" folder in the phone menu, in which there is a "Profile" tab. </p><p>  To get unlimited (within the operator‚Äôs services) opportunities for accessing the Network via a mobile device, there is a ‚Äúunlimited Internet to phone‚Äù service.  At the same time, users are given the opportunity to use a high connection speed.  However, as a rule, tariff plans provide for some traffic restrictions.  You can use an unlimited Internet connection only within the region of connection.  For international and intranet roaming, this service does not apply. </p>
