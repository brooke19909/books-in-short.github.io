    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The foundation of Kirillovka happened 200 years ago.  In 1805, Dukhobor sectarians, forcibly evicted from the Voronezh and Tambov provinces, settled on these lands.  The village was named in honor of its first resident - Cyril Kapustin.  In 1838, there were already 130 people here. </p><p>  However, in connection with the demand of the clergy, who was afraid of an adverse effect on the life of the flock, they were forced to leave the house.  From 1841 to 1843  these people gradually moved to the Caucasus.  Since 1864, Cossacks belonging to the Azov army stayed here.  Thanks to them, protection was carried out during the Crimean War. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1890, peasant Nalivaiko collected mud samples from the estuary and handed over to the doctors of the province.  After revealing the healing properties in them, it was decided to open a small mud bath near the Dairy Estuary.  Subsequently, the resort grew and attracted more and more attention of people. </p>
