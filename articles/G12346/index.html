But the fact that along the Yenisei from the shores of the Arctic Ocean to the borders with China for centuries lived the Tungus, explains the fact that there are only seven rivers called Tunguska. </p><h2>  The amazing popularity of the name "Tunguska" </h2><p>  And there are four more rivers, in the name of which there is a characterizing adjective - Podkamennaya Tunguska, Upper and two Lower, one of which is the old name of the Angara.  In the southern part of the <span>Central Siberian Plateau</span> there is a natural region called Tunguska. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stony tunguska" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/447627.jpg" width="450"></div>  The same name bears the <span>anti-aircraft gun-missile system.</span>  <span>Krasnoyarsk airport</span> is known as the ‚ÄúStone Tunguska‚Äù. It is impossible to ignore the <span>Tunguska meteorite</span> and the ‚ÄúBrazilian Tunguska‚Äù, a celestial body that fell in this country of South America, and named so because of its similarity with its Siberian counterpart.  Tunguska is a very popular name, even in the X-Files series.

    <h2>  Some geographic data </h2><p>  The right <span>tributary of the Yenisei</span> is called Podkamennaya Tunguska, as well as the Middle Tunguska, Chulkan and Katanga.  The basin area is estimated at 240,000 square kilometers, the length reaches 1865 km.  Its source is located on the Upper Tunguska Upland, and the Central Siberian Plateau with the natural region of Tunguska, this river crosses from the Angara Ridge in the south to the Yenisei in the west.  In 1908, a meteorite fell 80 kilometers north of the village of Vanavara.  Naturally, he was called Tunguska, because everything was named around him - the region, the river, the population.  The Podkamennaya Tunguska is navigable for 1,146 km, despite numerous rifts and rapids.  Some thresholds even have personal names. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Personalized Beauties </h2>

    <p>  So, the most significant of them are called Bolshoi, Muchnaya, and also the Polygus and Velminsky rapids.  The river itself and its banks are so beautiful that there is a list of locations whose names are very eloquent.  Here there is a Coast of tall grass and Dark waters, Fish Eldorado and Taiga summer, as well as Spruce Island and Tunguska expanse, Calm channel and Rocky sandbank.  Still there is Rocky Mountain and Transparent waters.  Not every river can boast of it.  The melting of the snow helps to fill the river mainly, although summer and autumn rains also contribute to severe floods (there are from one to four per year), in some years there are floods.  The river freezes from October to May, in which, as a rule, there are always floods.  Ice drifts take a decent time - 18 days in the fall and 9 in the spring.  This is scary because of the power of the river, and beautiful.  "The night is bright, light in the area, as if floating across the sky - on the wide blue stretches - silvery broken ice!" </p><h2>  The originality of the river </h2>

    <p>  Stony Tunguska is very diverse.  In the upper reaches it has a rather wide and deep valley, then, cutting through the outcrops of rocks (they are called traps), the river forms narrow gorges.  Traps, for centuries blown by winds that carry away particles of rocks, form characteristic pillars (Red Coast location).  In some places, the current reaches a speed of 3-4 centimeters per second.  Like the rivers of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the described water flow has tributaries.  Right are Tetere, Chula and Plague.  To the left are Como and Velmo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The wealth of the Podkamennaya Tunguska is not inferior to beauty </h2>

Fishing competitions are often held here, because more than 30 species of fin river inhabitants are found in this river.  You can‚Äôt list all of them, but this river in Siberia is famous for grayling, legendary pike, burbot and crucian carp, tugun and lenok, dace and minnow.  Here, ide and ruff are found in huge numbers, and the tributaries are full of lenok and grayling.  Since the freeze-up on the Siberian waterways is famous for its fortress, and its duration is long because of frosts, local residents are actively engaged in ice fishing, and since burbot accumulates under winter cover, it forms the basis of the fish table.  The Podkamennaya Tunguska River is generally famous for the amount of burbot in its waters both in winter and in summer.

    <h2>  Tourist prospects </h2><p>  <span>Fishing in Siberia</span> deserves separate words and praises, and not necessarily foreign ones, such as Eldorado and Safari.  But maybe they will attract lovers of comfortable fishing, because there are a lot of places for wild relaxation.  ‚ÄúOn Podkamennaya Tunguska, ice shores the coast - cuts fir, knocks trees, climbs with chest to meadows!‚Äù  An infinite number of poems and songs are composed about this river, as well as about the <span>nature of Siberia</span> in general.  They are all good, and they do not embellish reality with a single word, because there are not enough words to describe at least part of the beauty and grandeur of Siberia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="river in siberia" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/447634.jpg" width="553"></div>  Every year, there are more and more people who want to see this with their own eyes.  And, of course, because of its fame, the Podkamennaya Tunguska is popular.  A map showing at what distance from the same airport this beautiful river is located is attached.  It should be noted the attractiveness of the river for active tourist recreation - rafting on the river in kayaks and rafts.  There are several places on the river for this, and the total length of the waterway suitable for this sport is 550 km.  The rafting is designed for 16 days, complexity category 3.  The best place on the river for these purposes is the lower reaches.  You can stay in the village of Baikita, where there is a bakery and a shop.  A section of the river 120 km between this village and the next, Polygus, is the most picturesque place on the whole Podkamennaya Tunguska.
