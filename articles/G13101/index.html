    <p>  The most popular are the ultrasound models of Panasonic cameras, since they differ in small dimensions and the possibility of a 30-fold increase.  Equally popular are cameras with an inch matrix, which during tests show excellent image quality that matches the level of system models. </p><p>  For those who prefer cameras with the best quality, there are DSLM models.  They are equipped with a large matrix and can work with interchangeable lenses.  The Panasonic Lumix mirrorless cameras use the Micro Four Thirds system.  Devices from the Panasonic company show excellent results based on the results of numerous tests.  In this review of Panasonic cameras, the most popular and best camera models are presented. </p><h2>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH4 </h2><p>  <span>System camera</span> "Panasonic", which will appeal to more videographers than photographers.

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The main competitive advantages of the Panasonic digital camera of this model are: </p><ul><li>  the ability to record video in 4K format with Full HD and a frequency of 24 frames / s bit rate of 200 Mbps; </li><li>  image output with a 4: 2: 2 color sampling and a 10-bit picture to external recording devices; </li><li>  the use of an optional handle that adds specialized connectors for professional peripheral accessories; </li><li>  additional options that simplify the setup of the camera when recording video, adjusting and controlling the audio signal during the subsequent installation of the footage. </li></ul><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Panasonic's magnesium housing is reliable and compact in size, despite the fact that its design is designed as a pseudo-analogue of a DSLR.  The DMC-GH4 model maintains a leading position in a number of parameters, not inferior to the full-frame <span>Sony A7S</span> that appeared relatively recently <span>.</span>  The powerful computing electronics used in the model contributed to a significant increase in the speed of serial photography to 12 frames per second;  The duration of the series in RAW format is 40 frames.  Memory cards for the Panasonic camera of this model require productive and expensive ones related to the UIHC-I third class.  The sharpening system was improved, which made it possible to increase the rate of fire in the tracking focus mode to 7.5 frames / s and shorten the time interval between shutter release and pressing the shutter button, avoiding losses in the accuracy of aiming. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-G6 </h2><p>  In many respects, the DMC-G6 camera does not reach a serious model for professional photographers.  According to the reviews on the Panasonic camera of this model, we can say that it is surprising only in cost compared to competitors: the price is almost similar to the basic camera models. </p>

    <h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  The DMC-G6 will be a very pleasant and useful acquisition for amateurs, but not for professionals.  Older mirrorless models bypass it significantly in speed.  But few competitors can offer recording with locked focus at a speed of 7 frames per second and with tracking - 5 frames per second.  The camera does not have a hybrid AF that is relevant today, but the standard contrast focusing system does its job perfectly. </p><p>  For those who consider usability to be the main requirement for a camera, the pseudo-mirror format is a real salvation.  Compared to the Panasonic Panasonic DMC FZ8 camera, the keys, switches and levers on the case are much smaller, which, however, does not affect the speed of access to the main functions and the comfort of control.  The functional tools of the model are huge and complemented by a large number of scene modes, software filters and photo editing tools - those tools that are very popular among amateurs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rotary capacitive touch screen boasts a good resolution.  The viewfinder differs from the analogue in the previous model in both the size and clarity of the displayed image. </p><p>  For most fans, the capabilities of the G6 in video mode will be more than enough.  The maximum shooting frequency is 60 frames per second.  Movies are recorded in Full HD format with progressive scan.  You can use various PASM exposure control modes and configure other video recording options.  In its price category, the DMC G6 is a truly unique camera from Panasonic. </p><h2>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX7 </h2><p>  Panasonic designers launched the DMC-GX7 before the GM series, using it as a test case in an attempt to work out solutions that would create a series of cameras with an original design.  A solid and reliable camera body is made of <span>magnesium alloy.</span>  Less - with compact dimensions, the camera is too heavy.  The very high cost of the Panasonic camera of this model is justified more by unusual structural features, materials used and workmanship, than by characteristics and functions. </p>

    <h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  An electronic built-in viewfinder that rotates 90 degrees up is the original design solution of the Panasonic designs.  Thanks to this unusual solution, the number of angles that can be arranged in the frame has increased significantly.  But this is in theory: in practice, it is more convenient to use a touch screen with a mechanism for adjusting the angle of inclination.  The camera display is clear, large, in bright sunshine does not glare and does not shine. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Among all Panasonic cameras, the DMC-GX7 model became the first "system" in which a stabilization system is used due to matrix displacement.  The manufacturer claims that it can work with any optics and is highly efficient when shooting video due to the large amplitude of vibrations.  The user can independently choose a mechanism after installing optics with a built-in vibration reduction system.  The micro 4/3 system, thanks to its small working distance and small sensor format, is compatible with many lenses using special adapters.  The vibration reduction system will be very useful for those who prefer retro optics. </p><p>  In addition to the spectacular and original design, the camera is equipped with a good set of functions.  From other models in the GX7 lineup, I got the option to set the shutter speed so that you can use large aperture holes when shooting in bright sunshine in order to obtain the minimum DOF.  The camera received focus - picking - the backlight function on the image of contrasting borders.  This option is very useful when manually focusing.  In addition, when shooting in JPEG, the camera offers a tone curve adjustment tool. </p><h2>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM1 </h2><p>  In the Lumix GM series, this model was the first and immediately reminded consumers of the main advantage of system cameras - the small size that is missed by many modern manufacturers.  One of the best Panasonic cameras is a real baby: GM1 fits easily in a jacket or jacket pocket, and together with a pancake lens it can be hidden in a trouser pocket.  Compared to competitors of a much smaller format, the model wins in weight and size.  At the same time, it has other advantages besides small dimensions. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits of GM1 </h2><p>  The camera body is made of magnesium alloy and has a thickness of 3 cm. Panasonic designers managed to squeeze a 16-megapixel 4/3 format sensor, micro 4/3 bayonet mount, an improved mechanical shutter, a 3-inch touch screen and a pop-up flash into such a small device.  On the upper edge of the housing is a mode dial, a functionally programmable button and a lever for selecting focus modes. </p><p>  GM1 almost completely repeats the GX7 in the number of photographic functions and modes.  The electronic and software filling of the baby was improved, so that she acquired new opportunities.  Functions are available for automatically compiling cartoons from several photographs, recording time-lapse video ‚Äî a set of frames made with a large interval and reproduced at normal speed.  The amateur photographer will benefit from a wide variety of software effects and filters. </p><p>  The shutter mounted in the camera uses a small stepper motor, combined with a shutter mechanism.  He is able to work out shutter speeds up to 1/500 s.  The electronic shutter is responsible for shorter exposure times - up to 1/16 000 s.  In burst mode, the maximum speed is 40 frames per second without autofocus lock. </p><p>  The disadvantages include the small <span>battery</span> capacity <span>for the</span> Panasonic GM1 <span>camera</span> - only 650 mA * h.  The manufacturer claims that the battery lasts for shooting 230 frames, however, the use of complex video recording modes will quickly discharge it. </p><h2>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM5 </h2><p>  Panasonic based on the GM1 camera has created a series of compact mirrorless cameras.  The GM5 model did not become a replacement for the previous model and only continued the line, taking the place of a kind of flagship of the Lumix system devices. </p>

    <p>  GM1 is somewhat inferior to the novelty in size, which is explained by the introduction of an electronic viewfinder.  It has its own advantages: proximity sensor, focus activation function, significant removal of the exit pupil, adjust contrast, brightness and saturation, play Adobe RGB space.  The dimensions of the viewfinder are small, as well as the resolution of the built-in liquid crystal matrix. </p><p>  The increase in body size has a positive effect on the usability of the camera.  The free space under the screen was filled with a wheel for selecting shooting parameters and two function keys.  On the top edge of the camera there is a small ledge in which there is a ‚Äúhot shoe‚Äù for an external flash.  This innovation is not particularly relevant, especially considering the fact that the electronic viewfinder has replaced the flicker blitz.  Complete with GM5 is a compact flash DW-FL70, which does a good job of highlighting the plots. </p><p>  Panasonic developers did not change the electronic insides of the camera, but taught them new tricks.  The read speed from the matrix was doubled, which positively affected the hybrid type autofocus reaction.  Burst speed increased by a whole frame.  The processor performs quite complex real-time image processing: special creative effects can be used when recording videos and shooting panoramic pictures, and not just when shooting ordinary photos.  An improved scan method has improved the quality of movie recording to Full HD. </p><h2>  Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF6 </h2><p>  For familiarization with the micro 4/3 system, the Panasonic GF6 is ideal.  The model has become the ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù in the ratio of cost and parameters.  The manufacturer did not reduce the functionality of the camera, reduce the cost of the design or resort to obsolete components.  Despite the fact that the relevance of technology and hardware is not a strong point of the GF6, the camera fully meets all the requirements of users. </p>

    <h2>  Interface and Functions </h2><p>  The intuitive and convenient interface will come in handy for those people who have not handled anything more complicated than classic "soap dishes".  The Venus Engine processor, coupled with a 16 megapixel sensor, guarantee a good level of detail, effective noise reduction and excellent color reproduction.  The touch screen displays a high definition image.  The tilt mechanism facilitates the process of cropping photos. </p><p>  The camera display rotates up 180 ¬∞ to shoot in self portrait mode.  Any pictures can be instantly published on the Web thanks to the Wi-Fi interface.  NFC technology greatly simplifies the process of setting up a connection. </p><p>  The camera body lost all the extra controls, but got a lever for controlling the zoom.  The camera is equipped with a compact zoom lens equipped with a motorized zoom.  The camera body is plastic with small metal inserts. </p>
