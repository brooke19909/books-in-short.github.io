  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami tiger from modules or origami format 3d</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Funny paper crafts are known everywhere.  But only the Japanese folding an ordinary paper sheet to create figures from it, raised to the level of art.  Even the word "origami", meaning this process, has become a household word, bearing in itself the beauty and mystery of true creativity.  For the Japanese, the combination of ancient traditions and modern technology is a natural phenomenon that applies to all aspects of life.  This trend also affected paper modeling.  If earlier a tiger made using the origami technique was flat and sketchy, then using the modular origami method it really becomes like a real volumetric toy.  This is probably why <span>modular origami,</span> jokingly called "3d origami", has become a very fashionable direction in creating paper models of animals and <span>fairy-tale characters.</span> </p><p>  Modular origami differs from ordinary in that graceful figures are assembled from a variety of parts (modules), each of which is composed of a separate sheet.  Mostly the modules are triangular in shape, but not required.  All parts are connected by inserting one module into another and are held <span>by friction.</span>  Creating an origami tiger from modules is a complex, painstaking, but surprisingly fascinating business.  For work, it is desirable to use modules in two colors: orange and black.  Then the tiger becomes brighter and more characteristic.  There are many interesting, and sometimes unique patterns and instructions on <span>how to make an origami</span> tiger.  But often, using them, it is not always possible to create an acceptable design. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The best option is to first develop modeling skills on simpler types of modular origami, and then proceed to something more serious.  A rather simple is the paper folding pattern of the headgear-mask in the form of a tiger.  Besides the fact that it is simply beautiful, such a hat can also be used as part of a New Year's costume.  All parts (modules) in this circuit are connected in a ring.  One module will represent the face of the tiger, the rest are needed to hold the mask on the head. </p><p>  In order to fold a tiger origami headgear from modules, you need to make three squares from a sheet of <span>paper of</span> A4 <span>size</span> orange color.  In addition to them, you will need another square with a length and width of 19 centimeters.  It is advisable that all sheets be painted only on one side.  Further, each of the three large squares is folded in half diagonally, and the upper and lower corners are bent to the center of the figure, after which the workpiece is turned over.  The upper part of the part descends to the central horizontal, and the lower, on the contrary, rises with the rear triangles being pulled out.  The bottom corner is folded so that its top is in the center of the figure.  Similar actions are done with the upper angle.  All three ready-made modules are connected in one strip.  The face of the origami tiger from the modules will be the middle part. </p><p>  A triangle is formed from the remaining small square, and then it is bent in half.  Lateral corners are bent towards the middle, but so that they do not reach it.  Sharp corners drop - these are the ears.  The right angle must be bent so that the fold line extends from one ear to the other and after that the workpiece is turned over.  The head is glued to the middle module of the base of the mask.  Eyes, nose and stripes on the head are performed by the application technique.  After connecting all the details into a ring, the origami tiger mask from the modules is ready. </p><p>  Even the creation of such a simple origami model requires special concentration and patience, but at the same time this type of creativity activates the work of both hemispheres of the brain, being an excellent means of development. </p>
