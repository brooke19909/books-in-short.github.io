    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Before finding out which sea in Marmaris in Turkey is more suitable for families with children, and which is better for drivers to choose, we will introduce one interesting legend.  So, the locals say that the name Marmaris comes from the phrase in Turkish “Mimara as,” which translates as “hang the builder.”  It was uttered by the notorious Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who was furious when he saw what an unprepossessing fortress was erected instead of the powerful citadel ordered by him. </p><p>  In fairness, it should be said that the history of the city began long before the Ottoman Turks appeared in these parts.  The founding date of Fiskos, and it was this name that the Greeks gave him, remains unknown.  However, there are historical documents that indicate that the city conducted intensive trade with its neighbors in the 11th century BC.  e.  Later, the Persians owned it.  In the 1st century BC  e.  he moved to Rome, and then became part of the Byzantine Empire.  At the end of the 14th century, the Ottoman Turks captured and plundered it.  However, the final accession to their empire occurred only after 30 years.  A century later, a convenient bay attracted the attention of Suleiman the Magnificent, who wished to build a fortress on its shore. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1957, Marmaris was badly damaged by the earthquake.  Its restoration dragged on for more than 20 years, until in the early 80s it was decided to turn this section of the Turkish coast into a modern resort. </p><p>  As a result of large-scale construction there appeared a lot of hotels and entertainment venues, which annually host hundreds of thousands of vacationers, including from Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Natural attractions in the vicinity of the resort </h2><p>  Which sea washes Marmaris in Turkey?  This question can often be heard from tourists.  As already mentioned, this resort is a unique place where there are many natural attractions.  The main one, of course, is the confluence of the two seas.  If you want a unique opportunity to swim immediately in the Aegean and the Mediterranean, then just go along the coast towards the town of Dalaman, where the international airport closest to Marmaris is located.  On the way, you will notice that the water off the coast begins to get cloudy.  This means that you are at a meeting place for the quiet waters of the Mediterranean and the lush streams of the Aegean. </p><p>  In addition, tourists are advised to visit Pamukkale.  It is often called the "eighth wonder of the world."  There, from high rocky ledges, waters rich in mineral salts fall.  At the same time, each terrace has a small pool with a water temperature that is held at +37 degrees Celsius. </p><h2>  Other excursions </h2><p>  As for historical sights, not far from Marmaris is the <span>city ​​of Ephesus,</span> where John the Theologian spent the last years of his life.  It was there that he wrote the Gospel, as well as 3 conciliar epistles.  In Ephesus, you can wander through the four-thousand-year-old streets, see the richest ancient library, get acquainted with the decor of the house of the patricians, Roman baths and the house of tolerance.  There are also the ruins of the Temple of Aphrodite, the stands of amphitheaters, as well as the foundations of ancient houses preserved in the city of Knidos. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  <span>Which sea in Marmaris</span> in Turkey to go?  Such a question may seem strange only to those who are not familiar with geography.  Since the resort merges two seas at once, this circumstance may become decisive when choosing a hotel.  In addition, in Marmaris there are hotels that are designed for young people and options that are more suitable for families. </p><p>  In particular, hotels designed for "party people" are located directly in Marmaris, where most of the bars and discos are located.  As for club hotels, such establishments can be found in the villages of Turunc and Hisaronu, as well as in the park area between Icmeler and Marmaris. </p>
