    <p>  Greece, washed by five seas, is one of the most popular holiday destinations for many tourists from all over the world.  The tourism sector is the main source of state revenue.  A country with an ancient history is interesting for travelers with its historical and cultural heritage, beach holidays and gastronomic traditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Greece, developed tourist infrastructure, offering its guests hotels of any level of service, which are located both on the mainland and on the islands. </p><p>  It should be noted that the <span>classification of hotels is</span> slightly different from general standards.  That is why it is sometimes quite difficult to talk about the rating of hotels in Greece, using the usual "star" classification. </p><p>  The fact is that here the level of service is indicated by the Latin alphabet: from class L, analog 5 *, to E - 1-2 *.  Sometimes stardom does not matter, and in hotels of category E the service is even better than in hotels of class C (level 3 *).  That is, it turns out that, taking into account, say, the rating of all-inclusive hotels in Greece, you need to look not at the categories, but at the reviews of former guests.  This, as practice shows, is actually more reliable. </p><p>  When planning your vacation in high season, you should pre-book hotels.  This is especially true of the popular islands of Greece, where not only tourists, but also local residents rest.  Although, frankly, there are always a lot of vacationers, even in the cold season. </p><p>  Many people mistakenly believe that, without having an impressive amount of money, there is no point in looking at the rating of hotels in Greece 5 *.  In vain ... After all, no matter what, in this country you can always find cheaper options that match any, even seemingly the most modest, family budget. </p><h2>  Section 2. Pensions in Greece </h2>

Hotels in Greece ... The rating (reviews once again confirms this) is constantly changing, so it all depends on the owners of rental housing or rented a room. </p><p>  In cities, they usually offer separate rooms-apartments (2-3 beds) with a shower room, and in the provinces - houses with all amenities.  In these rooms you can live independently or addicted to someone. </p><p>  The cost of living is quite acceptable and commensurate with the level of the "upper D-class" (30-40 euros per night), often discounts and offers are made.  Those who really want to save money should visit the rating of 3 star hotels in Greece before the trip.  A suitable option, as a rule, is always found. </p><p>  In large cities, prices depend on the level of service, seasonality and location.  Here are a few examples: in C-class hotels (analogue 3 *) apartment prices range from 40 to 60 euros (in summer - 60-85 euros), B-class (4 *) - 85-110 euros (in summer - from 110 Euro and above). </p><h2>  Section 3.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can often find out about the rating of the best hotels in Greece from those who are already fortunate enough to visit this state.  Experienced travelers in most cases are happy to share information, their observations and thoughts. </p><p>  However, not everyone knows that camping at this resort is also widespread.  Such special venues are open from April to October.  It should be remembered that parking in unallocated places is strictly prohibited.  Of course, in this case we are not talking about the rating of hotels in Greece, but in fact it will be possible to save. </p><p>  Accommodation in a camping house for one night will cost a tourist 5-7 euros, a tent costs even less.  The location of such parking is always indicated on tourist maps. </p><p>  Hostels in this country are not as common as campsites.  Five youth hostels work in Athens during the year, two are open in Santorini and one each in Ios, Paros and Corfu.  All hostels are members of the International Hostel Federation of Athens. </p><p>  True, such institutions operate only in the spring-summer period.  Usually the cost of an overnight stay is 7-9 euros (per person). </p><p>  Some Greek monasteries also host travelers.  This applies mainly to monasteries on the mainland, and on the islands they are closed for living.  Here you should adhere to certain rules - observe the decency in clothing and daily routines.  Cohabitation of men and women from among tourists in monasteries is prohibited. </p><h2>  Section 4. Features of hotel accommodation </h2>

    <p>  Of course, the rating of hotels in Greece has a certain value for tourists.  For example, in hotels of a higher class, the territory is larger, the food is more diverse, the entertainment program is more interesting.  However, do not forget about the framework of decency.  On the territory of the hotel they don‚Äôt litter, after 22:00 they behave quietly, and smoke only in specially designated places. </p><p>  Tours to Greece are popular with tourists from all over the world.  But even here you can always find budget options not only in the provinces, but also in large cities and resorts.  Local mid-range hotels offer rooms with small bathrooms or showers.  The furnishings in simple rooms are very modest, but almost everyone has a balcony or a common veranda.  Double rooms usually come with two separate single beds.  Single apartments will cost only 30% cheaper than double rooms. </p><p>  A 4 star hotel rating in Greece suggests that the rooms in the more popular hotels are always air-conditioned.  The only exceptions are old buildings, which are always cool.  Cheap hotel rooms often lack telephones, but almost always have televisions.  True, there are very few channels, and all programs are in Greek. </p><p>  The main inconvenience that tourists may encounter is the noise from vehicles and nightclubs.  More quiet places need to be chosen on the outskirts of the city and in the countryside. </p><p>  All hotels must have price lists for all services.  These rules are spelled out in Greek law.  If the price indicated in the price list is overstated, guests have the right to inform the local police or tourist office.  This is considered a violation of the law and measures will be taken against the owners of the hotel. </p><h2>  Section 5. Greece is health.  Example SPA Hotel </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted that often the rating of all-inclusive hotels in Greece is of great interest to those who want to forget about all the troubles, problems and deeds and just switch, becoming, as they say, part of another world. </p><p>  This category of travelers in most cases also seeks to improve their health.  We give an example of a typical hotel, which will justify the expectations of all, even the most moody, vacationers. </p><p>  Oceania Club &amp; Spa 5 *, located in the Aegean Sea on the Halkidiki Peninsula, is considered the center of beach holidays and is one of the most popular hotels in Greece.  The quality of service meets the highest international standards. </p><p>  The hotel is located in a picturesque corner, surrounded by coniferous forests and olive plantations.  The entire coast of the peninsula, with a length of more than 500 km, is indented with coves and shallow bays.  Water here warms up by May to +23 degrees and by September reaches +25 ¬∞ C.

    <p>  Sometimes it begins to seem that the rating of <span>hotels in Greece (Rhodes,</span> Crete, Thessaloniki and others) is more or less the same.  In principle, this is true.  They say that the locals are unusually hospitable, and therefore they will do everything possible to make the traveler feel at home in their country. </p><p>  We give one more example. </p><p>  Dessole Malia Beach 4 * was built in the late 70s of the last century and partially renovated in 2014.

    <p>  No wonder they say that the rating of hotels in Greece (Rhodes, Crete, Halkidiki, etc.) does not matter much.  Why?  The answer suggests itself.  The fact is that, in spite of the so-called ‚Äústardom‚Äù, rest here simply cannot but appeal to both young and adult travelers. </p><p>  Hotel Amnissos 3 * is located next to the coastal city of Rethymnon, which has an ancient history.  The hotel was built in 1987 and renovated in 2011. </p><p>  To date, the hotel complex consists of 2-story bungalows.  The hotel area is very well-groomed and surrounded by lush vegetation: there are palm and <span>fruit gardens,</span> green lawns and flower beds.  For adults, show programs and sports venues are open, there is WI-Fi, mini-golf, billiards, a pool, a restaurant.  Children spend leisure time on the playground or in the kids club, in the pool, and in the evening have fun at the mini-disco. </p><p>  The rooms of two categories - Double Room (up to 3 people) and Family Room Open Plan (up to 4 people) are equipped with everything necessary.  It has a bathroom, balcony or terrace.  Hotel services include: WI-FI, iron, parking, luggage room and TV room.  Pebble beach, located across the road, 150 m from the hotel.  Beach accessories - for a fee. </p><h2>  Section 9. Rental housing </h2>

    <p>  If suddenly, and this also happens, you did not like the full rating of hotels in Greece, Crete, as well as many places in the country, can provide a house or a room for rent, which is actually an alternative to hotel accommodation. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that such services are provided not only by private owners and companies, but also hotel chains, offering in addition to hotels studios with kitchens and even whole apartments.  Apart-hotels sometimes open near hotels. </p><p>  In some resort areas, whole streets of houses intended for rental are built.  Private houses are also for rent.  The lack of some amenities is offset by the price of accommodation and the hospitality of the owners.  Before check-in and payment, you should inspect all rooms.  Homes for rent are marked with the inscription ENIKIAZOMENA DHOMATIA. </p><p>  In quiet areas, you can rent an apartment or studio.  Renting an apartment will cost about 100 euros (people).  The studio usually consists of a room with a sink, stove and refrigerator, sometimes there is a balcony or TV.  Free meals are not provided for guests. </p><p>  Tourists who prefer a luxurious vacation can afford to rent a villa on the beach.  And for romantic natures, a comfortable village house is probably perfect. </p><h2>  Section 10. When to wait for discounts? </h2>

    <p>  The cost of living depends on the seasonality and location of housing.  The lowest prices are from October to May.  During this period, discounts reach up to 50%.  From mid-July to September, peak season sets in in Greece and prices are rising.  From June to half of July, housing is 20-30% cheaper.  At this time it is better to book rooms in advance. </p><p>  Prices also rise on Easter and Christmas.  Many hotels in winter can be closed, and it‚Äôs easier to rent an apartment or a house. </p>
