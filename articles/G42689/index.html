What mysterious meaning is laid in this ceremony? </h2><p>  A wedding is one of the seven sacraments of the Christian church.  This is the conclusion of a union between two people in the face of the Lord.  Also called a wedding "church marriage" or "church marriage." </p>

    <p>  When to go through this ceremony is a personal choice for each couple.  You can get married right after the ceremony at the registry office, or you can wait a while.  In any case, it should be remembered that before the <span>wedding in the church, the</span> newlyweds are asked to show a certificate of registration of marriage.  Before determining the date of the sacrament, it is necessary to study the wedding calendar for the current year, since this can be done far from any day, as many newlyweds believe. </p><h2>  Wedding dress </h2><p>  Each girl is beautiful on her wedding day, but the bride in a lace cape is gentle, beautiful and doubly mysterious.  <span>A scarf on the head</span> for the wedding sets off the beauty of the bride and groom and emphasizes the solemnity of the moment.  Since ancient times, this accessory, simple and elegant at the same time, has been a symbol of modesty, purity and femininity of the bride. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you have to fasten your union with sacred ties in a church or cathedral, then be sure to consider a wedding scarf as an excellent alternative to a veil.  He will be able to create a truly unforgettable image that will correspond to all the traditions of Orthodoxy. </p>

    <h2>  Let's talk about a wedding dress </h2><ul><li>  Color.  White color of a wedding dress is a tradition that came to us from European countries.  In Russia, one could get married in clothes of any color.  The only rule that was observed: the outfit was supposed to be light enough, it should not have brightness and variegation.  You should not choose too gloomy and dark dresses in black, dark purple, dark brown shades.  All other colors are quite appropriate. </li><li>  Length.  The wedding dress should not be above the knee.  Catholic tradition is outfits with a long train.  Church attendants are unlikely to condemn the bride in a similar dress, but it is better to pay tribute to the Orthodox traditions and do without a train. </li><li>  The style of a wedding dress can be any, but it is better for the bride to prefer a closed one.  An ideal option would be an outfit with long sleeves, a shallow neckline and with a closed back.  The sleeve may be short, but the main rule is to close the back and shoulders.  You cannot enter a cathedral or church with a bare back or a deep neckline on your chest. </li></ul><h2>  Wedding scarf: what is it like? </h2><p>  Girls who are committed to the classics often prefer a multi-layered <span>long veil.</span>  Desperate dreamers and romantic young ladies decorate their heads with wreaths of fresh flowers and ribbons.  And Orthodox brides often appear before the altar, covering their heads with a scarf.  And, it should be noted, they are not mistaken at all!  Ordinary or lace scarves for weddings are a tribute to Orthodox traditions.  There are at least three reasons why you should give preference to this particular accessory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <ul><li>  It is really beautiful.  A wedding scarf made of weightless lace fabric that flows neatly from the bride‚Äôs head and shoulders is another bright and at the same time gentle touch to her outfit that will create an aura of spirituality, mystery and tenderness. </li><li>  This is original.  A wedding scarf will make the image of the newlywed memorable and interesting, since three out of five brides go to the altar in the same familiar veil.  Therefore, if three or more couples get married on one day, you will not be able to get lost on someone else's background. </li><li>  This does not violate church canons.  Church traditions require a woman to cover her head before entering the church.  Moreover, the bride‚Äôs face should always be open during the wedding ceremony.  Therefore, in this case, a veil is not the best choice, as it is often mounted on the back of the head without covering its head at all, or it has several tiers, one of which the newlywed will throw on her forehead at the entrance to the church.  The scarf for the wedding is allowed to comply with tradition, without encroaching on the beauty of the bride.  In addition, he will be able to cover all the "liberties" of the dress, whether it be open shoulders or a bare back. </li></ul><h2>  Types of wedding scarves </h2><p>  The choice of style depends entirely on your preferences, wishes and the cut of the wedding dress. </p><p>  A wedding scarf in the form of a button-fastened bolero with a hood and lace sleeves is perfect not only for brides who have chosen a frank neckline, but also for newlyweds in tight, elegant dresses that are not overloaded with unnecessary details.  In this case, the cloak will make the outfit complete. </p>

    <p>  If the bodice of the wedding dress is decorated with beads, complex embroidery or artificial flowers, then the bride should opt for models that would be completely closed, or had only one fastener. </p><p>  The voluminous ‚Äúcloak‚Äù, the length of which can reach the floor, will be appreciated by romantic girls.  And brides who prefer conciseness and simplicity to all the pleasures will like a scarf with satin ties and drawstring. </p><p>  Newly-made craftswomen of all trades will easily build a wedding scarf with their own hands.  How to do this? </p><h2>  DIY wedding scarf </h2><p>  First of all, you need to stock up on a piece of satin, high-quality tulle, silk, guipure, lace fabric or other airy and elegant fabrics.  Remember that a wedding scarf is a symbol of the beauty and purity of the bride, so it‚Äôs better to choose a boiling white color. </p><p>  In addition, you will need threads matching the color of the fabric, ribbons, beads or braid for decoration and a sewing machine.  And, of course, the pattern of the scarf for the wedding. </p>

    <p>  The work ahead is simple, but painstaking. </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to cut a circle from a piece of fabric, the diameter of which should be determined based on the size of the future scarf. </li><li>  Cut it in a straight line to the center. </li><li>  Make a neckline cut.  Remember that it is not located exactly in the center! </li><li>  Next, you need to fold the second piece of matter in half and outline a rectangle.  Its width is equal to the circumference of the neckline, which was divided in two, and the height is equal to the estimated height of the hood (take into account the height of the wedding hairstyle!). </li><li>  Sew the hood to the cloak, work on the edges and sew the clasp. </li></ul><p>  The scarf is ready!  Be beautiful and unique! </p>
