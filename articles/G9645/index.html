However, this undoubtedly has its advantages, because the local beaches are free from a large influx of tourists, which means they are quieter and calmer.  In addition, the cost of a ticket to Beldibi is more affordable compared to tours to other Mediterranean resorts.  Small hotels are especially attractive in this regard, for example, Asel Hotel 3 *. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This guest house is located in Beldibi.  On the territory of 1000 square meters.  m. here is a compact 4-story hotel building and a well-equipped area with a swimming pool and green spaces. </p><p>  The building was built in 2004, and several years ago was renovated.  Now tourists are welcomed by small, but clean and bright rooms.  The design of the hotel is modest, but tasteful - nothing more. </p>

    <p>  The platform in front of the pool is equipped with sunbeds.  In other words, the hotel will have something to do between trips to the beach and sightseeing programs. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The Kemer Asel Hotel 3 * does not have its own beach, however, at a distance of 400 meters (2 coastline), there is a city sand and pebble beach.  The entrance to the water is gentle and safe, so you can safely come here with children. </p><p>  The beach is equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds, anyone can use this beach equipment for free.  Nearby you can use paid entertainment: </p><ul><li>  windsurfing; </li><li>  boating and yachting; </li><li>  Beach volleyball. </li></ul><h2>  What to do in Beldibi </h2><p>  The clear sea and sandy beaches are not the only attraction of this resort.  Tourists staying at the Asel Hotel 3 * hotel should definitely visit some especially significant corners of the city. </p><ol><li>  Dino Park Kemer.  This attraction is located in the city of Kemer, however, the journey there will take no more than 15-20 minutes.  Dino Park occupies a fairly large territory and is famous for a large number of exhibits - dinosaurs that make sounds and move. </li><li>  <span>Mount Takhtaly</span> in the village of Kirish.  According to legend, this mountain was the habitat of the gods.  The cable car will help you get to the very top, and from the observation platform, the surroundings are visible in full view. </li></ol><p>  Fans of historical values ‚Äã‚Äãcan always go on an excursion to the ruins of the ancient city of Phaselis or visit the cave of Beldibi. </p><h2>  Asel Hotel 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Before buying a tour to Asel Hotel, you should definitely familiarize yourself with the reviews that tourists who have visited here have managed to leave. </p><p>  I must say that among the Russian speakers there are quite a lot of negative reviews, but there are also many positive features. </p>

    <ol><li>  Distance from the airport.  The hotel is located 40 km.  from the airport, so the trip will take about 30-40 minutes.  In this case, it is better to use the transfer from the hotel, as finding a bus or taxi can be problematic. </li><li>  Lack of entertainment.  On the territory of the hotel from entertainment there is only a pool (and that one is small).  Animation, billiards and other entertainment infrastructure is not provided.  However, those tourists who go to the beach and plan a busy schedule of excursions will not notice this. </li><li>  Nutrition.  Most guests agree that the food in the hotel is somewhat monotonous and does not meet the stated descriptions.  Partially solve this issue will help small cafes and bars, located in large numbers in the town itself.  The food is excellent here, and the prices are very, very low. </li><li>  Sea.  This is exactly what it is worth coming to Beldibi for.  The absence of a large number of tourists (including the Turks themselves) allows you to enjoy the beach in silence and cleanliness. </li><li>  Prices for accommodation.  This is another reason why vacationers choose this hotel, despite the negative reviews about the Asel Hotel 3 * Kemer.  The cost of accommodation here is one of the most attractive in the area. </li></ol><p>  Who can safely recommend the Asel Hotel 3 * hotel?  To all those who appreciate the solitude and beauty of nature, to all who are looking for a clean coast for a beach holiday, lovers of excursions.  In other words, everyone who expects from the hotel no more than a place for an overnight stay and a hearty breakfast will be completely satisfied. </p>
