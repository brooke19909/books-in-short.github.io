Such a beautiful name of the village is associated with one story about the girl Mary.  During the Caucasian War, a duelist exiled from the capital served in Kabardinka.  He was followed in these parts by his young wife named Marya.  Her husband, a brave warrior, was once mortally wounded by the highlanders, and his loyal horse was brought to the Russians by his faithful horse. </p><p>  Without their brave commander, the soldiers began to retreat.  But Marya, putting on her husband‚Äôs uniform, ordered: ‚ÄúGo!  I'm alive!"  After that, the soldiers began to attack the highlanders, and they began to flee in panic.  Mary was very carried away and once found herself in an enemy environment.  She was killed by a shot in the heart, and then fell out of the saddle.  A cap fell off her head, and her long hair fell over her shoulders.  The highlanders, seeing this, realized that they were fighting a woman.  They were overcome by fear of those whose women were equal in strength to men.  They never again attacked the fortification in Kabardinka.  Marya and her husband were buried nearby, and the grove where the young brave woman died was named Maryina. </p><div class="photo" data-original="votezde.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The surroundings of the village" class="if uuid-2601774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2601774.jpg"></div><h2>  Climate and nature </h2><p>  Living in your own home in Maryina Roscha, Gelendzhik, Kabardinka is very profitable and good.
