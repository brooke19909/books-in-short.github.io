Today, there is no such drawback - the housing market is filled with offers in the segments of secondary apartments and new buildings.  If there was money, all that remains is to choose and buy.  But at the stage of selection, many buyers are at a loss: how to properly evaluate the apartment?  Is only its footage important, or does the area and characteristics of the building itself deserve attention?  Let us consider in detail the main <span>types of houses</span> in which you can buy housing today. </p><h2>  Time-tested buildings </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="House types" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/872157.jpg"></div>  The old foundation is pre-revolutionary buildings;  they are preserved today not in all cities of our country.  Real estate of this category should be evaluated in each case separately.  Some buildings of this type tend to be demolished as soon as possible, while others are carefully and accurately reconstructed using European standards.  If you want to settle in the historic city center in a centuries-old house, get ready to pay a fairly large amount for such housing.  But to buy an apartment in an old house in poor condition does not make sense.  The likelihood that the building will be demolished soon is too high.

This is another category of elite real estate of the past.  It is easy to guess from the popular name that JV Stalin began to erect such buildings immediately after the end of the Great Patriotic War: in the country of winners there should be beautiful and comfortable houses for living.  You can recognize the "Stalin" by the high ceilings and magnificent decoration of the facades with Soviet symbols.  Most often, apartments in such houses are quite spacious and have a convenient layout. </p><h2>  Echo of a bygone era </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="House type" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/872144.jpg"></div>  One of the most popular residential development options is Khrushchev.  Such houses were and are in all cities of our country.  These are brick and panel five-story buildings with miniature apartments.  The rooms are usually no more than 4, their meter is more than modest, the bathroom is combined, and 6 m <sup>2 is</sup> allocated for the kitchen.  This category of residential real estate pleases only with its low cost.  Quite often in our country, house types were named after the surname of the main state manager.  It is not surprising that the "Khrushchevs" were replaced by "Brezhnevka".  The quality of buildings has improved - the ceilings have become a little higher, the layout is more diverse, the total footage has increased, and elevators have also appeared.  Such new buildings have become a real luxury for their time, they are popular in our days.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of Residential Buildings" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/872150.jpg"></div>  Modern construction organizations delight us with buildings with complex architecture, erected according to individual projects, and typical multi-story buildings.  Today, such types of houses as brick or brick-monolithic are still popular.  In the second case, we are talking about a solid monolithic structure, which is lined with bricks on the outside.  Such buildings are considered incredibly high quality and resistant to any cataclysms.  <span>Monolithic houses</span> do not have seams on the walls - they are made by installing formwork and pouring concrete directly at the construction site.  This is a modern and affordable housing, characterized by good noise and heat insulation characteristics.  Block buildings are erected from concrete blocks according to the principle of the designer.  The panel type is often confused with them - houses built from panels.  However, the difference is not only in the material (more precisely, in the form of its release), but also in the principle of ‚Äúassembly‚Äù.

To say that any one particular type of house is many times better than all the others is impossible.  When choosing a secondary housing, the condition of a particular building should be studied, as well as the documentation confirming the overhaul and timely <span>maintenance of the building.</span>  If we are talking about new buildings, then we should take into account the quality of construction and materials used, as well as the reputation of the developer.  Remember that in all cities, in addition to apartments in apartment buildings, there is a segment of individual housing and low-rise residential buildings designed for several owners.  You can always buy such a family-type house or a private cottage with a piece of land in the property.
