Now women can otherwise manage the time that was previously given to washing by hand and wiping the kitchen utensils dry.  Many housewives can no longer imagine their life without a dishwasher.  It is enough just to load plates and cutlery, start the equipment in one mode or another and after 20-30 minutes get out the impeccably clean and sparkling dishes. </p><p>  But in order for the dishwasher to serve faithfully for many years, you must regularly look after it.  We will talk about how to clean the dishwasher and how to choose the best tool. </p>

    <h2>  Why kitchen appliances require special care? </h2><p>  If the outside ordering does not raise questions, then cleaning the internal elements can be confusing.  It is not hard to guess why food residues, lime and greasy deposits must be removed: </p><ol><li>  Firstly, it is a hotbed of harmful bacteria and unpleasant odors. </li><li>  Secondly, regular cleaning will extend the life of the kitchen appliances. </li></ol><p>  But for those who are faced with this procedure for the first time, it may seem that it is easier to unload the wagon with coal than to clean the dishwasher.  In fact, everything is not so difficult if you know the basic rules of preventive care for it.  Next, a whole range of procedures will be presented, having completed which you can declare the perfect cleanliness of the dishwasher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to clean inside, where to start? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean a dishwasher at home" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2111766.jpg"></div></h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth paying attention to general points regarding the regular care of the kitchen "assistant": </p><ol><li>  After the next use, the dishwasher must be left open.  This is necessary for weathering residual moisture, which is the optimal environment for the growth of bacteria. </li><li>  Care is required for the internal compartments and baskets.  After each washing, they must be wiped dry. </li><li>  Manually cleaning the baskets is the only effective way to remove contaminants, unlike regular program rinsing. </li><li>  Before you install the dishes in the machine, you must carefully collect all leftover food. </li><li>  In the process of cleaning the dishwasher, you need to try to climb into everything, even hard-to-reach places.  It is impossible to fully rely on detergent compositions - they are not always effective. </li><li>  Do not save on the purchase of tablets and liquids for dishwashers.  How to clean the device without special tools?  This is almost impossible if you want to get rid of grease and dirty plaque.  Although there is one good tool, but about him a little later. </li><li>  Pay attention to the <span>rubber seals</span> located on the doors.  A lot of dirt is collected in this area. </li><li>  It is important to remove the fat layer in time.  It glows and forms a film, which with prolonged exposure can even eat into metal surfaces. </li></ol><h2>  What should always be done? </h2><p>  As a rule, a dishwasher is used day after day.  After each use cycle, internal products must be washed with food waste.  Spare time for this procedure should not be: it is important to carefully go through all areas, to process all the holes and indentations.  Note to the hostesses: most often the sprinkler clogs the food.  If, having looked into the machine after washing, you find particles of waste on it, do not put the matter in a long drawer, immediately eliminate them.  Before cleaning the dishwasher at home, in particular the sprayer, be sure to unplug the appliance from the mains.  For convenience, use tweezers or long tongs - with their help it is much easier to extract the remnants of food. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Having started a general cleaning at home, you will have to clean the dishwasher.  How to do it qualitatively, the following step-by-step instruction will tell you below.  Following the recommendations, you can tidy up your irreplaceable assistant in the kitchen in half an hour. </p><h2>  Strainer washing </h2><p>  This part must be washed periodically, but at least once a week.  The filter constantly accumulates grease, deposits and dirt.  Trash clogs small holes, which leads to an unpleasant odor from the machine, and after a while it can cause a leak.  First you need to carefully remove the lower basket and disassemble it - the only way to remove the filter.  It is enough to wash the part under the pressure of water with an ordinary <span>detergent for washing</span> dishes.  Wipe with a dry towel, set back. </p><h2>  Blade cleaning </h2><p>  The next stage is the processing of the blades or, as they are also called, the rocker arm.  Clean parts as they become dirty.  Most often, these parts are clogged with scale.  It is especially important to clean all the small holes on them - it is more convenient to use a toothpick.  After installing the blades in place, check whether they work normally - the rocker arms should rotate freely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Seal Processing </h2><p>  Often there is no need to handle rubber gaskets.  A regular visual inspection and cleaning every six months is enough.  In the instructions for dishwashers, there are sometimes manufacturer's recommendations on choosing the right product.  Share tips on handling door seals and hostesses.  According to reviews, many people are comfortable doing this with an old toothbrush - it easily penetrates the space between the pads.  But recommendations for the use of citric acid are not required.  The fact is that this substance negatively affects rubber.  Under the influence of aggressive acid, the material loses its elasticity and tightness. </p><h2>  What else needs to be cleaned? </h2><p>  Plastic baskets are easily cleaned with dishwashing detergent, but many people forget about the need to wash the so-called ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù.  It is located at the bottom of the machine, at the door.  Despite the fact that water does not enter there, dirt and various deposits accumulate in just a few uses. </p><h2>  What means are intended for washing dishwashers? </h2><p>  Regardless of the size (45 or 60 cm), dishwashers have almost the same device.  Once you finish cleaning hard-to-reach surfaces, you can move on to removing grease, rust and mold. </p>

    <p>  At this stage, it is important not to go wrong with dishwasher cleaning liquid.  So, in order to get rid of specific pollution, you should choose the right tool: </p><ol><li>  Mold.  To remove it, use bleach.  The exception is the presence of stainless steel parts in the machine.  Any chlorine compounds can be hazardous to this metal.  To prevent the appearance of mushrooms, it is necessary to leave the machine door open after washing. </li><li>  Rust.  Corrosion is not easy to eliminate.  But even if it is possible to find a suitable remedy, this will not give any guarantee that the rust will not appear again.  The first signs of corrosion processes: bloating of the top coat of paint and peeling.  Installing a water filter for a dishwasher will help prevent rust. </li><li>  Scum.  The easiest way to get rid of hard limescale is to buy Finish tablets.  The tool can be used both in the presence of an existing scale and for preventive purposes.  Cheaper analogues of the Finish tablets are Somat, Topper and Amway. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean the dishwasher" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2111771.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Do-it-yourself cleaner </h2><p>  If you believe the reviews, many users recommend using citric acid to clean the dishwasher at home.  As already noted, this component can damage the condition of the rubber seals.  A relatively safe alternative will be a solution of soda and vinegar.  You can cook it yourself as follows: </p><ol><li>  In a 1:13 ratio, take table 5% vinegar and boiled water.  That is, for 1 tablespoon of essence use 13 tbsp.  l  water. </li><li>  Next, you need to add baking soda - approximately 50-60 grams. </li><li>  The composition is thoroughly mixed, the soda should "hiss" a little. </li><li>  Then the glass with the resulting liquid is sent to the dishwasher 60 cm or 45 cm - it does not matter. </li><li>  "Assistant" is launched in the usual program, but without utensils and cutlery. </li><li>  At the end of the unit, wipe the inner chamber with a clean cloth.  After the procedure, no contamination should remain. </li></ol><p>  There is no need for regular cleaning.  It is enough to carry out the procedure once every 2-3 months.  And in order to minimize stone deposits, use salt - it affects the chemical composition of water, making it softer. </p>

    <p>  At first glance it may seem that there is not the slightest need for special care for kitchen appliances.  Dishwashers of all brands and models look externally clean and fresh for a long time.  But with daily use, all working parts are contaminated with food waste, sediment from hard water and detergents, scale and fat deposits increase, which subsequently leads to breakdowns and ineffective operation of the equipment.  At a minimum, using Finish to clean the dishwasher will increase its service life. </p><p>  The appearance of an unpleasant odor when the door is open serves as a signal of failure of the main "assistant" in the kitchen.  Do not wait for the sad consequences, clean the dishwasher as soon as possible. </p>
