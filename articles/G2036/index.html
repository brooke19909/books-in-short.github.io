    <h2>  Queen in love with an island </h2><p>  Achilleion Palace, which has a rich history, attracts tourists with its unique beauty and special atmosphere.  It was built at the end of the 19th century for the Empress Elizabeth of Austria, known as Sisi.  The Queen of Austro-Hungary, who had a great love for the ancient architecture, did not get along well with her mother-in-law.  And she traveled a lot, just not to meet her.  In 1861, a woman arrived on the wonderful island of Corfu, whose virgin nature she fell in love with at first sight. </p><p>  The independent queen, who did not recognize strict palace protocols, was not very fond of her entourage.  And the tragic deaths of children, father, sister, greatly undermined her psyche.  Therefore, the queen decides to leave her homeland.  Elizabeth of Austria always remembered the island that hit her in the very heart, so the choice of place of residence was not accidental. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A majestic building built in honor of Achilles </h2><p>  In 1889, the construction of the most famous landmark of Corfu begins - the most beautiful palace, next to which lies a picturesque park descending to the sea.  The Empress, inspired by the exploits of the great warrior of the <span>Trojan War,</span> Achilles, gave the name of her residence in his honor.  The Greek hero became the main theme of the three-story palace, in which Elizabeth of Austria sought peace for her soul, wounded by losses and family dramas.  She carefully thought out the exterior of the building and its interior.  Unfortunately, fate did not measure the queen's long life.  The travel enthusiast was killed in 1898 in Geneva by a terrorist. </p>

    <h2>  New owner </h2><p>  Nine years after her death, the German Kaiser who often visited Corfu bought the Sisi Palace.  The summer residence has become the center of European diplomacy.  The German emperor, who regularly lived in the palace until 1914, arranged the gardens that had fallen into disrepair, arranged rearrangements, and placed a marble monument to the first mistress in front of the main entrance.  The sad and touching figure of the meek Sisi as if personifies her tragic fate. </p><h2>  Palace History </h2><p>  In wartime, the magnificent palace of Achilleion was used as a hospital, and with the onset of peace, a school and an orphanage were located there.  For twenty years, the premises were leased to a German company, which restored the historical monument and turned it into a casino.  Now the strict palace of Achilleion, looking exactly the same as after the construction was completed, belongs to the state.  The museum located in it and the restored park area are open to all visitors.  From any point of a well-groomed tropical garden, an amazing view of the water surface of the Ionian Sea opens. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Architectural monument </h2><p>  Achilleion Palace (Corfu) is of great interest to all architecture lovers.  The building, designed by the Italian architect R. Carita in a neoclassical style, is decorated with columns, porches and a huge number of statues.  An inscription with the name of the palace in Greek is embossed on the iron gate at the entrance, and near the building there is an alley with plates laid out on which important dates are indicated regarding Achilleion.

    <h2>  What to see for tourists? </h2><p>  In the evergreen garden of the magnificent palace of tourists, statues are met - copies of ancient works on the theme of mythology, busts of ancient Greek philosophers.  But the most valuable sculpture, perhaps, is "Wounded Achilles."  It was she who was most dear to the first mistress of the residence, who ordered the work in Germany.  The marble statue of the mortally wounded warrior of the Greek epic did not like William II, who ordered the sculptor J. Gots to create a new image of the hero - not a dying one, but complete superiority over his enemies.  The huge bronze statue of Achilles the Victorious is imbued with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpowerful Germans, whose memory will remain for centuries. </p><p>  Inside the frescoed palace you can see the personal belongings of the Queen and William II, lifetime photographs, well-preserved furniture of previous owners and even jewelry, admire the paintings of artists on the ancient Greek history.  The most famous and valuable work of the museum is a painting depicting the triumph and valor of a Greek warrior: Achilles proudly stands on a chariot sweeping past the walls of Troy, to which the body of the murdered Hector is tied.  The canvas covering the entire wall is on the main staircase.  Admired museum visitors always gather near it. </p>
