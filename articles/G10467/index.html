    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  In general, according to Russian tourists, the rooms in this hotel are very decent.  So, they are decorated in Arabic style, quite spacious and comfortable.  Furniture and appliances are not new, but everything is in good working order.  Of course, sometimes some kind of breakdown happens.  But all malfunctions will be quickly fixed after contacting the reception.  A big plus, according to many travelers, is the following fact: despite the fact that the hotel has several residential buildings located in different places, loud music will not interfere anywhere with your night's rest.  This is confirmed even by those guests who lived near the amphitheater.  According to them, music plays only until ten in the evening.  Therefore, after this time you can sleep peacefully.  Another indisputable advantage of Alf Leila Wa Leila <span>Hotel 4 * (Hurghada),</span> according to our compatriots, is the fact that the Internet ‚Äúcatches‚Äù practically throughout the entire hotel, including in rooms.  True, with a large influx of vacationers, the connection speed is not very high, however, in many hotels, guests would be very happy about this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hurghada alf leila wa leila hotel 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1027115.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Judging by the comments, almost all the guests were satisfied with this item.  So, according to tourists, the cleaners here do an excellent job with their duties.  Moreover, they are not too lazy to regularly clean the dust even in hard-to-reach places, which is not typical for all hotels in Egypt.  If you hang a sign on the door that you do not want your apartment to be cleaned, you will definitely be called to make sure that everything is in order with you, that you definitely do not need this service.  As for the change of towels, it is produced every day.  Also, as needed, replenish supplies of bath accessories in the bathroom.  Bed linen is changed a couple of times a week.  In addition, cleaners are constantly building fun shapes from towels. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  As our compatriots note in their reviews, regardless of the time you arrive at the hotel, the administrators do everything possible so that the newly arrived guests can enter their room as quickly as possible.  However, some tourists note the fact that travelers who have booked standard rooms are offered for a small fee to replace them with apartments of the best category.  Some of our compatriots did just that, but in fact they were somewhat disappointed, since the standard rooms were no worse (only a few square meters closer) than the ones in which they were eventually settled.  Therefore, experienced travelers recommend that all vacationers first inspect all the apartments offered, and then decide whether to pay extra.  Otherwise, tourists had no complaints about the work of administrators at the reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel alf leila wa leila hotel 4" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1027116.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Many tourists arriving for a vacation at Alf Leila Wa Leila Hotel 4 *, reviews of which we are reviewing, were without exaggeration delighted with the huge, well-planned, very beautiful and well-groomed territory of the hotel complex.  So, according to them, there is a large number of diverse entertainment facilities, shops, sports grounds.  In addition, the territory has a lot of beautiful places for walks and photo shoots. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This topic often causes a lot of controversy among tourists.  And this concerns hotels of various categories not only in Egypt, but also in other countries.  However, Alf Layla wa Layla is a pleasant exception in this regard.  So, judging by the reviews of travelers, everyone was satisfied with the level of organization of food here.  According to the guests, the choice of dishes can not be called very diverse and chic, however, the hotel is not five-star.  In a word, our compatriots claim that the food here is organized in accordance with the category of the hotel complex. </p><p>  So, there are as many as four restaurants at the guests' service - the main, Moroccan, Asian and Italian.  Therefore, you can choose the kitchen to your taste.  However, experienced tourists are advised to come to the restaurant at the beginning of lunch or dinner.  In this case, you will have a greater choice of goodies, since not all dishes are cooked topping up.  By the way, during the day you can also eat fast food on the beach or in the snack bar on site. </p>

    <h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  On the territory of Alf Leila Wa Leila Hotel 4 *, the photo of which is presented in this article, there are several bars.  Moreover, as tourists note, they are located very interesting.  So, the bars are in one place (with the exception of institutions on the beach and by the pool) and form a kind of street.  Therefore, sitting in one of the institutions, you will feel that you are not in a hotel, but in a small town.  As for drinks, their choice seemed to travelers quite diverse.  Many were also satisfied with the quality.  The only complaints concerned the local whiskey, which our compatriots did not like.  Of the alcoholic drinks, many tourists preferred beer and <span>rum with cola.</span>  As for other drinks, the hotel guests praised the coffee served here. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As our compatriots note in their reviews, despite the fact that the Alf Layla Wa Layla hotel is located some distance from the coast, they were satisfied with their beach holidays here.  So, first of all, according to them, the guests of the hotel complex do not need to walk to the sea.  A free shuttle bus runs all day with a 10-minute interval between the beach and the hotel.  However, some tourists with pleasure went to the sea and on foot.  According to them, it took them no more than 15-20 minutes. </p><p>  The beach here is at the disposal of three hotels.  However, it is large, so there is enough space for everyone.  There are enough sun beds and umbrellas.  There is also a bar and snack bar on the beach where you can enjoy pizza, french fries, a hamburger and other fast food. </p><p>  The beach itself is sandy.  Entering shallow water.  Most of the bottom is sand, but stones are found in some places.  Therefore, tourists are advised to be careful when entering the sea so as not to injure their legs. </p><p>  Near the coast there is a small coral reef.  However, in beauty it can not be compared with the reefs off the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh.  But still, you can watch some marine life here.  In addition, travelers always have the opportunity to go on a sea excursion, which includes swimming next to beautiful and densely populated reefs. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Many tourists in their reviews regarding Alf Leila Wa Leila Hotel (Hurghada, Egypt) also mention hotel staff.  So, according to them, the staff here is selected very well.  The staff of the hotel complex is always friendly, welcoming, willing to help in any matters.  In addition, many of them speak Russian to one degree or another, so our compatriots do not have communication problems here.  You will not need to recall the English school curriculum. </p>
