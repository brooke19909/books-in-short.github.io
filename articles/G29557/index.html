  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gamma radiation. What do we know about this phenomenon?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Few of us know about such a thing as gamma radiation, since not all of us have special knowledge in the field of physics. </p><p>  So, gamma radiation is one of the many varieties of electromagnetic radiation.  <span>The wavelength</span> in this case is very small, as well as its wave properties.  The history of the discovery of this radiation began more than a hundred years ago.  In 1900, this phenomenon was discovered by one of the French physicists - Paul Willard.  And this discovery happened by accident as a result of a study of radium. </p><p>  Gamma rays are unique in their own way and have a number of unique properties.  The main processes occur when this radiation penetrates through certain types of substances.  The photoelectric effect of such rays is based on the appearance of electrons in a substance when exposed to light.  The photoelectric effect in this case can be both external and internal. </p><p>  The Compton effect is another property of gamma radiation, which also deserves special study.  In this case, an increase in the electromagnetic wave is noted.  This phenomenon was discovered back in 1923. </p><p>  Pairing is another unique feature of gamma rays.  As a result of a certain reaction, a quantum located in the very center of the nucleus becomes both an electron and a positron.  But thanks to the nuclear effect of such radiation, a gamma quantum is capable of knocking out nucleons from the nucleus.  Gamma radiation in the modern world is used in various areas of human life.  Gamma-ray inspection, for example, allows you to control the operation of many devices and products using special beams.  The preservation of many products also occurs using similar rays.  At the same time, the shelf life of the workpieces is significantly increased, and there can be no talk of any harmful consequences. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Using gamma radiation, sterilization of equipment, medical instruments, and some food products is carried out.  In medicine, such rays have also found their application.  With the help of <span>radiation therapy,</span> for example, a huge number of varieties of malignant tumors are treated.  Agree, this is an important contribution to the development of medicine, since not every drug can do this.  When using gamma rays, we observe quite good results in the treatment of cancer and, moreover, at relatively low cost.  Anyway, gamma rays due to their specific properties were able to significantly advance medicine forward. </p><p>  Gamma ray logging is an integral part of geology.  Using various sources of gamma radiation, geologists measure the depth of the wells.  But the gamma altimeter is a way to accurately determine the distance covered by <span>spacecraft.</span>  That is, these radiation have found active application in astronautics, and in geology, and in medicine, and in production.  But with all these positive aspects, gamma radiation has some disadvantages, which you must be aware of.  Due to prolonged contact with quanta, for example, a dangerous disease arises - radiation sickness.  The most serious consequence of such exposure are various types of cancer. </p><p>  In addition, these rays also have teratogenic effects on the body, as a result of which mutation and embryonic disturbance of normal development occur.  In fact, gamma radiation is the same radiation that we have heard a lot about, but about which we know little.  Although, when used correctly in small doses using modern equipment, these radiation can significantly facilitate and improve human activity! </p>
