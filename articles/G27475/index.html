  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Genetics and transgender issues</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the Bible <span>Book of Genesis,</span> it is written about the emergence of the biological species Homo Sapiens Sapiens: "God created them as male and female."  So who are they - man and woman: two halves or two different subspecies?  Interconnected for the continuation of the species of creature, throughout the rest of life, or, more correctly, in other areas of life, in addition to reproductive, are friends or enemies?  How much does a person‚Äôs personality depend on his belonging to one or another ‚Äúcamp‚Äù?  And how can genetics affect transgender issues? </p><p>  Aristotle, who was far from such a modern science as genetics, spoke wise words in the 4th century <span>BC</span> : "A man begets a man."  After almost two and a half thousand years, in 1956, scientists proved that the Y chromosome is responsible for the formation of the male body in the mother‚Äôs body, which is transmitted to the son only from the father, since it is absent in the mother‚Äôs body.  It is she who, in the eighth week <span>of embryo development,</span> directs the formation of the sex glands, turning them into male testicles.  <span>This genetics of</span> sex further determines the morphological sex, that is, the formation of the external genitalia and, after the birth of the child and as he grows older, <span>secondary sexual characteristics.</span> </p><p>  The presence or absence of the Y chromosome affects the gonadal (further development of the female ovary or male testicles), the gamete (the ability of the glands to produce eggs and sperm) and the hormonal sex (when the body produces estrogens or androgens - female and male hormones).  But, since man is a social being, not only the genetics of sex leaves an imprint on the personality, but the society itself with its clear rules and principles.  Thus, a person also has a civilian gender - the one to which he is ranked among others.  Gender is directly related to the civilian gender - a complex of sexual traits and behavior that society expects (and often requires) from a carrier of one or another gender.  For example, courage, some brutality, independence is expected from a man, and softness, tenderness, dependence, emotionality from a woman. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It‚Äôs good when the chromosome definition of sex coincides with our self-identity as men or women.  The rejection of gender restrictions in no way indicates transsexualism: if a woman wants to master the ‚Äúmale‚Äù profession or shows independence and courage in decision-making, this does not mean that she feels like a man.  She simply protests against the fact that a particular profession is considered masculine, and a particular behavioral attitude is imposed on a woman.  But what about the case when the biological sex does not coincide with the psychological conviction of the individual in belonging to another sex? </p><p>  In 1990, British scientist P. Goodfellow investigated the <span>male Y chromosome</span> and discovered the SRY gene, which is responsible for testosterone production.  So the science of gender genetics advanced one step further.  Experiments on mammals showed that if the SRY gene is implanted in a female embryo in the early stages, male genital organs are formed, which nevertheless do not lead to the birth of a male - a female with signs of female pseudo-hermaphroditism is born.  If the male embryo is blocked from developing testosterone, he develops male pseudo-hermaphroditism. </p><p>  But transsexuality is not just the presence of certain sexual characteristics under the influence of testosterone.  Transsexuals completely, organically do not accept the genetic definition of sex given to them by nature, and tend to belong to the opposite sex.  And this desire, no matter what clerics and conservative moralists say, is not at all idle fantasies and not evidence of moral decline.  After all, transsexuality begins to manifest itself in young children (approximately two years old), when the child wants to be called by the name given to the opposite sex.  <span>Gender education</span> does not give anything at all, but only exacerbates psychological trauma.  Boys are drawn to dolls and outfits, girls are pugnacious and play "boyish" games.  In adolescence, transgender people have an interest in the ‚Äúopposite‚Äù - in their understanding - and in ‚Äútheir own‚Äù - in the eyes of society - gender.  Transsexuality affects about one person per 150 thousand - that is, the percentage of such people in society is quite large. </p>
