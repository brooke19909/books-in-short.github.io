Today, France controls it.  The island of Corsica is one of the largest in the Mediterranean Sea.  However, the attractive features that he possesses appeared on it not so much due to its impressive size, but because of its geographical location. </p><p>  Try for the sake of interest to consider this piece of land not as a single detail, but in the geographical ensemble in which it is located on our planet.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Connection with the story </h2><p>  And although at first glance it might seem that these data will be of interest only to gray-haired academics, this is not so.  After all, all the peoples who have been here have left a mark.  That is why the island of Corsica is so rich in various historical sites. </p><p>  Here you can get acquainted with the history, starting from the park of a prehistoric settlement, which is currently about 8000 years old.  You can continue to familiarize yourself with the many fortifications of different eras, next to which you will find cute antique shops.  And finish your excursion with a visit to objects directly connected with the most famous Corsican - Napoleon Bonaparte. </p><h2>  Mentality features </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eagle and tails corsica island" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/449077.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In the popular television program ‚ÄúEagle and Reshka‚Äù the island of Corsica is presented as a quiet area with a leisurely current rhythm of life.  It is repeatedly emphasized that mainly pensioners live on the island.  To some extent this is true, but this fact does not mean at all that a <span>vacation in Corsica</span> will be monotonous and boring.  They know how to entertain tourists. </p><p>  As for the characteristic features of the mentality of the Corsicans themselves, they are a good-natured and sociable people with a truly southern temperament.  They are proud of their origin and history, and consider themselves not French, or even Italians, namely Corsicans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of outdoor activities on the island </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="France Corsica" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/449082.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The map of Corsica itself can immediately give a clear and correct idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat outdoor enthusiasts can do at this resort.  Fans of extreme sports will immediately recognize attractive routes for unusual trips in the outlines of mountain ranges.  The island of Corsica very naturally and fairly compactly collected twenty peaks in a relatively small area, each of which reaches a height of more than two thousand meters above sea level. </p><p>  By the way, you can go to conquer these peaks not only on your own, but also on horseback.  The trails laid back during the confrontation between the Etruscans and the Carthaginians are still suitable for horseback riding. </p><h2>  The hardest track in Europe </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of corsica" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/449078.jpg" width="382"></div></h2><p>  It is Corsica that is famous for the most difficult mountain route GR20.  As a rule, they spend 15 days to overcome 250 kilometers of rocky paths.  By the number of these crossings, special shelters are located - houses on the route where tourists can spend the night.  In Corsica they are called refugs (from the French word refuge, which means "refuge"). </p><p>  Transitions are incredibly beautiful.  Although, in our understanding of this sense, such sorties cannot be called absolutely wild rest.  This area is protected.  This means that the law prohibits the pitching of tents anywhere other than the places reserved for refuges. </p><p>  Each night in such a house, designed for 20-30 beds, will cost you about 11 euros.  Moreover, places will have to be booked in advance.  For the right to put your own tent you will have to pay 6 euros.  Bonfires are strictly prohibited everywhere. </p><h2>  Corsican festivals </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corsica island" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/449080.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Numerous festivals and local festivals deserve special attention, which Corsicans know how to conduct with great taste and indescribable color.  If you plan to visit Corsica at the end of summer, try to get on August 12 to the town of Bastelika, located in the very center of the island. </p><p>  It is on this day that the most real festivities are held in honor of the memory of the national hero Sampiero.  You may have never heard this name, but you probably know the hero of Shakespeare's tragedy - Othello.  So Sampiero served as a prototype for him. </p><p>  On this day, the streets are filled with dancing and singing people in magnificent costumes of the Renaissance.  Young men in love will surely take the opportunity to perform a serenade under the beloved‚Äôs window, and the sounds of old musical instruments flowing from all sides serve as a wonderful background for this holiday. </p><h2>  Feast of antiquity </h2><p>  If you prefer Roman classicism, go on August 8 and 9 to the city of Aleria.  At this time, the "Antique Holiday" is held there.  This time, the people around you will be dressed in Roman togas, and local restaurants and eateries will certainly offer antique dishes in their menu according to real old recipes. </p><p>  In Corsica, you can easily pick up the type of vacation that suits you, and you will surely take away an unforgettable experience from here. </p>
