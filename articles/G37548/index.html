  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting patterns: features, patterns and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In special magazines on needlework, you can find a huge number of beautiful and interesting patterns.  However, very often the selected option is not suitable for a particular product.  Similar problems most often occur in beginner craftswomen.  Therefore, in the material presented below, we will talk about how to make fashionable knitting patterns and not make a mistake when choosing the perfect option for the intended product. </p><h2>  Choosing a good tool </h2><p>  Professional knitters recommend paying special attention to the selection of knitting needles.  After all, if the tool is rough, too soft and bends during operation or has a sharp tip, it is more reasonable to consider another option.  It is also worth noting that people who are just learning to knit, it is better to purchase metal knitting needles.  This material provides good glide, and, accordingly, speed and quality of work.  In addition, it is worth noting that for a product with a clear pattern, knitting needles are recommended to be selected with a diameter equal to the thickness of the thread.  If you want to make a fashionable effect of elongated loops, you need to use larger needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting pattern diagram" class="if uuid-2952037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952037.jpg"></div><h2>  Buying yarn </h2><p>  Another important part of the preparatory phase is the selection of knitting threads.  Experienced craftsmen are convinced that in this case, you can rely on your own taste.  But keep in mind that for <span>knitting with</span> complex <span>patterns</span> , for example braids and bundles, it is better to purchase plain yarn.  And for simple ones - those called "Rice", "Chess", "Pearl" and others, it is permissible to use several colors or a gradient skein.  It is wiser to choose patchwork yarn for the front surface.  Otherwise, the pattern will not be visible.  It is also important to note that when buying knitting threads, you need to consider what season the idea fits into.  Accordingly, for warm clothes, wool yarn is an ideal option.  If the skin is too sensitive, you can use more expensive, such as merino.  In the spring-autumn - Angora or mohair, in the summer - thin linen or cotton yarn. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beauty is in simplicity </h2><p>  Most beginner knitters find hosiery and garter stitches too boring and common.  Therefore, it is rarely chosen as the main pattern.  However, a huge number of master classes prepared by experienced masters demonstrate interesting things.  It‚Äôs very simple to execute them, but they don‚Äôt lose sight of it at all.  And on the contrary, they look very expensive, stylish and fashionable.  Consider the following photo an example of the above knitting patterns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="front surface" class="if uuid-2952005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952005.jpg"></div><p>  We will also study the description of samples first in the current article.  Both options consist of front and back rows.  But hosiery requires that in the front rows there were exclusively front loops, and in the wrong ones - the wrong ones.  As a result of the work, we get a pattern that shows the model in the photo on the right.  Garter stitching is much simpler.  In it, you need to knit exclusively with front or back loops in each next row.  It is necessary to decide immediately.  This pattern can be seen on the model shown in the left photo. </p><h2>  Checkerboard pattern </h2><p>  Embossed <span>knitting patterns,</span> consisting of a series of front and back loops, are the most favorite among all beginners.  And all because they are performed very simply, but look really original.  The most popular is "Chess". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.picsnaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="checkerboard pattern" class="if uuid-2952000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952000.jpg"></div><p>  It is best suited for scarves and hats.  For knitting the entire large product, it is rarely chosen, but sometimes it is used to trim parts that they want to focus on.  The pattern is best combined with various types of elastic.  It is performed quite simply: </p><ol><li>  Choose how many loops and rows will be in one square.  For example, two.  This means that the pattern repeat is four loops. </li><li>  We calculate the loops for the set, given the two edge loops at the edges. </li><li>  In the first row, remove the hem, then alternate two front and two wrong loops.  So to the very end of the row.  We knit the last one as the wrong one. </li><li>  In the second row and all even we knit according to the drawing. </li><li>  In the third row, we shift the loops so that we get a checkerboard pattern. </li><li>  We knit the fourth according to the drawing. </li><li>  Then repeat the above steps. </li></ol><h2>  Pearl Pattern </h2><p>  To decorate the conceived thing with this pattern, you do not need to understand technology for a long time.  She is really elementary!  However, the pattern is best suited for doing bulk things.  For example, berets, classic scarves, snoods and scarves-hoods.  It can also be used to knit various sweaters and even skirts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pearl pattern" class="if uuid-2952010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952010.jpg"></div><p>  But it is important to consider that the latter will turn out to be quite tough and magnificent, so they will add extra volume to the beautiful lady.  The knitting pattern goes well with small braids and plaits.  To perform it, it is necessary to carry out the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Rapport is two loops.  When calculating the loops, you should also consider the edge loops. </li><li>  In the first row, remove the hem, then alternate one front and the wrong loop.  We knit the last one as the wrong one. </li><li>  In the second and subsequent rows (even and odd), over the front knit purl, over the purl - facial. </li><li>  We continue in this way to the desired blade length. </li></ol><p>  In almost the same way, another interesting pattern is knitted.  It is called "Rice."  In it, the wrong rows fit in the pattern, and the front rows alternate, as described above. </p><h2>  Intricate patterns </h2><p>  This type includes options consisting of many elements.  Most often, they include braids and plaits, lace and various figures - leaves, hearts and more.  Understanding the execution technology is not possible by description.  And a knitting pattern is what best explains what you need.  Therefore, we further suggest exploring the most spectacular and fashionable patterns.  They can be used to knit large items.  For example, sweaters, dresses and skirts.  However, it is important to consider that lace requires preparation of the lining.  Nevertheless, if the knitter draws a scarf and a hat in this way, the product will only become more effective. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern design" class="if uuid-2951996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2951996.jpg"></div><p>  So we sorted out simple and complex, voluminous and embossed, solid and openwork patterns for knitting.  The most difficult schemes we presented in the article.  We hope this helps the reader to avoid problems and errors when completing the intended product. </p>
