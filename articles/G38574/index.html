In fact, this tariff is a real anti-crisis solution.  But why is it called that?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  But before that it‚Äôs worth a little talk with you about what the ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù tariff ‚ÄúGo to zero‚Äù is.  We always have time to read reviews about it.  But understanding what we have to deal with is a much more important issue.  After all, maybe you decide to no longer be interested in this plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff megaphone go to zero reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/871144.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that our today's ‚Äúobject‚Äù is something that will suit those customers who have the majority of the environment using Megafon.  Indeed, the main feature of the tariff are free calls of 20 minutes per day to your operator‚Äôs numbers within your region.  As a rule, this is very attractive to customers.  The tariff "Megaphone" - "Go to zero" (Rostov region or any other region) - this is what can facilitate the communication of loved ones and friends.  Let's try to figure out what customers think about <span>this tariff plan</span> .  After all, they will help to form a general impression of our today's ‚Äúfacility‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About calls within Russia </h2><p>  Tariff "Megaphone" "Go to zero" reviews are quite positive.  And they usually begin with the main advantage of this plan - with calls within Russia and within the home region. </p><p>  As already mentioned, if you call Megafon subscribers within your region, then such calls will cost 0 rubles.  More precisely, their first 20 minutes.  With all this, then you have to pay 60 cents per minute.  Not a very big cost.  In addition, calls to home numbers, as well as to other operators, will cost 1.2 rubles. </p><p>  If you connect the option "All calls" to yourself, then you can rejoice - all calls will cost 60 kopecks.  As many users note, this is a very advantageous and suitable offer for those who like to communicate.  But what else does the Megafon tariff ‚ÄúGo to zero‚Äù receive?  We will talk about this later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff megaphone go to zero Rostov region" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/871145.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Another rather interesting point that we have not yet taken into account regarding calls is outside of your region.  You will spend 3 rubles per minute on Megafon in Russia, and 12.5 rubles on all other operators and city numbers.  That's all the problems. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  The tariff "Megaphone" - "Go to zero" (Rostov region or any other region) is famous not only for calls and free calls.  There is another very important point, which, as noted by customers, cannot but rejoice.  What is it about?  Of course, about the messages.  After all, it is they who occupy the second place in importance when choosing a tariff plan by a modern user. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thing is that you have the opportunity to send free ‚Äúsms‚Äù to any numbers within your region.  To do this, connect yourself "SMS XXS".  In the absence of this option, 1 message will cost 1 ruble 60 kopecks.  For other regions - 3 rubles.  But any MMS messages will cost customers 7 rubles. </p><p>  As many subscribers say, the prices here are quite sparing.  True, this is not all the points that customers emphasize.  Let's try to figure out what else you can pay attention to. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff megaphone go to zero Moscow" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/871146.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Other countries </h2><p>  The tariff "Megaphone" "Go to zero" (Moscow or any other city) gives us a great opportunity to always stay in touch.  No matter where your interlocutor is.  After all, this tariff is what a traveler or just a lover needs to talk to. </p><p>  As many subscribers say, you can calmly talk with <span>the Baltic countries, the</span> CIS, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Ukraine and Georgia.  And with all this, 1 minute of conversation will cost you 35 rubles.  This is not so much as it might seem at first glance.  Especially when compared with other operators.  For example, some of them require 100 rubles per minute. </p><p>  Regarding Europe, too, everything is much better than it seems.  For a minute of conversation you will pay only 55 rubles.  As you can see, there are no sky-high prices either.  Some operators offer calls in Europe from 100 to 150 rubles.  In the remaining corners of the globe, conversations of 97 rubles will cost you.  Fairly favorable and good offer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff megaphone go to zero Kursk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/871147.jpg"></div>
      <br>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  The quality of communication when making calls to remote corners of the Earth, as noted by customers, is very pleasing.  Network failures are virtually non-existent.  And this is an important point that should be taken into account when connecting the tariff and planning dialogs abroad.  Well, we are moving forward.  There is one more rather important point that is worth considering. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  What is left for us?  Of course, the tariff <span>"Megaphone" "Go to zero"</span> (Kursk or any other city) should also include special features for the Internet.  They help us stay connected, regardless of location.  And so it‚Äôs worth figuring out if everything is so good at this point. </p><p>  Unfortunately, not everything pleases customers.  The tariff "Megaphone" "Go to zero", reviews regarding the mobile Internet receive far from the best.  The thing is that in order to get free access to the World Wide Web, you will have to pay to connect an additional option called "Internet XS".  Otherwise, you have to pay 9.9 rubles for 1 megabyte of data. </p><p>  The first thing that does not please customers anymore is the cost of traffic.  You can find something more worthwhile.  And the quality of Internet connection is not particularly pleasing to subscribers.  Thus, this is the weakest point of the tariff plan.  However, with an additional package of services connected <span>(its monthly fee</span> is 200 rubles), no problems will arise.  Nevertheless, you can choose a cheaper tariff if you plan to use exclusively the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff megaphone go to zero tyumen" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/871148.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The tariff "Megaphone" "Go to zero" (Tyumen or any other city) is a real anti-crisis solution for those who plan to communicate by making calls.  Especially if in your environment everyone uses the services of one mobile operator.  True, it has its drawbacks. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the tariff "Megfon" "Go to zero" reviews are positive in most cases.  As already mentioned, if you decide to use this mobile operator for the Internet, it is best to either connect a special package, or choose a different tariff plan altogether. </p>
