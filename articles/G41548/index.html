    <p>  According to some users and experts, the phone in question has something special that compares favorably with other budget models: an approach to design.  In this sense, the most affordable devices from Nokia are not much different from premium models.  The Lumia line is characterized by a noticeable dissimilarity of individual devices in terms of hardware, but the appearance of all devices is uniform and equally attractive. </p><p>  Another interesting feature of the Nokia Lumiya 530 phone (reviews by many experts confirm this) is that it unifies with flagship models in terms of software as well.  The interface structure of the Windows Phone 8.1 OS installed in the device is almost the same as in the premium devices of the Lumia line from Microsoft. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Construction and appearance </h2><p>  We begin a detailed study of the phone with its <span>appearance.</span>  As some experts note, the design of the device in question is to some extent similar to that developed for the Lumia 510 smartphone (despite the fact that the appearance of the devices is uniform throughout the entire lineup).  The material of the phone case is of excellent quality plastic.  The controls of the smartphone are standard and their location implies a very high comfort of using the device.  If you remove the back cover from the phone, you will see slots for additional memory cards and SIM cards, as well as the device‚Äôs battery. </p>

    <p>  Owners do not record any backlashes, obvious creaks during the operation of the smartphone.  Convenience of use and high build quality are the key, according to many users, characteristics of the appearance and design of the Nokia Lumiya 530.  The reviews of many experts in the field of mobile gadgets are generally close to this assessment.  From this point of view, the device in question compares favorably with many budget models of smartphones. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs display has the same diagonal as the Lumia 520 phone, however, the resolution is slightly different - 854 by 840 pixels (800 by 480 in the 520 model).  Such a difference, according to some experts, is due to the desire of designers to provide playback on screen video in 16: 9 format.  Experts attribute the fact that the pixel density in the phone is higher than in the indicated analogue: the Lumia 520 screen is characterized by an indicator of 235 ppi, the model in question is 246 ppi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the same time, the display that is present on the Nokia Lumiya 530 phone (reviews by many enthusiasts of mobile gadgets reflect a not entirely positive assessment of this feature) is made using relatively outdated TN technology.  While the standard solution, even for many budget devices, is an IPS-type matrix.  The screen, made by TN technology, in general, has good performance characteristics - in terms of support for the Multitouch option, for example, however, it has small viewing angles.  In addition, in bright lighting, glare appears on the TN-type display.  The developers of this smartphone model, in addition, did not begin to equip the device screen with an oleophobic coating - which, in principle, can also be considered a standard solution even in the segment of budget devices.  This feature predetermines tangible difficulties with the removal of various contaminants from the display, as well as fingerprints. </p>

    <p>  The phone does not have a function to automatically adjust the screen brightness.  But this is not related to the quality of the corresponding hardware component - the smartphone simply does not have <span>a light sensor</span> installed <span>.</span>  However, according to customer reviews of Nokia Lumia 530, the absence of this option predetermines a minimum of inconvenience.  In addition, as smartphone users note, you can always change the brightness of the device‚Äôs screen manually - by choosing its low, medium or high level (but these options are not fixed, you can use the smooth way to determine the optimal screen brightness). </p><p>  The display of the smartphone allows, thanks to Multitouch technology, to process up to 5 simultaneous finger touches.  Experts, as well as device users, rate the quality of the corresponding function as high. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The Nokia Lumiya 530 phone (reviews of some users are also not very positive in this part) has only one camera located at the back of the device.  The lack of frontal is criticized by fans of "selfie" and talking on Skype.  And this despite the fact that on many competing models - 2 cameras.  Also, many users complain that the corresponding hardware component is not equipped with either a flash or autofocus.  However, the camera has a good resolution - 5 MP.  The quality of the images under adequate environmental conditions is characterized by users and specialists as quite decent.  And this despite the fact that much more pronounced portions of criticism in terms of image quality sometimes go to premium models of smartphones.  By the way, not all the flagships of the leaders in the market of mobile gadgets are equipped with the same autofocus function. </p><h2>  Camera: variety of software </h2><p>  At the disposal of users - a variety of software that allows you to use the capabilities of the camera, which is equipped with a smartphone "Nokia Lumiya 530".  Feedback from experts and users regarding the convenience of the respective solutions is the most positive.  The main application with which you can take pictures is ‚ÄúLumia Camera‚Äù.  Among its notable options is the setting of the necessary parameters for shutter speed, ISO, exposure, and white balance.  There is such a useful function as bracketing, which allows you to shoot frames in series at different exposure settings.  You can use the Camera app, which was developed by Microsoft.  In the Windows Phone ‚Äústore‚Äù you can download other useful types of software - such as, for example, ‚ÄúLumia Panorama‚Äù. </p><p>  The camera on which the Nokia Lumiya 530 phone is equipped (the reviews of the smartphone‚Äôs owners characterizing the corresponding option are very positive) can shoot videos in good quality - 854 by 480 pixels and at a speed of 30 frames per second.  Video content is recorded in MP4 format files. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Like other devices of the Lumia line, the device in question is characterized by excellent sound reproduction quality, and in all modes - through the speaker or when using headphones.  True, the headset must be bought separately.  It is also necessary to activate the radio option - a signal is caught through it. </p><h2>  Iron and performance </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with a powerful Snapdragon 200 processor with 4 cores.  The chip runs on a Cortex-A7 architecture.  Its clock frequency is 1.2 GHz.  The processor is also equipped with a built-in Adreno 302 graphics processing module, which, experts say, is optimized for working with office software, video files, as well as for launching undemanding games.  The amount of RAM is 512 MB.  It may seem that this is a bit, since many competing budget solutions have an indicator of 1 GB or more.  However, the specifics of the Windows Phone OS is such that it does not need a lot of RAM for its functioning.  The specified amount of RAM is enough to run popular applications and games. </p>

    <h2>  Test results </h2><p>  What about the actual performance of the Nokia Lumia 530?  The reviews of the owners of the device, as well as the opinions of experts characterize this aspect as a whole very positively.  The results of AnTuTu tests can be called quite consistent with this assessment, in one of which the phone, having dialed 11,644, was slightly inferior to a higher-level device - the Lumia 630. In the PhoneMark test, the device in question showed 796 points - the same as the Lumia 635 smartphone. In the MultiBench tests, the device showed results that are also comparable to the numbers for the Lumia 630. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  Consider the communication capabilities that the smartphone ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 530‚Äù has.  User reviews regarding this aspect characterize the device as fully consistent with the needs of modern users.  It has support for the most common wireless interfaces, as well as USB connections.  Many lovers of mobile electronics are impressed by the fact that the phone supports both of the world's largest navigation systems - GPS and GLONASS.  Support for 2 SIM cards in the phone, however, can not be considered full.  Active work is possible with only one of them.  To use the functions of another, as experts say, you must switch to it. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  What can be said about the battery installed on the Nokia Lumiya 530 DS phone?  Reviews in this regard are very different.  The battery capacity of the device is 1430 mAh.  This resource is enough for talking for about 10 hours.  The smartphone is in standby mode, according to the manufacturer - 22 days.  If the phone works only in the playback mode of audio files, then the battery will last 51 hours, if you watch the video on it - for 5.5 hours.  The practical indicators that Nokia Lumiya 530 DS users managed to achieve (the reviews of many experts in the field of mobile gadgets confirm this) are generally comparable with the declared capabilities of the phone. </p><p>  The smartphone is characterized by great convenience of monitoring battery resources.  So, in the phone‚Äôs settings, you can watch the current battery level, as well as receive estimated information about how much more it can work without recharging.  The interface of the corresponding application also allows you to find out which programs from the number of those running on the phone consume more energy than others. </p><p>  It <span>takes</span> about 2 hours to fully <span>charge the</span> smartphone‚Äôs <span>battery</span> .  With an average intensity of using the device‚Äôs battery resources, if you do not recharge it, it lasts about a day.  At the same time, the duration of work can always be increased if, for example, you turn off Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The phone is controlled by the Windows Phone OS in version 8.1, which is characterized, as we noted above, by low demands on hardware. </p>

    <p>  Of the weaknesses noted by users are the lack of a selfie camera, outdated technology in the display structure. </p><h2>  The best combination of quality and price </h2><p>  However, this is insignificant, according to many users, given how low the price set by the manufacturer on the Nokia Lumiya 530 phone is small.  Reviews regarding this aspect are the most enthusiastic.  Now the considered smartphone model is available in Russia for about 3900 rubles.  A device with similar functionality, ease of use and design quality for this price still needs to be searched, users believe.  This view reflects a lot of reviews.  ‚ÄúOh, the Nokia Lumia 530 Dual SIM.  Probably dear? "  - an inexperienced lover of mobile electronics will think when he sees this device with an attractive, high-quality design on the window.  And for sure it will be pleasantly surprised by the affordable price of the device. </p>
