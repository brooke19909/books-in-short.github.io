Each self-respecting insurance company has a website on which anyone can familiarize themselves with its terms and evaluate insurance tariffs - in order to make the right choice.

    <h2>  Endowment Insurance </h2><p>  Also, for citizens of the Russian Federation, the use of endowment insurance is possible.  It is characterized in that the amount of compensation can be received even if no insurance circumstances or events have occurred.  Savings programs provide for a certain rate of income, and the amount will depend on which initial conditions are selected in the tariffication.  This program is convenient in that payments can be assigned for a certain period, for example, when a certain age is reached.  With such a program, you can have a guarantee that a specific amount will be received at the right time.  The frequency with accumulative insurance can be very different - up to a lifetime.  Payments can also be done at one‚Äôs own discretion - both in favor of oneself and transferred to other persons who are related to these payments under an agreement drawn up for health and life insurance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cost of an insurance premium or premium may depend on a large number of conditions - from which tariffs and insurance conditions are chosen, to what a person's age, state of health and living conditions are.  More accurate information about life or health insurance should first be obtained from the insurance companies themselves. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health and life insurance cost" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11525/394173.jpg?1399829025945" width="200"></div></h2><h2>  Military Liability Insurance </h2><p>  There is another important point in insurance - the state ensures that the life and health of military personnel are insured without fail.  Mandatory state insurance is an attempt to help those who have lost their lives or health while protecting the Fatherland.  All military personnel are subject to such insurance from the moment they join the Armed Forces until the last day of their service.  But, it must be borne in mind that the validity of this insurance continues for a whole year after leaving the Armed Forces in the event that the onset of death or disability was associated with injuries or illnesses received during military service. </p><p>  To carry out life and health insurance for military personnel, the state allocates billions of dollars.  But not all of this money goes to those who need it.  This is due to the fact that people are not aware of their rights in financial, pension and insurance matters.  In order not to lose the money that is supposed to be received according to the current legislation and legal documents, you must have at least basic knowledge for those areas of life that you encounter or that you will have to face.  In particular, life and health insurance during military service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Russian laws imply that persons who are in military service are insured by the executive branch, or rather, those of its federal bodies that provide for military service.  These bodies may be the Ministry of Defense, Internal Affairs, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Penal Correction Service, the Federal Guard Service and others like them.  The insurers themselves are insurance companies licensed to provide compulsory state insurance, which have concluded relevant agreements with federal bodies.  The funds allocated to the tasks of compulsory state insurance of military personnel are allocated by the federal budget. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life and health insurance programs" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11525/394176.jpg?1399829098050" width="541"></div></h2><h2>  Who is responsible for the insurance of military personnel </h2><p>  To whom exactly does the state trust the tasks of <span>compulsory insurance of</span> military personnel?  In 2011, these tasks were carried out by the MAKS insurance company, and earlier, in the period since 1993, VSK Insurance House was engaged in the insurance tasks of the Ministry of Defense.  But everything changed by 2009, when Rosgosstrakh won the tender.  The following year, 2010, a closed competition was organized, to which VSK Insurance House was not admitted.  Those who have not received the due insurance payments know that the Ministry of Defense was suing VSK Insurance House, lodging claims in the amount of 130 million rubles, justifying this with lost payments.  Internal troops belonging to the Ministry of Internal Affairs insure Rosgosstrakh. </p><h2>  How to use insurance benefits </h2><p>  In order to deal with insurance, you need to take into account that there are not only Federal Laws and Government Decisions, but also various departmental acts in huge numbers, and far from everything is in the public domain.  Thus, it is not easy to use any benefits available in these acts even with the help of experienced lawyers.  But at the same time, for these benefits implies continuous funding from the budget.  In this way, the insurance protection of military personnel is very seriously confused. </p>

    <h2>  Personal insurance </h2><p>  Military personnel in the service of the Ministry of the Interior are subject to a mandatory life and health insurance contract by the state, namely, personal insurance.  If an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs died or died before the year expired after leaving the service, and his death is related to injuries or illnesses incurred while serving, his family should expect to receive a lump-sum allowance, the amount of which is ten-year monetary support for the employee.  For these purposes, there is an appropriate budget, and the amount itself is subsequently recovered from those who are directly guilty of his death. </p><h2>  Cases of payments and their conditions </h2><p>  Compulsory life and health insurance for military personnel provides the following benefits.  If an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs receives bodily injuries that prevent him from serving in the future, then he can count on receiving a one-time allowance, the amount of which is five years' salary, and again the amount is recovered from those who are guilty of this. </p><p>  When an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is injured or otherwise injures his health, he is entitled to receive monetary compensation, which should exceed the pension amount.  But these funds are paid either by the corresponding budget, or by organizations that have concluded an agreement with the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  If the damage is received by the property of an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs or his relatives, the funds are transferred from the budget, and then are recovered from those who are guilty of this. </p><p>  So, you can pay attention to the fact that receiving a lump-sum allowance and compensating for damage can only be done when the official activity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs employee was the cause of the incident leading to the death, injuries or damage to property. </p>

    <h2>  Cases of death and conditions for <span>payment of compensation to the</span> family of the deceased </h2><p>  In cases where the insured soldier dies, insurance payments may be received by his spouse, with whom marriage, parents or adoptive parents were registered at the time of death.  Also, if the deceased insured serviceman did not have parents, provided they are maintained or raised by their grandparents for at least three years, they can also receive insurance payments.  If stepfather and stepmother were engaged in upbringing and maintenance for five years, then they also qualify for insurance.  Also, if the children of a military serviceman are under the age of 18, or if they have received disability before the age of 18, if they are studying in any educational institution before the age of 23, they are also entitled to insurance payments. </p><h2>  Insured events under a compulsory insurance contract </h2><p>  Insured events in case of compulsory state insurance of persons performing military service is death during service, or in the event that one year has not expired after leaving it as a result of injury or illness resulting from service.  This may be a disability during service or before one year has passed after leaving it as a result of injury or illness resulting from service.  An insured event may be in the event of the dismissal of a soldier, if the military medical commission found him unfit for service in the Armed Forces due to injury or illness received during military service or training. </p>
