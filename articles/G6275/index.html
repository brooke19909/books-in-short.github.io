A wonderful area that Sochi boasts is Adler.  Hotel Variant is far from the only complex here, but it can become a good place for a vacation, and therefore it can be considered as one of the options.  Adler has an incredibly large selection of lodging: motels, <span>hotels,</span> guest houses, health centers and even campsites on the wild coast. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Variant (Adler) is located right on the seafront, and next to it is a spa town.  Two kilometers away, in the village of Khosta, a yew-boxwood grove grows, which is the only place in Adler protected by UNESCO. </p>

    <p>  The city of Adler is a resort where there is an Amphibius water park with many water attractions and pools, as well as the Aquatoria Dolphinarium, an aquarium, nightclubs and restaurants. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Hotel Variant (Adler), the photo of which is given in the article, is located in a very convenient location.  Next to it there are many entertainments that will be interesting not only for adults, but also for children.  While relaxing in Adler, it‚Äôs impossible not to visit the Amphibius water park.  It works from the beginning of June to September.  You can safely go here with the whole family, since there are not only adults, but also children's attractions.  The most terrible slide called "Kamikaze" is only by the bravest.  The speed of descent on it is an average of 10 meters per second.  The largest pool in the entertainment center is 24 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  No less interesting for vacationers will be a visit to the Akhshtyrskaya cave.  In the mountains near Sochi, archaeologists have found many grottoes (about 400), but only a few are of interest to science.  On the way to Krasnaya Polyana, just fifteen kilometers from the coast, is the most famous Caucasian cave - Akhshtyrskaya.  It is not very large, but very ancient.  Now all scientific research is over, and the cave is open to tourists.  It is certainly worth a visit to find out the most interesting story.  From Adler to the cave, you can drive yourself on buses number 135 and 131. </p>

    <p>  The whole family should go to the dolphinarium, where you can see the performance of belugas, seals, walruses.  Sea inhabitants will amaze you with their tricks.  Among tourists, a trip to the Dzikhrinsk Gorge is very popular.  This place is striking in its pristine beauty.  Ropes of creepers, boxwood walls, centuries-old boulders covered with mosses - all this looks like a fairy tale. </p><p>  In Sochi, you can visit <span>the largest aquarium in Russia.</span>  It contains about thirty aquariums in which marine and freshwater inhabitants live.  The rooms are decorated in the form of rainforests with waterfalls, lakes and cliffs.  The most impressive is the walk through the tunnel, which is 44 meters long.  It‚Äôs the same as sinking to the bottom of the ocean, and marine inhabitants float around you from all sides. </p>

    <p>  For children, a trip to the Adler‚Äôs monkey nursery is interesting, in which about two thousand primates live: macaques, baboons, rhesus, green monkeys and many others.  On the outskirts of the city is a dendrological park called Southern Cultures.  Of course, many tropical plants grow on the streets of Adler, but there is something to see in the garden.  It presents cultures from Africa, China and Japan. </p><h2>  Hotel Variant (Adler): reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has a great location.  Firstly, it is located in the very center of Adler, and secondly, right on the coast.  Not every complex can boast of such proximity to the sea. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the Hotel Variant (Adler, Russia) is a great cozy place for a good family vacation.  The rooms are clean and beautiful, they are equipped with everything necessary.  Especially comfortable and nice apartments with kitchens.  They are usually happy to order couples with young children.  Near the hotel there are shops where you can buy everything you need.  Near the complex there are several tour agencies that organize trips to local attractions.  The prices are the same as at the hotel reception, so there‚Äôs no reason to go anywhere, because everything can be ordered on the spot.  Yes, and many places can be reached on their own. </p>

    <p>  Dining at the hotel is organized according to several options, so vacationers have the right to choose the most suitable.  The complex's cafe serves tasty and good dishes, so you can safely choose a full board.  If you do not plan to sit still and intend to see the most interesting places of Adler and Sochi, then it is probably easier for you to take only a continental breakfast, so as not to rush for lunch and dinner. </p><p>  The hotel has a small but pretty well-kept area.  Of course, here you will not find a chic atmosphere in the rooms and a huge selection of dishes in the dining room, since this place is focused on budget holidays.  Therefore, the complex is more suitable for vacationers who do not want to overpay for certain benefits.  The hotel is open all year round, so it is ready to receive guests at any time.  Even in winter, there are many tourists who want to celebrate the New Year outside their hometown. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Variant in Adler can be recommended to vacationers as a budget holiday.  If you do not count on the benefits provided by five-star hotels, then you can very well choose this complex located on the seashore, since it corresponds to the price-quality ratio. </p>

    <p>  It is especially good in the summer, when the main selection criterion is the proximity of the beach.  The sea, the sun and the beautiful coast are the main components of a good vacation.  All this you can find in Adler. </p>
