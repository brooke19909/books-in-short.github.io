Almost all such screens can be mounted on a stand or hung on a wall using a special mount. </p><p>  The decision to buy a wall stand for TV and fix it on the wall is an excellent option to get rid of annoying nightstands and consoles, as well as create an original design solution and save space in the apartment.  This arrangement will also allow you to set the screen under the desired angle at a comfortable height.  Thus, you can block the access of young children to the technique.  Often, the abundance of types, sizes and design features of fasteners causes some difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knowtechie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wall mounted tv" class="if uuid-2256811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2256811.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the features of mounting wall-mounted TVs and the types of holders in this article. </p><h2>  Types of Holders </h2><ul><li>  Fixed - the easiest holder that takes up almost no space.  The inability to adjust and the design cause a fairly low cost for this type of device. </li><li>  Inclined type is a fairly common part.  It makes it possible to change the position of the installed screen vertically.  The holder has smaller dimensions than a tilt-swivel, as well as a lower price. </li><li>  Tilt-swivel is a multifunctional TV wall mount that is designed to rotate and tilt the screen in any direction.  The main feature of this model is its wide scope for adjusting equipment.  Tilt and rotation can be adjusted so that viewing is comfortable from anywhere in the room.  The price of such a mount is relatively higher than the previous ones. </li><li>  Ceiling - ergonomic holder.  Provides a wide screen tilt and the ability to change the angle of rotation.  However, for rooms with low ceilings, this type cannot be installed.  But the owners of spacious apartments can allow the <span>ceiling bracket for the TV</span> and, according to their preference, change its positioning. </li></ul><h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  Wall mounts for TVs have a number of characteristics that determine their compatibility with technology.  Typically, television mounts are universal, but in their reviews, many recommend purchasing a model of a mounting element that is compatible with your premises and equipment.  In this case, you will be sure of the compatibility of the mount and get excellent visibility from anywhere in the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is necessary to pay attention to: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.selby.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV holder" class="if uuid-2256826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2256826.jpg"></div><ul><li>  universality - additional shelves for synchronization with the TV; </li><li>  destination - for the liquid crystal, plasma or electron beam television; </li><li>  compatibility with screens from 20 to 65 inches; </li><li>  maximum load - the weight withstanding the screen; </li><li>  safety - a protective box for wires; </li><li>  color and design. </li></ul><h2>  Performance data </h2><p>  The most important parameter of the wall mount for the TV is the permissible load.  It indicates the weight of the TV holder supports.  Universality is the next characteristic that determines what size the design is designed for diagonally.  Manufacturers usually indicate a size range of 32-55 inches, for example.  Often <span>brackets for TVs</span> are equipped with a protective box in which the wires are laid, as well as additional shelves for installing a media player, tuner or home theater receiver. </p><h2>  From Samsung </h2><p>  Specialists of the Samsung trademark developed the WMN350M holder, which covers a wide variety of panel diagonals.  For different sizes of diagonals and series, you can suspend the TV screen at a distance of 17 to 40 mm from the wall.  This gives ample space on the back of the TV for connecting cables.  Connecting the device will no longer be a problem, even if the cable is slightly wider and larger than usual. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="palettesnquills.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wall-mounted TVs and their mount" class="if uuid-2256821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2256821.jpg"></div><p>  To hang Samsung wall-mounted TVs on a wall, you do not need to spend a lot of time and effort.  Wall mounting the plasma panel with the new WMN350M wall mount is quick, easy and safe.  This bracket model is able to withstand a maximum load of up to 220 kg (weight of the largest Samsung models).  The user manual, in order to avoid any difficulties, along with the installation guide lists all supported models. </p><h2>  Reliable and stylish </h2><p>  The 32-inch SONY KDL32RE303BR wall-mounted TV is designed to give you a realistic picture and surround sound.  This TV model is capable of displaying a rich and clear image with high detail on the screen.  The stability of the screen is provided by an ergonomic stand.  For wall mounting, a VESA 100x100 standard bracket can be used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wall-mounted modern TV" class="if uuid-2256830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2256830.jpg"></div><p>  This TV is protected against moisture, dust and power surges by the X-Protection PRO system. </p><h2>  How not to make a mistake in choosing </h2><p>  <span>Wall mounts for a TV</span> have a number of characteristics that determine their compatibility with the device: </p><ul><li>  Check what design and type of holder you‚Äôve chosen and how much is suitable for your room. </li><li>  Make sure that the selected type of fixture according to the weight characteristics matches the characteristics of your TV model. </li><li>  Make sure that all necessary parts are included in the kit: cables, bolts and special fasteners. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount for TV wall" class="if uuid-2256834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2256834.jpg"></div></li><li>  Make sure that there are no difficulties with installation: for concrete and brick walls there are no certain strict requirements.  But for walls made of drywall, a special approach is needed.  In this case, choose a bracket for a wall-mounted TV with a wide platform, and it is advisable to first get advice from a specialist. </li><li>  Make sure that the holder model you select is backed by warranty service. </li><li>  For owners of large home cinemas, it will be useful to decide whether you need an automatic bracket that automatically changes the position of the screen with the remote control.  Such an arm is not cheap, but tilting and turning it manually is not easy. </li></ul><h2>  TOSHIBA 32W3753DG TV </h2><p>  Another model of wall-mounted TV from TOSHIBA is made in a black plastic case.  Due to its small dimensions, this TV does not take up much space even in a small room.  And the implemented VESA 200x100 mounting standard provides the ability to mount the screen on the ceiling or wall using a special mount. </p><h2>  Recommendations for installation and operation </h2><p>  If you have already chosen the most suitable wall mount for the new screen, pay the main attention to the tips on the proper installation and use of the wall shelf for the TV: </p><div class="photo" data-original="amipublic.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV bracket" class="if uuid-2256833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2256833.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The assembly procedure and steps are the principal sections in the instructions that must be followed impeccably. </li><li>  The most successful, reliable and simple fixation of the holder is in the corner of the room. </li><li>  Accurately measure the height during installation and check how comfortable the image is perceived.  The screen, which is located at a low height (just above eye level), is best suited for vision. </li></ul><p>  In numerous reviews, buyers of modern plasma panels talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this method of mounting a wall-mounted television - on the wall or under the ceiling.  Most respondents noted the convenience of placing the screen anywhere in the room, as well as the ability to protect it from mechanical damage, improve the interior and save space. </p>
