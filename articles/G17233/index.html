A. Komensky.  He introduced a clear distribution of time for training and rest of students, the practice of teaching with a constant composition of students.  Soon <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  The classroom system of Y. A. Komensky has found its rightful place in the educational systems of the whole world. <strong> </strong></p><p>  <strong>The lesson as the main form of training has</strong> stood the test of time, despite the numerous attempts of teachers to get away from a fixed period of time in the organization of the educational process.  The ideas of ‚Äúfree education and training‚Äù, reformatory pedagogy and the alternative education movement undoubtedly influenced the traditional lesson, but could not move it from a leading position as the main form of organization of school education. </p><p>  <strong>A lesson as a main form of learning</strong> has its advantages. <strong> </strong>  This short period of time is a key component of the educational process, has a semantic, temporal and organizational completeness, is a holistic education that allows you to solve a set of educational <span>goals and objectives.</span> </p><p>  According to the main didactic goal, the following types of lessons are traditionally distinguished: </p><p>  a) a lesson in the study of new educational material in the subject; </p><p>  b) the lesson of consolidating knowledge and improving skills; </p><p>  c) a lesson in repetition (systematization, generalization); </p><p>  d) a lesson in the control and correction of knowledge, skills. </p><p>  The most common type is considered a combined lesson. </p><p>  <strong>A lesson as the main form of learning is</strong> not a frozen education.  It is amazing how much novelty and non-standardization a professional teacher can invest in this short period of time.  Constantly in pedagogical practice, new methodological findings appear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to increase students' interest in school activities in the 70s.  XX century, a new phenomenon appeared - non-standard lessons, that is, impromptu training sessions with an unconventional structure.  <span>Non-standard lessons</span> became popular - a business game, competition, travel, court, auction, excursion and others. </p><p>  <strong>A lesson as the main form of learning</strong> undergoes not only structural changes, but also experiences socially new requirements. </p><p>  A modern qualitative lesson is obliged to use the latest achievements of science and pedagogical practice.  The teacher must provide conditions for the productive <span>cognitive activity of</span> students, taking into account their personal characteristics;  to promote students' awareness of interdisciplinary connections, the formation of motivation and activation of the individual in the educational process.  This is not a complete list of requirements, due to the modern demands of society for graduates of educational institutions.  Social requirements are specified in the triune goal of each individual lesson: to educate, educate, develop. </p><p>  <strong>A lesson as a form of training</strong> obliges teachers to systematically plan <span>pedagogical activities.</span> <strong> </strong>  Preparation includes thematic planning of a lesson system on a given topic and lesson planning of one specific lesson. </p><p>  The effectiveness of the lesson, as well as the result of all school education, depends on the thorough preparation of the teacher.  The necessary stages of preparation are: diagnosis of the state of the quality of student knowledge and motivation, forecasting results, designing joint activities. </p><p>  The logical construction of the lesson, combined with the optimal selection of methods, techniques, <span>teaching aids,</span> allows you to achieve the highest possible learning outcomes. </p><p>  However, to conduct a quality lesson at a high modern level is not always possible even for an experienced teacher. </p>
