But, unfortunately, over time, most consumers are faced with such a problem as the deterioration of sound quality, the reasons for this can be very different.  In some cases, you can try to fix the problem yourself.  In the article you will find information on why one earphone is quieter than the other, as well as simple ways to troubleshoot. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  The most common reason why 1 earphone is quieter than the other is due to the following factors: </p><ol><li>  If only one earphone works worse, the sound is quieter, crackling or extraneous noise is heard, it is possible that the contact is closed on the case.  It is necessary to inspect the plug for a breakdown. </li><li>  One of the two speakers was demagnetized, as a result, the sound became quieter.  A high-quality accessory does not have such defects, but cheap Chinese devices have such a problem.  It is impossible to repair the headphones in this case, it is better to purchase new ones. </li><li>  During prolonged use of the product, small debris may clog into the headphones, which impairs sound quality.  It is recommended to disassemble and clean the device. </li><li>  If the music in the headphones is different, you need to check the balance in the device settings. </li><li>  If there is a violation of the volume in one of the speakers, it is advisable to check them on another device.  If the sound is better, it's all about the gadget settings. </li><li>  Excessive humidity, dropping with a blow, damage to the cord may also affect the functions of the device. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="es.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why does one earphone run quieter than the other airpods" class="if uuid-3115255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3115255.jpg"></div><h2>  Human factor </h2><p>  The younger generation prefers to listen to music, turning it on at full capacity.  Even using miniature headphones, such a habit over time is reflected in the organ of hearing.  After a long listening time in this mode, it begins to seem to a person that the sound is not so loud or one earphone began to work quieter than the other.  Why it happens?  It's all about the excessive load on the eardrum.  In this case, you should refrain from listening to loud music for several days.  If the hearing has not returned to normal, consultation with an otolaryngologist is necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kind.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why one earphone is quieter than the other" class="if uuid-3115249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3115249.jpg"></div><h2>  Clean the headphone mesh </h2><p>  As a rule, in people involved in sports with headphones, the device crashes faster.  This is caused by increased sweating during the training.  Sweat mixes with fat and clogs the headphone mesh.  Sulfur grease protects the human hearing.  However, when it hits the surface of the earphone inserted into the auricle, the miniature mesh gets clogged and it seems that the device's sound quality has deteriorated.  Cleaning and washing the mesh with available means will help get rid of the problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buzzfeed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why 1 earphone is quieter than the other" class="if uuid-3115254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3115254.jpg"></div><p>  If you are the owner of an ‚Äúapple‚Äù device and don‚Äôt know why one Airpods earphone is quieter than another, then perhaps the problem lies in the pollution of the sound channel. </p><p>  How to do it: </p><ol><li>  In any pharmacy, a solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide is purchased.  By the way, it is often used to clean the ears of sulfur plugs, since the liquid has the ability to dissolve accumulations.  Alcohol is also suitable if it is at hand.  Liquid perfectly dissolves fat. </li><li>  In a small container, alcohol or peroxide solution is poured onto the bottom.  Protective rubber bands are removed from the product, and then part of the earphone with the net is lowered into the solution and fixed to the edge of the container with a clothespin or other way so that the accessory does not completely fall into the liquid.  Attention: it is completely impossible to immerse the ‚Äúear‚Äù so that the speaker does not deteriorate. </li><li>  After 10 minutes, the headphones are removed and suspended so that the liquid does not flow inside, and left to dry completely. </li></ol><p>  If the problem was a dirty mesh, the sound quality should improve after such a procedure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabhow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why did one earphone run quieter than another" class="if uuid-3115253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3115253.jpg"></div><h2>  Damaged wire </h2><p>  If you cleaned the accessory and still do not know why one earphone is quieter than the other, it is worth inspecting the wire. </p><p>  To check for damaged wires, the headphones must be turned on when turned on, slightly twitch near the socket and at the point where the wire enters the head of the headphone.  If you hear crackles, hissing, fluctuations in volume, then the problem is damage to the cord or poor contact. </p><p>  If there is no sound at all, this is definitely a break.  If you have some skills, you can fix the earphone yourself or entrust this work to a specialist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabhow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphone cleaning completely" class="if uuid-3115260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3115260.jpg"></div><h2>  Connectivity issues </h2><p>  If the accessory is new or there were no malfunctions, why does one earphone work quieter than the other?  Perhaps the problem lies in the connection. </p><p>  Let's understand: </p><ol><li>  First of all, it is necessary to check whether the plug fully enters the connector.  If it is half shoved, there may be no sound at all or it is poorly distinguishable. </li><li>  Then it must be removed and inserted several times, scroll in the inserted form.  This is especially recommended if the phone is new.  As a result, the volume balance is restored. </li><li>  The most common cause of sound degradation is oxides, clogged dirt or debris.  In most cases, you can fix the problem simply by brushing the headphones with a cotton swab, brush or toothpick.  Picking a device and opening it without the proper skill is not worth it.  It is also worth considering that the port of the plug input can be clogged with dirt. </li><li>  Headphones, especially vacuum ones, are recommended to be inspected, wiped, checked on different devices. </li><li>  If we are talking about low-quality sound in the phone iPhone 7 models or older, it is recommended to connect headphones through Lighting or an adapter. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphonehacks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why does one earphone run quieter than another iphone" class="if uuid-3115250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3115250.jpg"></div><h2>  IPhone Settings </h2><p>  Why does one earphone work quieter than the other when connected in such devices?  This is a frequent question for inexperienced users. </p><p>  Not everyone knows that in the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù settings there is a setting that allows you to set a different volume for each headphone.  It is intended for people with hearing impairment, and few people are interested in these parameters. </p><p>  The action algorithm here is as follows: </p><ul><li>  The "Settings" tab opens; in it, "Basic" and "Universal Access" are selected. </li><li>  Scroll the screen and select "Adjust volume balance between left and right channels." </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="inewscast.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sound setting" class="if uuid-3115257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3115257.jpg"></div><p>  Here it is necessary to check, perhaps, the incorrectly placed balance and is responsible for the unevenly distributed sound in the headphones.  It is worth noting that even if the slider is exactly in the middle, it can be adjusted for yourself so that it sounds the same for both channels. </p><p>  Sometimes the difference in sound is due to various kinds of software failures in iOS.  In such cases, it is mandatory to completely reboot the device and restore the system. </p><p>  If none of the above troubleshooting methods has helped, and you still do not know why one earphone is quieter than the other, you need to contact a wizard for qualified help. </p>
