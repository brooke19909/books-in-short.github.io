Republic of Armenia: Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of <span>Armenia,</span> whose <span>sights</span> number in the thousands, has an eloquent characteristic - the “Country Museum”.  In this land, ancient civilizations once flourished, which left behind pagan temples.  But in Armenia there are many Christian shrines.  Traveling around the country can be compared to pilgrimage - there are so many monasteries and churches with miraculous icons. </p><p>  The capital of Armenia is Yerevan.  This is a very ancient city.  But beyond its borders, the state does not count sights.  One cannot be silent about the natural beauties of Armenia.  The South Caucasus with <span>Mount Ararat</span> (where, according to legend, the ark of Noah moored after the Flood), <span>Lake Sevan,</span> Garni Gorge - this is not a complete list of attractions.  All of them attract tourists from different countries.  In this article we will talk about the sights that Armenia is rightfully proud of - Garni. </p>

    <h2>  Gorge </h2><p>  With this name in the country there are several objects.  Firstly, the village of Garni.  It is located just twenty-eight kilometers from Yerevan.  Such proximity to the capital makes it the most visited place by tourists.  The village is located in the Kotay region (Armenia).  Garni is also a gorge along the bottom of which the Azat River flows.  It is interesting in that it contains pentagonal and hexagonal tall columns.  The gorge is famous for its two temples.  They are not connected by a single religion or chronology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of them is an ancient pagan temple.  It is also called Garni.  The second temple is Christian.  He is called Geghard.  Since both sacred structures are located close to each other, they can be visited in the program of one excursion.  Another plus is the presence of a restaurant near the gorge.  As a rule, travel agencies carrying tourists to temples make a stop here for lunch.  In addition to exquisite dishes of Armenian cuisine, here you can enjoy folk songs and dances performed by professional groups. </p>

    <h2>  Garni pagan temple: history </h2><p>  Armenia adopted Christianity very early in the third century.  But in the country, oddly enough, a pagan temple has been preserved.  He was dedicated to Mithra - the god of the Sun.  The temple was saved from destruction by the fact that it was located in a strategically important place.  The temple was fortified in the early ancient (Hellenistic) era.  It was used as a fortress throughout the Middle Ages, until the 1679 earthquake destroyed powerful walls.  In the Soviet period, the citadel was restored and turned into a museum. </p><p>  According to the cuneiform plaque found in Garni, there was already a fortress before the temple of Mithra.  Tsar Urartu Argishti (the one who built the Erebuni citadel, the future Yerevan) conquered it in the first half of the eighth century BC.  And the temple of Garni was erected by the Armenian king Trdat the First in 76 AD.  Its existence is mentioned by Tacitus.  When the temple ceased to serve its intended purpose, it, unlike many pagan temples, was not destroyed or turned into a Christian church.  The construction was simply included in the fortifications.  <span>The Armenian kings</span> made Garni their summer residence because of the favorable climate of the gorge and the inaccessibility of this place.  For more than a thousand years, the fortress has protected its inhabitants from invasions of enemies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the location of the fortress of Garni </h2><p>  The Mithra Temple dominates the area.  It is located in the Garni Gorge in Armenia, where the Azat River makes a sharp turn and forms a triangular cape.  On this raised platform, a temple was erected.  On both sides, the sheer walls of the gorge serve as the most effective defense of the structure.  The amazing slopes of this natural attraction, which look like hexagonal prisms made with human hands, are called “Symphony of stones” in Armenia. </p><p>  Where the alleged enemy could approach the fortress, an impregnable wall was built with fourteen defensive towers.  They ranged unevenly.  Where the enemy was easiest to approach the walls, the towers were ten meters apart, and where it was difficult - 25-30 meters. Despite the fact that the fortress garrison was huge in number, it was possible to get inside the citadel only through the only narrow one chariot wide gates. </p>

    <h2>  Garni Fortress </h2><p>  Just approaching this citadel, seeing how it “hovers” over the surrounding landscape, you are astonished at the skill of medieval architects.  You get even more amazed when you come close to the fortress.  Its towers and walls are erected from huge blocks of smoothly hewn blue basalt.  The blocks were not fastened with mortar, but only stapled and filled with lead at the seams.  Moreover, the thickness of the fortress walls is more than two meters!  Along the perimeter of the fortifications stretch for three hundred and fourteen meters.  This increased defensive ability was caused by the high status of the citadel, which served as the summer residence of the kings, as well as the frequent attacks to which Armenia was subjected at that time.  Garni courageously repulsed all the claims of the enemies. </p>

    <h2>  Temple of Mithras </h2><p>  This ancient structure was built in the Hellenistic style.  Garni Temple is a small rectangular structure surrounded by a colonnade outside.  In the middle of the building there is a hall with a portico, in which, in the pre-Christian era, a statue of Mithra towered.  Small canopies lead into the temple, the entrance to which is richly ornamented.  Wide steps ascend to the facade, the height of each of them is thirty centimeters.  Such elation of the temple gives it solemnity and grandeur.  As for the small details of the decor, the deviation from the Hellenistic canons of the decoration of sacred structures is surprising.  Along with the atlantes on the reliefs of the pylons and acanthus leaf that wraps the columns, national motifs were introduced: flowers, grapes, hazel leaves, pomegranate fruits. </p>

    <h2>  Palace complex </h2><p>  In the tour program, Garni Temple is not the only exhibit.  Indeed, next to the sacred building are other, no less interesting sights.  On the opposite side of the entrance of the citadel is a palace, or rather, what is left of it.  Following the traces of red and pink paint on the walls, you can make an impression of the magnificence of the royal chambers.  At the cliff is the front hall.  The northern fortress wall is adjoined by structures that served as barracks for the garrison and as housing for servants.  There were in the territory of the ancient palace complex and baths.  These baths were built no later than the third century and consisted of five rooms.  On the floor of the baths, an antique mosaic has been preserved. </p><h2>  Geghard </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous monasteries of the Republic of Armenia.  Garni and Geghard are located quite close to each other.  Therefore, sightseers, visiting the ancient temple, immediately visit the Christian <span>monastery.</span>  <span>The monastery is</span> not in vain taken under the auspices of UNESCO.  It arose at the dawn of the adoption of Christianity by Armenia.  At that time, in 301, it consisted of several caves, hollowed out in a rock under cells, in which hermits lived.  It is believed that Gregory the Illuminator lived in the monastery.  At the beginning of the thirteenth century, at the expense of the princes Mkhargrdzeli, a stone temple was built here.  And after a quarter century, three other churches were carved in the rock behind it.  The monastery is also famous for the tombs of princes. </p><h2>  Republic of Armenia: Attractions </h2><p>  Garni and Geghard are not the only places in the country that are of interest to tourists.  Many sights of Armenia are concentrated in its capital.  In Yerevan you should see the Grand Cascade, the <span>Blue Mosque,</span> the Erebuni fortress.  Going to the small town of Areni, you will be rewarded with a tasting of the best <span>Armenian wines.</span>  The country has many ancient temples and monasteries.  Recommended places to visit are Noravank, Haghpat, Geghardavank, Tatev, Sevanavank and Khor Virap. </p>
