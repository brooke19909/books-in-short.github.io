They are undoubtedly high-performance, but, unfortunately, the level of reliability is openly lame.  Many users were faced with the fact that after a fall, even from a small height, cracks appeared on the display or the device completely failed. </p><p>  But not all modern gadgets are so fragile.  Those who value reliability and are ready to sacrifice some innovative technologies are recommended to pay attention to Sigma mobile phones.  Under this brand, truly indestructible devices are sold.  The manufacturer prefers ease of use and practicality.  Such devices, although not equipped with the latest fashion, can well provide the user with a stable cellular signal and a long battery life. </p><p>  Also, Sigma mobile phones, reviews of some models will be considered a little later, they have a simple interface and well-designed ergonomics.  Some copies of the line are equipped with large buttons, which is ideal for the elderly.  It should be noted that the manufacturer does not overstate the cost of their products.  And this, no doubt, makes Sigma phones attractive to a certain audience of customers.  For example, the price of the simplest phone is 1500-2000 rubles.  A ‚Äúsmart‚Äù smartphone equipped with a powerful processor, a capacious battery, decent cameras, will cost from 20 thousand rubles.  Let's look at the characteristics of some models that, according to users, have an optimal price / quality ratio. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phones sigma" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2145612.jpg"></div>
