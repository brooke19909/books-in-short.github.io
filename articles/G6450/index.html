    <h2>  Lotus Resorts 3 *: hotel description </h2><p>  The hotel complex was opened in 2000, and renovated in 2009.  On a small, but well-groomed and cozy area, many varieties of plants have been planted that adorn the modern-style hotel building.  It is very small and neat, even compact, which is normal for India - it is difficult to find huge and elaborate hotels here.  Windows overlook the garden or grounds with the pool. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Lotus Resorts 3 * <strong> </strong>  It is located in <span>South Goa,</span> which, unlike the North, is quite calm and ideal for a quiet holiday.  Geographically located in the village of Benolim (Benaulim), 500 m from the beach of the same name.  5 km from it - the wonderful town of Margao, to the international airport Dabolim - 25 km. </p><p>  Within a radius of 5 km there are 4 more beaches and a stadium, and within 28 km holidaymakers will find the St. Augustine Tower, temples, the Bom Jesus Basilica and the convent.  In addition, nearby there are restaurants, cafes and bars, various shops with groceries and necessary household items. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment for adults and children </h2><p>  Sunsets and sunrises such as on the coast of Candolim, you will not see anywhere else.  Therefore, having rented a car, you should definitely go there, so as not to miss this bewitching action.  Moreover, it is located only 11 km from the hotel. </p><p>  At the Lotus Resorts 3 * hotel there is very little entertainment: there is a swimming pool with a bar, a children's playroom and a playground with a sandbox, table tennis, slot machines, chess.  But this may be enough for a relaxing and relaxed holiday.  Masters make a special massage - Ayurvedic, often used in ancient Indian medicine. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity is Benolim Beach.  It is municipal, so even umbrellas and sunbeds are issued for a fee.  But there are a lot of all kinds of water entertainments, which lovers of an active lifestyle will be happy with, a clean and warm Arabian Sea, which attracts children and lovers to swim calmly, and the sun that warms vacationers on sunbeds. </p><p>  In addition, there is the opportunity to organize a guided tour during which the guide will introduce tourists not only to the state itself, but also to the culture, values, customs and history of India.  Guests will find a trip to the statue of Shiva, a waterfall and a plantation where spices are grown.  During the tour, there is even the opportunity to swim with elephants. </p><p>  The best entertainment for women is shopping.  In local supermarkets and especially pharmacies (they are located next to the hotel) you can find many useful and unusual products, in particular medicines and cosmetics. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Lotus Resorts 3 * offers two bars and a restaurant.  Meals are provided in three types: Bed &amp; Breakfast (BB - breakfast and bed), Half Board (HB - half board), Full Board (FB - full board).  A variety of international and local dishes are served, as well as a special seafood menu. </p><p>  Since the rooms have kitchenettes with everything you need, and 1.5 km from the hotel there is a market, self-catering is possible. </p><p>  Nuances: </p><ul><li>  Check-in is from 14.00, and check-out is from 12.00.  If you need to settle earlier or rent a room later, this requires prior coordination with the administration and a separate fee will be charged. <strong></strong></li><li>  Pets with animals (even if they are service dogs) are prohibited. <strong></strong></li><li>  Children under 5 years stay free of charge;  from 6 to 12 years old - discount. <strong></strong></li><li>  There may be a power outage. <strong></strong></li></ul>

    <h2>  Lotus Resort 3 *: hotel reviews </h2><p>  Most vacationers, if not 100, then 90% were satisfied with the living conditions, service and food.  Despite the fact that the description of the hotel indicates the presence of a refrigerator and a hairdryer, some rooms do not have these items, as many of the guests write.  The maids do their job well and regularly, so the rooms are clean, there is always fresh linen and hygiene kits.  If we talk about the staff as a whole, the hotel guests liked it: friendly and helpful staff. </p><p>  Indian dishes are spicy, but besides them, during breakfast you can find healthy products on the table: cereals, fruits, vegetables, granola, jams, sandwiches and milkshakes.  Those who choose a tour on the BB system have the opportunity to have a delicious dinner with seafood, including delicious fish, right on the beach, which pleased all the tourists. </p><p>  It is necessary to decide in advance whether it is worth organizing a trip through an agency before ordering tours to Goa.  Tour operators' prices are quite high, but upon arrival they often forget about their tourists, if you again believe the reviews of people. </p><p>  Among the main disadvantages are frequent power outages, many mosquitoes and the absence of Russian-language channels.  But an evening without light can be turned into a romantic one, using candles, a fumigator will save you from flying bloodsuckers, and you can do without a TV during your holidays, choosing as an alternative, for example, a walk along the boardwalk.  And then this time spent in Goa will be remembered for a lifetime. </p>
