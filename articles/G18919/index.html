    <h2>  General Provisions </h2><p>  How are human activities and needs related?  Before answering this question, it is worth deciding on concepts.  Activity is a certain type of human activity that is aimed at achieving one or another result.  Motive pushes on its implementation.  He is a kind of motivator - what makes a person act.  Hence the word ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù.  In the end, everything leads to the achievement of a goal that gives one or another result. </p><p>  Need, in turn, is characterized by many scientists as a need or deficit of something that is necessary for a person.  We have a lot of them.  They are divided into categories.  There are spiritual, material, social, psychological, biological needs.  And they are all natural, as their satisfaction fully contributes to the harmonious attitude of a person and his full existence in society. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Intellectual component </h2><p>  You can tell a lot about how activities and needs are related.  And first of all you need to turn to the mind.  More specifically, to the <span>intellectual activity of</span> man.  It involves the receipt of information, its processing and assimilation.  Man is a dubious creature.  And from any information received it is quite capable of extracting benefits for itself.  It is also human nature to learn.  Many go to universities, get education.  They are engaged in self-development: they read, they study languages.  What for?  Because we have a need for self-affirmation.  It is important for a person to feel himself valuable, useful, necessary, possessing certain skills (maybe even unique to some extent).  This is the motive for intellectual activity. </p><h2>  Materiality </h2><p>  Speaking about how activities and needs are connected, one cannot but touch upon such a topic as money.  Everyone needs them.  Because only money gives us the opportunity to buy housing, clean water, food, clothes, a bed for a healthy sleep.  And the need for all of the above is our biological needs.  Free of what we need, we can only get air.  For everything else you have to pay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And we get money only for work and labor.  This is a reward for the benefit brought to the state, society or organization.  By the way, work is also a source of satisfying certain <span>social needs.</span>  Everyone sometimes wants to feel in the spotlight, to receive praise, approval, respect and a share of admiration.  Well, all this can be obtained if you try and overfulfill the plan, for example.  Or achieve other success at work.  Perhaps they will even write out such a trifle as a bonus to a soul and purse that is so pleasant. </p>

    <h2>  Scientific view </h2><p>  They say that human activities and <span>needs are</span> associated with value orientations.  It depends on them what exactly the motive of the personality will be directed to.  Because values ‚Äã‚Äãare the basis for everything.  And beliefs.  These are sustainable principles, ideals and worldviews.  If you think about it, it is precisely values ‚Äã‚Äãwith beliefs that determine not only our activities, but also, in fact, needs. </p><p>  An example is a simple situation.  Man enjoys a rich life.  For him, the main value is an impressive material condition.  And in order to achieve wealth, he will work, plan a business, develop it and think about how you can earn even more.  He is motivated by the result, which is the state.  Here, in principle, this situation shows how the activities and needs of a person are connected. </p>

    <h2>  Continuity </h2><p>  As it was already possible to understand, all the previously listed concepts are directly related to each other.  Need, activity, motive of activity is an inextricable triangle in which one comes from the other. </p><p>  It is important to note that everything carries a focused character.  Whether it is the needs of economic activity or creative.  In any case, human activity is aimed at achieving a particular goal.  It is a fact.  Because aimless activity is not activity.  But just a pastime. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that human activity is characterized by a creative, creative, productive nature.  You can draw a parallel with animals.  The activity shown by our smaller brothers has a consumer basis.  And nothing new is created in the end.  Only that which is already provided and given by nature.  And in the end, <span>human activity is</span> associated with spiritual culture.  Personalities tend to develop.  This is one of the basic needs.  It is a pity, however, that in our time, many forget about it. </p>
