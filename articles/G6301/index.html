Its territory is rich in historical monuments, engineering miracles, as well as natural beauty.  The most worthy places to visit for travelers located in the state are noted in the article. </p><h2>  First Steps in Toronto </h2><p>  In order not to miss the many interesting sights of Canada, you should definitely visit Toronto.  In this city, national pride rises - the CN Tower, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.  In the entire western hemisphere there is no building higher, and therefore every person should look at this miracle. </p><p>  A particularly beautiful view opens from the shores of <span>Lake Ontario.</span>  After watching, you can safely step into the Royal Museum.  It is one of the most famous cultural centers in the world, which specializes in natural history and world culture.  More than a million visitors from all over the world come here every year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rosemontresidences.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Canada" class="if uuid-2334462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2334462.jpg"></div><h2>  Continuation of the city tour </h2><p>  Even if you just walk around Toronto, you can see a lot of beautiful things, but it‚Äôs better to immediately go to the Hockey Hall of Fame.  There is no consensus in the world about where this kind of sport originated, but most people agree that it is in Canada.  The popularity of hockey among the population is huge.  After all, it is considered a national pride.  The building itself is one of Canada's attractions for the outward beauty and spirit of the history of the sports game. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next point on the trip, you can choose the castle of Casa Loma.  Spanish names are rarely found in the country, but this structure is an exception.  Translated by the name means ‚Äúhouse on a hill‚Äù, and it really rises a little above the city.  It was built at the beginning of the 20th century, which is visible in the style.  The neo-Gothic style became the basis for design, and elements from other directions are also observed in architecture.  The castle looks great, which attracts tourists. </p><h2>  To Ottawa to museums </h2><p>  If you visit the capital of the state and not get into the most famous museums, you will have to go here again.  Among the attractions of Canada should be noted the War Museum in Ottawa.  This structure looks interesting on the outside, and inside it stores a huge number of <span>rare things.</span>  They tell the story of the fighting that took place in Canada.  Many samples have several centuries. </p><p>  Another worthy place to visit is the History Museum, which is located on the other side of the river.  To find the building you should go to the Hull area.  This is the most popular museum in the country, and therefore the local population will always tell you the way if necessary.  Inside you can find out all the information about the development of the state from ancient times to the present day. </p><p>  The third cultural center can be considered the Museum of Modern Photography.  He is more than three decades old and during this time the most interesting works of Canadian masters were collected in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saga.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canada Attractions Photos" class="if uuid-2334465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2334465.jpg"></div><h2>  Historic buildings in the capital </h2><p>  The sights of Canada in the photo look great, but in reality they are breathtaking.  A striking example is the Rideau Hall mansion, which was built by a timber merchant nicknamed Mackay in 1838.  Three decades later, the building was chosen by the English Queen Elizabeth II as a residence.  Here, her representative lived in the person of the Governor General of Canada.  When the state became independent, authorities continued to use the building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the center of Ottawa is Parliament Hill, which is the cultural center of the city, as well as geographical.  The building was erected by Renaissance Gothic architects.  It is considered a national symbol, and several million people come to see it every year.  This is a whole complex that can be viewed from different angles.  The photo next to him must definitely replenish the collection of a tourist who has visited Canada. </p><h2>  Ottawa Travel Ends </h2><p>  If the sights of Canada in the photo attracted you, then one look at Watsons Mill live on the mill will make you forget all the worries.  The building is located near the river.  A picturesque bridge leads to it, and one such walk will take a long time to fill.  From all flour mills, this building continues to work and is still in the capital, but they decided to turn it into a museum.  A visit is recommended for those who love nature and are interested in the process of processing crops. </p><p>  Another interesting center in Ottawa is the Byward Market, the oldest of all trading venues.  In the lower city, it is simply impossible to pass by him. </p><p>  It is worthy to complete a trip around the region with a trip to Upper Canada Village.  This is a national park that sends visitors to the atmosphere of the mid-19th century atmosphere.  Here, the buildings are completely authentic and even residents are engaged in similar affairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveller.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canada Country Attractions" class="if uuid-2334468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2334468.jpg"></div><h2>  Walking in Montreal </h2><p>  The sights of the country of Canada are concentrated in large numbers in Montreal.  In this large city, many tourists immediately go to see the magnificent Olympic stadium, which is breathtaking with its concept.  Initially, local residents were against the construction of the building, and now the hinged-roof building is an architectural pride. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you want to just walk around the city, then you should definitely visit the parks.  The first of these is Lafontaine with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout a hundred acres.  There are playgrounds for sports entertainment and an open-air theater.  Park Sit de Le Havre authorities created to preserve the green zone of the city.  This huge territory inside the metropolis allows you to enjoy nature on a picnic without having to go far.  For tourists, such trips will be an excellent warm-up before exploring the main advantages of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.readersdigest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="main attractions of canada" class="if uuid-2334472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2334472.jpg"></div><h2>  Main places </h2><p>  The main attractions of Canada include the Basilica of Notre Dame de Montreal, which was built by masters in the early 19th century.  The architects used the neo-Gothic style in the construction of the building, which many travelers like.  After the completion of the work of the tower of the basilica, the population of past centuries used as a guide.  Now, visiting people are happy to contemplate an interesting interior and gilded sculptures.  Inside the building is one of the largest organs in the world. </p><p>  An oratorio of St. Joseph, where pilgrims come from different regions of the country, is considered to be no less a religious building.  It is believed that the prayers of the people in this church will be heard only if you climb to the building up the stairs on your knees.  The oratorio has an interesting design that will be remembered by many tourists.  Its largest copper dome is only losing to St. Peter's Basilica. </p><h2>  City concept </h2><p>  A photo describing the sights of Canada should be considered before a trip to the country, and especially Montreal.  The city is so diverse that even hiking in some areas will be remembered for a long time.  This applies primarily to Old Montreal - a historical and cultural center where all tourists prefer to relax.  Gray stone houses, cobblestone pavements and museums convey the spirit of past eras. </p><p>  The exact opposite is Bernard Avenue, where locals love to have fun.  There are many cafes and bars where you can sit without spending a huge amount of money.  Tourists rarely drop in here, but the area perfectly demonstrates local life. </p><p>  Lurie street is suitable for those people who want to enjoy classical architecture.  In turn, Monkland Avenue has the glory of a place with excellent cuisine in restaurants, and is also distinguished by active trade in the Mokland Village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handluggageonly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canada's top attractions" class="if uuid-2334478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2334478.jpg"></div><h2>  Introducing Modern Vancouver </h2><p>  When visiting Canada, the <span>sights of Vancouver</span> are a must-see.  This city is the scientific center of the whole state.  In its location, a tribute to nature is easily visible.  Here landscapes are intertwined with tall buildings, and a truly original atmosphere is created.  You can feel it in the best way in the Harbor Center area, where every tourist will find something interesting for himself. </p><p>  In Vancouver, you can not pass by the beautiful stadium BBC Place with a unique structure.  The view of it, especially in the evening, captivates the look.  Around it there are many interesting places that also deserve a visit. </p><p>  To plunge into the scientific sphere of the city, you should visit the Museum of the World of Science, which was built specifically for the Expo exhibition in 1986.  The building was built in accordance with all the latest technical capabilities, and later turned into a place to demonstrate the development of science. </p><h2>  Proximity to nature in the metropolis </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to create a description of Canada‚Äôs sights among the architectural structures, but it‚Äôs impossible to talk about structures like the Capilano Suspension Bridge in words.  All walking tours of the city begin from this place, so that a person immediately felt the local beauty.  We can say that this building was designed in 1889 by the Scot George McCain, and it offers excellent views of the river from below and landscapes.  Only here, all tourists should walk on it independently.  After all, to describe the emotional feeling of a walk is simply impossible. </p><p>  Beautiful memories will also remain with marine life lovers after visiting the local Vancouver Aquarium, where there are a huge number of diverse exhibits.  After that, you can safely go to see the diamond of the region - the island of the same name, which is located opposite the city through the strait.  In these places, untouched nature affects a person to the depths of his soul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sheratononthefalls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions photo with description" class="if uuid-2334481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2334481.jpg"></div><h2>  Natural wonders </h2><p>  The sights of Canada's cities are far from the only thing worth seeing when visiting the country.  Any tourist is simply obliged to visit Niagara Falls.  Even at the entrance to the location you will hear a loud noise and the roar of water, which falls from a height of 50 meters and creates similar sounds.  A cloud of water vapor rises above the waterfall.  One look at such a power of the elements strikes to the core. </p><p>  No less impressive will be a trip to Banff Park.  On a vast territory in the mountains, there are ski resorts, glaciers and forests with wild animals, large lakes.  The park was founded in 1885 and is considered to be the oldest of all such places in Canada.  For lovers of mountaineering, the area will be a real find.  Others can simply enjoy the beauties and be in harmony with nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greatvaluevacations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vancouver Canada Attractions" class="if uuid-2334482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2334482.jpg"></div><h2>  Two more parks </h2><p>  Among the main attractions of Canada from among the natural beauties, it is worth noting two more parks - ‚ÄúThousand Islands‚Äù and ‚ÄúYoho‚Äù.  The first of them has overgrown with a huge number of legends, thanks to its beauty.  Even if you simply imagine a water surface of an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo thousand square kilometers with various islands, admiration may arise. </p><p>  When visiting this area a pleasant time is guaranteed.  The Indians believed that islands of different sizes are fragments of paradise, which God broke due to disobedience of people.  Yoho Park is distinguished not only by its strange names, but also by its beautiful landscapes.  The Kneeling Horse River and the Laughing Waterfall will delight you with its views.  You should just come here and walk for a few hours.  Tourists are guaranteed many memories and reasons for surprise. </p><h2>  Other nature reserves </h2><p>  Canada's natural attractions are in excellent condition.  After all, the country's authorities are following them.  For example, two and a half thousand bison live in Wood Buffalo Park.  This territory was allocated to animals in 1922, and now it is actively exploited by them.  There are no roads on the territory of the park, and therefore you can only get here on foot. </p><p>  Jasper Park has a similar purpose, but there are a lot more animals here.  Representatives of the local fauna live here in full harmony with nature.  About two hundred species of birds and many species of fish live here.  The area is covered with coniferous forests - the most favorable conditions for the development of fauna.  A huge number of tourists come here every year. </p><p>  The last step in a journey through the natural beauties of Canada will be Lake Louise and Peyto.  This is a picturesque expanse of water, located 30 miles from each other. </p>
