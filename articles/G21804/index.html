At first, these settlements were located on the right-bank Dnieper islands, but later, when the communities began to quarrel among themselves, people began to look for places where they could not only live and farm, but also hide in a moment of danger.  This forced a person to settle in the elevated parts, where over time the so-called hillforts arose. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  Mogilev is a city of regional subordination in the eastern part of Belarus.  The population of Mogilev in number is in third place in the republic and continues to grow.  Folk legend connects the name of the city with the name of the hero Masheka, over whose grave a large mound called the "Tomb of the Lion" was poured.  The national poet of Belarus reworked this legend into a poem of the same name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The population of Mogilev" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1428383.jpg" width="600"></div>
