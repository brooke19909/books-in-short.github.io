    <p>  Ultimately, you can be prosecuted.  In addition, the moral aspect of this matter must not be discounted.  Can you calmly look into the eyes of your wife when she finds out that you know about the content of all her telephone conversations?  It is very likely that after this your marriage will crack, because your missus will believe that you do not trust her at all. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, if the moral aspect of the problem is secondary to you, and the question of how to listen to your wife‚Äôs phone is the main thing, then stopping your intentions does not make sense.  Unfortunately, experiencing jealousy, a person is ready for any reckless actions. </p><h2>  Ways </h2><p>  So, what are the ways to resolve the issue of how to listen to my wife‚Äôs cell phone?  There are several of them. </p><h2>  Legal </h2><p>  The first of them is for guidance only, as it belongs to the category of official ones.  It involves a direct appeal to a mobile operator. </p>

    <p>  However, such a service is provided exclusively to representatives of law enforcement agencies, provided that they have permissions from the relevant authorities.  In this case, the operator must provide all the statistics of outgoing and incoming calls, as well as the contents of all sent SMS messages.  We emphasize once again that ordinary citizens cannot use this method. </p><h2>  Illegal </h2><p>  Not sure how to listen to your wife‚Äôs phone?  You can use the illegal method if you are not afraid of the consequences of the above.  The meaning of wiretapping in this case is to intercept the signal that comes from the mobile phone to the operator‚Äôs base station and vice versa.  It must be borne in mind that from a financial point of view this method is considered quite expensive, since it will be necessary to purchase special equipment.  Nevertheless, in deciding how to listen to the phone, a huge number of people use it.

    <p>  Firstly, there is no direct contact with the mobile operator, and secondly, the likelihood that the wife finds out that she is checked in such a sophisticated way is minimized. </p><p>  However, it must be said about the disadvantages of the above method.  The fact is that its radius of action is limited - only 300 meters from the telephone you are listening to.  In addition, you need to consider that the mobile operator can change the encoding of the transmitted signals, in which case the efficiency of your listening equipment will be zero. </p><h2>  Spyware </h2><p>  However, there is another solution to the question of <span>how to listen to</span> his wife‚Äôs <span>mobile phone</span> .  To do this, you need the so-called "spyware" software, which is quietly installed in a cellular device.  This know-how works on the principle of conferencing.  During conversations, it imperceptibly involves a third party in the communication process and duplicates it to another number, which is indicated in advance. </p>

    <p>  The disadvantages of this method of wiretapping include the fact that for each model of a mobile device, you must create an individual algorithm of the program.  Moreover, it is imperative to establish direct contact with the listening device. </p><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  Today, many are interested in how you can listen to your wife‚Äôs phone without paying a dime.  Unfortunately, free cheese can only be in a mousetrap.  In this case, you can find a free version of the spyware, but be prepared for the fact that it will have functional limitations.  How to listen to my wife‚Äôs phone?  Everything is very simple.  Use the internet. </p><p>  The World Wide Web is now just stuffed with programs that are able to incognito function on an eavesdropping phone, transmit and save the contents of telephone conversations and SMS messages, as well as determine the geographic location of an object and even photograph it with an integrated camera.  Certain software makes it possible for the device to work according to the ‚Äúbug‚Äù principle: you make a call and hear everything that happens on the ‚Äúother end of the wire‚Äù. </p><h2>  How to determine that the phone is being tapped </h2><p>  So, we decided on how to listen to the wife‚Äôs phone. </p>

    <p>  It will also be useful to consider signs that may indicate that your conversations are being tapped. </p><h2>  The battery in the mobile device runs out quickly </h2><p>  If you began to notice that the battery of your cell phone is always in a hot state and runs out quickly, then it is possible that they are listening to you.  Be sure to check this fact with specialists. </p><h2>  Malfunctioning </h2><p>  When your phone does not respond to the shutdown mode in a timely manner or reboots randomly, this may also indicate that the contents of your conversations are becoming known to third parties. </p><h2>  Unusual sounds in the device </h2><p>  If during the communication with the interlocutor you hear extraneous sounds, noises or unfamiliar voices, then this may be a sign that spyware is in your device. </p><h2>  Interference </h2><p>  The probability of wiretapping can be high if you notice that a mobile device located near ‚Äúidle‚Äù speakers creates interference. </p>

    <p>  This is a clear sign that the spyware has been activated, and it broadcasts the conversation to third parties. </p><h2>  Communication with the interlocutor is too long </h2><p>  Sometimes there are cases when, by pressing the <span>call button</span> on the <span>phone</span> , you have to wait a long time for the connection with the interlocutor to take place, and the disconnection period is also excessively delayed.  The above signs may also confirm the fact of illegal access to telephone conversations.  In this case, the software requires a certain period of time in order to transmit the contents of the conversation by phone. </p><h2>  What to do if you are bugged </h2><p>  If you are sure that the contents of your telephone conversations become known to third parties, this is an occasion to contact law enforcement agencies.  Police officers will check your suspicions using special techniques. </p><p>  In general, if you are not sure that your other half is faithful to you, then resorting to listening to her phone calls should be the last thing.  It‚Äôs better to find out face-to-face relationships.  Also try not to leave your cellular device unattended for a long time and use various passwords when unlocking it. </p>
