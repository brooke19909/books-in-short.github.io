Due to the geological and geographical features of the location of the island on it, the tsunami never happened, unlike Phuket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samui beaches" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15383/401569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Samui's area is 228.7 square kilometers.  Local time is three hours ahead of Moscow.  There are more than 50 thousand inhabitants.  The coastline of the island is four kilometers long.  It can be noted that almost all the beaches of Samui are clean and amazing with their unforgettable beauty.  During low tide, water from the shore does not go far. </p><p>  You can get to the island by plane from Bangkok.  You can navigate the surroundings on Songthavas.  These are pickups with seats that are located in the back.  You can also rent a motorbike, car (if you have an international driver's license). </p><p>  So, if you decide to visit this island, then a map of Samui with beaches, hotels, attractions will help you decide on a tour to Thailand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weather on the island </h2><p>  The climate is different from other regions of the kingdom of Thailand.  On the island, the rainy season is not particularly pronounced, and there is no such heat as on the mainland.  Consider the weather for months.  For example, from January to March, the following is observed: rains become less and shorter, the sea becomes calmer.  Months such as February and March are considered ideal times for relaxation.  Daytime temperatures reach 31 degrees, nighttime temperatures 21, and water temperatures 28. The hottest season is in April and May. </p><p>  In Samui, bad weather is very rare.  The climate is tropical, hot with high humidity.  The rainy season here is short-lived, usually begins in October and ends in December.  From June to September, sunlight becomes less and less.  On the beaches, low tides are noticeable.  Waves, tropical showers, severe thunderstorms appear. </p><h2>  Where to stay on the island </h2><p>  On the coast there are many hotels for every budget and taste.  You can choose a chic or budget option.  But Samui hotels with their own beach are rare for the kingdom of Thailand.  You can also rent apartments. </p><p>  Hotels on the island are presented as complexes in the form of small villas or bungalows.  Since Samui is forbidden to build tall buildings. </p><p>  Before booking your favorite tour, it is worth examining the reviews of guests about Samui hotels, carefully consider the photos of the beaches, the presence of sun loungers and umbrellas on them. </p><p>  Choose based on your options and preferences. </p>
