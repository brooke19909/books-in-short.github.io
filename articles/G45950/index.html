  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An extrovert is ...</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to Jung‚Äôs definition, extraversion is the ability to convert energy and the mind's interest in things, people, events present in the outside world. </p><p>  Often in life there are people who easily make acquaintances, who do not experience difficulties in communicating with various people.  Simply put, an extrovert is a person who is more inclined to be interested in the events occurring next to him than inside him. </p><p>  According to some scientists, this condition is associated with variability in cortical excitation.  So, in introverts it (cortical excitation) is located at a level higher, and therefore changes less.  This explains that an extrovert is a person who very often needs external stimulation. </p><p>  One study found that the introvert has more intense blood circulation in the anterior thalamus and frontal lobes.  These zones are involved, for example, in the resolution and planning of tasks.  An extrovert is a person who has more intense blood circulation in the temporal lobes, the posterior thalamus, and the cingulate gyrus (anterior).  These areas in the brain are responsible for emotional and sensory experiences. </p><p>  An extrovert is one who constantly needs a large number of friends.  This person should always be in the center of communication, attention. </p><p>  Extraversion, of course, has different forms.  So, some are not mastered right away, and some ‚Äúget their own‚Äù work quickly enough. </p><p>  As a rule, such people are confident in themselves, they very rarely want to be alone.  Thanks to innate communication skills, it is very easy for such people to find work.  At the same time, many extroverts should learn to restrain themselves, struggling with the tendency to say the first thing that comes to mind.  This addiction often offends their interlocutors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Extraversion is manifested in the desire to wear beautiful, bright clothes, decorate the workplace and home with decor details, listen to energetic, fun music. </p><p>  According to the results of individual studies, the relationship between happiness and extroverts was revealed.  These people are often called introverts themselves happy.  However, this does not mean that the latter are unhappy.  The thing is that extroverts can speak, expressing their emotions, better than introverts, who, as a rule, have neutral emotions and are not very good at conveying them with words. </p><p>  Introvert self-esteem is slightly lower.  This may be due to the fact that modern Western society more welcomes extroverts.  At the <span>same time, extraversion</span> has its drawbacks.  In particular, according to scientists, the likelihood of antisocial (delinquent) behavior in sociable adolescents is several times higher than in introverts. </p><p>  <span>The logical-sensory extrovert</span> is distinguished by confidence, a masterly way of behaving.  This <span>type of character</span> was inherent in the famous Stirlitz.  Women of this type are beautiful and stately. </p><p>  Such people, in general, take good care of themselves, maintaining the health of the body and their external attractiveness. </p><p>  Intuitive and ethical extrovert is a proactive and enthusiastic person.  He is attracted to everything new.  Particularly tempting for him are interesting undertakings in which there is an opportunity to show abilities (both ours and others).  He really likes situations whose outcome is hard to imagine. </p><p>  A characteristic feature of such people is enthusiasm and ardor at the beginning of the activity.  However, in case of failure, it is very difficult for such people to finish the job.  Often they take up the next endeavor <span>without completing the</span> previous one.  They often like to see how others embody their ideas.  In this regard, such an extrovert requires efficient performers. </p>
