This monarch is rightfully considered one of the most famous rulers in world history.  In Germany, for example, the <span>constellation Ursa Major</span> is called Karlswagen - "Woz Karla". </p><p>  This ruler rightly considered himself the heir of the Great <span>Roman Empire,</span> because by the end of his reign, his own country stretched from the North to the Mediterranean Sea.  What goals Charlemagne set for himself, what he managed to achieve from what he had planned, we read below. </p>

    <h2>  short biography </h2><p>  In early April 742, Pepin, nicknamed Korotky, ruler of the Franks, accepted congratulations on the birth of Karl's son.  Pepin was the second representative of the Carolingian dynasty.  His son Karl was the eldest of the two sons of the monarch, the younger brother was born later and was named Karloman. </p><p>  Like the other sons of noble families, Karl was brought up in the saddle.  From an early age he mastered the profession of a warrior and ruler.  At that time, Karl received an excellent education: he was fluent in several languages, studied ancient literature, played musical instruments.  Karl was a supporter of the Christian church and repeatedly participated in the <span>crusades.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After Pipin‚Äôs death, power in the state was divided equally between Karl and Karloman.  Nominally the power was united, but due to dual power the situation began to swing.  After the sudden death of his brother in 771, the future emperor became the sole ruler of his country. </p>

    <h2>  Reforms and Transformations </h2><p>  A brief description of the actions of this ruler already gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat goals Charlemagne set for himself.  History (Grade 6) invites students to evaluate the scale of the empire created by this ruler on a map of Europe.  Based on the scale of the conquests, Karl longed for his name to be inscribed in the pages of history along with the names of the most famous rulers of the past.  His work impressed contemporaries so much that in the future the monarchs of Europe were called kings - in honor of the Latinized name of Karl.  An honorary nickname was given to him due to the high praise of his contemporaries and descendants of the goals set by the ruler Charles the Great. </p><h2>  Charlemagne's Goals </h2><p>  Briefly, the achievements of the king of the francs can be described as follows: </p><p>  1. The imposition of Christianity.  Charlemagne extended the borders of his power, imposing Christian teaching among the tribes subjugated by him.  The greatest fame brought him victory over the Saxons and Lombards.  Strengthening Christianity in the conquered lands, the construction of new monasteries and temples in the image of Byzantium - these are also the achievements of Charles.  The most famous and extant temple was the Achaean Cathedral. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what goals did Karl the great history set himself" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/683087.jpg" width="500"></div>

History (Grade 6) mentions that at the end of his life this monarch was anointed <span>by the pope</span> and received the title of emperor.  This solemn event took place in Rome in the year 800. </p><p>  2. The revival of the Roman <span>Empire.</span>  <span>Charlemagne was</span> able to fully prepare the second birth of the Roman power, because at the end of his life the area he conquered was ten times larger than the original size of the country in which he had once ascended to the throne.  This goal was achieved thanks to continuous military campaigns.  In total, Karl took part in 53 campaigns, of which 27 were personally headed by him.  The ruler divided his country into counties, and on the borders created special territories - stamps reinforced by the army.  Constant control over the graphs and margraves was carried out with the help of "sovereign people" personally loyal to Karl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the goals set by ruler charles the great" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/683076.jpg" width="596"></div>

    <p>  To fully understand what goals Charlemagne set for himself, it is enough to know that not one of his daughters has ever married.  The strict father considered unworthy candidates for husbands all the sons of the rulers of neighboring states. </p><p>  3. What goals Charlemagne sets for himself in the field of education can be easily traced by the level and number of schools and theological seminaries.  Their number has increased several times.  The most talented students were prepared for the adoption of the spiritual order.  It was during the reign of the King of the Franks that a school was opened where they taught to rule the country, a prototype of the future university.  A special decree of Charlemagne created the Palace Academy - a place where they read and discussed the works of ancient writers and modern theologians, practiced writing poetry and guessing intellectual riddles.  At the behest of this ruler, annals were written - annual chronicles of the reign of the king, as well as preserved works of ancient art, transcribed by the court clerks of the ruler of the Franks and Lombards.  In general, during the reign of Karl, so much was done for culture and art that historians call this time the Renaissance of the Carolingians - by the name of the Frankish emperor. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In order for the student to be able to comprehensively answer the question ‚ÄúGive an assessment to Charlemagne.  What goals did he set for himself? ‚Äù, It is necessary to briefly present material about all the achievements of this king, about his influence on contemporaries and about the principles of political governance. </p>
