It is also a very exotic country with a unique culture, so you can come here not only for a beach holiday.  In Thailand, you can sample local specialties, look at ancient Buddhist temples and visit local shopping centers.  Hotels in Thailand are for every taste and budget.  If you want to stay comfortably, then pay attention to the five-star complex InterContinental Nha Trang Hotel.  We will tell about what it is in this article. </p><h2>  Location Details </h2><p>  No wonder they say that a hotel with a favorable location is the key to a good rest.  This modern complex was built in the heart of the vibrant Nha Trang resort, which is very popular among Russians.  InterContinental Nha Trang 5 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) is located on the 1st line of the sea, which means that tourists can walk to the beach in just a few minutes.  The distance to the coast is only 30 meters.  Conveniently, there are many infrastructure facilities near the complex.  Not far from it there is a pizzeria and a supermarket, and after a few blocks - a large shopping center.  The hotel itself is located on the busy tourist street of Tran Phu.  A market is 500 meters away.  It is worth noting that this is a fairly lively area, which means that it can be noisy on the street day and night. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.244997" data-lng="109.19621099999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/1/2/7/17127.png"></div><p>  The international airport accepting flights from Moscow and other major cities of Russia is 40 km from the hotel.

Also on your own, you can always get by taxi or other public transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic hotel information </h2><p>  The modern city-wide InterContinental Nha Trang Hotel in Nha Trang was recently opened in 2014.
