Firstly, the prices here are much lower than in the capital, secondly, the ecology is much better, and thirdly, the design and layout of apartments comply with international standards.  With all these advantages, getting to the center of Moscow is very short.  LCD "Two Capitals" (Khimki) - just such a complex.  Modern, beautiful, comfortable and affordable.  It is being built by a young company, at first investors did not have confidence in it.  But the developer showed himself from the very best side, providing an indicative quality of work, without delaying the deadlines, and even making financial concessions, making for real buyers.  Therefore, the apartments in the complex are literally snapping up.  We make a reservation that an LCD with the same name is being built in St. Petersburg.  Another developer is building it, and the situation there is a little different.  We offer information about the residential complex "Two Capitals" in Khimki, whose address is as follows: North-Western Industrial and Communal Zone.  Nearby is the street of <span>German Titov.</span>  Given the fact that it was opened specifically to improve the transport situation in the new complexes under construction, there is reason to expect further amenities for their future residents. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The plot for the residential complex "Two Capitals" is allocated in Khimki.  The city, as you know, is located in the north-west direction from the capital and begins immediately beyond the Moscow Ring Road.  To him from the complex, when measured along the Leningradskoye Shosse, is exactly 3.9 km.  On the one hand, the railway line is bordered by a railway (less than 50 meters to it), on the other three, Titova Street and Transportnoe proezd.  It’s only 160 meters from the corner of the nearest house, which is loaded all year round with the Leningradskoye Shosse, but in order to leave it, you need to make a small detour before moving.  Literally across the Titova street from the complex, another large-scale LCD, called the "Solar System", is being erected.  In addition, there are several other new housing complexes nearby, as well as shops, gas stations, a railway station, and bus stops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Two capitals of Khimki" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1599716.jpg" width="502"></div>

Khimki, although located very close to the capital, it can take several hours to get here by car from the center.  The reason is frequent traffic jams.  Those who prefer public transportation are even more difficult.  There is a railway track near the complex, but the nearest Planernaya station is 2 km away, and Khimki station is 3.4 km away.  Interest holders hope that the Khimki-2 station will appear in the near future, but so far these are only projects.  At this stage of the construction of the “Two Capitals”, a free bus was launched from the complex to the Khimki station.  In any case, representatives of the builder say so.  The schedule of this route is not reported.  There are also several city bus routes, which, most likely, will have to be used by those residents of the Two Capitals who do not have a car. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  In this regard, the situation is not particularly favorable for the residential complex “Two Capitals”.  Khimki is primarily a large industrial center, where two dozen large and small industries are actively operating, and in addition, there is its own thermal power plant.  All this does not make the air cleaner.  Around the complex under construction there is no abundance of natural <span>green areas</span> where you can walk in nature, but there is a railway track and the largest highway in Russia.  True, Khimki Forest Park begins north of the complex, about 1 km to go to it.  While this is the only corner of nature nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Two capitals" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1599705.jpg" width="507"></div>

Also optimistic are the assurances that soon instead of the industrial zone there will be parks and new social facilities, such as shopping centers, fitness clubs and more. </p><h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  The residential complex “Two Capitals” has a developer “AM Development”.  The company was formed in 2005, but in the field of its activity there were objects of economic and industrial spheres, as well as separate residential buildings.  A large housing complex is her first experience in the construction of this kind of housing.  Therefore, at first, investors were very wary of the project.  But the developer, as if deciding to show venerable competitors how to work, took up the matter with all seriousness.  As a result, a peculiar record was set - first of all, they passed almost a year ahead of schedule!  People have long received keys, made repairs, and drove into beautiful apartments.  In their opinion, the builder has an excellent quality of work.  Capital LLC, Tandem M LLC, Axon CJSC cooperate with this <span>development company</span> .  The regions where AM Development operates are Khimki and Mytishchi.  Two previous projects - a small (only three houses) LCD “River Street” and the town house “Slavich”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Two capitals developer" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1599707.jpg" width="508"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Project complex infrastructure </h2><p>  In the residential complex “Two Capitals” (Khimki), the developer intends not only to build residential buildings, but also social facilities.  So, there will be two kindergartens, a clinic, a fitness club, a shopping center, a shopping gallery, a cafe, a private boiler room, a swimming pool, and a school.  Some interest holders worry that they will not build a school, but it is in the general plan of the developer. </p><p>  On the territory of the complex in 8.5 hectares will build 9 buildings.  Their height is 12-17 floors.  They will be located so as to form closed courtyards.  Around the perimeter, it is planned to put up a fence and establish security.  That is, only residents and people invited by them will be able to enter the territory of the complex. </p><p>  Around the “Two Capitals” there is no beautiful nature, but inside the complex will create a real oasis with multiple green spaces, flower beds, recreation areas.  For kids, playgrounds with slides, swings and carousels are equipped here; for outdoor enthusiasts, they will build sports grounds and equip bicycle paths. </p><p>  The entire territory of the complex will be free from cars.  For them, an underground multi-level parking is planned for 1600 parking spaces. </p><h2>  Infrastructure around </h2><p>  The presence of social facilities on the territory of the residential complex "Two Capitals" (Khimki) is vital for future residents, since there is practically nothing in walking distance.  Behind the tracks and behind the Leningradskoye Shosse near the Leningradskoye LCD there are a number of outlets, including Auchan, IKEA, Mega, and a construction supermarket.  In a straight line, they are no more than 700 meters away, but this is if you go straight through the rails.  Bypassing through a safe transition, the path increases several times.  It is convenient for motorists that there are gas stations in the immediate vicinity of the Two Capitals.  The closest of them is Lukoil. </p><p>  It is important for parents to know that in the area where the complex is being built, there are two lyceums, kindergartens and schools, but they need to be accessed by transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Two capitals in Khimki address" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1599708.jpg" width="506"></div>

    <h2>  Complex design </h2><p>  The residential complex “Two Capitals” will be very beautiful.  Reviews of those who have already settled here, and those who are just going to, are noted by the unusual and pleasant-looking appearance of the buildings.  The facades in some of them will have the characteristic features of the Petersburg architectural style, in the other part - the Moscow style.  Hence the name “Two Capitals”.  As conceived by the architects, the entire territory of the complex will be divided into residential and non-residential.  The first will house buildings, recreation areas, cafes, sports grounds, kindergartens and playgrounds for kids.  The rest of the infrastructure is planned nearby, so that the residents would be comfortable, but at the same time there would be no fuss.  A wide walking boulevard will separate these two zones. </p><p>  The buildings are erected by a monolithic-brick method.  The walls are laid in three layers, which should provide increased strength, sound insulation, heat and frost resistance. </p><p>  A nice feature of the project is the individual design of the porches, they were even given names.  For example, here will be: “Catherine’s Canal”, “Kalanchevskaya Square” and others.  Each name corresponds to a memorable place in Moscow or St. Petersburg, and large panels on the walls of the porches will remind you of these places visually. </p><h2>  Quartography </h2><p>  In the residential complex "Two Capitals" apartments are designed in two styles - classic and European. </p><p>  Classic is represented by these types of apartments: </p><p>  - studios with a total area (S) rounded from 25.5 m <sup>2</sup> to 31 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - one-room - from 32 m <sup>2</sup> to 39 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room apartments - from 43 m <sup>2</sup> to 55 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - three-room apartments - from 63 m <sup>2</sup> to 72 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  In the European style (with very spacious kitchens), these options: </p><p>  - one-room S from 33 m <sup>2</sup> to 43 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room apartments - from 50 m <sup>2</sup> to 64 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - three-room apartments - from 78 m <sup>2</sup> to 87 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  Loggias everywhere will do with <span>panoramic glazing.</span>  For the convenience of the tenants, they plan to rent the apartments without finishing, so that people themselves can create a design of their own liking.  In addition, in apartments with European planning at the discretion of the owners, the installation of additional partitions is possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Two capitals of Khimki address" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1599706.jpg" width="502"></div>

He not only rents out housing prematurely, but also holds stocks that are pleasant for buyers.  At the moment there are three of them: </p><p>  1. Until 31.12.  2017 inclusively declared a discount on all apartments 20%. </p><p>  2. Until December 31, 2017, the first payment for any cost of an apartment may not exceed 95,000 rubles. </p><p>  3. In building No. 13, storage rooms are a gift. </p><p>  But these are not all gifts from the builder.  He went to meet the wishes of the interest holders and took upon himself all the expenses for the registration of the DDU, which must be prepared before making a home purchase. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  A very significant plus for investors is the speed of construction of the residential complex “Two Capitals” in Khimki.  The reviews of people with enthusiasm note that the builder passed the first house at number 13 at the end of 2015, giving people a New Year’s present, because according to the plan, he was supposed to surrender only in 2017.  Some people think that since they signed the act of surrender, it means they will give keys the next day.  But in practice, everything is a little different.  So, the keys were issued to residents of building no. 13 in April. </p><p>  The developer decided to surprise everyone and, having not yet completed the entire complex, ennobled part of the territory, paved the paths, planted trees, built a large playground and the first kindergarten in the project. </p><p>  The next building, No. 16, was supposed to be commissioned in the II quarter of 2016, but the acceptance certificate was signed (as company representatives assure) only in December, and the keys will be issued in the I quarter of 2017. </p><p>  Corps No. 12 and 15 intend to hand over, respectively, in the II and III quarters of 2017.  Now they are simultaneously erecting floors and installing wall panels, while glazings and interior work are being carried out on finished floors. </p><p>  The last phase will be commissioned in the II quarter of 2018.  Then the customer agrees to complete the construction of the provided infrastructure. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  LCD "Two Capitals" among the new buildings near Moscow is in 9th place.  The result is not bad, considering that the developer is not yet one of the ten leaders in Moscow construction holdings. </p><p>  The advantages of the complex noted in the reviews: </p><p>  - quite acceptable quality of work; </p><p>  - quick construction of buildings; </p><p>  - spacious apartments, good layouts; </p><p>  - developed infrastructure; </p><p>  - proximity to the Moscow Ring Road; </p><p>  - acceptable prices; </p><p>  - A lot of nice promotions for the purchase of apartments. </p><p>  Noted disadvantages: </p><p>  - the complex is located in the industrial zone; </p><p>  - there is no acceptable transport accessibility to the complex and <span>social facilities</span> in the district; </p><p>  - change by the customer during the construction of some points of the project. </p>
