What to see in Armenia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Armenia is the smallest of the republics of the former USSR.  It has an ancient history and many interesting objects on its territory.  The country is inexpensive, it is real to visit without a passport.  Flights to Yerevan are cheap, there will be no problems with the Russian language in place.  Therefore, when planning such a trip, you need to know what to see in Armenia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Ararat" class="if uuid-3233214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3233214.jpg"></div><h2>  Visit Features </h2><p>  Tourism in Armenia was developed during the years of the USSR.  In those years, people traveled to this republic to inspect architectural monuments, to be treated at mineral spas, to taste local cuisine and alcohol.  Since then, for tourists, in fact, little has changed, but rail transport has fallen into disrepair, railway communication with Russia has stopped. </p><p>  You can get to Armenia without a passport, but you need to fly by plane, because by land at its borders there are such features: </p><ol><li>  With Turkey and Azerbaijan, everything has long been closed, and it is unlikely that anything will change in the coming years. </li><li>  Two international trains (from Batumi and Tbilisi) and many buses, as well as transit buses from Moscow, Pyatigorsk and other Russian cities go through Armenia to Georgia.  To travel by land you need a passport. </li><li>  You can call in from Iran, but you also need a passport.  Iran is visa-free for visiting for 30 days, but you should fly by plane to major airports. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Nina Stössinger, " data-source="https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:David_of_Sasun_Yerevan.jpg"><img itemprop="image" alt="Station in Yerevan" class="if uuid-3233216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3233216.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting places in the capital </h2><p>  Tourism in Armenia is, first of all, a visit to Yerevan.
