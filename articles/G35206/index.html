Nature also endowed people with amazing symmetry and proportionality, according to which, parts of the body are in the right proportion to each other.  In accordance with this pattern, all nature is arranged in general.  These laws were used by Leonardo da Vinci during his work.  All things in which there is such a distribution of proportions seem beautiful to a person. </p>

    <h2>  Golden ratio </h2><p>  Using patterns existing in the proportions of the human body, architects and artists created their creations.  Such incredible calculations gave many opportunities for accurate work, the correct construction of figures in sculpture and their depiction in paintings.  They called this calculation the "golden ratio."  This knowledge began to be used since 1935 in sewing.  Being a mathematician by education, the German Maria Lutterlo streamlined the works of the famous Leonardo. </p>

The Golden Pattern system allows you to build patterns for customers with any shape.  They do not have to have perfect proportions for this.  A seamstress takes only a few minutes to work.  It sounds like a fantasy, but the scheme allows you to build patterns in individual sizes for any person.  This is how mathematical formulas work. </p><p>  An ordinary seamstress will not be able to independently make such patterns and calculate these formulas, but she does not need to do this.  In specialized stores you can order the finished system "Golden Pattern".  User reviews regarding the operation of this technique are pretty good.  The order comes to the buyer directly from Germany, but you can also get to the intermediaries who sell ready-made sewing kits. </p><h2>  Set for work </h2><p>  The price of the order includes payment for the kit and its delivery. </p>

    <p>  The package contains the textbook "Golden Pattern".  There is an unusual meter there, a special scale is applied to it, which allows you to work with patterns.  For this meter, the manufacturer gives a lifetime warranty.  In the folder block there are 280 patterns, they are easily removed from it and just as easily inserted back when the work is done.  The package also has tools for working with the cut: cardboard pattern, acrylic rulers, button-needle.  Additional patterns can be ordered separately.  It is worth saying that although the set is not cheap, it is popular among professional seamstresses, and among those who only comprehend the basics of <span>designing clothes.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Preparing to build a pattern </h2><p>  To build a "Golden <strong> </strong>  patterns "it is required to take only a couple of measurements.

    <p>  After all the points above the waist are laid down in this way, you need to pull out the button and insert it on the tape at the point corresponding to the OB measurement.  Similar to the previous steps, insert the needle into the center of the cross on the pattern and put down all the points that are below the waistline. </p><p>  When all the labels are transferred to a large sheet of paper or tracing paper, they need to be interconnected.  For the connection, it is better to use the acrylic patterns available in the kit.  This is how the Golden Pattern works. </p><h2>  User reviews about the system </h2><p>  Building patterns on your own is not as easy as it seems.  This business needs to be learned, and then constantly practice your knowledge to become a good specialist.  Not everyone has time to graduate from an educational institution, or at least courses and get a specialty cutter.  But in life such skills would be very useful.  For this reason, many users bought patterns for themselves, which we are talking about today.  Reviews of the Golden Pattern will allow you to think about whether you need such a set. </p><p>  Buyers note that the ability to sew on their own is a great chance to prove yourself as a creative person.  All people want to wear clothes that will sit nicely on them and be comfortable.  That is why sewing products by individual standards is the most correct way.  Having mastered the “Golden Pattern” system, real users of this method learned to sew everything from a dressing gown to elegant evening dresses.  Many of them claim that working with such patterns is very convenient. </p><p>  Even experienced seamstresses use this method of constructing patterns; according to them, it is not difficult to deal with patterns.  The only problem that may arise in the process of work is the difference in growth in people.  Those for whom the pattern turned out to be long can bend it along the waistline, pasting the fold obtained with tape.  If it turned out to be short, then the drawing should be cut along the waistline and add the missing centimeters, adjusting it to your shape.  Only it is necessary to cut not the “Golden Pattern”, but the one that was transferred to tracing paper or paper. </p>

This method was called beam cut.  The "golden <span>pattern" of children's clothing is</span> also in the sets, and this is another advantage of this manual.

    <p>  In tailoring outfits for babies, the whole difference lies in the lines that are selected during construction.  If you use the wrong ruler, the difference in sewing will be about two sizes.  When buying a set of “Golden Pattern”, you need to use the tools that are in the kit, then there will be no problems with the construction. </p><h2>  To buy or not to buy </h2><p>  This scheme has been working for many years and is quite popular.  Its practicality has been tested by hundreds of specialists.  The Golden Ratio is a mathematical concept, but you can't argue with numbers and formulas.  Everything works! </p><p>  The set has a detailed description of how to work with patterns.  The first package contains basic models, but later you can order more modern models of clothes.  In the kit you can find skirts, blouses, lined products, outerwear. </p>

    <p>  Sewing skills using this method will still not be superfluous, because cutting a product is only part of the job.  Assembly and fitting of the product are the final stages of work, on which it depends on how the finished wardrobe item will look and how carefully it will be sewn.  If you have a machine, a desire and a little extra money, then you need to buy such a set. </p>
