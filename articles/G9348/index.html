And most importantly, always in plain sight.  It‚Äôs hard to come up with a better way to express yourself.  You also want to, but you don‚Äôt know how to draw graffiti?  Then this article will be useful for you. </p><p>  Let's start with one of the principles of graffiti artists.  They paint exclusively on the walls.  And even those who are only now interested in the question of <span>how to draw graffiti</span> know another feature of street art that its main tool is a spray can.  And the whole difficulty is to get a clear picture from the sprayed liquid paint.  At first it seems completely impossible, but with an understanding of the specifics of drawing, skills also come. </p><p>  To begin with, so that the question of how to draw graffiti correctly doesn‚Äôt scare the reader very much, we‚Äôll open a little secret that no one will condemn you if you use a pre-prepared stencil.  Home-made patterns can be cut from ordinary cardboard and used not once, but several times.  Paint from an aerosol can will not stain the excess area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe wall, and the picture will immediately turn out as it should be. </p><p>  Anyone who does not know how to draw graffiti correctly, for him, even drawing a simple straight line can be difficult.  Such a novice fan of street painting can be advised to use the same method, only cut and do not need anything.  A simple sheet of paper is applied to the wall, and paint is sprayed along its edge.  Part of the wall will be painted, and the paper will make the line straight.  This method is universal for creating contours and lines at any angle.  The smoothness of the lines depends on the height of the stencil.  The paint will fall under it, and the line will turn out to be beautiful and moving, plastic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are a fan of graffiti, but do not want the general public to condemn you for damaged walls, then you will be interested in the topic of how to learn how to draw graffiti with a pencil.  Starting with redrawing the drawings you like, remember that plagiarism in graffiti is unacceptable.  This is another principle of street artists.  You will need a regular drawing album, a simple pencil and a regular eraser.  And experienced graffiti artists advise starting pencil drawing from the letters of the alphabet, because in fact very short texts are drawn on the walls.  The two-dimensional drawing method is chosen so that the letters look more voluminous.  Otherwise, this technique in professional language is called graffiti "bubble style." </p><p>  For those who are interested in the question of <span>how to learn how to draw</span> graffiti with a pencil, you need to learn how to make drawings by different clicking on the pencil, as well as master the technique of hatching and applying shadows.  So you can create the effect of depth or, conversely, the surface of the picture. </p><p>  The question of how to draw graffiti is creative.  Because street art looks beautiful and attracts attention, it is almost impossible to find drawings of the same.  So dare, fantasize and embody your inventions.  Fortunately, there is enough space on the street walls. </p><p>  But remember that you cannot paint on the surface of residential buildings or those that are of cultural value.  It is forbidden to spoil gravestones and any monuments with some sketches.  They do not like professional graffiti and those who draw on cars and other vehicles.  You can not apply drawings on top of works of other graffiti.  A sense of solidarity and respect for other people's work is the unwritten law of professional graffiti. </p><p>  If all these principles are not a burden to you, and you continue to seriously think about how to draw graffiti, then our last tip: read professional publications by experienced graffiti artists.  And you will succeed.  Under your hands, boring gates will turn into unique corners, colored with funny and unusual sketches. </p>
