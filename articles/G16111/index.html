    <p>  James Watt was born into the family of the ship builder and creator of various mechanisms, James.  His mother, Agnes, was a representative of a wealthy family, at one time she received an excellent education. </p><p>  The future inventor was born on January 19, 1736. The boy was born very painful, so he received primary education at home from his parents.  The child could not play with peers due to poor health, so he spent most of his time on self-education. </p><p>  As a teenager, his favorite subjects were astronomy and chemistry.  He also liked to make models of mechanisms that his father created. </p><p>  Upon reaching the age of a graduate of primary school, James entered the gymnasium.  He showed great success in mathematics.  The young man loved to read, and many of this he sought to test in practice. </p><p>  At the age of eighteen, the young man lost his mother.  This affected the health and affairs of his father, so James had to take care of himself on his own.  The young man moved from Scotland to London for a year to learn a craft that was related to measuring instruments.  Official training was supposed to take place for seven years, but James had only enough money for one year.  He began his training with the manufacture of rulers and compasses.  Soon, a young student could already make quadrants, geodolites and other complex instruments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For this year, the young man almost did not go out.  All the time he worked: in the mornings - for the owner, and in the evenings - on order.  So he could feed himself.  In addition, due to the fact that he was not considered an official student, they could forcefully take him to the navy on the street. </p><h2>  First work </h2><p>  After graduating, James Watt with poor health returned to Scotland.  He decided to organize his own business in Glasgow, which consisted in the creation and repair of tools.  But he had to face a union of artisans who forbade him to do this work.  The reason was that James did not go through formal training.  It did not even help that he was the only representative of his business in Scotland. </p>

    <p>  But the case is saving the young man.  At this time, a batch of instruments for astronomy classes arrived at the University of Glasgow.  They required constant attention, including installation.  Through his friends, Watt gets the opportunity to work.  He was appointed master of scientific instruments of the educational institution.  He had the opportunity to create his own workshop. </p><p>  In an educational institution, James meets Joseph Black, who studied chemistry.  The master helps the scientist in the development of some chemical devices that advanced the chemist's further research. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since 1759, Watt's affairs have improved.  This was facilitated by a partnership with businessman John Craig.  They organized the production of various tools and toys.  The income of the inventor has increased significantly.  Their partnership ended after six years due to the death of Craig. </p><h2>  Invention Period </h2>

    <p>  Newcomen's steam engine has been around for decades.  Most often it was used for pumping water.  Nobody had ever tried to improve it.  Since 1759, Watt became interested in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing the pair, but his attempts were unsuccessful. </p><p>  In 1763, a representative of the University of Glasgow turned to the master with a request to help repair the existing model of Newcomen‚Äôs creation.  Watt was able to conduct a series of experiments with her.  He was able to fix the layout and see the inefficiency of this machine.  Watt made some improvements to the design, but this was not enough. </p><p>  Two years later, James Watt figured out how to create the perfect steam engine.  He began to implement his plan.  In 1769, he filed a patent for an isolated condensation chamber.  He was able to build a working model that worked on this principle.  He did not have the means to create a full-sized machine.  This helped Joseph Black, John Robuck.  The problems did not end, because it was impossible to achieve the necessary accuracy in the production of the cylinder and piston.  In addition, Roebuck became bankrupt. </p><p>  Watt has found a new sponsor.  It was Matthew Bolton, who owned a foundry.  The problem in creating the cylinder was decided by John Wilkinson.  Watt gained commercial success from his invention thanks to the creation of a joint company with Matthew Bolton, which had been operating for twenty-five years and brought the inventor a great fortune. </p>

    <p>  Watt sought not only to improve the Newcomer machine, he wanted to create a model with a universal engine.  All his attempts led to a new method in the operation of a steam engine, which he patented under the name planetary motion.  It was on this method that the first steam engine of James Watt began to work. </p><p>  After the success of the new machine, numerous attempts to fake it began.  In the struggle for the reputation of their own business, Watt and Bolton were forced to spend considerable money on litigation.  As a result, they were able to defend their rights. </p><h2>  The meaning of the invention </h2><p>  James Watt's engine patent was filed in 1769.  The document determined that the author of the patent <span>did not invent a</span> new machine, but a <span>steam engine.</span>  Watt did not fully understand how significant his future improvement would become. </p>

    <p>  The significance of the invention was that in the engine the piston moved under the influence of steam.  Thanks to this, it was possible to repeatedly increase power, creating more pressure.  There was no longer any need to increase the size.  Thanks to the invention, it became possible to create a steam locomotive, and a little later, a steamer. </p><h2>  Recognition of merit </h2><p>  During the life of the inventor, the machine of James Watt revolutionized the industry.  It is not surprising that he was elected a representative of many societies.  They even wanted to award him the baronial title, but he refused it. </p><p>  Societies in which Watt was elected: </p><ul><li>  Royal Society of Edinburgh. </li><li>  Philosophical Society in Rotterdam. </li><li>  Corresponding Member of the French Academy. </li><li>  The Birmingham Lunar Society is an unofficial organization for scholars of the British Enlightenment. </li></ul><h2>  Last years </h2>

    <p>  James Watt's biography proves how versatile he was.  The heterogeneity of his knowledge was genuinely surprised by the writer Walter Scott, who was personally acquainted with the inventor. </p><p>  In the last years of his life, Watt was engaged in a machine of his own production, which could copy sculptural works, such as bas-reliefs, statues, vessels and so on. </p><p>  The master died on 08/19/1819, in the eighty-third year of life.  He was buried in Handsworth. </p><h2>  Family and Children </h2><p>  James Watt, whose inventions made a breakthrough in industry, was married twice.  His first wife, Margaret Miller, died in 1772, giving birth to their fifth child.  But only two children survived to adulthood, whose names, like their parents, were James and Margaret. </p><p>  The second wife was Anne McGregor in 1777.  Their joint children were named Gregory and Janet. </p><h2>  Interesting fact </h2><p>  Watt suggested using the name ‚Äúhorsepower‚Äù as the <span>unit of power</span> .  However, in 1882, at the initiative of the British Association of Engineers, it was decided to assign a unit of power in the name of the inventor.  Since that time, it is customary to use watts in technology.  This happened for the first time in the history of technology. </p>
