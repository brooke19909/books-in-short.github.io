  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to remove the Internet speed limit on the phone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cellular operators providing the Internet to their subscribers offer tariff plans with a specific number of megabytes or gigabytes.  Almost all companies provided one condition: when the allocated traffic is completely consumed by the client, Internet speed is significantly limited.  Pages begin to open slowly, and entertainment content becomes almost impossible to view and listen to.  And here the question arises for subscribers - how <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#1" data-keyword="    ">  remove internet speed limit </keyword>  .  Each operator has created different services for this. </p><h2>  Beeline Terms </h2><p>  Beeline subscribers, while limiting the speed of the Internet, can use the service "Prolong speed".  When connected, it is valid until the end of the billing period of the main option or tariff.  For example, monthly subscriber traffic is updated on the 30th.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãwas limited to the 20th.  If at this moment you activate the ‚ÄúProlong Speed‚Äù service, then it will be valid for 10 days - only until the 30th day.  The maximum allowable validity period is 1 month. </p><p>  For subscribers who do not want at the most inopportune moment to look for a way <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#2" data-keyword="     ">  remove the Internet speed limit on Beeline </keyword>  ", The service" Auto Renewal "is provided.  It is quite convenient, since when using it, an additional package of high-speed Internet is automatically connected at the moment when the main traffic ends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="leephone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove the Internet speed limit on Beeline" class="if uuid-2242057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2242057.jpg"></div><h2>  Offers from MTS </h2><p>  MTS Company offers its subscribers "Turbo Buttons" - options that can be connected when restricting access to the Internet.  For smartphones, there are 2 options for ‚ÄúTurbo buttons‚Äù.  On one option, subscribers can take advantage of an additional 100 megabytes.  This volume of Internet traffic is given only for 24 hours.  After this period, unused megabytes burn up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another ‚ÄúTurbo Button‚Äù provides 500 MB.  This number of megabytes can be used until the main Internet traffic is updated, or within 30 days if the option is connected at the beginning of the billing period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hyser.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove the Internet speed limit on the phone" class="if uuid-2242054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2242054.jpg"></div><h2>  What offers Tele2 subscribers </h2><p>  The company "Tele2" took care of its subscribers.  She made it so that people don‚Äôt have to think about how <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#1" data-keyword="    ">  remove internet speed limit </keyword>  or connection blocking.  The company in its tariff plans created for phones included an option with an additional 500 megabytes.  It is automatically activated when the main traffic at the tariff ends. </p><p>  However, such a service is not convenient for all people, because some subscribers are not satisfied with such a volume of traffic.  If desired, the automatic option can be disabled.  Then, after the exhaustion of the main traffic provided for by the tariff, there will be no Internet access, but it will be possible to choose the most suitable service for yourself. </p><p>  For residents of Moscow and the Moscow region who do not know how <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#3" data-keyword="      2">  remove the Internet speed limit on "Tele </keyword>  2 ‚Äù, the following options are available: </p><ul><li>  5 gigabytes for 30 days; </li><li>  3 gigabytes for 30 days; </li><li>  500 megabytes until the end of the day; </li><li>  100 megabytes until the end of the day. </li></ul><p>  For other regions of Russia, other conditions may be provided.  For example, Tele2 subscribers residing in the Altai Territory are provided with a choice of options for 2 gigabytes, 500 megabytes and 75 megabytes.  The first two of them are connected for 30 days, and the last - for a day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove the Internet speed limit on Tele2" class="if uuid-2242066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2242066.jpg"></div><h2>  Services at Rostelecom </h2><p>  Mobile Internet from Rostelecom allows subscribers to experience new data transfer opportunities on the World Wide Web, because the company has created a variety of tariff plans.  The provided traffic volume on them ranges from 2 to 30 gigabytes per month. </p><p>  At each tariff, an option for 500 additional megabytes is automatically connected, which means that subscribers can not worry about blocking access and not think about how <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#4" data-keyword="     ">  remove the Internet speed limit on Rostelecom </keyword>  ".  If there is money in the account, the specified amount of traffic is activated after the exhaustion of the main package.  In total, you can use 5 packages.  After their exhaustion, Internet access is limited. </p><p>  On tariffs without the provided Internet, subscribers independently connect the necessary options.  For example, Moscow residents can choose "Internet from the phone."  This option provides 75 megabytes per day.  When restricting access due to the use of traffic, you can connect an additional 100 megabytes.  For subscribers who actively use mobile Internet, the options are Just Internet Internet M, Just Internet L, Just Internet XL.  They can connect much larger additional packages of 3 and 5 gigabytes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="versiya.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to remove the Internet speed limit on Rostelecom" class="if uuid-2242061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2242061.jpg"></div><h2>  Connecting options and services: the surest way </h2><p>  As noted above, for each region of the country there are various options for extending the Internet.  In order to make the right choice, find out all the conditions of how <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#1" data-keyword="    ">  remove internet speed limit </keyword>  It is recommended to visit the official website of the operator.  On it you can get acquainted with all available services, after specifying the desired region of Russia or the city. </p><p>  To connect the selected services and options, you will need to visit your personal account.  In it, this procedure is performed very quickly - in just a few mouse clicks.  Your personal account is also convenient in that you can: </p><ul><li>  disable automatic options to avoid unnecessary costs; </li><li>  monitor traffic consumption and connect the necessary packages on time. </li></ul><h2>  Activate options and services using commands </h2><p>  A convenient way to <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#5" data-keyword="      ">  remove the Internet speed limit on the phone </keyword>  , - connecting the most suitable package with additional Internet traffic by entering a command.  It is a set of numbers and signs.  You can find it on the official website of the operator.  When searching for a command to connect, be sure to indicate the region to find out the exact conditions. </p><p>  Here is an example of how different conditions can be for one team and for different regions of Russia.  Tele2 has the Add Traffic service for a day.  It is connected with the command * 155 * 281 #.  For subscribers of Moscow and the Moscow region, this option provides 100 megabytes per day for 15 rubles, and for subscribers of the Altai Territory - 75 megabytes for 8.5 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="infocity.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using commands to restore internet speed on your phone" class="if uuid-2242072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2242072.jpg"></div><p>  Commands for services and options do not change for a long time, so they can be saved in the phone‚Äôs contact list and used at the right time.  But at the same time, it‚Äôs still worth visiting the sites of operators.  From time to time, new offers appear on them, among which you can choose for yourself the most interesting and profitable options. </p><p>  So how <keyword class="kwd" data-id="#1" data-keyword="    ">  remove internet speed limit </keyword>  or blocking access to the global network is a question that cannot be answered unequivocally.  Each mobile operator has created a variety of options and services that restore speed or provide additional traffic. </p>
