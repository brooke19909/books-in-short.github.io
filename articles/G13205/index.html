Love for this place is directly related to the unique symbiosis of climate and sea.  Crimea is the only place in the region that boasts a subtropical climate.  All this contributes to the development of hotel infrastructure. </p><h2>  Features of rest in Crimea </h2><p>  The resort areas of Crimea can be divided into two parts: Stepnoy and the southern coast of Crimea.  The best hotels of Crimea on the seashore in the steppe part have a lower price and less crowded beaches.  This is due to the less developed resort infrastructure of this region, and, consequently, less popular among vacationers.  <span>The southern coast of Crimea</span> is a narrow strip between the Crimean mountains and the Black Sea.  Here is a unique climate zone, respectively, here are the best hotels of Crimea on the beach. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea hotels by the sea" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33695/816763.jpg" width="600"></div>  Service of the Crimean peninsula is focused on all categories of vacationers.  Mini-hotels in Crimea, on the seashore, are the best suited for tourists who prefer an economy-class vacation.  The maximum requirements of VIP-vacationers are ready to satisfy more than two dozen five-star hotels.

The cost of such rooms is much lower, and the service varies depending on the hospitality of the owners of private apartments. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of crimea by the sea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33695/816756.jpg" width="600"></div>  Resorts such as Saki and Yevpatoriya are focused on combining beach vacations with spa treatment and rehabilitation.  Many specialized sanatoriums belong to the largest enterprises in Russia and Ukraine.  Mud baths Saki and Moynaki are known for their healing mud, which helps to cure many diseases.  The most famous sanatoriums in Saki: "Saki", "Yurmino", Saki Central Military Clinical Sanatorium.  However, treatment is available not only to residents of the sanatorium, but also to those who chose other Crimea hotels on the seashore.
