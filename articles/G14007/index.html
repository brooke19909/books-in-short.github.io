  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The specifics of teaching the discipline 'Management of educational systems' in a pedagogical university</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The <span>pedagogical university</span> teaches several specialized disciplines.  The learning process begins with the general issues of pedagogy, but gradually the disciplines become more specialized depending on the profession received.  For example, <span>comparative pedagogy is</span> taught for students of the faculty of foreign languages, and the management of educational systems will be most useful for those who plan to take a leadership position in an educational institution of any type. </p><p>  There are several ways to improve the quality of training in this discipline: </p><p>  1) Students are motivated to create their own types of schools, their own <span>teaching</span> and management <span>methods</span> , to open experimental institutions and basic schools for specialized universities. </p><p>  2) The knowledge on the discipline "Management of educational systems" is transmitted in the form of lectures, discussions of material covered, discussions.  Students are given the opportunity to prepare and give a lecture on the subject of discipline or to prepare a project for managing a new school.  The topic of the project is discussed in advance with the teacher, and the number of project executors is also determined.  They can be from 1 to 4 people.  The project is presented and discussed in a practical lesson.  But since any discussion is based on knowledge of the laws of education, there is a need for these laws to read, study, analyze. </p><p>  3) Control test tasks in the form of 5-6 questions are given at the beginning of each lesson to consolidate previously acquired knowledge.  Students set their own grades - by the score for the correct answer.  If the teacher has developed a rating system, the total score for each lesson will be an impressive amount that allows you to compete with those who did not cope with the tests or missed the lesson. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  4) <span>Methods of managing</span> educational systems are developed annually in the process of training.  Students in their specialty spend a number of lessons with students, practicing methods for managing the student team.  In addition, students study the school management structure and participate in this process, attending <span>pedagogical councils,</span> general meetings and meetings with parents.  The normative documentation is studied, on the basis of which the activities of the institution are carried out, in particular, the charter of a general educational institution, the standard regulation on the institution.  As a result, conclusions are drawn about which methods and principles of managing educational systems are the most effective in this institution. </p><p>  5) The examination in the discipline "Management of educational systems" is carried out in the form of a creative management project, which should reflect all the <span>principles of management</span> regulated by the law on education.  The principles of state policy in education must be taken into account: the principles of humanism, freedom, democratization in government, the secular nature of education, the accessibility and unity of the cultural national and educational space. </p><p>  The results of the quality of acquired knowledge are usually monitored by an independent commission offering students to undergo testing in the discipline "Management of educational systems."  Testing is carried out a year or two after the end of the course.  Thus, experts estimate the level of residual knowledge, which normally should be 50-60% of the knowledge provided by the standard for the discipline "Management of educational systems."  Residual knowledge remains in the structure of <span>long-term memory</span> and can be applied by a future teacher in the process of professional activity. </p>
