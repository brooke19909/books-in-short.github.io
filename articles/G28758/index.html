    <h2>  Supply system </h2><p>  Hotel Sunny Hills Hotel Apts 3 * does not offer tourists a wide choice in terms of food.

Secondly, not far from the complex there are many restaurants and cafes, which at a low price offer travelers to enjoy Greek cuisine.  Guests spend the day swimming in the sea or walking around Paphos, so it‚Äôs more convenient for them to dine outside the hotel.  When issuing a ticket, they can choose either accommodation without meals, or pay only for breakfast. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel shortcomings noted by tourists </h2><p>  Tourists who stayed at Sunny Hills Hotel Apts 3 * leave negative reviews.  In them they describe the following disadvantages of the apartment: </p><ul><li>  The dishes in the rooms are very dirty.  The residual grease and detergents are visible on it, so tourists who come here will first have to wash all the plates and mugs. </li><li>  Bright floor in the room, which shows spots of dirt. </li><li>  Ants crawl through the rooms, which can sometimes climb into bed. </li><li>  The water in the sink leaves very poorly.  You have to wait almost half an hour to turn on the water again.  The administrator does not respond to a request to clean it. </li><li>  Monotonous breakfast.  Every day they serve the same set of dishes, which quickly bothers. </li></ul><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Hotel Sunny Hills Hotel Apts 3 * can be advised for a budget vacation in Cyprus.  It is suitable for tourists who prefer a calm and respectable vacation.  It often stops adults and elderly people, families with children.  Young people are much less common here.  There are not many night clubs and discos in Paphos, so they choose other resorts.  Arriving here with children, tourists should think about the organization of leisure in advance, because the hotel does not offer kids any entertainment. </p>
