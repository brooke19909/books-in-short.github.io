    <p>  In the pre-Christian era, the Slavs had their own faith, the formation of which took place in the culture for centuries.  Now the pagan gods are again returning from oblivion, awakening a new, very strong interest among the descendants of those peoples.  Despite the planting of Christianity, which was alien to the Russians, which for the most part took place by force, fire and sword, the people preserved in folklore, fairy tales and festivals mention of their true gods.  And sometimes, without suspecting it, we mention their names, which have become common nouns. </p><p>  <strong>Rod and Svarog</strong> </p><p>  The pagan <span>gods of ancient</span> Russia are, first of all, a family.  It is in that understanding how we are accustomed to imagine it.  At the head is the ancestor of all the other gods - Rod.  He is the creator of all things: light and darkness (White-God and Chernobog) and the universe.  Through his companion, a woman in labor, Lada, he gave birth to Svarog, who became the main god of earthlings.  It is believed that every person is a descendant of Svarog himself, that is, he can rightfully consider him to be his great-great-great ... grandfather. </p><p>  How did Rod appear?  It was created by the Supreme or the Absolute, that is, the very energy that has always been and will always be, the Force that figures in all <span>world religions</span> without exception <span>.</span> </p><p>  Svarog completed the work of the ancestor - the creation of our world.  Now it consists of three parts located at different levels.  The upper, heavenly world of Reign, inhabited by the gods.  Middle - Appear - is inhabited by people and is visible to us.  On the lower level - Navi - the souls of the dead dwell.  From there are obsessions and bad dreams come. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Alive and Alive</strong> </p><p>  Another oldest pagan gods of the Slavs is Alive and Alive.  They are the incarnations of male and female principles.  Alive is symbolized by a blade, a spear, a ‚Äú+‚Äù sign, a pentagram directed upward.  Alive carries a negative, lunar energy.  Its symbols are colo, ring, bowl, <span>five-pointed star</span> directed downward.  The result of their union is Zhivatma - the ‚ÄúI‚Äù of all that exists: a person, animal, plant, mineral, even an <span>elementary particle.</span>  It is individual, indivisible, it cannot be destroyed.  The size of Zhivatma is one ten-thousandth part of the hair section, this is a tiny luminous particle of the Supreme Aum. </p><p>  <strong>Lada mother</strong> </p><p>  Pagan gods always had companions who bore and bore them children.  God Rod was the very first to create Lada - the goddess of love and beauty.  She is also called the Beregina, the Holy Virgin, the Virgin Swan.  She became the wife of Belobog. </p><p>  The mother of the Gods of the Great Race is the patroness of the family, children and mothers, orphans and widows.  In honor of her, <span>people</span> called the <span>ideal</span> way of life - a way where everything is peaceful and good, and people get along with each other.  She also cared for abundance, ripening crops, </p><p>  The goddess of childbirth is also the daughter of Lada - Lelya.  In addition, her children are considered the twelve months of which the year consists. </p><p>  <strong>Belobog (Light-sighted) and Chernobog (Dark-eyed)</strong> </p><p>  Belobog and Chernobog are also the oldest pagan gods.  Svetovid - the husband of Lada - rules the world of Reveal.  He is the personification of peace, harmony, friendship, sincerity, good luck and good.  Patronizes trade and art. </p><p>  Dark-sighted (aka Morok, Pestilence, Darkness) - chained in armor, with a fierce face, the lord of the world Navi, the eternal enemy of Belobog.  Its symbol is the skull.  The wise Slavs respected Chernobog along with its opposite, because without darkness there is no light, everything in the world should be in balance. </p><p>  These are just some of the oldest, main representatives of the pantheon of ancestral gods.  In addition to them, their children and grandchildren exist, each of which has a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.  The main difference between the native faith of the Slavs is that any representative of the race is a direct descendant of the gods, having the same potential as his ancestors. </p><p>  In general, pagan gods of the Slavs are recognizable in many other religions of the world, especially those that originate from the Vedic culture.  This indirectly indicates that Rodnoverie is the oldest faith of our ancestors.  With travelers and immigrants, it spread through foreign lands, passed on to other nations. </p>
