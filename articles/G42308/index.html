A priority is a transparent ownership structure and a broad client base.  Based on the goal, a strategy was formed according to which already in 2007 the National Standard Bank redeemed 97.26% of the shares of CB RusYugbank OJSC, which is the largest in the region and has a very expanded network of offices and auxiliary branches.  This gave an impetus to the active development of the enterprise. </p><h2>  Priority area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, National Standard Bank received a short-term counterparty rating of B / B.  According to the national scale, the rating of a financial institution corresponds to the value "ruBBB +".  These indicators indicate a likely negative scenario for further developments.  Bank ratings take into account moderate business position, moderate capital and income, weakened risk positions and average financial liquidity.  A negative outlook is based not only on net banking indicators, but also on the state of the financial sector in Russia itself, which may have a certain financial impact on the institution.  This moment has become the reason for significant differences between the assessment of domestic and international experts. </p><h2>  What do customers say? </h2>

    <p>  At the first stages of its work, the National Standard commercial bank was exclusively engaged in servicing Usmanov's companies.  Since 2004 <span>, the financial</span> institution began to take an active part in the issue of municipal bonds.  A significant indicator of the active development of the financial institution was his purchase of RusYugbank, which was mentioned above.  Most of the reviews about the financial institution talk about the many positive aspects of partnerships, including in the field of lending.  This is what ensured a positive popular rating.  Bank customers focus on the fact that a financial institution offers the opportunity to early repay a debt after six months after its completion.  Mutually beneficial partnership in the aspect of lending is answered by many more investors, confirming the optimal terms of partnership and acceptable interest rates. </p><h2>  And even brokerage services are available </h2><p>  National Standard Bank (Stary Oskol, Moscow and some other cities where offices operate) offers brokerage services not only on the stock exchange, but also on the over-the-counter market.  Clients can, through partnerships with the bank, purchase municipal and corporate bonds, sovereign and corporate Eurobonds and domestic foreign currency bonds.  Cooperation is available under two tariff plans, which pleases investors, as it allows them to reduce the costs of paying for intermediary actions.  According to one of the plans, the commission is 30 thousand rubles for any volume of operations, and in another way it varies from 0.01% to 0.2% and depends solely on the volume of turnover of funds. </p><h2>  Reviews of employees of a financial institution </h2>
