  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Options for the application of cereals</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Application is a type of fine art, which implies the compilation of individual parts of a holistic picture.  The work uses a variety of materials - traditional colored paper, natural material (leaves, tree seeds, cone flakes, twigs, etc.), satin ribbons and strips of print media.  Pictures are created from shells and sunflower and pumpkin seeds, from matches and cotton sponges, straw and hay, <span>pasta, beads</span> and rhinestones are used. </p><p>  In the article we will consider the options for the application of cereals for children and adults.  What <span>types of cereals</span> can be used in the work, how to paint it in different colors, giving the grains the necessary shades, you will learn further. </p><h2>  Croup snowman </h2><p>  Before starting work on such an application from cereals, you need to draw a snowman figure on a sheet of cardboard with a simple pencil or marker.  Lines separate parts of the work that will need to be glued with different grains.  So the child will understand the method of placing the seeds.  We select the following materials for gluing: </p><ul><li>  millet; </li><li>  buckwheat; </li><li>  fig. </li></ul><p>  The remaining elements of the picture can be made of plasticine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cereal snowman" class="if uuid-2304391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304391.jpg"></div><p>  Do the work in parts, spreading the required surface with thick PVA glue.  Then, until it is dry, a handful of rice, buckwheat or millet is poured and attached to the cardboard with pressing movements.  After drying, the application of the cereal is turned over and the excess grains are poured onto the table.  Then work continues on the other details of the application. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Creating pictures from cereals is a troublesome and painstaking task, especially if the drawing is complex and has many components. </p><h2>  Groats applique templates </h2><p>  If you do not know how to draw, but want to make a beautiful and original picture, then you can use the templates.  These are simple coloring pages for children, which are sold in large numbers in bookstores.  They are perfect for cereal applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.leukvoorkids.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns for applications from cereals" class="if uuid-2304395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304395.jpg"></div><p>  Having a ready-made pattern in front of your eyes, it will be much easier for an adult and a child to correctly place layers of various grains. </p><h2>  Mushrooms from different cereals </h2><p>  Borovikov in the clearing can be made in the <span>form of an application</span> of cereals for a competition or an exhibition of children's works at school.  To make such a picture, you need a sheet of cardboard, a ready-made template and the following cereals: </p><ul><li>  millet; </li><li>  buckwheat; </li><li>  Wheat groats. </li></ul><p>  Grass can be made out of spruce or pine needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="porcini mushrooms" class="if uuid-2304389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304389.jpg"></div><p>  On the template, individual parts of the fungus are visible - legs, hats and their inner side.  Gradually spreading glue on the individual parts, we generously fill them with grits.  Then gently, patting, glue the grains to a sheet of cardboard.  The remainder, as already mentioned, spills out onto the table. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the picture is ready, it can be sprayed with hairspray.  This will slightly strengthen and decorate the surface of the picture.  Yes, and it will look brighter, as it will shine under electric lighting. </p><h2>  Owl from cereals and seeds </h2><p>  Such a wonderful owl, as in the photo in the article, is quite difficult to perform with cereal crafts.  It is necessary to spend a lot of time on its manufacture. </p><p>  After finding a suitable template, the drawing is transferred to the prepared background.  Next, you need to think about what colors will be needed to convey all the components of the bird's figure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="owl made from grains" class="if uuid-2304384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304384.jpg"></div><p>  Here you can use different cereals and seeds.  For example, the feathers on the head and wings of an owl are black, which means that you can take sunflower seeds.  The paws of the bird are yellow, for this we will use either millet or yellow old peas.  The branch of the tree on which the bird sits has a brown trunk (buckwheat) and green leaves (green peas).  For feathers on the chest, take striped sunflower seeds, they will look spectacular. </p><p>  In such a complicated craft from cereals, you still need to correctly and accurately place the elements of the application.  Here it will no longer be possible to fill in a field of a handful of grain spread with glue and to pour in excess.  Here you will need tweezers to place items in a piece by piece.  Seeds are all directed with a pointed part in one direction.  The eyes are laid out of white bean in semi-arches. </p><h2>  Cockerel - Golden Scallop </h2><p>  Such a wonderful cockerel from grains of different colors can be made on a template cut out of thick cardboard.  If it is possible to use a jigsaw, then you can prepare the contours of the bird on fiberboard.  After sticking all the elements of the image, it will be possible to put the cockerel on a shelf on the stand.  It will be a wonderful decoration in the kitchen or in the dining room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Croup Craft - Cock" class="if uuid-2304414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304414.jpg"></div><p>  To create a craft that has so many different elements, you need to prepare in advance.  The following seeds and grains of cereals will be needed in the work: </p><ul><li>  neck melon seeds; </li><li>  red lentils for scallops and beards; </li><li>  paw corn; </li><li>  different shapes and colors of beans and red corn for the tail; </li><li>  pumpkin seeds for wings; </li><li>  buckwheat for the torso. </li></ul><p>  Elements are laid in neat rows on the PVA glue and pressed down with tweezers.  After doing the work and completely drying the glue, you need to open the craft with acrylic varnish.  Then it will be possible to store it for a long time, putting it in a frame under the glass. </p><h2>  How to paint cereals? </h2><p>  If you need different colors for work, but there is no way to choose the necessary ones, then the grains are beautifully painted with simple gouache paint.  To do this, you need several containers and sheets of paper.  Take rice or millet, for example.  Buckwheat is harder to stain in a different color, as it is dark.  It will first have to be painted white, and then already in the shade necessary for the drawing. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="zaS8skFJUT0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaS8skFJUT0" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/4/2/1242.jpg"></div><p>  After watching the training video, it will become clear that it is very easy to color the cereal, just mix it with gouache paint of the desired color and dry the grains on a piece of paper. </p><p>  The article describes both simple and complex crafts from cereals, photos and tips on what material is best to choose in each individual case.  If necessary, now you can correctly and quickly paint grains with paints.  It remains only to gather courage and try to make an original craft.  Creating is always a pleasure, especially with children! </p>
