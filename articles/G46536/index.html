This street is not on the usual map of the city, but this unusual place can be found on the plan of the fortress.  The houses on this street are surprisingly small, because they are built into the arches of the defensive rampart.  Moreover, they are equipped and the second floor. </p>

Tiny houses, kitchen and household utensils, even knightly armor can tell the life story of the inhabitants of this glorious historical place.  The street begins its history back in the 16th century, at that time the main inhabitants were the guards.  They defended the northern part of Prague Castle.  Time passed, the epochs changed, and the people who became permanent residents of the fortress changed with it.  In the tower of Dalibork and the White Tower, prisoner nobles appeared.  The gallery of the defensive rampart was completed with houses for the guards and their families, who also carried the function of security guards.  Noblemen lived, oddly enough, in custody at their own expense, and the poor guards benefited from this maximum benefit and benefit.

Rumor has it that at the beginning of the 16th century, under the patronage of that same King Rudolph II, alchemists lived here, who knew how to make gold from sulfur, salt and mercury.  In those days, many kings and noble nobles hoped to replenish their treasury in this way.  The alchemists of that time were faced with serious, but at the same time difficult tasks.  This, of course, is the search for the elixir of immortality, the philosopher's stone and gold, a lot of gold. </p>

King Rudolph welcomed everyone and settled in one place.  And the modern administration of Zlata streets in Prague even made a wax installation of a mustached alchemist in order to maintain the curiosity of tourists.

    <p>  The days of the alchemists passed, and they were replaced by artisans-jewelers.  In one of the houses, judging by the presence of a safe and a fire cabinet, there was a jewelry workshop.  Here, not only worked, but also the master of jewelry and his family lived.  The interior decoration of the rooms has not changed much even in the details, all objects are in place, as if the jeweler had just left. </p><p>  And nearby there is a house in which the craftswoman needlewoman received, she sewed dresses for her regular customers.  If you go a little more, you can see the house of the healer-herbalist.  There still smells of tinctures and tinctures, which he apparently prescribed to his visitors.  Times have changed, along with them came the unprecedented flowering of the craft, and terrific poverty.  Nevertheless, this place has always attracted people by its name or history. </p><h2>  Zlata street in Prague: how to get there </h2><p>  To get to this place, you need to go on line A metro to the station Malostranska.
