    <h2>  How to choose the resorts of France </h2><p>  At sea in France you can admire more than 3 thousand kilometers of coast.  It overlooks both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  All resorts located here have their pros and cons. </p><p>  So, on the Atlantic coast, the water is cooler even at the height of the beach season, but at the same time it is cleaner and suitable for healing procedures.  The Atlantic beaches are sandy, but there is a problem of ebbs and flows.  In some areas, the sea recedes one kilometer from the coast (this is especially common in Brittany and Normandy).  Therefore, vacationers bathe here only at high tide. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Mediterranean Sea is much warmer and the coast is sunny.  An important role is played by the advertising of the <span>Cote d'Azur.</span>  Interestingly, the French themselves believe that Atlantic resorts are more attractive, largely because of their lesser workload. </p>

    <p>  The minus of the resorts of the Mediterranean can be considered the small width of the beaches (less than 50 m) and pebbles (resorts between the Italian border and Nice). </p><h2>  Benefits of Sea Resorts </h2><p>  French resorts on the sea (photos of them you can see in this article) provide tourists with not just beaches and related entertainment services (casinos, golf clubs, discos and nightclubs), but also therapeutic procedures that, according to vacationers, make you feel better with various, sometimes very serious diseases. </p><p>  It is no secret that France is the birthplace of thalassotherapy.  The very first thalassotherapy center was opened in 1899 in the city of Roscoff.  Now in the country there are several dozen centers aimed at treating such ailments as rheumatism and acute pain in the spine, as well as post-traumatic rehabilitation. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  For vacationers, it is important to know the climatic conditions in the place of stay.  So, the Atlantic coast of France is characterized by a cool sea climate - the temperature difference between summer and winter values ​​is small (+ 7 °  and + 20 ° ).  The swimming season lasts three summer months. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  French resorts on the Mediterranean Sea (photo you can see in the article) are distinguished by a classic subtropical climate - winters are mild and sunny, and summers are dry and hot.  In this article we will introduce you to the most popular and most visited holiday destinations, where both the French and numerous tourists spend their vacations. </p><h2>  Sea Resorts in France: French Riviera </h2><p>  A narrow and long strip on the northern coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, which stretches from Marseille to La Spezia (Italy) is united by the common name - Riviera.  <span>The Cote d'Azur is</span> sometimes called the French Riviera. </p><p>  French resorts on the sea, photos of which regularly appear on the pages of glossy publications, are known all over the world not only because of their amazing nature and living conditions. </p><p>  The city of Cannes, located on the shores of the picturesque Gulf of Napoule, is a prestigious and fashionable summer vacation destination.  The same applies to Nice.  Significantly increases the rating of Cannes and the annual film festival held in May. </p>

    <p>  Until the beginning of the XIX century, it was a small fishing village, until the French and foreign aristocracy discovered a picturesque area and began to build boarding houses and villas here.  Today, Cannes retain the status of a resort for high society of international importance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Cannes is a southern French city with a population of about seventy thousand people who are almost completely employed in the tourism sector.  The beach of this resort is sandy, wide.  Closely adjacent to it is the world-famous Croisette.  In a city with a well-developed infrastructure, many magnificent hotels have been built, guaranteeing guests a comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Monaco </h2><p>  French resorts on the Mediterranean attract tourists, in addition to excellent conditions for recreation and living, a wonderful climate.  For example, in Monaco, on average, there are at least three hundred sunny days a year.  The principality has many beautifully equipped beaches and pools, thalassotherapy centers. </p>

    <p>  Here you can stay in comfortable hotels, most of which are four- and five-star.  Superbly manicured sandy beach strip does not exceed two kilometers, since the main landscape is rocks.  The beaches in Monaco are paid, and their cost significantly exceeds the average price in the country. </p><h2>  Cap d'agde </h2><p>  Probably there is no person who would not dream of visiting the resorts of France on the sea.  In comparison with previous places, you can relax in Cap d'Agde, the largest resort in the Languedoc province, created in the 60s of the last century.  Its beaches, stretching over fourteen kilometers, are covered with fine clean sand.  The city has a well-developed infrastructure.  It offers guests - thalassotherapy, water park, golf and tennis, an island of entertainment and other pleasures of resort life. </p>

    <p>  There are still small resort villages on the Languedoc coast, however, the conditions here are somewhat inferior to vacation spots on the Cote d'Azur.  In this regard, they are unpopular among wealthy tourists.  The main advantage of a holiday in Languedoc is the affordable cost for middle-income guests. </p><p>  The resort village of Por-Camargue is known as a calm and quiet place for families.  In addition, it is a large entertainment center with a yacht school and a modern thalassotherapy center. </p><h2>  Quiberon </h2><p>  Unfortunately, some resorts in France (at sea) have a very small beach season.  For example, Kibron, in the south of Brittany, is located on a narrow spit that protrudes into the sea.  The beach season here lasts only two months - from July to August. </p><p>  The named resort is famous for the institute of thalassotherapy, which is recognized as the best in the world.  There are great beaches, pine forests, dunes, a golf club.  In addition, those who wish can go to neighboring Karnak to see a collection of megaliths (the largest in the world) - ancient stone statues. </p><p>  Rest in Kibron is indicated for people with metabolic disorders and disorders of the nervous system. </p>

    <h2>  La baule </h2><p>  The resort is located in the center of the coast of Côte d'Amour.  Prestigious and fashionable, it is comparable in image with the Breton Dinar and the Norman Deauville.  Great hotels here are lined up along the beach.  The best of them is Le Royale. </p><p>  The city has many <span>restaurants, cafes,</span> entertainment centers, casinos.  Thalassotherapy centers also receive visitors.  All guests of the resort spend daytime on the beach.  It stretched along the coast for nine kilometers.
