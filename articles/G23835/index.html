    <h2>  What is interesting tube <span>sound amplifier?</span> </h2><p>  An amplifier is one of the key components of the acoustic infrastructure, which is responsible for increasing the power of those signals that come from sound sources, switching the corresponding devices, adjusting the volume level, and also transmitting a signal whose power is amplified to audio equipment designed to play tunes. </p><p>  In tube amplifiers, radio tubes are used as a key element of circuitry.  They serve as reinforcing elements.  Typically, tube amplifiers provide less distortion.  As many music lovers note, the corresponding devices are characterized by a warmer, softer reproduction of melodies - especially when playing medium as well as high frequencies. </p><p>  Another major advantage of a tube amplifier is in providing in many cases a richer sound in comparison, for example, with transistor devices.  This is possible due to the unique properties of the lamps themselves, which, for example, are adapted to function without auxiliary correction, which is necessary to maintain the operation of, in turn, semiconductor devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  One-stroke and two-stroke devices </h2><p>  Tube devices are most often classified into 2 main categories - class A and class AB.  The former are also referred to as single-cycle.  In them, amplifying elements stimulate an increase in the power of both half-waves in the signal - both positive and negative.  The second devices are also called push-pull.  In them, each subsequent cascade of increasing power involves the use of different elements - one may be responsible for the positive half-wave, while the other can be responsible for the negative.  Class AB amplifiers are usually more economical and more efficient, often more powerful.  But on this score, discussions sometimes arise among music lovers. </p><p>  The considered devices in many cases are much more expensive than transistor analogs, despite the fact that their design is quite simple.  Many music lovers assemble the appropriate devices on their own - however, you need to try to find the best schemes for tube amplifiers - on 6P3S, for example, or other popular lamps.  For music connoisseurs playing using the devices in question, their price is often of secondary importance - if it is decided not to assemble an amplifier, but to buy it.  However, the characteristics, of course, play an undeniably significant role in choosing a device.  Consider what they can be, as well as examples of popular models of the corresponding type of devices. </p><h2>  Amplifier ProLogue EL34: specifications and reviews </h2><p>  According to many experts, the best tube amplifier, or at least related to the leaders by the relevant criterion (of those that belong to the budget segment) is the ProLogue Classic EL34 device.  This device can operate using two types of lamps - actually EL34 or KT88.  In this case, the user does not have to reconfigure the amplifier. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  According to experts - reviews that reflect their opinions can be found on many thematic portals - one of the main advantages of the device is its equipped with interfaces that allow you to smoothly load the lamp, which helps to increase its service life.  The amplifier is equipped with an effective <span>volume control.</span>  The device has a fairly large power, which is 35 watts. </p><h2>  Amplifiers Triode </h2><p>  Another amplifier that belongs to the budget category is the TRV-35 device, manufactured by the Japanese Triode brand.  The fact that it is assembled in Japan largely determines the quality of the corresponding product.  The amplifier is universal - perhaps it is the best tube amplifier in its segment from this point of view.  Lamps that can be used on the device - EL34, in some cases, it is possible to use the ElectroHarmonix elements manufactured in Russia. </p><p>  According to experts, one of the most notable options for the amplifier in question is the ability to connect to modern home theaters. </p>

    <p>  Another well-known product of the Japanese Triode brand is the TRX-P6L device.  As some experts note, this device is the best tube amplifier in the Triode line in terms of functionality.  So, in it there is, in particular, an equalizer of four-band type, which is designed to optimize the timbre of the melody taking into account the specific acoustic situation in the room, as well as the parameters of the used sound systems.  The device in question allows you to use different categories of lamps - EL34, <span>6L6, as</span> well as KT88.  The device is equipped with a depth feedback regulator.  The amplifier can operate in 2 modes - triode, as well as ultra-linear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another notable device manufactured under the Triode brand is the VP-300BD amplifier.  Many music lovers ask a common question: "One-stroke or two-stroke tube amplifier - which is better?"  They can, having chosen exactly the VP-300BD, which refers to the devices of the first type, remain very satisfied with the purchased device.  The device in question is a triode one, classified as an open type amplifier.  It may be noted that the output stage of the device operates on triodes 300B, which are classified as direct-channel. </p><h2>  Audio Research VSi60 </h2><p>  Among the most famous brands of manufacturers of tube amplifiers is the American corporation Audio Research.  Its most technologically advanced products include the VSi60.  Many music lovers are convinced that tube amplifiers are better than transistor ones, and the device manufactured by the American company allows us to put forward a strong argument in favor of devices of the first type: according to experts, the amplifier in question provides the most impressive sound scale, which is quite comparable with the performance of transistor devices.  The main lamps with which the American device works are the KT120.  The volume control of the <span>amplifier</span> in question is <span>electronic.</span> </p><h2>  Amplifiers Unison Research </h2><p>  Another well-known brand of devices in question is Unison Research.  The most effective solutions developed by this corporation include the S6 amplifier.  Perhaps he is the best tube amplifier, or at least related to leading solutions, in terms of a combination of characteristics that are characteristic of class A devices: high power of 35 W, as well as a significant damping coefficient.  The device uses 2 direct-current triodes located in each channel. </p><p>  According to experts, the amplifier in question is characterized by the highest sound quality in terms of detail and purity of the reproduced melody. </p><p>  The next well-known product manufactured under the Unison Research brand is the P70 amplifier.  In turn, it is push-pull.  Music lovers wondering why a single-cycle tube amplifier plays better than a push-pull amplifier, slightly change their perception of the effectiveness of the corresponding devices, listening to music when using the device in question.  The developers of the P70 amplifier managed to provide exceptionally high sound quality with a very impressive power of the device - more than 70 watts. </p><p>  According to experts, the device can connect to the acoustic infrastructure, forming a fairly impressive load.  The device in question is also characterized by genre versatility.  If we consider the best tube amplifiers for listening to rock music - the P70 device can rightfully be attributed to leading solutions. </p><p>  Among the well-known single-cycle products manufactured under the Unison Research brand is the Preludio device.  It also operates in Class A. It uses the powerful KT88 tetrodes.  The power of the device is 14 watts.  Therefore, the amplifier requires a connection to the acoustic infrastructure, which has a sufficiently high level of sensitivity. </p><h2>  Mcintosh </h2><p>  Another well-known brand that produces amplifiers is the American corporation McIntosh.  Many music lovers, wondering which tube amp is best, first of all associate the highest quality products with those devices that are manufactured under the McIntosh brand.  This corporation is one of the most recognized manufacturers of audio equipment in the Hi-End segment in the world. </p>

    <p>  It may be noted that the McIntosh MC275 product first appeared on the market in 1961.  Since then, it has implemented a number of improvements, but it is still produced under its historical name.  In principle, this amplifier belongs to the legendary devices, one of the best products in the world in the Hi-End segment.  The device uses KT88 lamps.  The power of the amplifier is 75 watts in stereo playback mode. </p><h2>  Audio note </h2><p>  Another well-known brand on the amplifier market is Audio Note.  Among his most popular products is Meishu Phono.  Perhaps this is the best tube amplifier in its segment, if we consider the corresponding devices in terms of observing the purity of the technology.  So, not a single semiconductor is involved in it.  In the structure of the power supply unit of the device there are 3 transformers, 3 kenotrons, as well as 2 chokes.  The output stage uses 300B triodes.  In the design of the amplifier there is an effective tube phono stage.  The device in question has a rather modest power, which is 9 watts.  Nevertheless, the device is compatible with many modern types of floor acoustic equipment. </p><p>  Determining the best tube sound amplifier based on the subjective perception of its operation is quite difficult.  However, one can come closer to solving a similar problem by comparing one or another device model by its main characteristics, as well as by analyzing the corresponding parameters. </p><h2>  Choosing the best amplifier: model comparison options </h2><p>  What parameters can be considered as key?  According to modern experts, the most important characteristics in this case can be: </p><p>  - power; </p><p>  - <span>frequency range</span> ; </p><p>  - level of harmonic distortion; </p><p>  - signal to noise ratio; </p><p>  - support for communication standards; </p><p>  - level of energy consumption. </p><p>  In turn, these parameters can be compared with the price of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Choose an amplifier: power </h2><p>  As for the first indicator - power, it can be represented in the widest range of values.  Optimal for solving most of the problems characterizing the use of a tube amplifier is an indicator of the order of 35 watts.  But many music lovers only welcome an increase in this value - for example, up to 50 watts. </p><p>  At the same time, many modern high-tech devices of the corresponding type work perfectly at a power of about 12 watts.  Of course, in many cases they require connection to a high-performance acoustic infrastructure.  But the use of effective audio equipment is one of the mandatory attributes of the use, in fact, of the devices in question.  Why a tube amplifier is better than more modern modifications of devices is a question that is not particularly relevant for many music lovers, since they have repeatedly been convinced in practice of the objective superiority of the corresponding devices in key parameters.  And therefore, they try to conduct testing and practical use of tube amplifiers on pre-prepared equipment that meets the highest requirements. </p><h2>  Frequency </h2><p>  Regarding the frequency response of the amplifier, it is highly desirable that it be in the range from 20 to 20 thousand Hz.  Although, it should be noted, quite rarely, the modern manufacturers of devices in question supply amplifiers to the markets that do not meet this criterion.  It is difficult to find equipment in the Hi-End segment that would not reach the indicated frequency parameters.  One way or another, when buying a tube amplifier, for example, from a little-known brand, it makes sense to check in which range it supports the frequency. </p><h2>  Harmonic distortion </h2><p>  As for harmonic distortion, it is desirable that they do not exceed 0.6%.  Actually, the lower this indicator - the better the sound.  The best tube amplifier in a given segment is often determined primarily on the basis of the harmonic distortion index.  It should be noted right away that the corresponding indicator is not the most significant in terms of ensuring good sound quality.  However, this parameter characterizes the response of the acoustic infrastructure to the input signal.  It is rather difficult in practice to provide stimulation of the acoustics reaction during measurement as it is when playing real signals.  But modern brands of tube amplifier manufacturers are trying to provide the lowest harmonic distortion.  Prestigious models of devices are able to provide it at a level not exceeding 0.1%.  Of course, their cost may be incomparably higher than competing models that have a higher harmonic distortion, but for the music lover, the price issue in this case may be secondary. </p>

    <h2>  Signal to noise ratio </h2><p>  The next parameter is the signal-to-noise ratio; in modern tube amplifiers, it most often corresponds to an indicator of 90 dB or more.  In general, this value can be considered very common when comparing the characteristics of various devices, even if presented in different segments.  Therefore, if the task is to choose a good one-cycle tube amplifier or, for example, a two-cycle amplifier, then the considered parameter will not always objectively reflect the competitiveness of a particular device.  One way or another, the higher the corresponding indicator - the better.  It is desirable that it be at least 70. Some top models of amplifiers provide a signal to noise ratio of more than 100 dB.  But their price, as in the case of harmonic distortions, can be impressive. </p><h2>  Other parameters </h2><p>  The remaining parameters - support for one or another communication standard, power consumption, are significant, but secondary.  It makes sense to pay attention to them, all other things being equal, in terms of the indicators that we examined above.  One way or another, for a modern amplifier, it is typical to consider the presence of support for a sufficient number of stereo pairs - about 4, audio output for recording sound.  Regarding energy consumption - its optimal indicator is about 280 watts. </p>

    <p>  Of course, when considering which tube amplifier is better, many subjective factors play a role.  Most often, music lovers evaluate the corresponding devices based on them: design, build quality, sound level, ergonomics. </p><p>  All the above parameters can be compared with the price of the device, which can be represented in a very wide range of values.  But a person for whom the question is not why the tube amplifier is better than the transistor one, since he knows the answer to it, the price, as we noted above, can not always be considered as the most significant criterion when choosing a device for organizing listening to your favorite tunes. </p>
