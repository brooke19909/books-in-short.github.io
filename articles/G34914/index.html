    <h2>  Secrecy </h2><p>  From acquaintance with the proposed package of options, we will begin.  It's no secret that hiding your number on a mobile device is not a fairy tale, but a very real opportunity.  And she is interested in many. </p><p>  Beeline numbers can be hidden without unnecessary problems with our today's service.  "Antiaon" is valid even in cases when your interlocutor has the package of options "Caller ID" installed <span>.</span>  It turns out that you can always remain completely anonymous.  "Antiaon" ("Beeline") is what you need to keep your number a secret. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Well, like any option, this offer has some peculiarities.  For example, there can be no such non-standard opportunity absolutely free and act endlessly, right?  Yes indeed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Beeline service "Antiaon" is connected independently.  And it turns off too.  Otherwise, it will work until you issue a waiver of the option. </p><p>  Plus, "Antiaon" ("Beeline") is a paid offer.  And here the cost varies depending on the location of the subscriber.  But the price tag differs not too much.  Yes, and there are two types of payment - monthly and "advance".  In the first case, you will be charged about 88 rubles per month (post-payment), and in the second - 3.77 rubles per day (prepayment).  The connection and disconnection itself is free.  But in advance you need to worry about the availability of a sufficient amount on the balance sheet to charge a monthly fee.  For a day or a month immediately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline numbers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1148288.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In principle, that‚Äôs all.  After all, Antiaon (Beeline) has no more features.  Unless, as already mentioned, you can hide your number, even when the Interlocutor is connected to the interlocutor.  What needs to be done to get such an interesting service?  And how to disable it if necessary? </p><h2>  We call the operator </h2><p>  For example, a good option would be to use a Beeline hotline.  That is, using the most ordinary call, you can both connect and disconnect our today's options package.  Not the most popular option, but it does exist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You need to get through to the Beeline company.  In this case, the operator is called using the combination 0611. This is a toll-free number that serves to connect subscribers with the company.  Dial it and wait for an answer.  And then you inform that you would like to enable or disable the "Anti-Aon" option.  An application will be drawn up for you, and after a while you will receive a message with the result of processing the operation on your mobile number.  Nothing difficult, right? </p><p>  Only now, "Antiaon" can be disconnected and connected using other methods.  Indeed, self-service is often in great demand among subscribers of all mobile operators.  And our case is no exception.  What other tricks can I use? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline operator call" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1148287.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Inquiries </h2><p>  For example, a USSD request is a good alternative to calls.  This function was invented so that each subscriber could independently disconnect and connect certain packages and offers at any time.  So, take this into account.  Requests and commands dialed from a Beeline mobile phone are completely free.  And you can use them at any time. </p><p>  To turn on the Antiaon mobile phone, Beeline offers two different combinations.  The first is a kind of number.  It looks like this: 067409071. As soon as you type it, just click on the "Call" button and wait.  The second solution to the connectivity issue is the USSD command.  In this case, you will need to dial * 110 * 071 #.  And of course, ring the combination again.  A couple of minutes of waiting - "Antiaon" is connected. </p><p>  What to do if you decide to abandon it?  Here again, the USSD combination comes to the rescue.  This time it looks like * 110 * 070 #.  So literally with a few clicks of the buttons, you can easily and simply connect or disconnect Anti-Aion (Beeline). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antiaon disable" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1148286.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  The last and perhaps the most interesting and modern approach to solving the problem is the use of the official Beeline website.  With its help, each subscriber is able to view information about his number, as well as connect and disconnect certain options. </p><p>  To make your ideas come true, you must go through the authorization in the "My Account" and select the "Services" tab.  Look for the item "Antiaon" there.  The function that is currently available will be displayed on the right side of the line.  This is either "Disconnect" or "Connect."  If you click here, you will receive an SMS with a confirmation code on your mobile.  Enter it in the appropriate window on the screen, and then click "OK." </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  But there is another solution to the problem.  You can use the special service from Beeline to connect and disconnect Antiaon.  To do this, dial * 111 # on your mobile phone and ‚Äúring‚Äù the combination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antiaon service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1148285.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  What will happen?  You will be taken to a special menu.  Carefully review it and find "Services" (other).  Look for "Antiaon" there and read the information about the offer.  What's next?  Select the desired button to connect and disconnect, respectively, send a request and wait.  Nothing more is needed. </p><p>  By the way, the use of * 111 # is also absolutely free.  Easily and simply you can connect and refuse any option that Beeline can give.  Now you can independently choose a way to solve the problem and bring it to life. </p>
