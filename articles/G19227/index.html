This is a large shopping, tourist and entertainment district, famous for its restaurants, shops and hotels.  The legendary pedestrian street Istiklal begins here, where there are many bars, night clubs and cinemas, so it is occupied by young people almost 24 hours a day.  The square itself is also lively, because it is a popular and favorite place both for tourists and for the local population.  Taksim hosts social events, parades, and concerts, and on December 31, locals gather in the square to celebrate the New Year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New Year at Taksim Square" class="if uuid-3020536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82509/3020536.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The word Taksim means "division" or "distribution."  During the late Ottoman period, Sultan Mahmoud I made this place a point where the main water lines from the north of Istanbul converged and then distributed to other parts of the city.  Thus, the square got its name from a large stone reservoir located on its western side.  Until the 20th century, this area was partially inhabited, there were military barracks, a training ground and a cemetery descending along the slopes.  In the 1930s, the cemetery was moved to another part of the city, and the district became open for construction, becoming one of the most revered parts of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport system </h2><p>  Currently, Taksim is also an important central hub, which distributes not so much water flows as public transport flows.  This is not only the main crossing point for the municipal bus system, but also the starting point of the Istanbul metro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stargundem.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Taksim Square transport" class="if uuid-3021027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/3021027.jpg"></div><p>  From the square you can reach anywhere in the city, and just 100 meters buses leave for Hawash Airport.  Taksim Square is served by the Istanbul Metro and underground funicular, which connects to a modern tram line.  An attractive feature of the square is the historical trams that arrive here from Independence Square.  You can take the tram to the very end - Tunel Square and take a walk back, visiting the nearby Istiklal, a long and elegant shopping street, which is one of the most popular pedestrian streets in Istanbul. </p><p>  Taksim Square has many attractions and one of the most important monuments.  This is what will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Republic Monument at Taksim Square in Istanbul </h2><p>  Designed by renowned Italian sculptor Pietro Canonica, it was erected in 1928, despite the strict Islamic prohibition of depicting living beings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Republic Monument" class="if uuid-3020526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82509/3020526.jpg"></div><p>  It marks the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, after the War of Independence, and perpetuates the memory of revolutionary leaders, including the founder of the republic, Kemal Atat√ºrk, commander in chief and statesman and his successor, the second president of Turkey, Ismet Inenu.  In gratitude for the help of the Soviet Union in the national liberation struggle, Kemal Ataturk ordered the left hand of his figure to immortalize Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Aralov.  Since its opening, the monument has become the centerpiece of official ceremonies in Istanbul. </p><h2>  Atat√ºrk K√ºlt√ºr Merkezi </h2><p>  On the other side of the square is a huge building - Ataturk Cultural Center.  In the first years of the republic‚Äôs existence, the construction of the opera began, which took as long as thirteen years and was completed in 1969.  It was opened as the Istanbul Palace of Culture and was a significant example of Turkish architecture of the 1960s. </p><div class="photo" data-original="worldarchitecture.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cultural Center" class="if uuid-3020528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82509/3020528.jpg"></div><p>  In 1970, a fire inflicted huge damage to the building and, after renovation, it opened in 1978 under the name of Ataturk Cultural Center, known as AKM.  National and international concerts, operas, rallies, exhibitions and premieres were held at AKM.  There were performances by the Istanbul State Theater, the State Opera and Ballet Theater, the State Symphony Orchestra, the State Turkish Classical Music Choir and the International Festival in Istanbul, attracting many spectators.  Currently, the building is undergoing a reconstruction phase again.  A visit to the legendary AKM in the evening will allow you to enjoy a breathtaking view. </p><h2>  Places for rest </h2><p>  On Taksim Square is located one of the few parks in the city - Taksim-Gezi.  It is a small green oasis in the middle of the realm of concrete, where locals and visitors can rest in the shade of trees from the bustle of the city.  The park is also known as a starting point or venue for demonstrations and political protests.  It was here in 2013 that people gathered to disagree with the destruction of the park for the construction of a shopping center on its territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stockholmcf.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sightseeing tours to Istanbul from Moscow" class="if uuid-3020530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82509/3020530.jpg"></div><p>  The subsequent police brutality gave rise to a whole protest movement in defense of this place of rest.  The park hosts mass meetings on Labor Day, as well as the annual LGBT Pride Parade.  Be careful not to endanger yourself by involuntarily joining an event in which participation was not originally part of your plans. </p><h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  After a tour of Taksim Square, it's time to enjoy a meal in one of the many cafes, restaurants and pubs.  The choice here is truly wide - from fast food restaurants such as McDonald's and Burger King to chains like Hard Rock Cafe.  For a more complete immersion in the local atmosphere, you should try the local favorite street foods, such as islak (a hamburger cooked with a special tomato sauce with herbs) and d√∂ner (a beef or chicken sandwich), and if you prefer something lighter, an excellent choice tasty corn with oil and salt will be sold by many street vendors.  Ayran (a cold drink from yogurt) is very popular in summer.  And of course, few people can resist the temptation to indulge in local coffee with a Turkish dessert.  The square has the best candy stores, which you can also take home as a present for your family and friends.  And since we were talking about gifts, Taksim Square is one of the best places in the city to buy souvenirs.  There are shops offering a wide variety of goods, including clothing, books, jewelry and handicrafts. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  There are a lot of different hotels on the square, and tourists will have no problems choosing a place to stay for the night.  One of them - the Ritz Carlton Hotel - perhaps the most prestigious, is located in the heart of Istanbul overlooking the Bosphorus, where a breathtaking view opens from the terrace of a tall building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ritzcarlton.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Ritz Carlton" class="if uuid-3020532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82509/3020532.jpg"></div><p>  This luxury hotel features an award-winning spa and gourmet restaurant.  The Ritz-Carlton Restaurant offers modern Mediterranean cuisine that can be enjoyed in a sophisticated atmosphere, while the elegant RC Bar presents Istanbul's largest selection of whiskeys. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Taksim Square offers locals and city guests many options for relaxation.  In this part there are inexpensive bars and clubs offering all kinds of entertainment, and an evening walk around the square will convince you of its greatness and delight you with amazing views.  Here you can spend time enjoying the beautiful melodies of talented street musicians and explore the alleys to form your own opinion about local graffiti.  On your sightseeing tour to Istanbul from Moscow, be sure to include a visit to Taksim.  It will, without a doubt, be a pleasant surprise, no matter how high your expectations. </p>
