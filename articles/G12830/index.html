  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Winter fishing for pike</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Why is fishermen catching pikes in the winter for zharilka so beloved by real fishermen?  Why is this fish a welcome catch for them?  The answer to these questions is only one: there is no such reservoir in which the pike would not be found, and you can engage in its fishing throughout the year.  There are a lot of different ways of catching this fish, and the most fascinating of them is winter fishing for pike on the lapdog.  In order for the winter <span>fishing for zherlitsy</span> to be successful, it is necessary to take into account some of the features of such fishing.  You need to arrive at the pond very early in order to arrange the fishing gear for the morning dawn, and you can choose a place with a better catch prospect without any fuss. </p><p>  As a rule, fishermen put from ten to twenty zergelnits no more, because with an active bite you can run into ten pieces too much, and in its absence, the number of established zerglovka will not have a big impact on the catch.  <span>Catching pike in the winter</span> on the vents is a certain difficulty - at the very beginning it is the arrangement of gear, for this it is necessary to drill holes with an ice drill, prepare the vents, make a nozzle of live bait, and then set the vented vents to their working position.  According to their design, there are several options for winter fishing lanterns, but it should be noted that, in principle, their work is practically no different from one another.  With a great desire, a zergla can be made with one's own hand, since its design does not differ in great complexity. </p><p>  Winter <span>fishing for zerglitsa</span> requires perfecting all the components of the tackle, and in particular, the hook - it must be well sharpened.  This action is an order of magnitude reduced pike gatherings during hooking.  Very often, with the active behavior of the fish, the first bites appear almost instantly, sometimes you don‚Äôt even have time to completely tackle the gear.  Successful pike fishing in winter for zergilniks largely depends on choosing the right place for installing gear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If pike fishing in the winter occurs on the lake, then the best place is considered to be the water area near the reeds or a little distance from them.  If the reservoir is unknown, then the arrangement of the girders is best done at a great distance, one from one, and as the nibble is frequent in one place, gradually move everything to it.  It is always advisable to note the places of a good bite, so that the next pike fishing in the winter on the vents will bring good success.  In the waters of rivers, pike can be found in quiet backwaters, mill pools, in which non-predatory <span>fish (roach,</span> rudd, carp) are attracted by quiet water and the presence of forage, but they, in turn, are very interesting to predators.  The probability of finding a large number of this <span>predatory fish</span> in the deepening of the river bottom with the presence of snag.  At the very beginning of the freezing-up on small-sized reservoirs, where the depth varies from two to three meters, the pike keeps to places covered with algae.  During this period, there is still full of all small fish serving as a toothed predator for food.  After some time, when the underwater flora decays and dies, the pike moves to areas with cleaner water. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, a very important condition that affects the biting of pike in winter is the weather.  This predator is well caught throughout the season, if the winter weather is warm and soft, which is interspersed with short thaws and light frost.  Pike fishing in the winter, in mild weather without wind, is instantly revived (with the appearance of fluffy, heavy snow in the air).  A very strong influence on the biting of pikes in the winter is exerted by atmospheric pressure, due to the appearance of a membrane, in the form of ice at the junction of two media of water and the atmosphere. </p><p>  Whatever the weather, and no matter what the catch is, you always get pleasure and a lot of positive emotions from the process of catching pike in the winter. </p>
