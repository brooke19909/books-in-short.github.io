It is part of the autonomy of Asturias.  For a long time Gijon was the industrial and commercial center of the country, with a well-developed metallurgical industry and large reserves of natural resources.  Towards the end of the last century, tourism began to develop actively in Gijon, which significantly replenishes the city budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gijon spain" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1799211.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The history of the city of Gijon </h2><p>  On the land where the city is today, the first settlement appeared in the VI century BC.  In the 1st century BC  e.  it was subdued by the Romans.  The influence of Roman culture and today is clearly visible in the architecture of the city, especially this applies to the mansions between San Lorenzo and the marina. </p><p>  After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Gijon was captured by the Visigoths, and then by the Arabs, who established their rule until 722.  Legend has it that at this time the head of the tiny kingdom of Pelayo opposed the Arab governor.  As a result, Pelayo was forced to flee to the caves of Asturias.  It was there that the Madonna appeared to him and convinced him of the need to fight and defend the Christian faith. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sporting gijon spain" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1801581.jpg" width="580"></div>

This event was the beginning of the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula by Christians.  In 1395, a terrible fire almost wiped out Gijon in Spain from the face of the earth.  However, it was restored quite quickly. </p><p>  In 1480, the city began to build a port on the north coast.  In the middle of the XVI century it was fortified, and at the end of the XVIII century, active trade with the West Indies was already conducted through it.  Today it is one of the main ports of the country. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Everyone who plans to visit this city is probably interested in the weather in Gijon.  Spain is famous for its mild Atlantic climate.  Gijon is no exception: it is not as hot as in other parts of the Iberian Peninsula.  In summer, air rarely warms above +28 ¬∞ C, and in winter the temperature does not drop below +5 ¬∞ C.  The only thing that can overshadow the rest is the rains that happen in these places quite often.  The swimming season is quite short - from June to August.  The rest of the time, the water in the ocean does not warm above +15 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Gijon in Spain is not considered the most popular beach resort.  But this type of recreation is actively developing, and, probably, in the coming years the city will catch up with its more famous competitors.  The best urban beaches are Poniente, Arbeyal and San Lorenzo, which stretches for almost three and a half kilometers along the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gijon Spain Attractions" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1799208.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are quite strong currents and large differences in depths.  Fans of noisy entertainment should opt for Poniente Beach.  Pure sand was brought here from the Sahara desert.  The beach of San Juan is annually celebrated on this beach: bonfires are burned all night and thousands of vacationers and townspeople have fun.  Here is a fun festival of cider. </p><p>  For a relaxing family vacation, Arbeyal Beach is ideal.  It should be noted that all the beaches of the city are awarded the highest distinction - the Blue Flag. </p><h2>  Gijon in Spain: sights of the city </h2><p>  It's hard to believe, but just a hundred years ago, at the place where the modern city is today, there was a tiny fishing village.  <span>Modern travelers</span> know Gijon in Spain as an actively developing resort, the country's cultural center with many interesting objects of history and architecture.  There are ancient places of worship and museums, parks and squares, sports facilities and many other interesting places.  But usually the ancient city of Gijon in Spain, the photo of which you can see in this article, tourists begin to study from its historical part - Cimadeville.  Nor will we break tradition. </p><h2>  Historic city center - Simadevilla district </h2><p>  It is located in the fishing village of Cimadevilla, on a peninsula that bisected the port.  Most of the local streets are lined with cobblestones.  Many buildings have been restored in recent years.  On the hill of Santa Catalina, opposite the sea, there is an amazing sculpture ‚ÄúPraise‚Äù by Eduardo Chillida.  She is a symbol of this part of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In Simadeville, you can visit the clock tower, which today houses the historical archive.  In addition, Roman baths located in the old part of the city are popular among tourists. </p><h2>  Museum of the people of Asturias </h2><p>  One of the most interesting cultural centers in Gijon (Spain) is the Museum of the people of Asturias, which acquaints visitors with the culture and features of the local population.  This ethnographic museum began work in 1968 and during this time has earned recognition not only from the townspeople, but also from many tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gijon spain photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1799206.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Isabel Park </h2><p>  In the mid-20th century, the architect Ramon Ortiz created a landscape park in the city, which he named in honor of Queen Isabella I of Castile.  Today, the park territory occupies fifteen hectares.  There are a lot of fun rides, colorful flower beds.  Shady alleys are decorated with sculptures.  The picturesque pond is especially attractive, on the banks of which peacocks are important for walking, swans, ducks and geese nest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in gijon spain" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1799215.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here, more than twelve separate underwater environments have been restored - from the Bay of Biscay and the Asturian rivers to the tropical oceans. </p><h2>  Gijon Workers University </h2><p>  Fans of architectural monuments will be interested in the working university of Hijon in Spain.  It is considered the main architectural attraction of the city.
