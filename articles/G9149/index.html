The slogan ‚ÄúFor Faith, Tsar and Fatherland‚Äù was forgotten after that. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rebirth of the Department in a new state body </h2><p>  A little later, almost six months later, this department became known as the main one, which gave it state rights and full legitimacy, in contrast to the previous government department.  The tasks of this Police Department included the organization of local police activities, full control of what she was doing, as well as the protection of borders, prisoners of war, foreign ambassadors and guests of the highest echelons of power who arrived in the USSR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="county gendarmes" class="if uuid-2674769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2674769.jpg"></div><h2>  Department List </h2><p>  At the end of 1917, the Department consisted of nine departments, called clerical work, as well as secret departments and chancery.  The structure of the Department was as follows: </p><ul><li>  Division 1 is the very first variation of the Department that existed under the Empire.  She was engaged in all police affairs, as well as extracts for the appointment of awards, allowances, pensions.  Regulated all cases involving counterfeit money, sorted papers on the return of refugees to their homeland. </li><li>  The 2nd department was engaged in state affairs during the time of the Russian Empire.  Drafting laws on public events, for example, how to behave, which speeches to skip, and which to prohibit.  He created such slogans as ‚ÄúFor Faith, Tsar and Fatherland‚Äù, ‚ÄúGod bless us,‚Äù etc. He was involved in the creation of laws on the reception and import of vehicles into the territory of the empire. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="bistrobarblog.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://bistrobarblog.blogspot.com/2018/03/quelques-autres-canulars-de-la-seconde_12.html?m=1"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicholas II" class="if uuid-2674787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2674787.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Section 3 was engaged in the search for political criminals, as well as in the struggle against mass party movements, strikes and rallies.  Managed the guard of the emperor himself and was completely secret.  It became known about him only after all the affairs of this department were transferred to the so-called Special Department, which kept all the data on political parties and movements in tsarist Russia. </li><li>  4th section - the police department monitored all mass work, and also completely controlled all peasant movements. </li><li>  The 5th department executed special decisions of the Ministry of the Interior, for which he was nicknamed the executive. </li><li>  The 6th department supervised the manufacture and storage of explosives (cartridges, explosives, as well as chemicals).  The duties of the 6th department included monitoring and control of the entire gold and oil industries, which began to develop in the Russian Empire. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.chaostrophic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gendarme assembly" class="if uuid-2674766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2674766.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The 7th department, the ‚Äúsupervisory‚Äù, compiled and contained all archival records of inquiries, cases of revolutionary leaders of certain groups of people (parties, congresses).  The duties of the seventh division also included the maintenance and archiving of prison correspondence (about all emergency situations in prisons, about escapes, considering appeals and extending the term). </li><li>  The 8th department was a center for managing all detective agencies and criminal investigation agencies in the Russian Empire. </li><li>  The 9th Division was engaged in all matters related to intelligence and counterintelligence, liaison with allied powers and discussion of plans for enemy states. </li><li>  The encryption department of the Police Department guaranteed complete secrecy and storage of the royal family‚Äôs correspondence, decrypted enemy messages, and developed new ways to decrypt and encrypt letters. </li></ul>
