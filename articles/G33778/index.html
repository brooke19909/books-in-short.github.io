Over the past couple of years, the company has released three phones of the K6000 series, distinguished primarily by their capacious 6080 mAh batteries.  Noteworthy and most practical is the latest model in the series - Oukitel K6000 Plus (Android 7.0 / MTK6750T).  Reviews about it, albeit ambiguous, but the gadget deserves attention and careful consideration. </p>

    <p>  In general, such a low demand for Oukitel products is caused by not quite competent, or rather, unacceptable pricing policy for Russian realities.  Those who prefer mid-price segment devices (more than 15 thousand rubles) consider the brand models too modest for themselves and mediocre, and admirers of budget models (less than 10 thousand rubles) do not want to spend an extra couple of thousand of their hard-earned money on some kind of and unnecessary "chips", without which you can easily do.  Therefore, the Oukitel K6000 Plus smartphone was stuck at a crossroads with a price tag of 11 thousand rubles, even after the ‚Äúfilling‚Äù was significantly improved compared to previous generations.  Despite this, the device may not be as successful as its competitors, but it is for sale, and we will try to figure out why. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the hero of today's review is the Oukitel K6000 Plus smartphone.  User reviews, the characteristics of the gadget, as well as its advantages and disadvantages will be considered in our article. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device is delivered in a specific for Oukitel box of bright orange color made of cardboard.  The design is sparse: the brand logo is depicted on the front and at the ends, and on the back there is a brief specification, which indicates the most notable characteristics of the Oukitel K6000 Plus.  Dealer surroundings in the face of stickers, barcodes and labels can be seen around the perimeter of the box. </p>

Judging by the reviews of the owners about the Oukitel K6000 Plus, they were especially pleased with the truly necessary OTG cable and case.  It is good that the manufacturer did not put the headset in the kit, because in this price segment it is simply not needed.  Headphones ‚Äúfor show‚Äù significantly affect the cost of the entire gadget, but there is no sense in them, so it‚Äôs much more practical to shift the purchase of the headset to the shoulders of consumers - they will choose what they need. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Oukitel K6000 Plus has a classic design - a monoblock with a touch screen.  Looking at a bunch of other mobile gadgets, you can‚Äôt call a smartphone light and thin.  The device has quite impressive dimensions - 77 x 155 x 9.5 mm and weighs 208 grams.  Such ugliness is the reckoning for a capacious, as well as a massive, battery. </p><p>  Despite its size, in customer reviews about the Oukitel K6000 Plus there are practically no negative feedback regarding ergonomics: the device fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and you can operate it with one hand with proper comfort.  Yes, fragile female handles in weight will have a hard time with such a mass, but only when watching videos or games, and in conversations that last no more than ten minutes, the impressiveness of the device is not felt. </p>

    <p>  The design of the gadget is predominantly aluminum alloy, and plastic inserts can be seen in the upper and lower parts of the cover, where the antennas are located.  The case pleasantly cools the hand and inspires confidence, so the name does not turn the name Oukitel K6000 Plus budget model. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the front panel at the top there is a familiar set: a peephole of the front camera, an LED event indicator and a light sensor.  The indicator is barely noticeable, and in bright daylight it is practically not visible.  By the way, the events for which he will be responsible can be selected in the settings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The lower part of the front panel is occupied by the physical Home key, which is also a fingerprint scanner.  On the sides are the touch buttons "Back" and "Context menu".  On this occasion, the owners leave mixed reviews about the Oukitel K6000 Plus phone, because in previous generations this key was not there, but there were familiar touch buttons.  Those who used Samsung, Homtoms, or other similar gadgets with the same physical control did not experience any problems with the innovation, while the rest considered this decision to be superfluous and did not live up to expectations. </p><p>  Also, many owners in their reviews of the Oukitel K6000 Plus smartphone complained about the too dim backlighting of the touch keys: even in a dark room it is very difficult to consider the outlines, and you have to poke your fingers at random. </p><p>  I am glad that the designers have added a fingerprint scanner functionality.  Now the sensor supports gesture support: for example, with a single tap, you can pause the currently playing track or play the selected one.  As for the scanner itself, there are no serious questions for it.  Judging by the reviews of the Oukitel K6000 Plus, users rate the recognition accuracy at 9 out of 10 points, which is more than acceptable for a device in this price category. </p><p>  In the upper rear part of the device, you can see the peephole of the main camera (16 megapixels), a duplicated LED flash.  There is nothing below, only the brand logo and the address of the Internet resource. </p>

    <p>  On the right side are the power off key and the volume rocker.  The latter, judging by the reviews of the Oukitel K6000 Plus, slightly backlash - unpleasant, but not critical.  The left side is occupied by a hybrid interface for two nano-SIM cards (or one SD- and SIM card). </p><p>  Above is a standard 3.5 mm mini-jack audio output.  The bottom end is reserved for micro-USB output, and on the sides of it there are two decorative grilles with perforation: one has a microphone, and the other has an external speaker.  By the way, users in their reviews about the Oukitel K6000 Plus have repeatedly complained about ill-conceived perforation.  On the one hand, yes, this adds to the attractiveness of the gadget, and on the other hand, the holes get clogged, and to get ‚Äúpocket‚Äù dirt out of them, you need to arm yourself with a needle or thin tweezers, that is, simply shaking the phone will not help here. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  As for the assembly, users have no serious complaints about the smartphone: it does not creak, it does not play (except for the volume rocker) and does not crunch.  All parts are fitted to each other, so there are no gaps either. </p><p>  The device comes in two variable colors: a light panel - a golden back cover, and a black panel - a gray cover.  Judging by the reviews of the Oukitel K6000 Plus, the latter solution looks noticeably nicer and more solid.  But looking at the design part as a whole, we can say that we have a typical representative of the budget segment, of which hundreds are on store shelves. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The device has a good IPS-matrix with a high screen resolution (Full HD) and a good angular overview.  The Oukitel K6000 Plus received a 5.5-inch display, where the 1920 x 1080 px scan looks quite acceptable.  The density of dots of 401 ppi allows you to work with the device with the proper comfort, and you won‚Äôt be able to view individual pixels, even if you really want to. </p><p>  The display itself is protected by a 2.5D class Asahi Glass Dragontrail panel.  In addition, a factory film is additionally glued to the device.  <span>The oleophobic coating,</span> although mediocre, is available both on film and on glass, and it does not interfere with the review.  Oukitel K6000 Plus supports OGS technology, so there are no air gaps between the protective screen and the display. </p><h2>  Matrix Features </h2><p>  Factory calibration was not entirely successful.  The color temperature at the output is much higher than the reference indicator, so the picture is obtained with a clear "cold" tint.  The same can be said about color reproduction: the image is saturated with ‚Äúspurious‚Äù shades, and you can‚Äôt call it natural. </p>

    <p>  The reserves of the maximum and minimum brightness level of the matrix are at an average level.  The first parameter allows you to more or less tolerably work in direct sunlight, and the second slightly blinds your eyes in a dark room, so there is no need to sin on auto-tuning - it really is, and there is nothing to do with automation.  Contrast ratio varies within 560 units at medium brightness, which is quite acceptable for this price category. </p><p>  As for viewing angles, they are maximum for the IPS matrix, so you can watch a video or browse through the gallery of images in the company of one or two like-minded people.  The only thing worth noting is that even with a slight change in the angle, the picture looks a little dull, that is, a certain percentage of brightness is lost. </p><p>  Generally speaking, the factory calibration of the matrix was frankly poorly done, and it‚Äôs better to redo it all with special utilities (you need administrator rights), so the screen features cannot be called a smartphone‚Äôs strong point. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The set of chipsets, although budgetary, is quite modern for the Oukitel K6000 Plus: 4 GB of RAM, the Mediatek MT6750T series processor with eight Cortex-A53 cores, the Mali-T860 video accelerator and an internal 64 GB drive. </p><p>  As a rule, the budget segment of gadgets is equipped with 2 GB of RAM, so here we have a clear advantage over competing counterparts.  In the process, the user can access a little more than 2 GB of 4, and this is an excellent indicator, so there are simply no problems with a lack of RAM. </p><p>  The Oukitel K6000 Plus 64Gb has internal memory, which is enough for the average needs of users.  But even if such a volume is not enough, then it can be expanded by installing an external SD-card, up to 256 GB. </p><h2>  Tests </h2><p>  The results in the benchmarks are average, if we compare the performance of a smartphone with a similar budget brotherhood.  With so much RAM, some Snapdragon of the eight-hundredth series would have clearly been out of place, but then the price would have definitely exceeded the mark of 15 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Here we have a quite stable and acceptable frame rate in most modern games, but on serious and ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications you have to reset the graphics settings to average or even minimal values.  Otherwise, friezes and numerous lags appear. </p><p>  As for the interface, everything is perfect here: applications open quickly, tables and icons respond smoothly and there are no brakes when scrolling.  There are also no problems with multimedia and web surfing: everything plays, whistles and puffs, as the developer intended.  In addition, even under heavy load on the chipsets, the smartphone case does not heat up, which is good news. </p><h2>  Platform </h2><p>  Powered by Oukitel K6000 Plus on Android 7.0.  Reviews about the platform are ambiguous, because the system is still damp, and besides, it is clumsily localized in places, so you should not be surprised to see the lost foreign language among the Russian masses. </p><p>  Stock, even the latest firmware, alas, does not solve the problem, but on specialized resources you can find amateur options that are no worse than official ones in filling, but with normal Russification. </p><p>  Users in their reviews expressed special thanks to the manufacturer for a ‚Äúclean‚Äù operating system.  A good half of budget gadgets are littered with advertising and sponsorship applications, unlike our hero, where there are no heaps of useless pre-installed programs. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The smartphone received two cameras.  There is no point in considering a front-facing 8 megapixel, because it can be said no: the modest characteristics of the matrix make it possible to do only a high-quality avatar, and to talk with bitterness about the video messenger and that‚Äôs all. </p>

    <p>  The main camera received a matrix OmniVision 16880 series with a resolution of 16 megapixels.  Here we have autofocus, a duplicated LED flash and an f2 / 0 lens.  The control interface does not shine with a variety of functionalities - everything is standard and without any original ‚Äúchips‚Äù. </p><p>  The rear camera copes well with shooting landscapes in the daytime.  Of course, there are some problems, such as unstable focusing and loss of sharpness at the edges of the image, but in general, the output image is quite decent. </p><h2>  Shooting Features </h2><p>  Close-ups are given to the camera poorly, this is due to the indicator of the minimum distance for the focus, here it is significantly larger in comparison with other budget counterparts.  Therefore, to shoot any objects in the vicinity is a hassle.  At this point, one could close one‚Äôs eyes if it were not for the many negative reviews from booklover users who need a gadget to shoot books, notes, instructions and other literature. </p><p>  The quality of images in the dark leaves much to be desired, but this is the trouble of the entire budget segment, so this part is difficult to record in obvious cons.  The image is obtained with a mass of noise, and to get rid of them, you need to unscrew the noise reduction to the maximum, and this, in turn, a loss in detail, - in general, everything is bad. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  A clear advantage of the device is the capacity of the battery at 6080 mAh, in fact, this is where the name of the Oukitel gadget line comes from.  The production of lithium-polymer batteries for the brand is handled by a fairly well-known company from the Middle Kingdom - SCUD Battery Co., Ltd, so there is no need to worry about quality. </p>

    <p>  Quite an appropriate addition to such a capacious battery was the Media Express technology of fast charging Pump Express Plus.  A smartphone with its help charges up to 100% from scratch in a little less than two hours, while with a conventional charger you have to wait at least an hour more. </p><h2>  Benchmarks </h2><p>  The test results are encouraging: the device was far ahead, leaving even venerable premium models of well-known brands behind.  So with the autonomy of the smartphone, everything is in order, even despite the gluttonous Android platform. </p><p>  Specifically, in mixed use mode (call, sms, internet, 50% of the screen brightness) the battery lasts for three days.  Watching videos in high resolution at 75% brightness will drain the battery in 15 hours.  With the maximum possible load with everything turned on and 100% of the screen brightness, the device will last about 6-7 hours. </p><p>  The results are excellent.  A rather mediocre set of chipsets with moderate power consumption also played a significant role here.  So the gadget can rightfully be called a long-lived smartphone.  Finding such a representative in the budget segment is a great success. </p><h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  Our respondent doesn‚Äôt have many analogues.  The closest in quality content can be called the Ulefone Power 2 (6050 mAh) and Blackview P2 (6000 mAh) models. </p><p>  The first in its technical characteristics is almost identical to the K6000 Plus.  But it is very difficult to recommend it for purchase, because it has even fewer owners than Oukitel series.  And this directly affects the support of gadgets, that is, firmware updates have to wait for years, if at all, wait, as well as warranty repairs.  And user reviews about the model are far from the most flattering. </p>

    <p>  But nothing bad can be said about Blackview P2: the device turned out to be successful and pretty in many respects, and the only thing in which it is inferior to the K6000 Plus is in the version of Android.  Even the latest models of the brand come with stock firmware on the Android 6.0 OS, while Oukitel has the seventh version of the platform.  The manufacturer seems to promise to transfer its gadgets to the "seven", but, as is often the case with the Chinese budget segment, we are waiting, but will we wait? </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p> On the market of mobile gadgets, you can find smartphones that reassure their user with some unusual ‚Äúchips‚Äù, an aesthetic and thoughtful design, providing unusual solutions that are really interesting to deal with, and so on and so forth. </p><p>  The K6000 Plus model can in no way be attributed to their number.  The manufacturer positions the device as a workhorse, which, alas, is not able to please the owner with all these advantages, and does not seek to do this.  Say what you like, but we have a budget device in front of us, and delights can be found in the premium and mid-price segment. </p><p>  From the K6000 Plus, essentially only one thing is required - a long and stable operation, and the device copes with this with a bang.  One of the main "applications for success" - excellent autonomy - is fully implemented and works at 100%.  In addition, a set of chipsets is enough for lightning-fast operation of the interface and the launch of most modern gaming applications. </p><p>  Here, a mediocre and poorly calibrated matrix acts as a fly in the ointment, except perhaps an unpretentious sound, but a good half of the budget segment models suffer from this disaster, so you don‚Äôt have to sort out much. </p><p>  In the <span>bottom line,</span> we get the following: if you want a smartphone ‚Äúfor the soul‚Äù - pass by, but if you need a moderately productive long-lived gadget without claims to appearance with multimedia, as well as an enviable battery life, then the K6000 Plus will be an excellent assistant to you. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  superior autonomy; </li><li>  good set of chipsets; </li><li>  Support for all Russian communication protocols, including LTE; </li><li>  platform "Android 7.0". </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  disgusting factory calibration of the display matrix; </li><li>  poor sound (cacophony at maximum volume). </li></ul><p>  The estimated cost of the smartphone is about 11,000 rubles. </p>
