    <h2>  Fort History </h2><p>  The need for the construction of the Tarakanovsky fort, which is also called Dubensky, arose at the end of the XVIII century in connection with the cessation of the existence of the Commonwealth. </p><p>  On October 24, 1975, the Polish-Lithuanian state was liquidated.  In world history this event is better known as the Third Partition of Poland.  As a result, the Russian Empire participating in the partition acquired an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 120 thousand square kilometers.  This territory included most of the Lithuanian, Ukrainian and Belarusian lands. </p><p>  To protect the acquired possessions at the beginning of the XIX century, it was decided to erect defensive structures.  One of these structures was the Tarakanovsky fort. </p><h2>  Construction Features </h2><p>  Hill building in the place where the Tarakanovsky fort is located began in the second half of the 19th century.  A huge amount was allocated for the construction of the structure - 66 million rubles.  The chief architect was appointed military engineer Eduard Totleben.  Construction lasted 30 years and was completed in 1890. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At that time, the fort was rightfully considered the most modern fortification in Russia.  For its construction, innovative materials for the 19th century were used - cement and concrete. </p>

    <p>  The fort is built in the shape of a rhombus, the length of which is 240 meters.  The fortress was surrounded by a deep moat, in which there were earthen ramparts that strengthen the walls.  Inside the fortress walls housed an economic building, which includes warehouses and living quarters.  Casemates located along the perimeter of the fortress could accommodate up to 800 people.  There were an infirmary and an operating room, wells and warehouses, armories and much more.  Each casemate was equipped with ventilation and heating systems, as well as plumbing and sewage. </p><p>  Looking at modern photos of the Tarakanovsky fort, even through the veil of desolation, you can see the former power and greatness of the fortress. </p><h2>  Fortress use </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that during the time of its existence the defensive abilities of the fortress were not tested.  The main purpose of the fort was to protect the railway lines in the direction of Kiev - Lviv.  Military operations in the vicinity of the fort unfolded in the First World War.  In 1915, the fort was surrendered without a fight, and the Austrian military was stationed in the fortress for about a year.  The Austrians were expelled from the walls of the fort only in the summer of 1916 during the offensive operation of the Russian troops led by General Brusilov.  The fort was liberated, but suffered significant destruction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  During World War II, the soldiers again lost the fort without a fight.  During the hostilities, German invaders were based in the fortress.  Later, the use of the fort was considered impractical, since, according to many military leaders, the location of the fortress was not of strategic importance.  Thus, the colossal structure, for the construction of which enormous financial and human resources were expended, remained unclaimed. </p><p>  In Soviet times, they tried to use the fort as storage facilities.  However, due to the high humidity, this idea was unsuccessful. </p><h2>  Description of the fortress </h2><p>  When describing the Tarakanovsky fort, it should be noted its main feature, which distinguishes it from other structures of this type.  The fortress is almost impossible to find without knowing its exact location.  Standing at the foot of the Tarakanovsky fort, the visitor will see only a high hill covered with thickets.  It is interesting to note that during construction, the area around the fort was specially planted with plants characterized by abundant foliage.  Today, these plants have turned into wild impenetrable jungle. </p>

    <p>  To get to the territory of the fort, whose area is about 4 hectares, you can only through a long tunnel made in the hill.  In the center of the fort is the main building.  The height of the building above the ground is two floors, and the number of underground floors is still not known exactly.  According to local residents, the depth of some wells, which are found at almost every step in the fort, is four floors.  Along the perimeter of the fortress are the buildings of the casemates. </p><p>  Tarakanovsky fort today is a cluster of dilapidated buildings, overgrown with dense greenery.  But in the outlines of the ruins, the former greatness and power of the fortress is still guessed.  In the reviews of tourists, there is often a comparison of the fort with ancient temples in the thickets of the Amazon, often depicted in films about Indiana Jones. </p>

    <p>  The fort has two lines of defense.  The first line (supporting wall) is decorated on the inside with pilasters and arches of various shapes, some of which lead to the dungeon of the fortress.  The second line (earthen rampart) is based on casemates encircling the fort inside.  In the center of the defensive fortress there is a two-story officer corps. </p><h2>  Mysteries of the fort </h2><p>  The fortress is shrouded in secrets and legends.  Most of the legends of the Tarakanovsky fort are associated with a huge number of underground passages.  It is not known for certain how many floors are underground.  In addition, many moves have not yet been studied by fans of riddles.  Some passages are piled up and concreted, some have not been found. </p>

    <p>  Locals talk about ghosts that allegedly inhabit the walls of the fort.  As if confirmation of these legends, <span>grave hills</span> are found at the walls of the fortress <span>.</span>  This is the burial of Austrian soldiers who died during the Brusilovsky breakthrough.  There are also stories about the disappearance of tourists who risked exploring the dangerous sections of the fortress. </p><h2>  Fort reviews </h2><p>  It is unlikely that you can find negative reviews about the Tarakanovsky fort.

We can say with confidence that a visit to the Tarakanovsky Fort will not leave anyone indifferent.  Everyone will find something new, exciting and amazing. </p><h2>  Attractions </h2><p>  Tarakanovsky fort, or New Dubenskaya fortress, is far from the only attraction in the district.

The fortress played an important role in many historical events. </p><p>  Lovers of romance can visit the <span>Tunnel of Love</span> in the village of Klevan.

The first mention of these places dates back to the second half of the seventeenth century.  Then on the site of today's monastery stood the Holy Trinity Church, which was destroyed by the Austrians during the First World War.  Later, the church was ruined by the Soviet government.  The new church was built only in the eighties of the last century. </p>
