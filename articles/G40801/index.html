If this happened due to, for example, a device crash, then the question is clear, but what if the gadget stopped working without visible damage and malfunction?  And, indeed, the situation is from the category: ‚Äúthe iPad has not been charged‚Äù often overtakes the lucky owners of tablets from Apple.  The article provides examples of the most common cases.  In addition, methods for resolving such problems are described. </p>

    <h2>  <span>The iPad does not turn on:</span> looking for the essence </h2><p>  Once your gadget has stopped responding to the power button, it is worth finding out exactly what the problem is.  A software error or a dead battery may occur. </p><ul><li>  If the iPad does not respond to the power button (the screen does not light up, the indicators do not light up), then with almost 100% probability we can conclude that there are internal problems.  In such situations, it is necessary to find out what could have caused the device to malfunction: if this remains a mystery to you, then you can try to return the tablet under warranty, if you drop it, wet it or leave it to overheat in the sun, they will refuse you at the store or ask you to pay money for repairs. </li><li>  In case of problems with the operating system, the iPad responds to touches at startup, and sometimes the download reaches the start screen, reporting an error.  Regardless of the specific error, the easiest method to solve the problem is to reflash the device. </li><li>  Well, the last, quite common reason why the iPad does not turn on is problems with the charge of the tablet (charger).  Let's analyze it in more detail. </li></ul><h2>  Ipad did not charge: what to do? </h2><p>  First, make sure that the problem is in charging.  If this is the case, then when you turn on the user will see a battery icon with a lightning on the display.  Why can't I charge my tablet?  There may be several reasons: the charge controller has failed, the port has broken, the charger itself has stopped working or there is not enough power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  In the first case, you won‚Äôt be able to cope on your own, so you should contact the manufacturer‚Äôs company, the store where the device was purchased, or the craftsmen who can bring the tablet back to life. </li><li>  A port damaged by water or fire cannot be repaired, but can be cleaned if it is clogged. </li><li>  The charger can be replaced, the main thing is to clarify what exactly failed: block or wire. </li><li>  Lack of power is a fairly common problem that occurs in older generations of the iPad (3, 4).  The fact is that they have massive batteries of ~ 11,500 milliamps installed, which require a higher voltage to charge. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Types of Chargers </h2><p>  We will analyze in more detail how to charge the iPad, which cable and unit are needed specifically for your device. </p><p>  By purchasing a tablet in the store, in the kit you will receive a cable and a unit that are ideal for the brand new iPad, but what if they fail at a certain point?  Or you just took the tablet from your hands and now make desperate independent attempts to choose the right charger. </p><p>  In fact, everything is much simpler than it seems at first glance.  There are two types of Apple tablets: large (12.9 and 9.7 inches) and small (7.9 inches).  You just need to consider the operating conditions of the chargers for each. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Working conditions for charging kits </h2><ul><li>  Large iPads are equipped with large batteries (more than 10 thousand milliamps / hours), therefore, it often takes 6 to 9 hours to charge them.  Therefore, do not panic if the gadget is not charged overnight - the iPad in this regard is slow, and it is powered by special 12 W power supplies.  Moreover, such a tablet will not be charged from a regular computer or laptop, since the power of these devices is not enough.  Nevertheless, some modern models of Mac computers are able to provide sufficient energy for ten-inch tablets.  This problem is also present in the car, for example, to charge the tablet from the cigarette lighter, you first need to purchase a converter (a device that raises the voltage). </li><li>  Small iPads got more modest batteries (about 7,000 milliamps / hours), so they work with ordinary 10 W units, the same as on the iPhone, without any problems.  Despite this, even such crumbs experience problems when connected to a computer (energy either does not come in or it builds up very slowly). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Using non-original chargers </h2><p>  No matter how trite it may sound, but most Chinese cables and units carry only problems.  The causes of failures can be several: poor-quality assembly of the cord or power supply, difficulty in verifying the certificate (aftermarket charging for iPad), poor power. </p><ul><li>  A wire assembled poorly is always a risk.  The consumer literally buys a pig in a poke: the charger can be inactive or work for a very short time, fail and damage the gadget itself - it all depends on the price of the wire.  Cheap chargers can really be dangerous, both for phones / tablets, and for the health of the consumer, so you should not save on the purchase of the original or at least a certified analogue. </li><li>  Consumers who bought non-original devices in the first hours are faced with an almost insurmountable nuisance - the inscription on the board: ‚ÄúThis cable is not certified, its operation with this iPad is not guaranteed‚Äù, and with this notification the device stops charging.  Why it happens?  The fact is that due to the increasing accidents and problems due to low-quality charges, Apple has tightened the system for checking the originality of those.  The latest version of iOS does not allow unoriginal or non-certified cables to work.  What to do?  There are two options: either buy a suitable charge, or simply turn off your device (current will flow, and the system will not be able to check the cord). </li><li>  A problem can arise both in case of cable damage, or because of the unit.  Therefore, if your iPad does not charge from the outlet, you need to carefully check the characteristics and integrity of the charging kit. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  If the original charging for the iPad has been purchased, all the blocks have been checked and replaced, but your tablet is upset with both the operating time and the charging time, then it's time to seriously think about replacing the battery.  Many users have been using their tablets for many years, subjecting them to severe stress, while forgetting that lithium-ion batteries are subject to wear.  This, of course, is the worst case scenario. </p><p>  In general, if once your ipad has not been charged, this is not a reason to get rid of it - it is quite possible that your case is directly connected to the charger and it will be enough to purchase a new one. </p>
