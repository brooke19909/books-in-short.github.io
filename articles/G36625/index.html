    <p>  The hotel does not have its own restaurant, but on the floor there is a spacious and fully equipped kitchen where tourists can prepare food purchased at a supermarket near the hotel.  This will significantly save money and will be a salvation for mothers with children.  Every experienced traveler knows how difficult it is to find food for children in restaurants and cafes, especially if the baby needs a diet or an allergic child.  When it is possible to cook food yourself, you can feel at home. </p><h2>  Paid breakfasts </h2><p>  If you do not want to cook yourself, then you can order breakfast at a hotel Villa Jadran 2 (Montenegro, Budva) for a fee at the time of booking.  But they will be cooked in a hotel located next door. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Guests will have to go for breakfast at the LM Budva, 150 meters away.  To many, this does not seem very convenient, but for travelers who plan to go on an excursion around the surroundings for a whole day, it is better to have a hearty breakfast before a trip to a neighboring hotel, and not to stand at the stove early in the morning. </p><h2>  Room Quality </h2><p>  All 16 rooms are equipped with the most necessary for a comfortable stay.  14 numbers are represented by type DBL (double room).  These are standard one-room double rooms with one double bed. </p><p>  At Villa Jadran in Montenegro <span>(Budva Riviera)</span> there are also two TRPL rooms, i.e. triple.  This is a triple room with single and one double bed. </p>

    <p>  The room has a TV, electric kettle, refrigerator, hairdryer, small safe.  Almost every room has its own bathroom with shower, toilet and washbasin.  The floors are tiled. </p><p>  Almost all rooms have a balcony or terrace.  Only one - without a balcony, and in four the bathroom is located on the floor. </p><h2>  Room decor </h2><p>  The interior of the rooms of the hotel Villa Jadran (Montenegro), according to the reviews of tourists staying in the hotel, is not at all impressive.  The poor situation does not even correspond to the two-star status.  Many were shocked by the old furniture and appliances, comparing it with the situation in Soviet times. </p>

Things can be safely placed in a large wardrobe.  Small personal items are placed in bedside tables.  There are enough sockets, you can safely put all the gadgets on charge for the night.

Hotel tourists are given only toilet paper.  The rooms are not cleaned every day, towels are changed every 5 days. </p>

    <p>  According to tourists' reviews, we can conclude that in some rooms there were problems with the plumbing: the shower broke or leaked. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Villa Jadran has been rated positively for the quality of the rooms.  Many people like the presence of a kitchen and a working oven, where tourists cooked baked freshly bought fish.  In other hotels this is not possible. </p><p>  Really like the location of the hotel.  You can walk to the coastline in just a few minutes, just cross the road and go to the shore of the Adriatic Sea.  Just keep in mind that umbrellas and deck chairs are paid.  If you take a set for two people, then this pleasure will cost tourists 5 euros. </p><p>  If you walk along the coast for about 15 minutes, then you get to the best beach in the city - Morgen. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is an old market, and the center is convenient to get to.  All attractions are nearby: both the fortress walls and the citadel. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are a lot of negative reviews about the Villa Jadran 2 hotel: people are unhappy with the furniture, which is constantly falling apart, and the plumbing, which is breaking. </p><p>  Most of the complaints are about the very poor soundproofing of the rooms.  I could hear a neighbor sneezing in the room opposite.  All the sounds of street noise were in the room.  At night, people could not fall asleep due to music playing on the beach in bars until 3 a.m., even ear plugs did not help. </p><p>  Most reviews have criticized box spring beds, which are desperately crashing into the backs of sleeping travelers.  And the pillows are called wooden. </p><p>  On the ceiling, lighting in the style of "Illich lamp".  Older people will understand this comparison well.  But our people would have endured all this normally, if not for the noise outside the window.  To regain strength spent on an active day, you need to sleep well.  If this is not possible, then nervous exhaustion gradually sets in and rest becomes hell. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Before you go on a trip to an unfamiliar place, carefully study the location of the hotel, see photos of experienced tourists.  Remember that hotel owners take photos immediately after repair, so in reality you can be very disappointed. </p><p>  Before choosing a hotel, read the reviews of tourists who have recently been there, experienced all the charms of life in this place and honestly appreciated the hotel.  Only then can you book.  Even if you agree to some inconvenience for the sake of saving money, then at least you will be mentally prepared for what you see. </p>
