Today, the interest of foreign citizens to a large extent is to relax in the resorts of the Republic of Cyprus. </p><p>  Limassol is located in the south of the island.  This resort is considered the sea gate of the country and a major center of the tourism industry.  In addition, Limassol is a city of business.  Offshore companies, famous wineries, the largest fruit and vegetable production are just part of Limassol's business life. </p><p>  Foreigners often choose Limassol as their place of permanent residence.  Including Russians.  Several thousand Russians are constantly living here.  In Limassol there are Russian-language newspapers, Russian schools, shops, a restaurant.  Therefore, if someone is afraid to go on holiday abroad because of the language barrier, then you can safely go to Limassol. </p><p>  The resort has an excellent position on the island of Cyprus.  It stretched along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea for sixteen kilometers at the foot of the Troodos Mountains.  Picturesque landscapes, lemon orchards, vineyards, mild climate made Cyprus Limassol tours very popular among tourists.  Spring comes here in February, and hot, dry summers begin in May and continue until October. </p><p>  Traditional Cypriot hospitality leaves unforgettable <span>holidays in Cyprus.</span>  Limassol is no exception.  Children feel especially comfortable here.  In addition to the fact that the hotels provide everything that children need (children's menu and highchairs, children's playgrounds and pools), in the city itself, children can see an amazing zoo, an amusement park, three water parks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tour "Cyprus Limassol" will certainly appeal to young people.  This resort has earned the fame of the "party" and fun city.  Among the official festivals, it is worth noting the traditional carnivals and festivals: in March - the Apocreo Carnival, in May - the Flower Festival, in June - the Greek Drama Festival, in July - the Art Festival, September - the Wine Festival. </p><p>  But life at the resort does not freeze at night.  Noisy fun continues in numerous taverns, bars, restaurants. </p><p>  However, Limassol is not the only attraction for fun.  This port city lies in the center of the island and provides an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to travel and explore new places.  And Limassol itself is notable for ancient history. </p><p>  In the old part of the city, cobbled streets will lead tourists past ancient buildings that have preserved the architectural heritage of several centuries. </p><p>  The history of the city is connected with the name of the famous crusader Richard the Lionheart.  It is in Limassol that travelers will see the Limassol fortress, in the chapel of which the English king was crowned.  In the vicinity of the resort are the ruins of Amathus - an ancient city that flourished for 16 centuries.  Again, Richard the Lionheart in the twelfth century completed the destruction of Amathus after the Arabs. </p><p>  Kolossi Castle is another attraction visited by vacationers in Limassol.  An interesting castle built in the fifteenth century was founded by the Knights John.  A drawbridge leads to the second floor, and above, on the roof of the tower, is an observation platform that allows you to explore the surroundings. </p><p>  The history of the knightly era is also presented in the Museum of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  But tourists are happy to learn the traditions of Cypriot winemaking at the KEO factory.  A visit to the largest enterprise is a free tour and free tasting, the opportunity to buy fine wine at low prices. </p><p>  The Cyprus Limassol tour is without a doubt a fascinating shopping experience.  Fans of shopping will be pleased with a huge number of souvenirs, boutiques with clothes from famous European manufacturers, the opportunity to buy good quality leather and jewelry, optics. </p>
