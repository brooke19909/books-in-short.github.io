In order not to miss anything during the trip, you should prepare in advance and find out about the places to visit.  This material will help in this, where the must-see sights are described in detail. </p><h2>  Historical mystery </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Gelendzhik, dolmens stand out clearly, which are located near the village of Renaissance.  These are large stone buildings that were erected in the Bronze Age.  Until today, the purpose of these structures is not exactly known, according to one version, aliens built them.  Only here wall paintings depicting the elements speak of something else.  Tourists are attracted here not only by inspection of ancient buildings, but also by the energy of this place.  Here you can recharge your batteries for new achievements, and therefore you should come here during your holidays as early as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="womanadvice.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of gelendzhik" class="if uuid-2362984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2362984.jpg"></div><h2>  Proximity to animals </h2><p>  In the resort town of Gelendzhik, attractions are more focused on entertaining people.  One of these is the safari park, which is spread over a vast territory.  This is the first rehabilitation institution for animals, where they fall from the hands of humans as unnecessary, or someone passes a representative of the fauna for care.  For them, special cells are built here, where a lot of space and conditions are as close as possible to the natural habitat.  In addition to inspecting animals, there is something to do in the safari park.  On a large territory it‚Äôs nice to just walk, and if you want to look at everything from a height, you can ride a cable car.  Users will arrive after a trip to the top of the Markotkh Range, where it is possible to visit the first artificial cave and enjoy the compositions inside.  There is also a maritime museum on the territory where exhibits are presented that gathered from the bottom of the sea.  Among them is the <span>Greek coin,</span> which is two and a half thousand years old. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.topkurortov.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gelendzhik sights photo" class="if uuid-2362985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2362985.jpg"></div><h2>  Marine views </h2><p>  Of all the attractions of Gelendzhik, one of the most popular is the dolphinarium, where adults and children are recommended to go.  Monday is considered the day off, and the rest of the time you can enjoy incredible views.  Not only dolphins participate in them, but also other marine animals.  Among them are walruses and fur seals, which can ridiculously amuse any person.  As for dolphins, during the first inspection of their movements and graces, admiration will involuntarily appear.  Their mind seems to be felt, because it is not for nothing that scientists compare their intellect with the human mind.  In addition to the performance, there is an opportunity for those who wish to swim with dolphins in their pool.  This is not only a discharge of fresh emotions, but also a way to recharge your batteries from these amazing marine life.  In the end, you can take just a few beautiful photographs in memory of the time spent. </p><h2>  Record place </h2><p>  Even if the attractions of Gelendzhik in the photo do not attract you to visit this resort, then after arrival the opinion will definitely change.  Any tourist who is tired of visiting entertainment venues can just walk along the city's promenade.  It is only worth preparing yourself that the journey can be lengthy.  It was in the Krasnodar Territory that a record was set for the length of the street adjacent to the sea.  Only fourteen kilometers a person will have to go from beginning to end, in order to fully see all the charm of the embankment.  This record was repeated in the city of Dubai, but the first to do it in Gelendzhik.  Walking along the street can bring a lot of pleasure, because here the infrastructure is developed for tourists, like in no other place.  Catering establishments, entertainment centers, shooting galleries and shops with a wide variety of goods.  You can spend a whole day relaxing on a trip along the promenade, and only then will it be possible that you will fully explore this place. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.awaytravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gelendzhik description of the attraction" class="if uuid-2362986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2362986.jpg"></div><h2>  Return to History </h2><p>  Description of the attractions of Gelendzhik can only prompt a tourist to visit the resort, but it is impossible to convey the beauty of certain places in words.  These include the "Old Park", which is located in the village of Kabardinka.  The subjects of this institution are architectural structures of ancient eras.  Here you can see the pyramids, obelisks, statues of Greek gods and much more.  The authors touched the eras of Antiquity, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and therefore everyone will find here a piece of something attractive for themselves.  All this complements the composition of wildlife from various plantings.  The important thing is that the buildings were recreated taking into account even the smallest details.  Such a qualitative approach was reflected in the energy of the place and its popularity.  Every day an incredible number of people gather here who want to see the architecture of past eras.  If you want to consider everything in a calmer time, then it is recommended to come in the morning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotel-in-gelendzhik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of gelendzhik photo with description" class="if uuid-2362987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2362987.jpg"></div><h2>  Nature's actions </h2><p>  If a person‚Äôs photo describing the sights of Gelendzhik was pleasant to him, then there will be many times more emotions from living enjoying them.  This applies to the rock Parus, which can be seen from the Black Sea.  With its structure, it really resembles a ship's fixture, and the name is given very suitable.  According to scientific studies, the formation of the rock occurred due to the invasion of water on land, as well as under the influence of erosion.  Another interesting phenomenon of the Sail is a neat hole inside it.  Its origin is a mystery to all people, and attempts to establish the causes of the appearance have successfully failed.  The most significant was the theory that during the Caucasian war a shell hit it, but historians have denied this, according to the notes of the soldiers.  They said that even from an armadillo it was impossible to break through a rock.  Travelers should try this place for at least a few minutes, marvel at the natural phenomenon and take a couple of photos for the collection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kubhot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gelendzhik attractions and entertainment" class="if uuid-2362988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2362988.jpg"></div><h2>  Water beauty </h2><p>  To combine the attractions and attractions of Gelendzhik together, tourists should head to the vicinity of the village of Renaissance.  It is in this area that <span>the Janet River</span> with its tributaries creates an incredible valley with waterfalls.  One hundred meters from the village you can see the first cascade of water, but the most attractive places are located a little further.  Most valued by locals is a waterfall called Emerald.  They believe that if you swim in its waters on the feast of the Baptism, then illness will bypass you for a year.  The hollow under this waterfall is called the Cup of Love, because the atmosphere here is really romantic.  They go here not only for swimming or exploring a natural miracle, but just for relaxation.  Very close to the Janet River there are many glades where the sound of water will be heard.  Here you can have a great family picnic, take part in various games in nature and just have a great time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="puteshestvovat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of the city of gelendzhik" class="if uuid-2362990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2362990.jpg"></div><h2>  Lots of fun </h2><p>  When the natural and historical sights of the city of Gelendzhik are examined, then it is recommended that tourists visit the Olympus Park.  This is a huge entertainment complex, which is divided into two parts.  Below the users will find a zoo where you can contact with animals, as well as a crocodile farm.  There is also a large number of cafes, pubs and even a tasting room where you can taste the damask wines.  You can go to the upper part by cableway 1150 meters long.  In the evening, it shines beautifully and creates a romantic atmosphere.  Upper Park welcomes travelers with an observation deck from where you can enjoy views of the sea and the surrounding area.  If the height of six hundred meters above sea level is small, then you can climb the Ferris wheel - the first attraction in a similar area.  From there, the views open up even more complete and incredible.  Other attractions include horseback riding or quad biking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik city attractions photo" class="if uuid-2362991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2362991.jpg"></div><h2>  Water parks in the resort </h2><p>  Photos of the attractions of the city of Gelendzhik from among the entertainment institutions do not convey all the fun that you can feel when you visit them.  One of these is the Golden Bay Water Park, which is the largest of these institutions throughout Russia.  The attention of users is a huge number of the most diverse attractions for people of all ages.  The only negative here is the influx of people in the season, when you have to stand in line for certain slides for half an hour, and sometimes more.  An alternative is the Dolphin water park, which is often bypassed due to the popularity of a competitor.  Here the area is much smaller, but you can spend time no less well.  A lot of entertainment, swimming pools and cafes in the territory will provide the tourist with everything that is necessary for a good vacation. </p><h2>  Deep sea </h2><p>  When you get tired of relaxing on the beaches of Gelendzhik, sights will be a pleasant alternative for spending time.  One of these is considered to be the ultramodern aquarium, which is located almost in the very center of the city.  During its design, the authors made sure that the clients were really comfortable.  The interior uses a lot of marine elements, including corals.  There is an aquarium at the entrance right under your feet, and inside you can find fountains and pools.  The tour is accompanied by pleasant quiet music, and all the information about the local animals is displayed on the TV screens.  The exposition itself is divided into three exhibition halls.  Marine inhabitants are separated from freshwater inhabitants for obvious reasons.  The design of aquariums is also pleasantly pleasing to the eye.  For example, a decorative human skeleton is placed with sharks.  It presents marine fauna from all over the world, and therefore interest is guaranteed to visitors. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.59186150000001" data-lng="38.02416629999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/9/7/1897.png"></div><h2>  One unusual place </h2><p>  A photo of the city of Gelendzhik, the beach and sights after exploring all of the above places will be an excellent addition to the collection, but there is another institution that is worth a visit.  Such is an unusual gallery called "White Horse".  Its essence is that all exhibits are made of ordinary rubbish and waste.  You should not be skeptical of this, because it is here that you can enjoy how rich a person‚Äôs imagination can be.  The gallery has its own permanent exhibition, and sometimes other works are exhibited here.  When creating sculptures or paintings, plastic bottles, discarded disposable tableware, and the like were used.  At least unusual sensations are guaranteed to every person here. </p>
