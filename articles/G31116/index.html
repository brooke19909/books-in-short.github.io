    <h2>  Rest in the Leningrad region, Lake Vuoksa </h2><p>  More and more people are choosing places around St. Petersburg to spend their vacations.  No need to travel far from home, and if necessary, you can return back in a few hours.  One of the most interesting options for such a holiday is the Karelian Isthmus.  Here, near the town of Priozersk, there is a glacial <span>lake of Vuoksa</span> with indented shores, many bays and reaches.  According to tourists, this is the most picturesque pond near St. Petersburg.  There are many islands on the lake.  Some of them are overgrown with pines and other conifers.  The most popular among holidaymakers is Oleniy Ostrov.  People come to the lake to escape from the bustle of the city.  Berries, mushrooms, boating in the summer, skiing, skating and sledding in the winter - all these are traditional components of the rest here.  Yes, you can just walk in the woods - after all, a huge number of different paths are trodden along the shores!  Some come for the weekend, some for a week.  And there are regulars who spend all their holidays on the lake.  They stop in tents, in different villages, at <span>recreation centers.</span>  But the highlight of several seasons is the rental of cottages in the Leningrad region, namely on Lake Vuoksa.  One of the best options - to live in a comfortable, cozy wooden house, breathe clean air, fish, spend a romantic evening on the terrace, watching the sunset over the water, together with your loved one - is to come to Plotvichkin Zavod. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottage rent in the Leningrad region" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680862.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the hundred and tenth kilometer you should turn to the village of Kommunary.  Before reaching him, at the crossroads, go left.  In two kilometers there will be a village of Krotovo.  You need to drive it completely, and after the Plotvichkin backwater sign appears, follow it.  Three hundred meters of dirt road, and you have already arrived.  On weekdays, an electric train travels from Finland Station to Mullyupelto Station.  From there, the hundred and first bus you get to the signpost behind the village of Krotovo.  And then - on foot along the dirt road.  When you see a wooden fence, then you are already there. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The base has a good and convenient infrastructure.  The territory is compact, versatile, practical, green and well-groomed.  Its area is about a hectare.  Safe, security everywhere.  You can park your car in the parking lot.  Among the greenery there are many places to make barbecue - arbors, as well as a tent.  Charcoal for barbecue can be bought on site, and skewers give free.  On the territory of the base for tourists there are sports grounds.  On one you can play football, on the other - volleyball.  In the evenings, a billiard room is open.  A good, comfortable and safe playground has been built for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Plotvichkin backwater recreation center" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680847.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are also twelve houses, each of which has a separate entrance.  They are located around the pool, and some overlook Lake Vuoksa.  Double cabins with kitchen utensils and a dining area, as well as an outdoor terrace.  Almost all rooms have balconies or verandas.  Double cottages are suitable for families.

The cottages also have an equipped kitchen with utensils, a dining table, a microwave, a gas stove, and an electric kettle.  The bathroom is combined, but the technology is modern and working.  Rental of cottages in the Leningrad region is most beneficial for vacationers on this base - at least, so many reviews say.  Children under seven are lodged for free if they do not need extra beds.  Quadruple cottages have two bedrooms with a TV in each.  In addition to the kitchen, these cottages have a covered terrace with plastic furniture.  A place for cooking kebabs is located right next to the house.  The six-seater cottage has three bedrooms and a large covered terrace.  A two-story house is designed for a company or a family of ten people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottage complex" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680832.jpg" width="350"></div>

Don't want to leave your favorite pet at home?  This is not a problem, in the complex you can stay with small dogs (up to thirty centimeters at the withers). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Plotvichkin backwater reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680829.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Since, without exception, all the houses, cottages and rooms are equipped with kitchens, most vacationers cook for themselves.  Products can be bought in stores in the village of Kommunar.  Nevertheless, the cottage complex included breakfast in the price.  In the morning they mainly give cereals, boiled eggs, pastries, dairy dishes, including yoghurts.  You can order three meals a day in the restaurant.  But you need to go to lunch and dinner on schedule.  Corporate parties and banquets are also organized there.  In such a hall for celebrations about fifty people are accommodated.  The restaurant is in a separate building.  And in the tent in the open air you can accommodate another sixty people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krotovo Priozersky District" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1680839.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment, beach, fishing </h2><p>  In summer and winter, various festivals, contests and competitions are held at the Plotvichkin Zavod base, so it won‚Äôt be boring.  There is a whole range of baths.  Firstly, it is a Russian steam room, on wood, with oak and birch brooms.  And in some cottages Finnish saunas with different capacities are built in.  There are two piers on the lake where you can walk or fish.  Two beaches - one of them equipped, sandy, and the second floating (pontoon).  It is very good for sunbathing, swimming and boating.  In addition, the base has a small outdoor pool.  It works only in the summer because it does not heat up.  In winter, vacationers skate and ski, and also fish under the ice. </p><h2>  Plotvichkin Zavod: reviews of vacationers </h2><p>  This base is popular with guests primarily because it is possible to have a great time outdoors and not go far from such a metropolis as St. Petersburg.  The cottages are warm and clean, the furniture is new.  They give bedding.  On cold days they drown.  The territory is cozy, beautiful.  Baths were most appreciated.  Very beautiful exit to the lake.  Friendly staff.  Clean and tasty well water.  The food is simple but good and nutritious.  Tourists highly recommend this cottage complex.  Mostly a very decent contingent rests - no drunken scandals.  It is good to ride bicycles here - many paths are laid in the forest.  Walking along the lake, magnificent views and the stunning beauty of nature have sunk into many souls. </p>
