This is very attracting the attention of customers.  They can apply to the bank to receive services in their free time from work, without asking the leaders for work early in the evening or at lunch time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Offices on weekends and holidays </h2><p>  Private clients are served on Saturdays according to the operating hours of Uralsib Bank branches in Moscow - from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  At some points of sale there is a lunch break (rest break) from 13.00 to 13.30.

All comprehensive information on the functioning of points of sale on holidays fixed by law is published on the eve of holidays on the bank’s website and information stands in offices. </p><h2>  Signs and Signs </h2><p>  The Bank Uralsib in Moscow is trying to please its customers as much as possible.  ATMs are located in most areas of the capital.  For the convenience of private clients, payment terminal locations are equipped with signs containing information on possible transactions (“cash deposit”, “cash withdrawal”, “utility bills”) and working hours (“round-the-clock”, “24 hours”).  Information signs and signs are necessary for the use of an ATM network by customers of a credit institution. </p><h2>  ATMs of Uralsib Bank in Moscow </h2><p>  Often cash is required by customers in the evening or at night (for example, you need to urgently pay a taxi or pay in cash at the store).  At this time, shopping and entertainment centers, where most ATMs and payment terminals are located, are closed. </p><p>  We list the addresses of the ATM installation points, access to which is provided without any time limit, that is, around the clock.  So, if you need to urgently withdraw money, you can use the following addresses: </p><ul><li>  Krasnopresnenskaya embankment, 12. </li><li>  Dmitry Donskoy Boulevard, 1. </li><li>  Marxist, 1 building  1. </li><li>  Udaltsova, 65. </li><li>  2nd Tverskaya-Yamskaya, 14. </li><li>  Efremova, 8. </li><li>  Academician Korolev, 3. </li><li>  Marshal Rybalko, 2/5. </li><li>  Cosmodamian Embankment, 55/5. </li><li>  Bakuninskaya, 50/1. </li><li>  Avtozavodskaya 11. </li><li>  Leninsky Prospekt 72/2. </li><li>  Lublin, 175. </li><li>  Novinsky Boulevard, 12/1. </li><li>  Serpukhovskaya, 31/1. </li><li>  Zelenodolskaya, 36/1. </li><li>  Rusakovskaya, 28/1. </li><li>  Izmailovsky Boulevard, 55. </li><li>  Electrode, 9/1. </li><li>  Sadovaya-Chernogryazskaya 13/3. </li><li>  Victory Square, 2/1. </li><li>  Forest, 43. </li><li>  Leningradsky prospect, 33A. </li><li>  Prospect Mira, 71/1. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.finnovosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uralsib bank addresses in Moscow" class="if uuid-2250725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2250725.jpg"></div><p>  We list the addresses of payment terminals, access to which is limited by the opening hours of institutions (in entertainment and shopping centers, shops, cinemas), where they are located: </p><ul><li>  Sevastopol Avenue, 56A; </li><li>  Povarskaya street, 30; </li><li>  st.  Tverskaya, 9; </li><li>  Leninsky Prospekt, 123A; </li><li>  Nakhimovsky Prospect, 24; </li><li>  23 Andropov Avenue; </li><li>  st.  Trade Union, 61; </li><li>  Taganskaya street, 3; </li><li>  st.

Agricultural, 16A; </li><li>  Chistoprudny Boulevard, 13/1; </li><li>  Profsoyuznaya street, 56. </li></ul><p>  If an enterprise has a salary project agreement with Uralsib, then most likely an ATM and a payment terminal will be installed on the territory of this enterprise, but access to them will be allowed only to employees of the organization (especially if the enterprise is located in a closed territory with access control) .  A developed ATM network is necessary for private customers.  This is a significant factor when choosing a lending institution for an individual, since people need to withdraw cash on preferential terms of service every day, and sometimes even hourly. </p><h2>  Exchange rates </h2><p>  Today's demanded operations in commercial banks are conversion operations.  Clients need to always know in real time the current rates for making profitable transactions for the sale or purchase of currency.  Uralsib in Moscow publishes the current exchange rate on a daily basis on its official website. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gamespools.online" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="uralsib bank central office in moscow" class="if uuid-2250826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2250826.jpg"></div><p>  Making exchange transactions in a bank is beneficial for individuals for a number of reasons.  A person can take advantage of an attractive exchange rate at a credit institution, check the notes for authenticity, exchange damaged (damaged) notes, exchange and receive notes of the required value for the convenience of transactions. </p><h2>  Currency exchange through special services </h2><p>  During the period of advanced information technologies, make currency exchange transactions in the Uralsib Internet Bank.  When exchanging currency at the cash desk of an additional office, a commission is charged (at least thirty rubles per transaction).  Online conversion operations occur without commission.  The course in mobile services is different from the course set for exchange operations at the cash desks of additional offices.  For operations in mobile applications, you must be a registered user. </p>
