Now it is not difficult to find information and photos about Adygea.  But these materials will satisfy only as the preparation of the route.  Mountains cannot be described; they must be seen, heard and inhaled.  Then it will remain with you for life. </p><h2>  Among the mountains of Adygea </h2><p>  The village lies in the hollow of the Belaya River valley and on both banks of the Dakh River.  The amazing thing starts right away.  Two streams carry their waters parallel to each other, as if competing, and merge together only at the very rapids.  Over the past centuries, terraces have formed along the river, on which the village houses were built. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.228901" data-lng="40.20087349999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/5/0/2/11502.png"></div><p>  In the valley, protected by the approaching mountains of Azish-Tau, Una-Koz and Gut, a peculiar microclimate has been created, which is characterized by calmness, a mild summer, a long autumn and a little snowy winter. </p><p>  The opportunity to go to the sandy beach or climb the mountains attracts tourists here.  Local hotels offer excursion programs of varying complexity, individual routes are also possible.  This gives good prospects in the development of the village as one of the tourist centers of Adygea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  When did the settlement arise? </h2><p>  Until 1862 there was a large Adyghe aul.  The village of Dakhovskaya was created as an advanced settlement of the Belorechenskaya fortified line, which was built and settled by the Cossacks.  A detachment of imperial troops was commanded by V.A. Geyman.  The confrontation between the Adygs and the Cossacks continued until 1864, until, at the end of the Caucasian war, these lands were left to Russia, and the indigenous population was deported. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vitaliverba.livejournal.com" data-author=": vitaliverba, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountains at Dakhovskaya" class="if uuid-2955229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2955229.jpg"></div><p>  The new settlement began to be called the village of Dakhovskaya by the name of the river.  ‚ÄúDahe‚Äù in Adyghe means ‚Äúbeautiful,‚Äù and perhaps the Daho peoples once lived here.  Or the aristocratic clan Dahyo owned this land. </p><p>  Whatever it is, today the village of Adygea Dakhovskaya with natural and historical sights surrounding it is known far beyond the borders of the region. </p><h2>  Dakhov egg bridge </h2><p>  The ancient bridge over the Belaya River can be called the main attraction of the Dakhov village.  He meets tourists at the entrance to the settlement.  Not far from it a modern bridge was built, which today took over the crossing of cars and people, making the well-deserved stone bridge exclusively a monument. </p><p>  It was erected in 1906 by the repressed Cossacks of the Second Urupsky Regiment.  Excited by the revolutionary events of 1905, the Cossacks wanted to send to Georgia to suppress the unrest that arose among the Cossacks.  But capturing the headquarters in Yekaterinodar along with the banner, the Cossacks went to one of the villages.  There their uprising was crushed, the regiment was disbanded.  Someone was shot, someone was exiled to Siberia.  The construction of a bridge in Dakhovskaya is forced labor for punished Cossacks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kukarta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old bridge" class="if uuid-2955232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2955232.jpg"></div><p>  Help in the construction of such an object necessary for all was provided by both the stanitsiks and the church.  To make the solution connecting the stones strong, egg whites were added to it.  Eggs were collected throughout the village.  The bridge stands to this day.  Until recently, it carried a serious traffic load.  Huge timber trucks passed through it, and even tanks during the war. </p><h2>  Memorial cross </h2><p>  This is another attraction of Art.  Dakhovskoy.  A stone cross is erected in memory of the events that took place here in 1920.  Cossacks who lived and served in these places received orders to be sent to the Kuban to suppress the rebellion that broke out there.  They refused to fulfill the command. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vitaliverba.livejournal.com" data-author=": VITALIVERBA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross in memory of the Cossacks" class="if uuid-2955230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2955230.jpg"></div><p>  A detachment of special forces (CHON) was sent to the village.  Arrests and inquiries were made.  Without identifying the instigators, the Chonovtsy shot everyone. </p><h2>  Church of St. George </h2><p>  Strictly speaking, it cannot be called a Dakhovskaya landmark.  But <span>this is a religious building</span> expensive for the villagers.  The church in the Cossack village has always occupied a special place.  Pious people built their first temple back in 1864, two years after strengthening the territory of the former village and turning it into the front lines of the Caucasian War.  The money was allocated by the Cossack army.  Strong materials were chosen: stone on the foundation and oak timber on the walls. </p><p>  In the Soviet 30s, the church suffered the fate of most religious buildings: it was made a warehouse.  Save the temple failed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kazaki-lefortovo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. George" class="if uuid-2955228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2955228.jpg"></div><p>  Today the Church of St. George the Victorious is located in the building of the former store.  The elders take care of her, for God is where they believe in him. </p><h2>  Savran cable car </h2><p>  There is such a landmark of Adygea in the Dakhov village, as the cable car.  It is part of the tourist complex "Grafskaya Polyana".  The first chair "cable car" in Adygea allows you to comfortably get in 20 minutes from the Dakhovskaya glade to the top of the Una-Koz ridge.  The length of the road is more than 1200 meters, and the height is a thousand above sea level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cableway" class="if uuid-2955233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2955233.jpg"></div><p>  It offers beautiful views of the village, valley and mountains.  Nearby are the Tetis rope park, the Devil's Finger rock and other attractions of the village of Dakhovskaya, where you can go with the whole family and have a great time. </p><h2>  Dakhovskaya cave </h2><p>  In the mountains in the vicinity of the village there are many monuments of archeology.  One of them is a cave, which in 1957 was studied by A. A. Formozov.  Here the parking lot of an ancient man of the Early Paleolithic period was discovered.  In front of the cave there is a platform, the entrance height is only 70 centimeters.  Further, a twenty-meter corridor with a decreasing ceiling leads to a large hall: 50 by 15 at a height of up to 10 meters.  In the corner of the hall there is a narrow hole, behind which there is a second hall, where stalactites grow.  The cave is also called Dirty.  It is moist, and the floor, ceiling and walls are covered with clay. </p><p>  In the first hall, in the cultural layer, a stone ax, arrowheads and other flint tools were discovered.  Here they found the bones of animals: mammoth, deer, wolf and others. </p><h2>  Ancient dolmens </h2><p>  The sights of Dakhovskaya include ancient megalithic structures - dolmens located in the vicinity of the village.  Dolmens - funerary and religious buildings made of large stones, are the most mysterious monuments of ancient history. </p><p>  The Circassians themselves call dolmens "sir un", that is, "the house of dwarfs".  Local legends say that gnomes could find rare metals and precious stones in the mountains.  And they hid these treasures in their homes. </p><p>  In this area, two groups of dolmens were discovered.  One is located at the confluence of the Sahrai and Dakh rivers, and the second is on the opposite side of the village.  There are more than 130 pieces.  In some places, during excavations, the remains of people, animals, jewelry and armor were discovered. </p><h2>  Tetis Rope Park </h2><p>  This man-made landmark of Dakhovskaya is located on the top of the Una-Koz ridge, where the observation deck is arranged.  It is popular with thrill-seekers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dah-sl.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tethys Park" class="if uuid-2955298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2955298.jpg"></div><p>  The rope town is located at an altitude of 1000 meters above sea level.  Under it is the Dakhov Valley, with views of the peaks of the Main Caucasian Range, covered with snow.  This is the largest rope attraction in Adygea, which also works year-round. </p><p>  The park has 5 tracks, bungee tracks and trolls.  Their complexity is different: both five-year-old kids and desperate extremes can try their hand.  The participants are professionals who ensure their safety.  In addition, a continuous insurance system is provided. </p><p>  Here, training is provided for beginner athletes, and sightseeing routes for experienced people are also developed.  For example, one of the routes passes through caves and grottoes, in which, perhaps, primitive people lived. </p>
