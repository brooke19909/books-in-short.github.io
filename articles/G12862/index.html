    <p>  Here is a very short and cool summer, which lasts a maximum of 1.5 months - from July to mid-August.  Despite this, there is no end to tourists, since the main attractions of the city and the surrounding area are clean air, nature unspoiled by human activity and wonderful people. </p><p>  The city of Kem, whose hotels are ready to receive guests year-round, is the starting point for Solovki, which can be reached by boat.  <span>The Solovetsky Islands,</span> on which the monastery‚Äôs monastery is located, is a historical place given to the monks <span>Marfa Boretskaya</span> in the 15th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 16th century, the Kemsky volost was ravaged twice - first by the Finns, and then by the Swedes.  In 1591, a fortified prison was built on Solovki, and from the end of the 18th century, Kem received the status of a county town. </p><p>  During the Soviet era, the famous monastery became the place of imprisonment of political prisoners, and a concentration camp was built in Kem where they were waiting for departure to the islands. </p>

    <p>  Today, not camps, but hotels (Kem, Karelia) give shelter to travelers, and the <span>Solovetsky Monastery</span> is a museum-reserve open to visitors.  Its historical value and sad history attract thousands of tourists every year, which makes it possible to support the monastery financially. </p><h2>  "Berth" </h2><p>  The Prichal Hotel (Kem) is considered the best place to relax, as it is located on the very shore of the White Sea in the village of Rabocheostrovsk at 1 Naberezhnaya. </p><p>  In total, these are 8 beautiful cottages located in a picturesque place.  Each of them is ready to receive guests based on their preferences and capabilities.  The total number of rooms is 93, and beds are 190. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the city of Kem itself does not have attractions worthy of close attention, therefore, mainly tourists come to visit the Solovetsky archipelago or ecotourism.  And mushroom pickers, and berry pickers, and fishermen are well aware of these lands, which have not yet let anyone go without a catch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the cottage No. 1, in addition to 9 cozy rooms, there is also a restaurant and bar where you can order Russian dishes or have a good time with friends over a beer. </p>

    <p>  Depending on the cost, the rooms are divided into categories: economy class (in which the toilet and shower are in the block), as well as a suite, a junior suite with all amenities. </p><h2>  Cottages "Berth" </h2><p>  Kemi Hotel ‚ÄúPrichal‚Äù is located 12 km from the railway station, but in the immediate vicinity of the pier, which is extremely convenient for those travelers who decide to go on a boat to Solovki. </p><p>  Tourists who prefer comfort and do not spare money on it, choose a cottage number 8.  There are 28 rooms with a high level of comfort, among which two rooms - single and double - have working fireplaces.  Hotel ‚ÄúPrichal‚Äù (Kem) has a level of 3 *, which is quite good for a small provincial town. </p>

Beautiful <span>white nights</span> and, albeit for a short time, but real polar days, attract lovers of northern beauty. </p>

    <p>  Vacationers who prefer bird watching will also not be disappointed, as wild ducks nest on the local river Kemke, which can be fed and watched for their broods.  Sea gulls ‚Äúcompete‚Äù with ducks for feeding, as do the ubiquitous sparrows and pigeons. </p><p>  In summer, tourists can enjoy river rafting, boat trips to the Kuzovetsky archipelago, sailing and hiking in the forest for mushrooms and berries. </p><p>  In winter, the Kemi Hotel ‚ÄúPier‚Äù invites snowboarders and skiers.  Since winters in these places are very snowy, the cottages do not remain empty - beginner skiers learn to go down from the small Kem heights, and thrill-seekers can take part in dog sled competitions. </p><h2>  Mushroom and berry hunting </h2><p>  Since Karelia is a region that does not have large industrial enterprises, it is a real paradise for mushroom pickers, since you can not be afraid that the mushrooms found can be poisoned with chemicals. </p><p>  The Hotel ‚ÄúPier‚Äù in Kemi (Karelia) often becomes a ‚Äúhaven‚Äù for mushroom pickers, because these regions are famous for a large number of mushrooms, as well as berries.  Morels, oily fish of incredible size, chanterelles and the king of mushrooms - porcini mushroom - are found everywhere in local forests. </p>

    <p>  For berry growers, the abundance of blueberries, lingonberries, cloudberries, cranberries, blueberries and wild raspberries gives you the opportunity to take a walk around your favorite pastime.  It is important that all the vegetation of Karelia is recognized as environmentally friendly and is in great demand among the population outside the republic.  There are so many berries that you can collect them without leaving the city of Kemi, right in the city park. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  For fishermen, this region is also a paradise.  <span>Forest lake</span> will delight them with the catch of pike, pink salmon and even salmon, and in the White Sea you can catch sea cod with a net.  Fishing requires a license, which is easy to obtain.  Travel companies even organize weekend tours for fishermen, therefore the Hotel ‚ÄúPrichal‚Äù is not empty in Kem either in winter or in summer. </p>

    <p>  Catfish, flounder, sea bass, goby and other fish become trophies of such tours.  On odd years, real herds of pink salmon fish come to spawn to the White Sea, whose caviar can be enjoyed from July to August. </p><p>  For the most advanced fishermen who are ready to spend time on long fishing, fishing camps are organized, which can be reached by boat. </p><h2>  Mini-hotel "Kem" </h2><p>  In addition to the Prichal cottage complex, guests are welcomed by the Kemi Mini-Hotel of the same name.  It is located in close proximity to the railway station and offers travelers not only comfortable rooms for relaxation, but also round-the-clock meals. </p><p>  The cost of rooms from 800 rubles per day makes it popular with tourists traveling to the Solovetsky Islands.  A bus departs from the inn, delivering passengers to the seaport. </p><p>  Economy rooms do not have their own amenities (they are located on the floor), and the standard category has its own toilet and shower. </p><p>  All rooms have a private balcony with city views. </p><h2>  Hospitable land </h2><p>  Tourism in the Kemsky region is just beginning to develop, so these places are in demand among those travelers who are attracted by nature, and not ancient monuments.  Here you can fully spend the weekend with family and friends, doing what you love - listening to birds, fishing or ‚Äúhunting‚Äù for berries and mushrooms. </p><p>  This hospitable Pomeranian region generously shares its wealth and will not leave anyone indifferent.  Kemi hotels provide shelter for travelers, and cafes and restaurants are ready to feed hungry tourists with dishes of Russian national cuisine.  Convenient transport interchange allows you to easily get to the city by car or by train.  If you fly by plane, you should take a ticket to Arkhangelsk, and then take a ferry to Kem. </p>
