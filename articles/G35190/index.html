In this regard, the organization of accounting is carried out in such a way that at the same time it is possible to reflect both the preservation of the original form and the loss of price over time.  In this case, the <span>average annual cost of OPF is</span> used as a key indicator.

    <h2>  Key Values </h2><p>  The cost of OPF can be recovery, residual and initial.  The latter reflects the cost of obtaining the OS.  This value is unchanged.  The initial cost of funds that come from the capital investments of certain companies can be established by adding up all the costs.  These include, among other things, transportation costs, the price of equipment and installation, etc. The replacement cost is the cost of buying an operating system in the current conditions.  To determine it, revaluation of funds is carried out using indexation or the direct translation method based on current market prices, documented.  <span>The residual value</span> is equal to the replacement, reduced by the amount of depreciation.  There are also private indicators of OS use.  These include, in particular, the coefficients of intensive, integral, extensive operation of equipment and shift. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="average annual cost of OPF balance sheet formula" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1576851.jpg" width="500"></div>

This is due to the fact that with prolonged use of funds in the process, they quickly lose their original properties.  The degree of wear can be different - it depends on various factors.  These, in particular, include the level of exploitation of funds, staff qualifications, aggressiveness of the environment, etc. These factors affect different indicators.  So, to determine the return on assets, an equation is first drawn up, according to which the average annual cost of OPF (formula) is established.  From the revenue and the number of employees depends on the capital ratio and profitability. </p><h2>  Obsolescence </h2><p>  It means the depreciation of funds even before the physical loss of properties.  <span>Moral wear and tear</span> can occur in two forms.  The first is due to the fact that the production process reduces the cost of funds in those areas in which they are produced.  This phenomenon does not lead to losses, since it appears as a result of an increase in accumulations.  The second form of obsolescence arises as a result of the appearance of such OPFs that are distinguished by high productivity.  Another indicator that is taken into account is depreciation (the process of transferring the value of funds to manufactured products).  It is necessary for the formation of a special cash reserve for the complete renovation of objects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="average annual cost of OPF balance calculation formula" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1576852.jpg" width="419"></div>

    <h2>  Average annual cost of OPF: balance sheet formula </h2><p>  To determine the indicator, you must use the data that is present in <span>the balance sheet.</span>  They should cover operations not only as a whole for the period, but also separately for each month.  How is the <span>average annual cost of OPF</span> determined <span>?</span>  <span>The balance formula is as</span> follows: </p><p>  X = R + (A √ó M) / 12 - [D (12 - L)] / 12, where: </p><ul><li>  R is the initial cost; </li><li>  A - article of introduced funds; </li><li>  M - the number of months of operation of introduced OPF; </li><li>  D is the value of the residual value; </li><li>  L is the number of months of work of disposed funds. </li></ul><h2>  OS put into operation </h2><p>  As can be seen from the above information, the equation by which the <span>average annual cost of OPF (formula</span> ) is determined includes indicators that require a separate analysis.  First of all, the initial price of funds is established.  For this, the amount of the balance at the beginning of the reporting period on the account is taken.  01 balance sheet.  After that, you should analyze whether any operating systems were put into operation during the period.  If it was, you need to set a specific month.  To do this, you should look at the revs in dB midrange.  01 and establish the value of the funds put into effect.  After that, the number of months in which these operating systems were operated is calculated and multiplied by the cost.  Next, the <span>average annual cost of OPF is</span> determined <span>.</span>  <span>The formula</span> allows you to set the cost of funds put into use.  For this, the indicator obtained by multiplying the number of months of use by the initial price of the OS is divided by 12. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="average annual cost opf balance calculation formula example" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1576853.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Average annual cost of OPF: balance sheet calculation formula (example) </h2><p>  Suppose the OS at the beginning of the period amounted to 3670 thousand rubles.  Throughout the year, funds were introduced: </p><ul><li>  on March 1 - 70 thousand p .; </li><li>  on August 1 - 120 thousand p. </li></ul><p>  Also disposed of: </p><ul><li>  on February 1 - 10 thousand p .; </li><li>  on June 1 - 80 thousand p. </li></ul><p>  Decision: </p><ul><li>  X = 3670 + (120 √ó 5: 12 + 70 √ó 10: 12) - (80 √ó 6: 12 + 10 √ó 11: 12); </li><li>  X = 3670 + (50.0 + 58.3) - (40.0 + 9.2) = 3729, 1 thousand rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Retirement </h2><p>  In the analysis, in addition to the funds put into operation, the funds written off are determined.  It is necessary to establish in which month they dropped out.  For this, the revolutions in cd midrange are analyzed.  01. After that, the value of the disposed funds is determined.  When decommissioning fixed assets during the entire reporting period, the number of months in which they were operated is established.  Next, you need to determine the average annual value of disposed funds.  To do this, their price is multiplied by the difference between the total number of months in the entire reporting period and the number of months of operation.  The resulting value is divided by 12. As a result, the average annual cost of OPFs retired from the enterprise will be obtained. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the average annual value of the OPF formula of revenue and number of employees" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/1576854.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <h2>  Final operations </h2><p>  At the end of the analysis, the total average annual value of OPF is determined.  To do this, add up their initial cost at the beginning of the reporting period and the indicator for the funds put into operation.  From the obtained value is deducted the average annual value of fixed assets retired from the enterprise.  In general, calculations are not difficult and time-consuming.  In the calculation, the main task is to correctly analyze the statement.  Accordingly, it should be compiled without errors. </p>
