    <p>  Its channel is very winding, which attracts many tourists.  For example, lovers of kayaking.  Indeed, in the middle and upper reaches, rapids and rocky riffles are difficult to pass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The largest of them on the Izhma River is located near the city of Sosnogorsk.  Somewhat downstream relative to the village.  This threshold is called Selet-Kosyet, which in literal translation from the language of local nationalities means "Heart". </p><p>  For a long distance, this river is navigable.  Ships and motor ships can go from the mouth of the Ukhta River.  It is from here that shipping begins on the Izhma River in the Komi Republic. </p><p>  In the lower reaches, Izhma expands significantly.  At the same time becoming difficult for the passage of ships.  A large number of backwaters and channels appear.  At the same time, the course of the river is greatly weakened.  And in addition there are large islands that constantly have to go around. </p><p>  In Pechora, Izhma flows into the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa small village, which is called Ust-Izhma.  The river has many tributaries.  On the right side, the largest are Sabys and Ayyuva.  And on the left side these rivulets are called Ukhta, Sedya and Kedva. </p><p>  Noteworthy is the place near the mouth of this river.  Historians and archaeologists have discovered an ancient settlement, which is known as the Filthy Nose.  On it, scientists found artifacts that dated to the XI-XIII centuries.  Among them are an iron ax with a wide blade, spear and arrowheads, a chair equipped with a bronze handle.  Presumably all of these items belonged to Novgorod residents, who related themselves to state people.  They were directly involved in collecting tribute. </p><h2>  Settlements in the region of Izhma </h2>

It is worth noting that along its shores there are a large number of different settlements. </p><p>  For example, in the upper reaches, the river flows through a fairly large village called Verkhneizhemsky.  It belongs to the municipal district of Sosnogorsk.  There are about 10 streets in the village.  According to the latest census, almost 900 inhabitants live in it. </p><p>  In the middle reaches of the river is the town of Sosnogorsk.  In this place the river Ukhta flows into Izhma.  It is noteworthy that until 1957 this city was called Izhma.  This village is located almost 350 km from the center of the region - Syktyvkar.  About 26 thousand people live in it.  Traces of primitive communities dating back to the Stone Age were discovered by scientists on the site of Sosnogorsk.  The modern history of the city originates during the period of Soviet industrialization in 1930-1940. </p><p>  The city of Ukhta is 8 km up the river.  This is the second largest settlement in the Komi Republic.  Its population is almost 100 thousand people.  Ukhta received the status of the city in 1943.  After the end of World War II, processing and other industries actively developed here, and building materials were produced.  Trunk pipelines were built to supply oil and gas to other regions. </p><p>  Today it is a large industrial city in which a well-developed resource base.  The economy is famous for its developed transport and production infrastructure. </p><p>  There are many skilled workers.  There are several design and research institutes in the city. </p><p>  At the mouth of Izhma is the village of Akim.  It arose in the middle of the XIX century.  The name received in honor of the founder, whose name was Yakim.  Now the village is in decline.  According to the latest census, only 21 people live in it. </p><h2>  Pechora basin </h2>

    <p>  According to the water registry, Izhma belongs to the Dvina-Pechersky basin district. </p><p>  The water sections of the river are divided as follows: it is Pechora itself from the confluence of the Usa to Ust-Tsilma, and then Pechora below the confluence of the Usa river. </p><p>  Directly Izhma belongs to the Pechora river basin. </p><h2>  Hydrology facility </h2><p>  Basically, the river is fed by melting snow.  Usually the pond freezes by mid-November.  Ice is opened on the river in the spring.  This happens after the May holidays. </p><p>  The maximum water flow rate is about 1,300 meters per second.  Such indicators are formed in May.  Minimum rates in February-March.  No more than 80 cubic meters per second.  In April, it rises sharply to almost 250. This does not allow the river to leave the banks and dry up.  Due to this, its flora and fauna is preserved. </p>
