    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  A quite popular destination for recreation is Turkey.  <span>"Gloria Verde"</span> (hotel, 5 stars) has long been loved by travelers.  Nevertheless, you can find a number of negative reviews about this institution, namely: </p><ul><li>  if you rent a room with a terrace and a jacuzzi, then only a hotel employee can turn it on, and therefore you will have to wait long enough to use this option; </li><li>  visit to the kids club is paid; </li><li>  a lot of insects in the hotel; </li><li>  every year, hotel prices are rising, but nothing new appears; </li><li>  approach to the sea is strewn with sharp stones, and the depth increases quite sharply; </li><li>  not very good quality of cleaning the rooms (although if you leave a tip, you can slightly improve the situation); </li><li>  all promotions and super-offers are just fraud (if you settle in a room at a reduced price, then you will have to pay much more for additional services); </li><li>  the hotel is very noisy both during the day and late in the evening; </li><li>  the waiters in the dining room work very slowly - they are in no hurry to wipe the tables and take away dirty dishes (sometimes you even have to make a remark); </li><li>  the hotel is not divided into smoking and non-smoking blocks, and therefore everything is saturated with the smell of tobacco smoke; </li><li>  there are no lifeguards near the children's pool; </li><li>  the beach is not cleaned carefully enough. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The Gloria hotel chain (Turkey) is widely known and is associated with quality service and a vibrant vacation.  It is worth noting that the hotel is thought out to the smallest detail so that guests can fully relax.  Spacious elegant rooms, huge pools, a private beach - all this immerses tourists in a carefree atmosphere.  The restaurant has very tasty food, as well as the possibility of forming an individual diet menu.  Well, of course, it is worth noting that the hotel has many Russian-speaking employees. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Gloria (hotel-resort, Turkey) makes a rather positive impression, there were some shortcomings.  The main one is the constant rise in prices from season to season.  At the same time, the quality of services does not get better.  Very little attention is paid to beach care.  As a result, sharp stones, trash and algae.  The constant noise from bars and other establishments does not contribute to a quiet and relaxing holiday, day or night. </p>
