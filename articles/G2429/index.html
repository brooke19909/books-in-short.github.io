The people associated him with good deeds and called him a peacemaker.  Why Alexander 3 was called a peacemaker can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Ascension to the throne </h2><p>  Due to the fact that Alexander was only the second child in the family, no one considered him as a contender for the throne.  He was not prepared for rule, but only given a basic military education.  The death of his brother Nicholas completely changed the course of history.  After this event, Alexander had to devote a lot of time to study.  He re-mastered almost all subjects, starting with the foundations of the economy and the Russian language and ending with world history and foreign policy.  After the murder of his father, he became a full-fledged emperor of a great power.  The reign of Alexander 3 lasted from 1881 to 1894.  What ruler he was, we will consider further. </p>

    <h2>  Why was Alexander 3 called a peacemaker </h2><p>  To strengthen his position on the throne at the beginning of the reign, Alexander abandoned his father's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe constitutionality of the country.  This is the answer to the question of why Alexander 3 was called a peacemaker.  Thanks to the choice of such a government strategy, he managed to stop the riots.  To a greater extent by creating a secret police.  Under Alexander III, the power strengthened its borders quite strongly.  A powerful army and its reserve reserves appeared in the country.  Thanks to this, Western influence on the country has come to a minimum.  This made it possible to exclude all kinds of bloodshed throughout the entire period of his rule.  One of the main reasons why Alexander 3 was called a peacemaker is that he often participated in the elimination of military conflicts in his country and abroad. </p>

    <h2>  Board Results </h2><p>  Following the reign of Alexander the 3rd was awarded the honorary title of peacemaker.  Also, historians call him the most Russian Tsar.  He threw all his strength to the defense of the Russian people.  It was with his forces that the country's prestige on the world stage was restored and the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church was elevated.  Alexander III allocated a lot of time and money to the development of industries and agriculture in Russia.  He increased the welfare of the inhabitants of his country.  Thanks to his efforts and love for his country and people, Russia has achieved the highest results for that period in economics and politics.  In addition to the title of peacekeeper, Alexander III is still awarded the title of reformer.  According to many historians, it was he who laid the sprouts of communism in the minds of the people. </p>
