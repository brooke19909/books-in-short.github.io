    <h2>  Facilities and service </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of a high level of service, it should be noted other services provided at this place.  So, free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel - after all, staying in touch is important, and the Internet is necessary for this.  Of course, you can not do without private parking.  By the way, you do not need to pre-order a place for yourself - it is provided free of charge upon arrival.  Car rental is also available.  The registration desk is open around the clock, so that every guest who arrives at any time of the day will be served as quickly as possible.  It should also be noted that the administration of the Kriopigi Beach Hotel 4 * (Halkidiki) offers a shuttle service, for an additional fee.  This is very important, because many people find it difficult to navigate upon arrival in a foreign country.  For the same reason, the hotel offers visitors a tour desk.  The hotel has an ATM, currency exchange, a place where you can receive a fax or print / copy paper.  Packed lunches are even given to tourists.  And the last thing to note is the banquet and conference rooms.  In general, all that is needed, and that which may simply be needed at some point. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  General services </h2><p>  It must be said that Kriopigi Beach Hotel 4 * (Halkidiki, Kassandra) provides services of both an individual character and general.  So, for example, guests can be offered a safe.  For lovers of shopping, as well as for those who just need to buy something, several shops are offered on site.

There are non-smoking apartments for couples and also for honeymooners.  Another nice nuance that should be noted by attention is the availability of an elevator.  Indeed, sometimes travelers return to the hotel so tired that they don‚Äôt even have the strength to get to their room.  So the elevator is very welcome here. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  Kriopigi Beach Hotel 4 * is one of the most loyal hotels that generally can be.  If guests are a family with a child whose age is less than two years, then he will stay at the hotel absolutely free.  Especially for a young traveler, a cot will be installed in the room.  The only thing is that future guests will need to clarify this fact during the booking process.  This event is necessary for the hotel to install a crib in the apartment in advance.  Thus, by the arrival of guests everything will be ready.  But this is not all the benefits regarding accommodation.  If the child is less than 12 years old, then he will also live for free.  Only not on a crib, but on an extra.  If the child is older, then you will have to pay 70% of the cost of placing one person.  As you can see, the hotel provides all the amenities for its guests.  The only thing that is not allowed is living with your pets. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and comments </h2><p>  Tourists who have visited this place always leave Kriopigi Beach Hotel 4 * with sadness.  Greece is a very hospitable country, and it can become a native home in just a few days spent in it.  Attentive attitude at the hotel, charming staff, excellent service - all this invariably makes tourists return there again.  Tourists vacationing at the Kriopigi Beach Hotel 4 * (Halkidiki, Kassandra) leave reviews, by and large, positive, and even admired.  After all, the efficiency of service can not but rejoice.  For example, some tourists tell how they asked to change the room based on personal preferences, and their question was immediately resolved without unnecessary conversations - they were immediately transferred to a suite.  Fans of economical holidays enthusiastically share their impressions - for two weeks only 30,000 rubles, taking into account numerous excursions, dinners in taverns and a variety of entertainments.  For Europe, it's just ridiculous money, considering what kind of service is offered for them.
