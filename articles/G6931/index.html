    <h2>  Free service </h2><p>  On the territory of Sergios Hotel 3 * there is a small pool with fresh water.  Sunbeds and umbrellas around it can be borrowed for free.  Towels should be paid extra.  You can also play darts and table tennis at the hotel. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Sergios Hotel does not have its own swimming area.  The beach is at a distance of about one hundred and fifty meters.  It is urban, so the use of trestle beds and umbrellas must be paid separately.  Everything is provided for a comfortable pastime, there are also showers and a toilet.  The coating is pebble and sand, therefore, judging by the reviews, the presence of special rubber shoes is necessary.  Those who did not bring with them should not despair, because it can be purchased at any nearby store, including the hotel.  Paid is also a beach bar. </p>

    <h2>  Sergios Hotel: reviews </h2><p>  Many Russians share their impressions that initially, even before arriving at this hotel, they were very worried about the low category of the Sergios hotel.  But their fears on the spot immediately dissipated.  Moreover, many regretted not buying a longer tour.  The ratio of value to the quality of the service offered is simply amazing. </p><p>  The rooms are comfortable.  Many Russians liked the presence of a balcony from which an excellent panorama opened.  The furniture is new, the plumbing works fine.  The staff, judging by the reviews, works great.  Everything is clean, bedding just shines, towels are changed even in some cases twice a day. </p><p>  As for food, there are also no complaints.  Tasty, healthy and varied - this is how our compatriots who have already had time to relax at Sergios Hotel speak about food.  I especially liked the pastries, in particular cakes.  In general, there are practically no complaints about the hotel itself, except perhaps about its small territory, as well as the lack of any entertainment on site.  Therefore, many advise young people to come here, who will spend most of their time in the city. </p>

    <p>  The discontent among our compatriots was caused by a group transfer.  And although Sergios Hotel is only 25 kilometers from the Heraklion airport, guests arrived at the hotel only forty minutes later.  The bus was stuffy, and there were a lot of people in it.  But this is a minus of the host. </p><p>  In the end, we can say that the vast majority of Russians hope to return to this hotel yet to spend their holidays just as well. </p>
