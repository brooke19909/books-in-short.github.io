Located on a hill, more precisely, its southwestern slope.  It is beautifully limited by the steppe rivers Sok, Surgut and Shungut, which, combined with the oak and birch groves located very close by, gives the local landscape a special appeal.  Sulfur Lake, located here is a miracle created by nature, is considered the most peculiar and beautiful in the entire Middle Volga. </p><h2>  History of Sernovodsk </h2><p>  This wonderful city was founded by decree of Tsar Peter I in 1703.  It was called Novo-Sergievsky at that time.  People then lived in Kalmyk and Kyrgyz huts, dugouts, huts, tents, and some lived in small huts.  In 1824 Sulfur town appeared, as it was allowed to the landowners to build wooden houses by the lake, necessarily small.  This town was beautiful, original and decorated with flowers, the columns of its houses were entwined with ivy.  Since 1830, it began to be inhabited by permanent residents.  The reason for this rapid settlement of the area was medical sources.  They built a theater with restaurants.  It happened in 1843.  Windows, walls, doors, candelabra and chandeliers were buried in greenery, and the terrace and balcony turned into a green flower garden. </p>
