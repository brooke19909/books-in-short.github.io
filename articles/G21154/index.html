    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  Peter the Great paid great attention to economics and trade.  In 1716, he sent a detachment of Bekovich-Cherkassky to Bukhara and Khiva through the Caspian.  During the expedition, it was necessary to study the routes to India, to explore the gold deposits in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya.  In addition, the task was to persuade the emir of Bukhara to friendship, and the khan of Khiva to the citizenship of Russia.  But the first expedition was completely a failure.  The Khiva khan persuaded Bekovich-Cherkassky to disperse the detachment, and then attacked individual groups, destroying them.  The Persian campaign of <span>Peter 1</span> was also due to a message transmitted through the representatives of Israel Ori from the Syunik meliks.  In it, they asked the <span>Russian tsar</span> for help.  Peter promised to provide support after the end of the battles with Sweden. </p><h2>  The situation on the coast </h2><p>  The history of Persia at the beginning of the 18th century was marked by an intensification of activities in the Eastern Caucasus.  As a result, all coastal territories of Dagestan were subordinated.  Persian ships controlled the Caspian Sea.  However, this did not put an end to the feuds of local rulers.  On the territory of Dagestan, violent clashes took place.  Turkey was gradually drawn into them.  All these events worried Russia.  The state conducted trade through Dagestan with the East.  Due to the activity of Persia, all paths were actually cut.  Russian merchants suffered huge losses.  The whole situation was negatively reflected in the state of the treasury. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Immediate occasion </h2><p>  Having recently completed the Great Northern War, Russia began to prepare to send troops to the Caucasus.  A direct reason was the robbery and beating of Russian merchants in Shamakhi.  The organizer of the attack was the Lezgi owner Daud-beck.  On August 7, 1721, armed crowds ravaged Russian shops in the courtyard, beaten and dispersed the clerks.  Lezgins and Kumyks looted goods worth about half a million rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flotilla" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1245947.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Training </h2><p>  The Russian emperor became aware that Shah Tahmasp II was defeated by the Afghans at his capital.  Troubles began in the state.  There was a threat that the Turks, taking advantage of the situation, would attack first and appear before the Russians in the Caspian.  Putting off the Persian campaign was very risky.  Preparation began in the winter.  In the Volga cities of Yaroslavl, Uglich, Nizhny Novgorod, Tver, the hasty construction of ships began.  In the years 1714-1715.  Bekovich-Cherkassky compiled a map of the eastern and northern coasts of the Caspian.  In 1718, the description was also made by Urusov and Kozhin, and in 1719-1720.  - Verdun and Soymonov.  So the general map of the Caspian was compiled. </p><h2>  Plans </h2><p>  The Persian campaign of Peter 1 was supposed to start from Astrakhan.  He planned to go along the coast of the Caspian.  Here he intended to capture Derbent and Baku.  After that, it was planned to go to the river.  Hens to put a fortress there.  Then the path went to Tiflis to assist the Georgians in the battles against the Ottoman Empire.  From there, the military flotilla was supposed to arrive in Russia.  In the event of hostilities, contact was made with Vakhtang VI (King of Kartli) and Astvatsatur I (Armenian Catholicos).  Astrakhan and Kazan became centers for the preparation and organization of the campaign.  Out of 80 field companies, 20 battalions were created.  Their total number was 22 thousand people.  with 196 artillery pieces.  On the way to Astrakhan, Peter agreed on support with the Kalmyk Khan Ayuki.  As a result, Kalmyk cavalry, numbering 7 thousand people, joined the detachments.  June 15, 1722 the emperor arrived in Astrakhan.  Here he decided to send 22 thousand infantry by sea, and seven dragoon regiments (9 thousand people) - by land from Tsaritsyn.  The last commanded by Major General Kropotov.  By land, Don and Ukrainian Cossacks were also sent.  In addition, 3 thousand Tatars were hired.  In the Kazan Admiralty transport ships were built (a total of about 200) for 6 thousand sailors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Derbent" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1245948.jpg" width="550"></div>

The author of the message was <span>Dmitry Kantemir,</span> who was in charge of the camp office.  This prince was fluent in oriental languages, which allowed him to play an important role in the campaign.  Cantemir made a typeset Arabic font, created a special printing house.  The manifesto was translated into Persian, Tatar and Turkish. </p><h2>  First stage </h2><p>  The Persian campaign began from Moscow.  To accelerate the course along the rivers along the way, variable rowers were prepared.  By the end of May, Peter arrived in Nizhny Novgorod, on June 2 - in Kazan, 9 - in Simbirsk, 10 - in Samara, 13 - in Saratov, 15 - 1 Tsaritsyn, 19 - in Astrakhan.  2.06 vessels with ammunition and soldiers also left Nizhny Novgorod.  They also headed to Astrakhan.  The ships marched in five rows one after another.  July 18, all ships went to sea.  The head was Count Fedor Matveevich Apraksin.  On July 20, ships entered the Caspian Sea.  During the week, Fedor Matveevich Apraksin led ships along the west coast.  By early August, Kabardian troops joined the army.  They were commanded by the princes Aslan-Bek and Murza Cherkassky. </p><h2>  Andireus </h2><p>  July 27, 1722 there was a landing in the <span>Gulf of Agrahan.</span>  The Russian tsar first stepped on the land of Dagestan.  On the same day, Peter sent a detachment led by Veterani to capture Andyrius.  However, on the way to the settlement in the gorge, he was attacked by the Kumyks.  Highlanders took refuge in the rocks and behind the forest.  They managed to incapacitate 2 officers and 80 soldiers.  However, the detachment quickly regrouped and went on the offensive.  The enemy was defeated, and Erdirei was burned.  The rest of the North Kumyk rulers expressed their complete readiness to serve the Russians.  On August 13, troops entered Tarki.  Here Peter was greeted with honor.  Shamkhal Aldy-Girey gave the Russian tsar an argamak, the troops received wine, food and fodder.  After a while, the troops entered the Utamysh possession, which was located near Derbent.  Here they were attacked by the 10,000th detachment of the Sultan-Mahmud.  However, as a result of a short battle, the Russians managed to put the army to flight.  The village was burned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  G. Derbent </h2><p>  The Russian Tsar was very loyal to those who agreed to submit, and very cruel to those who resisted.  News of this soon spread throughout the county.  In this regard, Derbent did not show resistance.  On August 23, a ruler with several eminent citizens met Russians a mile away from the city.  Everyone fell to their knees, bringing Peter the silver keys to the gate.  The Russian tsar received the ruler affectionately and made a promise not to send troops into the city.  However, not all residents, but mainly Shiites, provided a warm welcome.  They occupied a privileged position, since they were the backbone of the Safavid domination.  By August 30, the Russians approached the river.  Rubas and laid the fortress in the immediate vicinity of the territory inhabited by Tabasarans.  Under the rule of Peter there were many villages.  Over the course of several days, all the environs that ran between the Belbel and Yalama rivers also became subordinate to the Russians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Persian campaign Peter 1" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1245949.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Local government reaction </h2><p>  The feudal lords in Dagestan had a different attitude towards the appearance of the Russians.  Haji Dawood began to actively prepare for defense.  His allies Ahmed III and Surkhay tried to sit out in their own possessions, taking a wait and see attitude.  Haji-Dawood knew perfectly well that he alone could not resist the attackers.  In this regard, he, hoping that Ahmed III and Surkhay would help, tried to simultaneously establish relations with the main rivals of the Russian Tsar - the Turks. </p><h2>  Completion of the first stage </h2><p>  The Persian campaign suggested the annexation of not only the territories of Dagestan, but also of practically the whole of Transcaucasia.  The Russian army began to prepare for advance south.  In fact, the first part of the campaign was over.  Storms at sea prevented the continuation of the journey, which made it difficult to transport food.  The Russian tsar left the garrison under the leadership of Colonel Juncker in Derbent, and he went on foot to Russia.  On the way by the river.  Sulak he laid the fortress.  Holy Cross for the defense of the border.  From here, Peter and his army set off on water to Astrakhan.  After his departure, the command of the detachments in the Caucasus was transferred to Major General Matyushkin. </p><h2>  Rasht </h2><p>  By the fall of 1722, the threat of the occupation of Afghans loomed over Gilan province.  The latter entered into a secret agreement with the Turks.  The governor of the province turned to the Russians for help.  Matyushkin decided to forestall the enemy.  Quite quickly, 14 ships were prepared, which took on 2 battalions with artillery.  On November 4, the vessels left Astrakhan and a month later appeared at Enzeli.  With a small landing, the city of Rasht was taken without a fight.  The following year, an increase of 2 thousand people was sent to Gilan in the spring.  infantry with 24 guns.  They were commanded by Major General Levashov.  Together, the Russian troops occupied the entire province.  So control was established over the southern part of the Caspian coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Persian campaign 1722 1723" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1245950.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Baku </h2><p>  Even from Derbent, the Russian tsar sent Lieutenant Lunin to this city with an invitation to surrender.  However, Baku People were under the influence of Daud-Bek agents.  They did not let Lunin into the city and refused the help of the Russians.  June 20, 1773 Matyushkin headed for Baku from Astrakhan.  On July 28, troops entered the city.  The authorities, welcoming them, handed Matyushkin the keys to the gate.  Having occupied the city, the troops settled down in 2 caravanserais and established control over all important strategic points.  Having received news that Sultan Muhammad-Hussein-bey was in contact with Hadji-Davud, Matyushkin ordered him to be taken into custody.  After that, he and three brothers with property were sent to Astrakhan.  Dergah-Kuli-bek was appointed by the Baku ruler.  He was promoted to the rank of colonel.  Prince Baryatinsky was appointed as commandant.  The campaign of 1723 allowed to capture almost the entire coast of the Caspian.  This, in turn, caused serious damage to the positions of Haji-Dawood.  Having lost the Caspian provinces, he actually lost the opportunity to recreate an independent and strong state on the territory of Lezgistan and Shirvan.  Haji Dawood at that time was in the citizenship of the Turks.  They did not provide any support to him, as they were busy solving their own problems. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Persian campaign was very successful for the Russian government.  In fact, control was established over the coast of the East Caucasus.  The successes of the Russian army and the invasion of the <span>Ottoman forces</span> forced Persia to sign a peace treaty.  He was imprisoned in Petersburg.  In accordance with the agreement of September 12 (23), 1723, vast territories departed to Russia.  Among them were the provinces of Shirvan, Astrabad, Mazenderan, Gilan.  Passed to the Russian Tsar and Rasht, Derbent, Baku.  However, they had to refuse to advance to the central parts of Transcaucasia.  This was due to the fact that in the summer of 1723 Ottoman troops entered these territories.  They devastated Georgia, the western lands of modern Azerbaijan and Armenia.  In 1724, the Treaty of Constantinople was signed with Porta.  In accordance with it, the sultan recognized the acquisition of the Russian Empire in the Caspian region, and Russia, in turn, recognized his rights in the territory of Western Transcaucasia.  Later relations with the Turks intensified.  To prevent a new war, the Russian government, interested in an alliance with Persia, returned to it all the Caspian territories under the Ganja Treaty and the Rasht Treaty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fedor Matveevich Apraksin" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1245951.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Peter took his campaign on time.  Its success was ensured by a sufficient number of people, ships and guns.  In addition, the Russian Tsar was able to enlist the support of neighbors.  They readily answered his requests.  So, for example, Russian troops were replenished with the Kabardian wars, hired Tatars.  The preparations for the campaign were organized in an organized manner.  She did not generally take so much time.  Of particular importance in the campaign were transport ships.  They ensured uninterrupted supply of provisions.  Of strategic importance were the Russian strategic maneuvers.  Given that the terrain was unfamiliar, they were able to establish control over almost the entire territory.  Big problems could cause the Russians to the Turks.  They put strong pressure on Haji Dawood.  He, in turn, influenced the Bakuis and other rulers.  Nevertheless, even this could not impede the implementation of Peter's plans.  If it were not for the autumn storms in the Caspian Sea, it is quite possible that he would have moved even further.  However, it was decided to return.  Nevertheless, Russian troops remained in the controlled territories.  Several fortresses were established.  In the villages and cities in the management there were Russian officers.  In the territory of the East Caucasus, by the time Peter left for Russia, there was not a single uncontrolled settlement left.  The situation for some mountaineers was complicated by the inaction of the allies.  Some of them might have resisted, but given the inequality of power, they preferred to surrender.  Most of the battles took place bloodless or with minor losses from the Russians.  This was largely due to the fact that the local rulers knew the behavior of Peter with the humble.  If he said that he would not send troops into the surrendered cities on his own, then he kept his promise.  However, the Russians acted rather harshly with those who resisted.  The key moment was the capture of Baku.  With the occupation of the city, the Russians established control over almost the entire coast.  It was the most effective and largest capture.  Against the backdrop of the recent victory in the Northern War, the success of the Persian campaign further exalted the Russian Tsar.  It should also be borne in mind that the emperor carried out active reforms within the country, which involved the Europeanization of the state.  All this combined has made Russia a truly powerful state, whose participation in foreign policy relations has become mandatory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manifesto to the peoples of the Caucasus and Persia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1245952.jpg" width="292"></div>  Peter's campaign in Eastern Transcaucasia ensured unhindered trade to Russian merchants.  The paths were opened again for them, they ceased to bear losses.  The royal treasury also replenished.  The officers who remained in the garrisons and fortresses continued to serve there until the signing of new agreements in 1732 and 1735.  These treaties were necessary for Peter to relieve tension on the borders and prevent clashes with the Turks.
