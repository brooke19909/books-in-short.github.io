    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Guests of the Kaurma Hotel visit the public beach of Dzhemete.  Its main feature is that it is covered with very soft golden sand.  When you first visit this beach, some tourists even get the feeling that they are not in Anapa on the Black Sea, but somewhere on the Spanish or Italian coast. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the <span>beach Dzhemete</span> tourists include its crowded.  Also, the minus of relaxing on the sea in this place, according to vacationers, is a large number of mosquitoes. </p>
