    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The Altai State Reserve began its work a long time ago, on October 7, 1967, when a new protected green area was created on the territory of the reserve, which existed from 1932 to 1951, by decision of local authorities. </p><p>  It should be noted that purely geographically it is located in the <span>mountains of Southern Siberia</span> and covers the Turochak and Ulagan regions of the Altai Republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Altai Nature Reserve boasts an impressive area of ‚Äã‚Äã881,238 hectares. </p><p>  Note that the length of the reserve from southeast to northwest is 230 km, and the width is 30-40 km. </p><h2>  Targets and goals </h2><p>  Altai Nature Reserve was created to achieve very specific goals. </p><p>  We will try to list the most basic: </p><ul><li>  to preserve the most valuable and rare in beauty Teletskoye Lake and its landscapes; </li><li>  protect cedar forests; </li><li>  save the most important hunting and hunting animals that are on the verge of extinction, for example, deer, elk, sable and so on. </li></ul><p>  Also, the main goals of creating this reserve include the desire for a permanent stationary study of the nature of the region as a whole.  The main task of the Altai State Nature Reserve poses the opportunity to ensure, preserve and study: </p><ul><li>  typical and unique ecological systems; </li><li>  the natural course of natural phenomena and processes; </li><li>  genetic fund of flora and fauna; </li><li>  individual species and communities of animals and plants. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Features of local flora </h2><p>  The reserves of the <span>Altai Territory</span> as a whole, as well as the aforementioned territory in particular, are very rich in rare and sometimes even unique plants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most common are tree species such as fir, spruce, larch, birch, <span>cedar, pine.</span>  The real pride is the high-mountain ecologically clean cedar forests. </p><p>  It is difficult to imagine that sometimes the diameter of the cedar tree that has grown here can reach 1.8 meters, despite the fact that its age is even a whopping figure of 400-450 years. </p><p>  In general, the West Altai Reserve is rich and diverse.  It has about 1,500 species of higher plants, 111 mushrooms.  There are 272 species of lichens alone. </p><p>  The reserve contains 668 species of algae known to mankind.  Seven species of lichens from the collection, which the Altai Territory reserves can boast, are listed in the Red Book of Russia.  Such lower plants include a laboria (both reticular and pulmonary), a stick bordered, and others. </p><p>  It is interesting that in this region there is a diverse species composition of animals and plants.  Significant variegation of the vegetation cover is created due to the local variety of climatic and natural-historical conditions, as well as due to the complex terrain with heights, in some places reaching the mark of 3,500 meters. </p><p>  Of the 1,500 species of flora representatives known here, endemics and relics are found.  The reserve‚Äôs area is not only quite impressive, but also very well located: at the junction of the mountain systems of Altai, Tuva and Sayan.  The extremely rich fauna of the reserve is determined by the variety of natural conditions, as well as the complexity of biogeographic boundaries and natural historical development. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Animals of Altai Reserve </h2><p>  One of the main species of fauna living in the Altai taiga is sable.  Cedar tree nuts occupy a significant place in its diet, therefore, the location of this animal in the reserve depends on the distribution of cedar, and these trees have enough Altai Reserve. </p><p>  Among ungulates, maral, <span>reindeer,</span> Siberian roe deer, Siberian goat, Siberian musk deer and mountain ram live here. </p><p>  Maral, a large taiga-mountain deer, is considered the most numerous view of the reserve area.  Like all deer, every year with the beginning of spring he drops his horns, and new ones grow in return.  Young horns are called antlers.  They are of great value as a raw material for medicines. </p><h2>  The rare inhabitants of the reserve </h2><p>  Siberian musk deer are found in the forests of the Altai Reserve.  She has no horns, but there are well-developed fangs on the upper gum.  Their length is approximately 10-12 cm. The musky gland of male musk deer can be used in the manufacture of quality perfumes. </p><p>  This reserve, as well as the <span>Tigirek reserve of the</span> Altai Territory, is famous as a natural habitat for another rather rare animal - the mountain Siberian goat. </p><p>  In the southern side, as well as in the adjacent territory, mountain rams are found in the wild.  True, it should be noted that as a result of the extermination by both predators and humans, there are only a few dozen of these animals left, so they, together with the snow leopard, are listed in the Red Book. </p><p>  Few people know that only about 35 years ago, a wild boar entered the reserve from Tuva.  And today it is already quite common in the territory of this reserve, successfully propagating and gradually increasing in number. </p><p>  Altai Nature Reserve is also considered a home for large predators such as wolf, bear, wolverine and lynx.  The bear lives in the <span>mountains of Altai.</span>  He is extremely mobile and develops a fairly high speed when running.  Before lying down in a den, he accumulates a huge amount of fat, which is considered healing.  In spring evenings, as well as in the morning, bears can be seen grazing on the southern slopes of the mountains, where they eat young shoots. </p>

    <h2>  Reserve structure </h2><p>  At the moment, the Altai Reserve consists of four departments: </p><ul><li>  scientific; </li><li>  environmental education; </li><li>  security; </li><li>  economic. </li></ul><p>  One of the most important functions in the reserve is performed with the help of the security department. </p><p>  The main task of the scientist is to study the natural course of processes in natural complexes located on the territory of the Altai Reserve.  With the help of the scientific staff, research is being carried out in different directions.  Today, the scientific department of the Altai Reserve is actively involved in the study of argali, musk deer, as well as snow leopard. </p><p>  The environmental education sector was created with the aim of creating an understanding of the Russian society of the problem related to the protection of nature and environmental safety.  In this regard, the specialists of the reserve conduct various events not only with the guests of the reserve, but also with the population. </p>

    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  On May 24, 1958, the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR issued an order aimed at restoring this natural park, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich at that time was 914777 hectares. </p><p>  However, in the summer of 1961, the Altai Reserve was again disbanded.  For the period from 1965 to 1967, the scientific community of Siberia raised the question of the need to create such a special security place within the territory of the previously located reserve. </p><p>  On March 24, <span>1967, the</span> Executive Committee of the Altai Regional Council of Workers' Deputies decided to organize a specially protected area in order to preserve the unique natural complex of the Teletsky taiga and Lake Teletskoye. </p>

    <h2>  What to see first? </h2><p>  You can get to the Altai Reserve only from Lake Teletskoye, so you will definitely have the opportunity to get to know and appreciate the so-called Altyn-Kolyu. </p><p>  This lake received its Russian name from the Cossacks, who first appeared here in the 17th century.  The origin of the unusual name is associated with the Altai tribe of teleses living on the lake. </p><p>  There are also interesting routes in the reserve, such as Kholodnoye Lake, Korbu, Kishte and Unapproachable waterfalls. </p><p>  By the way, not everyone knows that the Korbu waterfall is located in the middle of Lake Teletskoye.  It has a well-equipped observation deck and <span>information stands,</span> and its height is 12.5 meters.  This is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the reserve. </p>

    <h2>  Korbu Waterfall </h2><p>  This place is located on the same river Korbu, which flows into Lake Teletskoye.  The entire right bank of the lake is also located in the Altai Reserve. </p><p>  The waterfall forms a cloud of water dust, which constantly hovers around it. </p><p>  Guests of the reserve, located on the spacious observation deck of the waterfall, enjoy magnificent views.  In the winter season, when the river completely freezes, Korbu Falls creates a continuous picturesque ice wall. </p><p>  There is only one way to get to the waterfall: you need to cross the lake with a boat.  This tour is very popular among tourists.  However, there is some danger for travelers arriving at a waterfall on the lake, since there is a chance that the upper or lower course will begin, which sometimes makes the trip almost impossible. </p><p>  Since 1978, Korbu Falls has been in the status of a natural monument. </p>

    <h2>  Kishte Waterfall </h2><p>  This stunning and picturesque place is located on the eponymous river, which flows into Lake Teletskoye on the right bank. </p><p>  The amazing beauty of this waterfall, tourists have the opportunity to enjoy nearby. </p><p>  Note that you can get to the waterfall only with the help of a motorboat, since the pleasure boat does not enter it.  The noise of falling water can be heard even from the lake, therefore, as a matter of fact, it was called Kishte, which in translation means "calling." </p><p>  It also has a second name - Sable.  It should be noted that the waterfall is located on the territory of the Altai Reserve, therefore, in order to visit it, you must have special permission. </p>
