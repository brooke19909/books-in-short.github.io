Every day there are new devices designed to simplify the life of a person.  This article will discuss the Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sho-Me A7-90FHD DVR" class="if uuid-2466561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466561.jpg"></div><h2>  Gadget culture </h2><p>  Residents of large cities spend considerable time daily in traffic jams.  The blame for the imbalance between the pace of car sales and the speed of construction of new roads, freeways and parking spaces. </p><p>  In other words, it becomes crowded with people not only in public transport, but also in their own, when they are on the roadway.  Under such conditions, a high probability of an accident.  And in view of the frequent attempts of the culprit to escape from the scene, it can be difficult to reproduce the details of the incident for trial by law enforcement agencies. </p><p>  Therefore, electronic devices fixing everything that was happening began to be in great demand.  An example is the Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD dashcam.  Thanks to such products, cases of fraud on the roads in the spirit of the nineties came to naught, when the attackers deliberately ‚Äúframed‚Äù under the vehicle in order to obtain a large sum from the victim by extortion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD video recorder will successfully remove the ‚Äúmovie‚Äù, where all details will be visible, as well as the license plate number of possible witnesses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forumpovideoregistratoram.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="screen recorder Sho-Me A7-90FHD" class="if uuid-2466770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2466770.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The model is not cheap, because many people pass by because of the price (see below), perhaps in vain, because the product has a number of useful options.  The design of the Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD includes one camera with a viewing angle of 170 ¬∞, capturing video in a resolution of 2304 √ó 1296 at a frequency of 30 frames per second. </p><p>  Footage is saved in MOV format to a microSD memory card up to 64 gigabytes.  Recording of what is happening is carried out without pauses until the empty seat on the map runs out.  At the same time, loop recording saves videos lasting from 3 to 15 minutes, and not one giant file.  Accordingly, you can not worry about problems with free space on the media. </p><p>  The processor is Ambarella A7LA50D, the diagonal of the device‚Äôs screen is 2.7 ". Power is supplied both from the car‚Äôs network and from the battery, the power of which is 180 mAh. </p><p>  Dimensions 87 √ó 52 √ó 39 mm, that is, the gadget is small in size and will succinctly look on the windshield (mounted on a suction cup). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sho-Me A7-90FHD Complete Recorder Kit" class="if uuid-2466562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466562.jpg"></div><h2>  Shock sensor </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD, it should be noted that the product has one very important function - the G-sensor.  This is an electronic accelerometer, which is designed to determine the time point when the accident occurred. </p><p>  As soon as the increased pressure on the car, coupled with a decrease in speed, is detected, the shock sensor is triggered, and recording of everything that is happening begins.  The file is moved to a special area on the memory card that is protected from erasure, and the coordinates obtained via GPS and GLONASS help determine the location of the vehicle.  Immediately minus: in this model GPS and GLONASS are absent. </p><p>  According to the instructions of Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD, a motion detector is built-in, due to which recording starts only when some events occur in front of the windshield.  This ensures the effective operation of this option in conjunction with the G-sensor. </p><p>  If the car is in the parking lot and another vehicle crashes into it, video recording also automatically starts, as an increase in pressure and an increase in speed (shift from place or worse) are recorded. </p><h2>  How to choose a product </h2><p>  A motorist who has set out to acquire such a device does not always have information about innovative models and their capabilities.  Therefore, the main task assigned to the product is to fix the video, and such that it can be easily distinguished license plate at different times of the day. </p><p>  Those who work by car at night (taxi drivers, couriers, truckers and public transport drivers) are guided by gadgets with WDR - a technology that allows shooting at night (the darkest places are lightened and the light from the lights in the frame is darkened ) </p><p>  Such a "chip" in the Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD is not stated, but there is a shock sensor, which is great for fixing the details of a car accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avito.ru" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sho-Me A7-90FHD DVR is convenient and compact" class="if uuid-2466571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466571.jpg"></div><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  The second thing they pay attention to is of course the price.  And she is rather big: about 10,000-10,500 rubles.  In the Bayonne online store, it was possible to purchase the product for half the price, but there the sale of the goods was completed back in 2016. </p><p>  Since then, the cost has increased, and those who wish have to put aside funds to purchase a much-desired gadget. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  DVR Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD motorists praise for the quality of shooting - corresponds to its name - FullHD.  Many people note the optimal ratio of price and quality, but since such reviews date back to 2016, we are probably talking about a cost of 5,000-6,000 rubles, while similar models from other brands were 2,000-3,000 rubles more expensive. </p><p>  Very flattering and users respond to sound quality.  The viewing angle allows you to fix every little thing, and a reliable mount can withstand sharp movements, especially when you need to turn the camera sideways (to the approached police officer, for example). </p><p>  Summarizing the positive comments, it should be noted the fact of the low price at the time of purchase and attractive appearance.  As of 2018, hardly anyone will take it, because for the money there are more advanced models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forumpovideoregistratoram.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DVR equipment" class="if uuid-2466575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466575.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Sho-Me A7‚Äì90FHD is not ideal, unfortunately, there are more negative comments than positive ones.  Motorists note a mismatch in viewing angle to the stated indicators: it is indicated that 170 ¬∞ is not there, but 140 ¬∞ can very well be.  This is mainly written by owners of AutoExpert DVR-929, who have something to compare with. </p><p>  There are complaints that the model crashed after four weeks of operation, and then completely failed.  After diagnostics in the service center, the product was handed over for repair, and later the buyer was compensated with funds in the amount of the total cost of the gadget. </p><p>  Moreover, the review is not single.  A number of drivers expressed dissatisfaction that the device crashes at the most inopportune moment.  Hangs were observed during video recording.  The REC mark blinked, but the DVR did not respond to anything, and later turned off. </p><p>  Sound problems are also upsetting.  Someone writes that sound and image are at the highest level, while others leave feedback of a diametrically opposite nature.  It is difficult to judge what the reason is: factory defect or different background noise from the owners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ms-autotech.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="compact model Sho-Me A7-90FHD" class="if uuid-2466568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466568.jpg"></div><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that at the moment the cost of the Sho-Me A7-90FHD product is in no way the optimal ratio of price and quality.  For 10 500 rubles.  you can find a more reliable sample. </p><p>  It is important to pay attention to feedback and learn from the mistakes of others.  In addition, it should be understood that for the correct fixation of everything that happens, you need not only a FullHD camera and a G-sensor in the device, but also WDR technology. </p><p>  This three-letter marking on the box will guarantee that the image will not be too dark or excessively bright, since the principle of recording is to maintain the balance of the color scheme.  A well-recorded video will thoroughly recreate the details of an accident. </p>
