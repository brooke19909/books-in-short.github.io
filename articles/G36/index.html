During the years of turmoil, it was burned, rebuilt, and burned again.  He was besieged, visited by saints and queens, escaped from it.  It was a religious community, a fortress, a terrible prison and a scene for one of the most famous episodes in the history of Scotland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.watchmesee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dannottar castle scotland" class="if uuid-3019609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3019609.jpg"></div><h2>  The base of Dunnottar </h2><p>  There may have been prehistoric settlements in Dannottar, but the earliest evidence dates back to the fifth century, when Saint Ninian, the first Christian bishop, a Briton by birth, founded one of the first churches in Pictland on the rock of the same name. </p><p>  Ninian's Church was just one of the many that the first saint of Scotland laid down throughout the country to spread Christianity throughout the north.  This temple was a simple thatched wooden structure. </p><p>  The early Christian center at Dannottar grew and became part of the fort and a small Picts settlement.  At the end of the ninth century, King Donald II defended the fort from the Viking invasion, although he himself was killed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fortress was rebuilt, but it was made not of stone, but of wood.  In 1276, on the site of the Ninian Chapel, a new Norman-style stone church was consecrated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.historichouses.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dannottar Castle Photo" class="if uuid-3019612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3019612.jpg"></div><h2>  History of Dunnottar Castle </h2><p>  The Viking invasion was only the first sad episode in the history of Dannottar.  When Edward I claimed the Scottish throne, this place again aroused interest among the kings. </p><p>  English troops occupied Dunnottar Castle in Scotland, but local forces, led by William Wallace, captured the fortress.  The British took refuge in the church, but an independence activist burned it with soldiers inside and destroyed the castle. </p><p>  In 1336, after the death of Robert I, the British returned.  Eduard Balliol tried to capture the throne with the help of the English troops.  He occupied the castle and almost immediately began to strengthen the defense.  The Scots returned him and burned him to the ground again. </p><p>  By the end of the fourteenth century, Dunnottar Castle belonged to the Kate family, the Great Marishals of Scotland.  Sir William Kate built the first stone defenses, including curtain walls around most of the cliff. </p><p>  King James IV visited Keith in Dannottar in 1503, and his granddaughter Mary, the Scottish Queen, came here twice, in 1562 and 1564.  On the trains she was accompanied by her son, the future Jacob VI.  After becoming king, he returned here in 1580 and spent 10 days here hunting and leading his Privy Council. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1595, a man named John Crichton was sentenced to death for witchcraft and was burned at Dunnottar Castle. </p><p>  Seventh Earl Marishal joined the Conspirators in 1639 and fought with the Marquis of Montrose during the Battle of Aberdeen.  In 1645, Montrose appeared at the head of the royalist army, crossing over to the other side.  He tried to agree, but the count refused to make concessions to his former ally.  Montrose then burned the castle and devastated the entire region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="murrayfoote.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dunnothar castle ruins" class="if uuid-3019611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3019611.jpg"></div><h2>  Symbols of Scotland </h2><p>  But the most dramatic event in the history of Dannottar was yet to come.  Charles II stayed here, trying to take the throne from parliament.  He was crowned in Scone.  During the ceremony, the symbols of the royal power of Scotland were used.  These include the crown, sword and scepter.  They usually returned to Edinburgh Castle for storage, but Oliver Cromwell threatened Edinburgh, so these items were sent to Dannottar for safety.  Cromwell decided to destroy them in the same way as the English crown. </p><p>  Earl Marishal was captured, so the defense of Dannottar was entrusted to Sir George Ogilvy of Barras.  In September 1651, British troops appeared at the gates of the fortress and organized a long siege. </p><p>  The garrison of 69 people lasted the whole winter.  By May 1652, Dunnottar Castle was the only place in Scotland where the royal flag was still flying.  But the British brought heavy guns and fired at the castle for 10 days.  Finally, after a siege lasting only 8 months, Ogilvy surrendered Dannottar Castle to the people of Cromwell. </p><h2>  Where were the symbols of the crown </h2><p>  The symbols of the crown were hidden right under the nose of the English army.  And the people of Cromwell searched as they could, but did not find anything. </p><p>  There are several versions.  According to one of them, the British allowed Mrs. Granger, the wife of the Minister at Kinnef, which is a few miles from the coast, to enter the castle.  Then she carried everything out under her skirts. </p><p>  According to another version, they were sent down the cliffs in a basket to Mrs. Granger's maid, who pretended to collect seaweed off the coast.  In any case, the symbols of the Scottish crown were securely hidden first at the Grangers, and then secretly buried in a church in Kinnief under the floor near the altar. </p><p>  The British were furious and staged a rout in the castle.  The chapel was destroyed, and the Ogilvy family was imprisoned.  Mrs. Ogilvy died of abuse, but Sir George survived without revealing the place where the crown, sword and scepter were hidden. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.omair-khan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="inside the castle of Dunnothar" class="if uuid-3019610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3019610.jpg"></div><h2>  Whig Storage </h2><p>  But this was not the last chapter in the history of Dunnottar Castle, a photo of which is given in the article.  Although the fortress was in ruins and the large hall was destroyed, what was left was enough for the castle to still be used as a barracks.  In 1685, religious unrest was in full swing, and authorities brutally suppressed the Presbyterians. </p><p>  One hundred and sixty-seven men and women who refused to accept the new prayer book and acknowledge the supremacy of the king in spiritual matters were sent to Dannottar and buried in a damp, dark cellar, which has since become known as the Whig Shelter.  There they were kept in terribly cramped, unsanitary conditions for 5 weeks, until the end of June. </p><p>  Some of the Whigs surrendered and took the oath of allegiance.  Others tried to run away;  25 succeeded, but 15 of them were returned.  Two died during an attempt to descent.  The rest went to the West Indies, but died on the way or on arrival.  A simple covenant stone memorial stands in a cemetery in the parish church of Dunnottar, on the outskirts of Stonehaven. </p><p>  Currently, visitors can go down to the Whig Shelter and marvel at how any of the conspirators could survive in such a dark, damp, cramped room. </p><p>  In 1695, the ninth Earl Marishal managed to return Dannottar to the Katam.  But after 44 years of existence as a barracks, the castle was no longer a suitable home for the family.  Then the tenth Earl Marishal made a fatal mistake;  he joined the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1715, supporting Jacob VII (II).  As a result, both were forced to flee to France. </p><p>  George I seized his land holdings, including Dannottar.  The castle was sold to a York construction company that took it apart.  Many years later, Kate returned Dannottar, but it was not until 1925 that any serious efforts were made to preserve the historical landmark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picturesboss.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dannottar castle story" class="if uuid-3019670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/3019670.jpg"></div><h2>  Visit </h2><p>  Today, tourists can visit a number of buildings, including the remains of the chapel and the count's hall, stables, a forge, a warehouse, barracks and a stone house or tower built earlier.  And you can also visit the Whig Shelter and the restored living room.  However, almost all buildings are in ruins and without a roof, with the exception of the living room. </p><p>  But the photo of Dunnottar Castle in Scotland (Great Britain) shows that this is the most memorable and romantic place that you can imagine.  In both directions, you can take walks along the rocks, you can go down to the shore from the eastern side of the cape to enjoy a beautiful view of the rock. </p>
