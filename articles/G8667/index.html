Therefore, rest here is respectable, one might say, aristocratic, without fuss.  The beaches of Abu Dhabi top the cleanest and most comfortable on the globe.  Hotels for sea vacations are not lower than four stars, and all the "three stars" are in the city center, and they come there on a business trip.  Therefore, the best options for all network lines are open here.  Let's see what a beach vacation in Abu Dhabi is and where to live in order to relax in comfort.  Well, if not like <span>Arab sheikhs,</span> then almost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abu dhabi beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2146872.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Abu Dhabi beaches </h2><p>  Almost all along the coast of this emirate, you will find exceptionally small coral sand, velvety to the touch and known for the fact that it does not get hot from the sun.  The beaches here are considered ideal if you come with small children.  No stones, the entrance to the water is comfortable, gentle, there are no pits or drops of depth.  Swimming is completely safe.  The most popular and easily accessible is Central Beach.  You can come here by car or by public transport.  There are several free sites.  The two most popular beaches located outside the city are Al-Rahah and the coast of Bahrain.  Let's take a virtual tour of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cornish Abu Dhabi Beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2146891.jpg"></div>

We can say that it is a continuous park zone ten kilometers long.  Gardens, lawns, alleys, palm trees, even tropical plants - all this is irrigated with fresh water.  Among the green foliage there are many clubs, fountains, cafes, playgrounds.  Here are the most beautiful fountains in Abu Dhabi.  And chic skyscrapers are built along the entire length of the embankment, which makes the sea line even more picturesque.  People here walk, ride bicycles and roller skates, relax, drink coffee.  There is also one of the public beaches of Abu Dhabi - Cornish.  It starts from the hotel's club and stretches to Ittihad Square.  Its length is 4 kilometers.  The beach is popular, there are up to 50 thousand visitors every month.  There are paid zones and public ones for family people and women.  This is the first beach in the Middle East to be awarded the <span>Blue Flag.</span>  In the paid area there are showers, changing cabins, umbrellas and tents for relaxing.  The public beach is open around the clock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star beach hotels in abu dhabi" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2146969.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Al Rahi Coast </h2><p>  This Abu Dhabi beach is located half an hour from the city, along the road connecting the capital of the UAE and Dubai.  There are paid sections on it, the entrance costs 10 dirhams (180 rubles).  Here, almost everything is the same as in Cornish: sand, blue water, comfort.  There are simply fewer people than in the center.  The beach is state-owned, but the emirate‚Äôs authorities plan to build a promenade here, which is rumored to surpass Cornish in all respects.  Yes, and now new hotels, shopping centers and restaurants are being built there.  Those who wish can take a look at the world's first skyscraper in the form of a sphere - Aidar building.  He also stands on the coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bahrain island </h2><p>  Until recently, these places were protected areas.  And of course, tourists were not allowed there.  And now this is another luxurious resort and beach of Abu Dhabi.  It consists of a landscaped area and wild areas where you can come all day with a family or company.  The resort area has a lot of entertainment, beach and water.  There is even a nature reserve with chamois and gazelles that graze in the wild.  And on the many kilometers of sand dunes that stretch across the island, you may not even meet a single person.  People who prefer a secluded vacation can not find a better place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels first line beach abu dhabi" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2146972.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels in Abu Dhabi, on the first line </h2><p>  Many complexes of this kind are located on the Corniche promenade.  First-line beach hotels in Abu Dhabi are among the most expensive in the country, if not in the world.  Take, for example, the Sheraton Resort and Towers.  This hotel is located right on the sea, from which only a park area will separate its territory.  The hotel rooms are suites and junior suites.  All are air-conditioned, have satellite TV with a Russian channel and gorgeous views of the sea.  Many rooms are located in the so-called towers. </p><p>  In general, the territory of the hotel resembles a mini-town.  There are shops, and discos, and playgrounds, and sports entertainment, and even its own diving center.  But at the same time, all shopping centers are within walking distance.  And upon check-in, you will be served a fruit basket and a bottle of wine.  At the very exit to the Cornish Beach is the Hilton Hotel.  This is ten floors of a snow-white building.  The hotel's pool has a direct view of the bay.  All the suites of this hotel are equipped with kitchens, and guests on the Executive floor have access to a special lounge where they can enjoy free drinks in the bar all day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abu Dhabi hotels with private beach 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2146937.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Are there any hotels in Abu Dhabi with their own beach (5 stars)? </h2><p>  Of course, only a positive answer can be given to such a question.  Many of these hotels are located far from the center, on the islands.  For example, Golden Tulip Al Jazeera in Gangut.  Its territory is so huge that the distance from the main building, which is located at the artificial sea canal, and the bungalows, located directly on the 800-meter beach in the Persian Gulf, is more than a kilometer.  Between them there are minibuses every hour.  Near the main building there is a disco, a coffee house decorated as a Bedouin tent, and restaurants.  Bungalows have a bedroom, dining room and kitchen.  And the suites in the main building are each located on their own floor, have their own elevator and a balcony with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 meters to enjoy the sunset. </p><p>  But the most luxurious hotel in Abu Dhabi (5 stars, with a beach) is the Emirates Palace, which belongs to the Kempinski chain.  He ranks among the most expensive hotels in the world.  Its building itself is a wonderful Arab palace, as if from a fairy tale.  It is decorated with golden domes and spiers, and a real oasis is spread around.  All rooms are equipped with the latest ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù technology, which allows interactive control of all household appliances.  The beach of the Emirates Hotel lies one and a half kilometers.  It is also covered by the Wi-Fi zone.  The hotel complex has a huge library and a fund of films that can be used online.  This service is also connected to the beach.  Guests can dine in 20 restaurants and view the city and surroundings from a helicopter.  For this, a special platform is installed on the roof. </p>
