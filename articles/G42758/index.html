Over the entire history of its existence, the city has repeatedly experienced the hardships of hostilities, troops were held here and battles were fought with the <span>Crimean Tatars.</span>  The modern sights of Orel have largely preserved the memory of past times and military operations in the district. </p><p>  This city was founded as a fortress at the confluence of two rivers.  The favorable climate and large fertile lands made its surroundings attractive for the lives of many noblemen.  The main attractions of Orel are the apartment museums and estates of famous and talented writers who have made a great contribution to the development of literature. </p>

They remained steep and steep, with city beaches and tree planting, giving a picturesque view to all the surroundings.

    <p>  The main <span>attractions of Oryol</span> can begin to be seen from the place of the city.  Currently, there is a small square with a memorial.  It was installed in honor of the 400th anniversary of the city.  The key dates in the history of the Eagle are carved on it.  Not far from this memorial place is the oldest temple in the city.  Initially, the Epiphany Cathedral was a wooden building, but it was destroyed during a fire.  After that, the cathedral was built of stone.  At the moment, it is one of the oldest stone buildings in the city of Oryol.  Sights, whose photos are striking in their beauty, include an ancient carved iconostasis.  This cathedral is also famous for its icons, many of which are considered miraculous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
