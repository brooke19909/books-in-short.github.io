The structure of this payment did not include such components: social, compensation and incentive contributions.  When <span>paying wages, a</span> prerequisite was to be observed.  It consisted in the fact that the base salaries, <span>tariff rates</span> used in the process of calculating the monthly salary, special rates used in calculating the payment of non-standard types of work, could not be lower than the minimum wage.  Subsequently, due to changes in domestic legislation, the main of which were reflected in the Federal Law No. 54 of 04/20/2007, this condition was excluded from the Labor Code. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The impact of "minimum wage" on base rates </h2><p>  Speaking about what the minimum wages are, a number of important points contained in the legislation should be mentioned.

    <h2>  How is the minimum set? </h2><p>  Consider what is 1 minimum wage and how it is approved.  The establishment of a minimum <span>wage</span> value in a particular subject of the Russian Federation for each organization is divided into several stages. </p><ul><li>  At the first stage, an agreement of regional significance is developed on the minimum maximum allowable amount of deductions for wages in the subject.  After that, the regional commission (tripartite) on the regulation of social labor relations carries out the development and conclusion of an agreement.  What are minimum wages in subjects?
