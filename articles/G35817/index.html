    <p>  However, there are clients who are dissatisfied with the quality of the institution.  Some say that people who arrived at the hotel in order to celebrate the wedding, prevented other guests from sleeping and relaxing with loud music.  There are also clients who are not satisfied with the lack of items that provide comfort in the rooms (water cooler, tea, coffee, window screens to protect against insects).  In addition, some complain that the living quarters are not warm enough and sometimes there are problems with plumbing equipment.  People were also unhappy with the malfunctions of the wireless Internet.  Visitors were disappointed by the lack of refrigerators in rooms and a grocery store near the hotel complex.  In addition, the rental of sports equipment seemed some too expensive service. </p>
