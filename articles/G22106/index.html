And this is not at all surprising, because this country, first of all, is an object of sheer delight, and you can talk about it for a long time without a break. </p><p>  True, at the same time it is very difficult to choose colors that can convey at least a fraction of the emotions caused by capes, rocks and bays of the west coast.  Yes, try it yourself, returning from an unforgettable journey, to describe the sound of the surf, the beauty of the plains of Alentejo or the grape valleys of the Douro, the smell of fried sardines in Porto, the music of fado or the breath of the wind soaked in Arab exoticism in the Algarve.  But these are just small strokes for a wonderful picture called Portugal!  To visit here means to visit another - bright and unforgettable world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Portugal sea holidays" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/476247.jpg" width="400"></div>

Not for nothing, this season is becoming increasingly popular among vacationers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, at the beginning of autumn, the country celebrates perhaps the most important holiday - grape harvesting.

    <h2>  Where can I stay in the Algarve? </h2><p>  For a truly luxurious vacation that meets all the canons, Algarve hotels are perfect.  Portugal <strong> </strong>  It offers literally everything that, according to the average tourist, a resort town should have.  Hotels in the southern part of the country are an excellent service, a wide selection of entertainment and comfort. </p><p>  Most of them have their own pools; rooms usually have furnished terraces for sunbathing, air conditioning, televisions and hair dryers.  Daily cleaning, free continental breakfasts, shops and restaurants on site will complement the list of services provided by the resort.  Agree that such a set is unlikely to leave indifferent any of the vacationers, as evidenced by many enthusiastic reviews. </p><p>  Of course, the choice of a hotel is an important component of any holiday.  In the Algarve, each of them is unique in its own way, as it tries to attract tourists.  But all hotels are united by a special cordiality and comfort that greets each of the guests: well-groomed territory, spacious rooms, and honeymooners who spend their honeymoon also have bouquets of flowers. </p><h2>  Meet Madeira! </h2><p>  A map of Portugal with resorts and amazing places to visit will be incomplete if you do not mention another wonderful place of this country - the island of Madeira.  The Portuguese call it the place of endless spring.  It smells of forest, fish, honey and flowers.  The sky above it is devoid of clouds, and the whole island looks like a huge outlandish garden. </p><p>  The capital of this autonomous region of Portugal - the city of Funchal - descends in a huge amphitheater from the mountains directly onto the ocean.  There are several famous botanical gardens in and around the city, including an orchid garden.  And if you climb the cable car to the top of Monte, then your eyes wide open with delight will see a stunning picture: a city hugging the ocean.  By the way, you can go downstairs on wicker sledges, which for many years served as almost the only means of transportation for local residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Portugal in August" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/476287.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Madeira </h2><p>  By the way, every year in early May, the island hosts a carnival of flowers - an amazing holiday, which attracts tourists from all over the world.  And for those who appreciate wine, the island will offer its drink, timeless - Madeira. </p><p>  That's just the concept of "beach" vacation on this island is very arbitrary.  Since it is of volcanic origin and rises above the ocean, it has almost no slopes.  The beaches in Madeira are mainly replaced with special concrete platforms with ladders descending into the ocean.  But you can still, traveling around the island, find wonderful little beaches with sand heated by the sun. </p><p>  For those who love hiking, Madeira is a true paradise: the landscapes are breathtaking and ask for your camera, and the air is so clean and healthy that you want to breathe it for the future!  No matter what Portugal offers you in this fabulous place - sea holidays or land travels - believe me, all this will be great! </p><h2>  You will be welcomed by all of Portugal </h2><p>  Yes, however, what can we talk about if all of Portugal is one of the oldest resorts in Europe.  Here you can find hotels that are more than 100 years old!  Of course, they look like palaces, for example, Reid`s Palace 5 * deluxe (Madeira Island) or Olissippo Lara Palace 5 * (Lisbon).  Their walls are decorated with paintings by famous masters and portraits of celebrities who revered hotels with their attention. </p><p>  The highlight, the local ‚Äúknow-how‚Äù are the former estates and architectural monuments turned into hotels.  In this way, Portugal managed to preserve them, and even to receive annual profits from the ‚Äúpots‚Äù that were restored using the most modern technical achievements (such hotels are called in this country). </p><p>  True, and ultramodern hotels are in no less demand here.  Their base is constantly updated and updated.  So the choice is yours! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Portugal map with resorts" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/476303.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Vacations can be very varied. </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that entertainment in Portugal is very diverse, and you do not have to rack your brains on how to spend the next day.  Theaters, halls of classical or modern music, all kinds of festivals, shows open their doors to tourists eager for cultural relaxation. </p><p>  In tourist organizations, as a rule, monthly calendars of cultural events are published, which helps visitors to navigate this abundance of offers. </p><p>  So, for example, one of the major international events is the Algarve Summer Festival, in which music groups and performers, famous throughout the world, are involved.  One cannot but note the Portuguese carnivals dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the saints.  The best of them takes place in the Algarve, and thousands of people strive here to become part of this multicolor, which will last for three days. </p><h2>  Portuguese bullfighting </h2><p>  Describing holidays in Portugal in September, one can not help but mention bullfighting.  From spring to autumn in the cities of Santarem, Corusa and Vila Franca di Shira annual fairs are held with a unique spectacle - bullfighting. </p><p>  You can immediately notice that in Portugal, bulls are not killed in the arena.  In this country, the sight mentioned is primarily a demonstration of courage, dexterity and excellent dressage.  By the way, there is another feature in the Portuguese bullfight, there are no professional toreros in it.  In the arena in their role you will see ordinary clerks, waiters and workers. </p><h2>  The most western coast </h2><p>  This country even stands out on the map, showing the whole world its individuality, dissimilarity to the rest, an old and so understandable Europe.  Turning away from the continent, Portugal peers into the Atlantic Ocean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Portugal sea" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/476314.jpg" width="457"></div>

    <p>  Holidays at sea here can not be imagined without a visit to Cape of Rock - the westernmost point of Europe.  By the way, tourists who have been here are given a certificate of this. </p><p>  In this place, on a commemorative stella, standing on the shore, the words: "Here the earth ends and the ocean begins" are written down, belonging to the great Portuguese poet Comuens.  But the truth is, the person standing on the cape will be the last in Europe to see the setting sun!  Can you imagine? </p><h2>  And goodbye, Sintra </h2><p>  Eighteen kilometers from the poetic region of Europe is the beautiful old city of Sintra - the summer residence of the kings.  This is perhaps the most visited place in Portugal by tourists. </p><p>  Royal palaces, filled with exciting secrets and fascinating stories, monasteries, miraculous parks, fortresses, golden beaches of the Atlantic, and just observation platforms with amazing views - this is just a small list of attractions of this coastal city. </p><p>  Incidentally, despite the small number of inhabitants (there are just over 30,000 in Sintra), the city is the recognized cultural capital of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="entertainments in Portugal" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/476293.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Who said that Portugal is a vacation at sea and nothing more? </h2><p>  In Sintra, an old tram that carries passengers from the beginning of the last century will deliver you to the coast, to the desired beach.  But do not immediately rush onto the silky sand!  After all, you still need to see the Castle of the Moors, the Pena Palace, the amazing mysterious park of the Quinta de Regaleira estate, conceived as the embodiment of paradise on earth, the Capuchin monastery and the Monserat Palace. </p><p>  But that is not all!  Can you imagine?  And after all, we are talking only about one city!  And how many places requiring a mandatory visit in this beautiful, unusual country, which has mixed exotic beauty with European restraint!  No, you understand, you cannot go here once.  It is necessary to come to this country again and again.  And only then it will be possible to say: "I know something about Portugal!" </p>
