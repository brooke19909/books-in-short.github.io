What features does this technique have and what should I look for when choosing? </p><p>  There are many varieties of video cameras, but how to choose a really suitable model?  What characteristics to look for and which manufacturer to choose?  Consider the features of the technique and the recommendations of specialists about which video camera is better to buy? </p><h2>  Types of Camcorders </h2><p>  All camcorders can be divided into several groups depending on their technical characteristics and purpose. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pt.aliexpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://pt.aliexpress.com/store/product/D7200-Digital-VideoCamera-33MPcamera-digital-Home-Camera-24X-Optical-Zoom-Camera-Plus-LED-Headlamps-free-Shipping/1390826_32791575067.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Varieties of Camcorders" class="if uuid-2335631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2335631.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Amateur cameras. </li></ul><p>  They are compact, easy to use and are in the middle price category.  With these devices you can shoot family holidays, travels, events from life or record incidents.  They do not take up much space, so they can be easily taken with you on the road.  Most amateur camcorders are manually configured and have several shooting options. </p><ul><li>  Professional devices. </li></ul><p>  Many people ask: what is better to buy a camcorder for high-quality shooting?  Experts recommend considering the purchase of a professional analogue.  Such devices can be used both for shooting at home, and for shooting video for television or a blog on the Youtube channel.  They are distinguished by great functionality, different shooting modes, all kinds of parameters that are manually configured.  Often such cameras are equipped with high-resolution matrices, a microphone for high-quality sound recording and interchangeable options.  They also differ in larger size than amateur counterparts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Action camcorders. </li></ul><p>  This is a separate type of device that is gaining more and more popularity every year, especially among people who are involved in an active sport.  These cameras can shoot good quality video in extreme conditions or with a constantly moving dynamic picture.  Most often they are used in motor sports, with high-speed descents from the mountains on skis or bicycles, during parachute jumps or bridges.  Cameras are small in size, not subject to moisture or mechanical damage.  In addition, they can easily be attached to some equipment dressed for a person.  The lens that this camcorder has is wide-angle, so it allows you to convey the full range of emotions in dynamic shooting. </p><ul><li>  3D cameras. </li></ul><p>  They have two built-in lenses that allow you to shoot video for later viewing in 3D.  Most often, there is no such need for home shooting.  In addition, many cameras can be supplemented with the 3D option if necessary and for a fee. </p><h2>  How to determine the model of the camcorder? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pt.aliexpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://pt.aliexpress.com/store/product/D7200-Digital-VideoCamera-33MPcamera-digital-Home-Camera-24X-Optical-Zoom-Camera-Plus-LED-Headlamps-free-Shipping/1390826_32791575067.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Compact devices" class="if uuid-2335642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2335642.jpg"></div><p>  Everyone is worried about the question: which is better to buy a camcorder for home and what to look for when buying?  But before choosing a model or type of camera, you need to decide what it is for.  After all, the market has a lot of different models with various options, so here you can get confused as a beginner or a professional. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of the choice: </h2><ul><li>  We determine what a video camera is for. </li></ul><p>  If shooting is needed only for amateur home videos, then bulky professional devices are not needed.  If a person buys a camera with the hope that in the future he will become a professional blogger or videographer at gala and other events, then it is worth considering more professional models. </p><ul><li>  Where will the captured video be played? </li></ul><p>  If the video will be watched on a home computer or an ordinary TV, then there is no need for high-resolution cameras, and often these are professional models.  If this is a smart TV with a higher screen resolution, then it is worth taking a closer look at more expensive models that provide high-quality shooting. </p><ul><li>  Where will the shooting take place? </li></ul><p>  Before deciding which one is better to buy a video camera for high-quality shooting, it is worthwhile to understand where the main shooting location will take place.  This can be at home, on the street, on the road or during active travel, as well as night shooting - the type of video camera that is required directly depends on these factors. </p><ul><li>  Frequency of use and duration of the video. </li></ul><p>  Depending on how often you plan to use the camera, as well as how long the video will be, the device class is selected.  For home shooting with occasional use, an amateur model is quite suitable.  But before you decide, it is worthwhile to study the parameters of the selected model, on which both the quality and the maximum duration of the shooting depend. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When familiarizing yourself with the parameters, you need to pay attention to the resolution of the matrix, the type of image stabilizer, the presence of the shooting option in the dark and autoflash, the optics and the approximation quality of the video. </p><h2>  Important camcorder options </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.omnicoreagency.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-entry-level-dslr-cameras/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Professional or amateur?" class="if uuid-2335659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2335659.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the purchase to be successful and to be sure which cameras are better to buy, you still need to know the options in the device - important, priority and necessary. </p><ul><li>  Matrix or megapixels? </li></ul><p>  You should not choose a camcorder with a large number of megapixels, image quality does not depend on them, but on the characteristics and features of the matrix.  The larger its extension, the higher the video quality. </p><ul><li>  Optics. </li></ul><p>  Today, there are many types of video cameras, regardless of price category, which are equipped with a good lens with high-quality optics.  But which camcorder is best for home?  Zoom over 10x for amateur home shooting is not needed, moreover, if the camera has an optical stabilizer.  A five-fold increase is a perfectly optimal solution.  Here the "wide-angle" of the lens is of greater importance, that is, what angle of space it can cover. </p><ul><li>  Video finder. </li></ul><p>  Well suited for shooting in sunny weather, but expensive models have this option.  The optimal focus option is from 30 to 35 mm. </p><ul><li>  Battery. </li></ul><p>  The most important element of every device.  The duration of the camera‚Äôs operation without recharging directly depends on its quality and characteristics.  Experts recommend that before deciding which digital video camera is better, familiarize yourself with the battery parameters.  If necessary, stock up on extra. </p><ul><li>  Microphone input. </li></ul><p>  All camcorders come with a microphone and record fairly high-quality sound.  But in order to do, for example, reporting or making concerts, it is worth paying attention to the fact that if necessary a stereo microphone is connected to the camera, for which an additional input is required. </p><ul><li>  3D video support. </li></ul><p>  This option goes more as an additional, rather than the main one.  If necessary, you can supplement your camera with such functionality, but it is not very popular for amateur home shooting.  Therefore, the answer to the question of which is better to buy a camcorder for the home, will be not so much additional functions as the device‚Äôs capabilities. </p><ul><li>  Floodlight. </li></ul><p>  A camera equipped with an LED flashlight is a good option for shooting video at night or in a dark room.  But for this you need to make sure whether it can be used when shooting video or just photos.  In addition, the built-in spotlight illuminates only 1-2 m, which may not be quite enough. </p><h2>  Optics and Scaling: Features </h2><p>  Optics is the most important feature in any device for shooting video.  Therefore, before answering the question which video camera is better to buy, it is worth knowing its features.  Image quality, and accordingly, the quality of shooting depends directly on the optics and scalability. </p><p>  Well-known camcorder manufacturers equip their equipment with professional lenses that have good zoom quality and magnification.  If you need to shoot video from home distance in home shooting and so that it does not lose quality, you should choose high-quality optics.  If this is not necessary, a three- or five-fold increase in the image is an acceptable characteristic of the optics, and at the same time at an affordable price for the model itself. </p><h2>  Interfaces and Equipment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="liberty-intl.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://liberty-intl.org/2017/01/how-the-government-broke-all-digital-cameras/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Camera tripod" class="if uuid-2335650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2335650.jpg"></div><p>  The answer to the question which mini-video camera is better will be a mix of all kinds of parameters, where the interface and equipment are of great importance.  The most convenient interface in the home camera is USB.  The option makes it easy to transfer the captured video to a computer or laptop.  LANC - needed when the camera is planned to be controlled remotely.  So that no one copied the video and the image was not lost when transferring the image, it is worth considering the HDMI image. </p><p>  To transfer high-resolution video, the HD-SDI interface is used, but the transmission speed is low.  In addition, the camera may have a headphone input in order to view and listen to video in a noisy room. </p><p>  The camcorder can be equipped with an LCD screen to see the features of the image directly during shooting.  The flash allows you to shoot in the dark, and an option such as PictBridge eliminates the need to transfer the captured video, since everything happens automatically. </p><p>  An interchangeable lens, a remote control or a lighting lamp are additional equipment options for the camcorder, which are usually not needed at home. </p><h2>  Flash memory or hard drive: which is better? </h2><p>  In order to make a quality purchase and know which is better to buy a digital video camera, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the features of the device‚Äôs memory.  The best storage device for information on the device is solid state memory.  It can be in the form of a memory card or built directly into the camcorder. </p><p>  But there is also a storage medium in the form of an HDD.  Its distinctive feature is the ability to store a large amount of information, but devices with this type of memory are more sensitive to shaking and sudden movements when shooting. </p><p>  The most optimal memory size is 32 GB, but you need to make sure that it is possible to increase the built-in or removable memory in the camcorder. </p><h2>  Which camcorder to buy a blogger on Youtube? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="whatphotographygear.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://whatphotographygear.com/cameras/8-best-cameras-for-macro-photography.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Panoramic shooting" class="if uuid-2335689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2335689.jpg"></div><p>  Before deciding which one is best to buy a digital video camera, it is worth clearly indicating the purpose of its use.  Blogging on the Youtube portal is a fairly common activity in recent years in people of different age categories.  Depending on the topic of the blog, you may need a different modification of the camcorder. </p><p>  Buying initially expensive equipment is not worth it, especially if a person is new to his business.  For video, an amateur camera for home shooting is well suited.  Perhaps at first you can use a smartphone in order to understand the intricacies of the case. </p><p>  Action cameras are suitable for maintaining a dynamic blog, but if a person plans to shoot only in a calm or home environment, then it is easier to use more budgetary and easier to manage modifications. </p><p>  Which portable camcorder is better to buy?  Experts recommend at the first stages to give preference to models Sony RX100 Mark IV, <span>Sony RX100</span> Mark III, Panasonic Lumix GH4 or Panasonic G7.  They are compact, comfortable, have all the necessary functionality, but the sound will have to be recorded separately.  If you plan to shoot not only video, but also good quality photos, then the Canon 80D model with a built-in microphone is a great solution. </p><p>  Mandatory in the camcorder for blogging, even when shooting at home, support for 4K.  This option allows video editing without quality loss, but a powerful computer is required. </p><h2>  Action camera or conventional? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTEquzzR_wk"><img itemprop="image" alt="Professional camcorder" class="if uuid-2335663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2335663.jpg"></div><p>  Many people wonder which camcorder is better to buy - action or normal for home use.  Often amateur and simple devices are chosen for the home.  But if the family leads an active lifestyle or plans to shoot a certain dynamic video sequence, then you cannot do without a compact action camera. </p><p>  The advantage of an action camera is its mobility.  In order to attach it to any place, there are all kinds of belts, suction cups, Velcro and additional accessories.  It is worth paying attention to the quality of fasteners.  The camcorder must hold firmly and securely in a specific place. </p><p>  Regarding the quality of a conventional camera and action modifications, it all depends on the selected device model.  A dynamic picture can also be on an amateur camera with good optics and wide resolution.  Action cameras also increase the viewing angle of space, that is, when shooting on such a device, more elements fall into the frame. </p><p>  Tips on which camcorder to choose in a car, or consumer reviews suggest that an action camera is better in this case.  In addition, the quality of dynamic shooting will be many times higher, and the viewing angle is much wider.  This may be necessary in certain cases.  For home and simple shooting, you should not overpay, from a number of amateur cameras you can find an excellent option for properties and characteristics. </p><h2>  The best camcorders and their characteristics </h2><p>  To finally decide which camcorder is better to buy, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the features of the most popular models on the market. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Panasonic HC-V760 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  20x optical zoom allows you to shoot a high-quality picture, even if it is quite far away.
