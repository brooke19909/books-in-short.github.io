By the way, in the famous ski resort Saw are constantly training the Italian team. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.7388878" data-lng="7.426186599999937" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/1/5/8/12158.png"></div><p>  However, in this small town you can not only ski, Aosta in Italy is famous for its beautiful landscapes and ancient history. </p><h2>  Arch of Augustus </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gates of Augustus in Aosta" class="if uuid-2979680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2979680.jpg"></div><p>  The first human settlements on the site of modern Aosta have been known since prehistoric times. </p><p>  Back in 1158 BC, the ruler of the Salassian tribe living on this earth founded the first city.  However, he did not last long.  The city and its inhabitants stood in the way of the warlike Roman Empire, seeking to conquer the lands of Gaul.  Not wanting to endure the disobedience of the barbarians, Emperor Augustus ordered the demolition of the town from the face of the earth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In honor of this victory, a triumphal arch was built, perfectly preserved to this day.  Arch of Augustus in Aost is made in the form of a gate of huge stone blocks.  Its height is slightly higher than 11 meters, a commemorative inscription in honor of the victory of Augustus is stamped over the vault.  Historians believe that the gate was built back in 25 BC, and since then has undergone restoration only once, at the beginning of the XIV century. </p><p>  On the site of the ruined city, the Romans quickly built a new one, named Augusta Pretoria Salassorum.  So in the name the names of the winner and the vanquished are combined. </p><p>  To this day, the central part of the town of Aosta in Italy has retained the original Roman layout, when the two main streets divide the settlement area into four parts and are blown out to the main gate. </p><h2>  Ancient ruins and bridge </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The ruins of the Roman theater" class="if uuid-2979686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2979686.jpg"></div><p>  History buffs will surely appreciate a walk through this ancient city.  A huge number of historical buildings have survived here, from ancient times to the romantic Middle Ages. </p><p>  The ruins of the Roman theater have been preserved very close to the famous Praetorian gate erected by the warlike conquerors.  These ruins look very picturesque against the backdrop of high mountains and the azure Italian sky.  This theater, which housed about 4,000 spectators, was once the center of the city‚Äôs public life.  Nowadays, part of the back wall with powerful stone arches, some parts of the stage and the steps of the auditorium have been preserved from it.  Today, the annual Christmas Market is held here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The massive and still reliable Ponte Romano Bridge was also built during the Roman Empire.  Now there is no water under the bridge, the river has long changed its course, but it itself will stand still for many years. </p><p>  An interesting monument of antiquity is the Ancient Roman Villa della Consolata.  It was discovered relatively recently, in 1971.  From this building of the 1st century BC, the remains of the mosaic floor and heating system are preserved.  Although at one time it was a large complex of a mansion and outbuildings. </p><h2>  Castles and Cathedrals </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nidski.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aosta ski resort in Italy" class="if uuid-2979398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2979398.jpg"></div><p>  Probably one of the most beautiful medieval castles of the province is located in the suburbs of Aosta in Italy.  They were erected in places leading to alpine passes, which allowed owners to charge a fee from travelers passing by. </p><p>  Since then, the castles from the fortifications were transformed into the dwellings of the Italian nobility, like the castles of Ussel and Verre.  And the recently restored Fenis, once the former residence of the Shallan family, is ready to reveal the secrets of chivalry to guests.  It completely restored medieval interiors, you can see the arms and dining halls, as well as frescoes dating from 1425-1430. </p><p>  The building of the Cathedral, one of the many medieval monuments in Aosta in Italy, was built in the XI century.  It is known that earlier on this place was also a beautiful functioning church.  The cathedral contains countless religious artifacts, and its interior is fully consistent with the high status of the temple.  The mosaic floor has been preserved here, and the atrium is decorated with terracotta figurines and frescoes.  The windows of the cathedral are still decorated with colored stained-glass windows made by masters of the 15th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Paradise for skiers and snowboarders </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ansa.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lift to the resort of Pyla" class="if uuid-2979775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2979775.jpg"></div><p>  In this small province, as many as 23 ski resorts are concentrated.  Choosing where it is better to go to Italy in winter, you should choose one of them, focusing on the complexity of the tracks and your own level of training. </p><p>  It is most conveniently located in the provincial capital, Aosta, from where it is very comfortable to get to any resort.  A panoramic cable car and an indoor ski lift leads directly to the resort of Pyla from the city.  The multi-kilometer road is open for skiers all year round, and the rise time will take only 18-20 minutes. </p><p>  Yes, and to the rest of the ski resorts near Aosta in Italy, it will be quite easy to get there either by car or by bus. </p><p>  There are many worthy places for skiing in this region - Cervinia, La Thuile, Courmayeur, Champorsche.  At all there are tracks with different levels of difficulty and experienced instructors who can help beginners.  Let's try to figure out how these popular resorts differ from each other. </p><h2>  For the daring and courageous </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.blanketbay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heli-ski on the slopes of the mountains" class="if uuid-2979901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2979901.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing tours to <span>ski resorts,</span> it is important not to overestimate your strength and sports skills.  For example, Courmayeur at the foot of Mont Blanc is suitable for lovers of difficult off-piste slopes stretching right on the slopes of a majestic mountain. </p><p>  To the highest point, Punta Helbronner (3462 meters), are two lines of lifts.  From there you can go down to the Tula region or choose a difficult route to the famous White Valley. </p><p>  Even more dizzying slopes await lovers of extreme sports in the <span>snowy resort of</span> Cervinia.  The base station is located at an altitude of 2000 meters and from there the lifts take speed enthusiasts to the Rosa plateau, at an altitude of 3480 meters.  The length of the maximum route, the famous "Ventany", is more than 12 kilometers, and the total length of the routes exceeds 350 km.  And also amazing off-piste routes and the opportunity to do heli-skiing.  This is an amazing adrenaline rush - descent along an absolutely untouched slope, to which a helicopter delivers a desperate skier.  Heli-skiing is often held on inaccessible slopes where no one has ever ridden. </p><h2>  Trails for beginners </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.scuoladiscipila.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beginner ski run" class="if uuid-2980044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2980044.jpg"></div><p>  If the skills of skiing are not very honed or you plan a winter holiday with children, Champors is worth choosing among the many tours to the Italian ski resorts.  Most of its tracks run through the Mont Avik Regional Park, among silence and unspoilt nature. </p><p>  The slopes here are perfectly suited for family vacations and the first attempts to ski.  It even provides two training schools for beginners. </p><p>  Even with children it is good to visit La Thuile resort, which provides an excellent winter holiday for guests of any age.  There are separate snow parks for kids, where the child will learn to ski without distracting adults.  And for experienced skiers there are 160 kilometers of pistes of different difficulty levels, many off-piste runs. And also in La Thuile there is the famous Franco Bertod piste, the slope of which sometimes reaches 73%! </p><h2>  For snowboard fans </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nonstopdestination.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Snowboarding" class="if uuid-2980055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2980055.jpg"></div><p>  Almost every <span>ski resort,</span> and Aosta in Italy is no exception, equipped with special snow parks for riders.  For example, in the Courmaraider park (Courmayeur resort) there is both an easy line for beginners and challenging tracks with eight-meter spans and various obstacles for diving. </p><p>  And in the Cervinia Indian Park snowpark there is even a zone for training beginners and children.  And for experienced freestyle enthusiasts, there are many springboards and boxes where you can hone your skiing skills.  By the way, this is one of the longest snow parks in Italy, the total length of the tracks exceeds one kilometer. </p><h2>  Ski tours to Italy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cervinia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter skiing" class="if uuid-2980070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2980070.jpg"></div><p>  Fans of active winter holidays will not have difficulty choosing the right time and cost tour in Aosta.  Numerous agencies offer a tour of five days, with the ability to choose a hotel, a direct transfer to the selected resort, an additional booking of excursions or heli-skiing. </p><p>  And guests of the hospitable town of Aosta in Italy will be waited by delicious local cuisine, landscapes of extraordinary beauty and friendly residents.  By the way, on some tracks you can ride even in summer. </p>
