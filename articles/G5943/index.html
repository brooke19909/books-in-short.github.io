    <p>  At home, when you need to apply welding (for example, when repairing a car, garage door, etc.), special tools are required.  However, not everyone has the necessary welding skills, as well as suitable equipment.  Therefore, the situation can be corrected by a welding inverter, the reviews of which are positive, and the device does not require special qualifications in order to learn how to work with it. </p><p>  <strong>What is a welding inverter?</strong> </p><p>  This is a welding device that has the following elements: a network rectifier, a high-frequency transformer, an inverter, a choke, and an output rectifier.  The principle of its operation is the conversion of AC to high-frequency direct current.  The current frequency is controlled by microprocessor control.  Using a welding inverter, you can weld metals of different thicknesses.  According to the type of power supply, the devices distinguish three-phase and single-phase.  It is also important that welding inverters are able to work from autonomous electric generators. </p><p>  Due to its characteristics, the <span>welding inverter</span> receives mostly good reviews among professionals and non-professionals.  After all, the apparatus has small dimensions, makes a high-quality seam, they can be welded in any positions and the spraying of metal during operation with the inverter is minimal.  In addition, the welding inverter is capable of welding metals and alloys that are not available for other <span>types of welding.</span>  The device has high efficiency, consumes a little electricity with a high power factor.  One of the disadvantages of a welding inverter is the high price, which makes it a not so affordable tool for using it at home. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And, nevertheless, due to the fact that the units are able to weld both ferrous and non-ferrous metals, inverter welding machines get the best reviews.  They can be successfully applied both in the professional sphere, for example, in construction or car service, and in domestic conditions. </p><p>  <strong>How to choose the right machine for welding?</strong> </p><p>  This question is asked by many people who use welding equipment in their activities, or have never met with it before. </p><p>  When choosing a device for welding, you need to pay attention to whether it has protection against power surges.  The optimal value may be 170-270 watts.  Such protection is provided by devices that are classified as medium or premium.  Models with a class lower and simpler have protection ranging from ten to fifteen percent. </p><p>  It is important to know how to choose a welding inverter so that it fully meets the requirements for it.  Be sure to find out when buying whether there is service and where the service center is located, and also to ask if there are printed circuit boards for the device you have chosen, since this is the most expensive breakdown of inverter welding equipment.  Having decided on the upcoming scope of work, you can stop at a household or professional welding inverter.  Household appliances are designed to work for twenty to thirty minutes with a break of one hour.  Professional can work throughout the entire shift (eight hours).  The following options are standard for any inverter-type welding equipment: hot start, anti-stick, formed arc. </p><p>  <strong>Consumer reviews on welding invertors</strong> </p><p>  People who bought a welding inverter leave reviews of the following nature.  It is noted that the device has most of the functions that are not available for other <span>welding units.</span>  He is able to stabilize the voltage, automatically adapts to the network.  It has a reinforced cable, the length of which reaches five meters.  In general, consumers have a good impression of welding inverters.  For example, Svarog models are gathering positive feedback about themselves.  The devices of this manufacturer do not make noise at work, not heavy, compact.  Moreover, many consumers say that the welding inverter, despite the high price, is a very useful tool in which it is not a pity to invest money.  <span>The invertor welding</span> machine "NEON" also has good reviews.  People with this unit say that it is successfully used for welding zirconium and makes a strong connection. </p><p>  Thus, the welding inverter, the reviews of which are given in the material, fully justifies its price and really turns out to be such a tool that is successfully used both in everyday life and in professional activities. </p>
