Next, let's try to figure out which is better - “Meizu” or “Xiaomi.”  It is these brands that are direct competitors to a similar gadget "Huawei", which managed to pretty well "untwist".  Among the phones in question, it is rather difficult to choose a leader.  Below are the characteristics of competitors, as well as their features and user reviews. </p>

    <p>  Technical characteristics of the Xiaomi 4X model: </p><ul><li>  The processor is “Qualcomm Snapdragon 435” (1.4 GHz). </li><li>  RAM - 2.3 or 4 GB. </li><li>  Graphic accelerator - "Adreno 505". </li><li>  The built-in memory is 16, 32 or 64 GB. </li><li>  Front / rear camera - 13/5 MP. </li><li>  Diagonal / display resolution - 5 inches / 1280 * 720. </li><li>  Battery capacity - 4100 mAh. </li></ul><p>  Which is better (“Meizu” or “Xiaomi”) in terms of the above parameters?  According to experts, the Snepdragon and Adreno combination is more productive than Media Library and Mali.  It is worth noting that the Qualcom processor is better optimized, which allows you to extend the battery life between charges.  In addition, the M5 has a limit on internal memory of only 32 GB. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Exterior </h2><p>  Which is better, “Meizu” or “Xiaomi”, in terms of design?  Modification M5 definitely wins on this parameter.  The fact is that this unit has more body colors, there is rounded glass on the edges (2.5 D).  The model is characterized by excellent ergonomics, which makes it possible to easily control the smartphone with one hand.  The frames of the screen are thin, under the central part of the monitor is the "M-Touch" key.  The buttons for adjusting the volume level and the inclusion are identical for both models.  An additional convenience noted by Meizu is the removal of the headphone jack from the top to the bottom. </p>

    <p>  Xiaomi 4x smartphone is also equipped with 2.5 D glass, the body is made of aluminum.  Ergonomics at the proper level, however, would not hurt a large roundness of the corners.  In the upper end part there is an infrared port for controlling the TV, next to a 3.5 mm jack, which is not very convenient during operation.  4X manufacturers have provided only three types of colors (black, golden and pink colors). </p><p>  Continuing to find out what is better (“Meizu” or “Xiaomi”), it should be noted a more convenient placement of the M5 in the hand and a wide selection of body colors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Navigation and interface </h2><p>  The interface of both models under consideration is up to standard.  Among the identical options: 3.5 mm jack, micro-USB port, GPS, GLONASS.  Version 4X has a more modern configuration of the Bluetooth module (4.2 versus 4.0).  In addition, Wi-Fi modules are different.  "M5" is equipped with the classic version of the "dual band 801" with frequencies of 2.4 and 5 GHz.  The “Xiaomi” smartphone has a module 802. It is worth noting that the NFC option was not found on both devices, which is not surprising.  Such a module is very rarely used on budget versions. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  When figuring out which smartphone is better - Meise or Xiaomi, you should pay attention to the screen settings.  The resolution of the models is the same (1280 * 720 pixels).  Diagonal M5 is 5.2 inches (282 ppi), and its competitor, this figure is 5 inches (296 ppi).  Types of matrix, and in one and the other phone - IPS.  However, Xiaomi has a better factory calibration.  The screen does not fade, providing a clear display of colors, in which black remains black and the white hue has no extraneous inclusions. </p><p>  Meizu has a slight purple or yellow glow when tilted at a certain angle.  An even greater deviation causes a partial darkening of the screen.  The brightness margin is excellent, the information remains readable even in bright sunlight.  The multi-touch function supports up to 10 simultaneous touches, there is a protective <span>oleophobic coating.</span> </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Xiaomi or Meizu - which is the best smartphone in terms of shooting?  The modular filling of the devices under consideration is almost identical in terms of optical parameters, therefore the shooting quality is approximately the same.  In the afternoon, the pictures come out quite worthy, but in the evening and at night - of very dubious quality. </p><p>  Front-facing cameras are also not particularly distinguished by their characteristics.  Both versions have a 5 megapixel version.  This is quite enough for selfie and communication on Skype.  The only advantage of the M5 is the presence of a manual shooting mode, which makes it possible to achieve better quality images and videos. </p>

    <h2>  Sound options </h2><p>  If you are interested in which phone is better to buy (“Meizu” or “Xiaomi”) in terms of sound quality, pay attention to the M5.  He wins significantly in this category.  In many respects, this is due to the past developments of the company, which was engaged in the production of portable audio players.  Users and experts note the good quality of high frequencies, rich bass and equalizer support, as well as the ability to manually configure the player. </p><p>  The 4X modification leaves much to be desired.  In a nutshell, it is characteristic of most budget devices.  When listening, there is a noticeable excess of high frequencies and a lack of clarity on a low timbre.  An equalizer is present in the standard player, which is already not bad, because with the help of manual tuning you can improve the sound quality. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  In terms of battery “survivability”, “Xiaomi” comes forward among competitors.  The battery capacity is 4100 mAh, which allows the device to work for 24 hours or more with moderate use after a single charge.  In the case of active use of the Internet, games, social networks, the smartphone will have to be charged every night. </p><p>  In the M5, the situation is even more critical.  Battery capacity - 3070 mAh.  It is easy to assume that such an apparatus will need to be charged at least twice a day during active use. </p>

    <h2>  Xiaomi or Meizu: which is better? </h2><p>  User reviews indicate that “Xiaiaomi” is preferable among the competitors in question.  This is due to the metal case, a more informative display, increased battery life and a good supply of RAM.  The M5 is also in demand, despite some flaws. </p><p>  If we calculate the advantages of the models by sections, they will be approximately equal.  This is not strange, each device has its pros and cons.  For a user who needs a phone to communicate on social networks and the sound quality is not particularly important, 4X is quite suitable.  Those who expect to use the gadget to listen to music, create photos, it is better to opt for the M5. </p>

    <h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  Which is better: “Meizu”, “Xiaomi” or “Huawei” among Chinese smartphones?  Above, we examined in detail the parameters of the first two competitors.  Depending on the needs and intended use of the smartphone, each consumer has the right to choose a model according to their preferences.  It should be noted that Huawei has been actively selling for several years, although the characteristics of some modifications are lower than those of its competitors.  For example, the Y3 (2017) model has only 1 GB of RAM, an 8 megapixel camera and a battery capacity of 2200 mAh.  The display size is 5 inches with a resolution of TN 854 * 480 pixels.  Front camera - 2 megapixels.  This is not so much as for a smartphone, but suitable for users who are not particularly fond of social networks and selfies. </p>
