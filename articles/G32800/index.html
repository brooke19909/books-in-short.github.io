Festive New Year's carnival is just the right place to dress up in a princess costume and show off in it in the company of Santa Claus and Snow Maiden.  However, New Year's party is not the only place where you can wear a <span>chic dress</span> with a crown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="princess costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1092360.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <h2>  Image Details </h2><p>  What will be needed in order to make a princess costume on your own?  In order not to miss anything, you should disassemble the outfit in parts.  It can be made detailed - to include in the princess costume such additional elements as knickers, gloves, a fan, a handbag, a handkerchief with initials, jewelry in the form of pendants with precious stones, or limited to a dress and a crown. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  So, firstly, you should choose the fabric for the dress with its many petticoats.  A win-win option for a full skirt is <span>tulle.</span>  It is distinguished by stiffness.  A more upright skirt will hold well, while a soft one is perfect for creating ruffles.  Satin, brocade or velor is well suited to complete the main part of the dress.  You can also use chiffon and silk, or you can completely make a <span>skirt of tulle,</span> and the top of the dress - from a beautiful knitted fabric like velor or sequin fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The princess costume can be sewn of absolutely any color, but, as you know, almost all babies really like pink shades, and therefore a little fashionista will appreciate this color scheme.  But, of course, it is better to take an interest in her preferences in order to precisely please the child. </p>

    <p>  For convenience, the work can be divided into parts: first take up the bodice of the product, and then - with the skirt.  The first step is to develop a product template.  Therefore, armed with a <span>centimeter tape,</span> you need to take the following measurements from the child: chest and waist, tummy volume, back width, front width, shoulder width, neckline, chest height, back and front length to the waist and sleeve length. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Building a dress bodice pattern </h2><p>  All taken measurements are transferred to paper as follows: </p><ul><li>  You should draw a rectangle with sides equal to the measurement of ‚Äúchest circumference‚Äù and ‚Äúback length‚Äù to the waist. </li><li>  According to the measurement "chest height", determine the line of the chest in the drawing. </li><li>  Mark the neck in the upper corners of the drawing.  It all depends on the model in mind, the neck can be highly closed or open with a beautifully designed neckline, where a precious necklace of beads and stones will show off. </li><li>  To mark the edge of the line of the shoulder seam, you should postpone the measurement ‚Äúback width‚Äù along the upper side of the rectangle.  The humeral line for a beautiful fit is withdrawn with an understatement of the edge by 1.5 cm. </li><li>  Then they descend to the chest line and divide it into the zone of the back, armhole and front.  The first of them is equal to the width of the back, the second is calculated by dividing the volume of the chest by 4, and the remainder falls on the zone of the anterior shelf. </li><li>  The next step is to determine the middle in the armhole zone.  A side seam will come out of it, on which, if necessary, tucks for the waist can be made. </li><li>  Next, the armhole should be finalized by connecting the extreme points of the shoulder seams with the midpoint.  In this case, a smooth line should be drawn, rounding off all sharp corners. </li></ul><p>  At this stage, the blank for the bodice is ready.  Next, it needs to be transferred to the fabric and cut with allowance for seam processing. </p><h2>  Building a pattern of sleeves </h2>

    <p>  Princess children's costume can be made with a small sleeve or, conversely, make them long with beautiful angles falling to the floor at the wrist.  To make a template, you will need a ready-made pattern of the bodice of the dress.  It is folded along the shoulder seams and encircled the armhole along the contour.  If you draw a circle, part of which is formed on the shoulder‚Äôs shoulder, and in the center place a segment equal to the circumference of the top of the arm along its bottom, extend this line in both directions and draw around the circumference of the sleeve, the length of which would be equal to the cut of the armhole, then the template for tailoring. </p><p>  However, if you sew, for example, the costume of Princess Leia, it will be enough to fold the fabric in half and simply mark the side and sleeve seams with a smooth transition under the arm. </p><h2>  Tailoring skirts </h2><p>  Sewing a skirt and connecting it with a bodice, getting an excellent princess costume with your own hands - it's easy!  To make it, you will need only two measures: the length of the product and the volume of the abdomen of the child.  Further, after calculating the required amount of fabric, you can draw a template directly on the canvas, since it is a regular rectangle, which is closed with a seam and collected at the top on an elastic band.  Here you can simplify the task by leaving the bodice and skirt as separate parts so as not to attach a zipper and sew buttons.  If the product is multi-layered, then each of the layers must be closed separately, but you can collect all of them at the top with one elastic band. </p>

    <p>  The lower layers are best made of hard tulle, then let go soft, and then - the main fabric. </p><h2>  Creating a costume with a child </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself princess costume is a great occasion for co-creation with a child!  Each mommy can devote an extra hour of precious time to her child and allow the baby to participate in the creation of a chic outfit.  You can instruct her to string beads on a fishing line or, under the control of her mother, cut tulle with scissors.  These tasks are simple, but pleasant impressions are provided to the child, because the idea that she helped to sew the princess costume for the girl will be an occasion for pride and will spur on further exploits in the future. </p><h2>  How to create the image of Leia? </h2><p>  Such a cult saga as "Star Wars", did not leave anyone indifferent.  Adults and children, clinging to the screens, were fascinated to watch part by part.  The boys presented themselves as swarms of the Jedi, and the girls dreamed of dressing up in the costume of Princess Leia.  It is not difficult to put on such a mysterious image at a carnival celebration.  A white straight dress with one-piece sleeves, a belt at the waist and a hairstyle with two pigtails gathered on the head in shirts - and you can shine at the holiday. </p><p>  To sew such an outfit, you will need a white cloth two measurements long from the neck to the floor of the child.  It can be satin or velvet fabric, you can also use just linen or cambric.  For cutting, you will also need to measure the length from the wrist to the wrist (through the neck of the child) and postpone this value by bending.  On the neck, in the middle of this segment, you will need to make a cut.  And so that the head goes well, a cut on the back or the front shelf.  It can be closed with ties or buttons.  Next, you need to measure the circumference of the chest and abdomen and, with a larger value, place this segment directly on the canvas in the center from the mark to the mark indicating the wrists.  Next, you need to draw sleeve and side seams of the ‚Äúbat‚Äù type and flare down the dress panel by about 7-10 cm on both sides.  After that, it remains only to find a suitable belt (or sew it from a strip of fabric) and supplement the image with an appropriate hairstyle. </p>

    <h2>  How to create an image of jasmine? </h2><p>  The legendary adventures of Aladdin would be almost uninteresting to the girls if the princess did not appear in them.  Her outfit has long been the dream of any girl.  It is best to sew the costume of Princess Jasmine from chiffon, satin or silk with inserts of beautiful golden fringe with beads and other decorative elements in the form of beads, stones and satin ribbons.  For sewing the top, you can use the bodice pattern described above, and for the pants you need to take the child‚Äôs sportswear, fold it inside out, the trouser leg to the trouser leg, and draw around the contour of the seams.  When cutting, you will need to add 10 cm at the side seams and 5 cm at the top and bottom (to design the drawstring for the elastic). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="princess jasmine costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1092373.jpg" width="312"></div>
