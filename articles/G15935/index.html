The same as neat little toy houses, which are laid out in red-brown brick, bright roofs made of tiles, decorated with weathercocks and turrets ... The elegant lace curtains on the windows complement the overall impression.  This is Bruges - a landmark city in Belgium, which is rightly on the list of the most picturesque and beautiful settlements of Europe, while being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><p>  About 10 thousand tourists come here every day.  Moreover, the sights of Bruges tend to see both Belgians and residents of other countries of the world.  At the same time, the number of guests in this place can be considered quite large, given that the population of the town itself is only 45 thousand people. </p><h2>  What to see in Bruges? </h2><p>  Due to the small size of the town, all its main cultural and historical sights are not far from each other.  This allows you to inspect them in almost one day.  Of course, it would be much better if the optimal route of movements was drawn up in advance.  Our compatriots will be helped in this by a map of the city in Russian, on which all the interesting places located in it are indicated.  What sights to see in Bruges in one day? </p><h2>  Grote Mark </h2><p>  It is advisable to start sightseeing in Bruges from the picturesque central square of the town.  On it you can see the main symbol of this settlement - Belfort Tower.  This medieval bell tower, which for 8 centuries served as an observation point for citizens, is today considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.123rf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="belfort tower" class="if uuid-2458624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2458624.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the Belfort Tower is the most recognizable building in Bruges.  The gallery located at her top can be accessed by a staircase consisting of 366 steps.  An amazing panorama of not only the city, but also of all its environs opens from the tower.  In addition, this building is still used as a bell tower.  With its 47 bells, set in motion by means of special mechanisms, it still regulates the life of the population of Bruges, notifying people about the time and events significant for the city. </p><p>  Interestingly, <span>Martin McDonagh</span> built the action of his famous film around this tower.  The name of this picture is ‚ÄúTo Bury Down‚Äù. </p><p>  Grote Markh is the center of the city and its main square.  And until now, there are market pavilions located here, attracting the attention of tourists.  Today they sell only souvenirs.  But in the old days in this place there was an active trade in all that was necessary for the townspeople.  That is why the Grote Markh is also called the Market Square. </p><p>  Here you can also see numerous restaurants.  They invite hungry travelers, offering them their dishes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="cityvagabond.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Market Square" class="if uuid-2453807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2453807.jpg"></div><p>  From the pedestal, the heroes of the battle of Golden Spurs, who fought for the independence of Flanders, look at tourists having dinner or acquiring magnets.  These are sculptures of the butcher Jan Braidel and the weaver Peter de Connick. </p><p>  Indeed, the history of Flanders is hardly simple.  At the same time, the battle of the Golden Spurs was far from the only bloodshed on this earth.  That is why it is not surprising that in Bruges you can see the oldest medical institution in Europe - the hospital to them.  St. John  It was founded in the 12th century.  and performed the functions assigned to it until the middle of the 20th century.  Today, a museum is open and working in it.  Within its walls, the artist Hans Memling, who is one of the most famous people living in this town, regularly exhibits his works. </p><p>  Of course, among the attractions of Bruges are palaces.  The owners of one of them in former times was one of the most noble families of the town.  Today in this palace, which is called Grythuyz, is the museum of the same name.  It contains wonderful examples of luxurious carpets and furniture, as well as decor.  All this was made by the masters of the city.  Tourists who have visited the sights of Bruges, reviews about this palace leave the most enthusiastic.  Having bought a ticket for 8 euros, you can freely walk along its corridors, feeling for some time a local aristocrat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After visiting the museum, travelers again return to the Market Square.  By the way, here you can get on one of the many excursions that offer to see the sights of Bruges in one day, accompanied by a guide. </p><h2>  Beginage </h2><p>  Considering the main attractions of Bruges, being on its Market Square, you can deviate somewhat from the central part of this settlement and, walking or riding a carriage, get to a very quiet and comfortable place.  Here is the home-refuge of the runners - Beginage.  You can get to its territory by passing on a small bridge.  In its northern part, a small chapel will open, and if you look to the south - a large one.  On the territory located between these buildings, there are quiet streets with small white houses with red roofs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beginage in Bruges" class="if uuid-2453826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2453826.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists can stroll through a modest park with its huge old trees.  The Belinazh complex is surrounded by canals, in the waters of which ducks and swans swim.  To date, all these buildings belong to the convent of the Order of <span>St. Benedict.</span>  For tourists, this area closes at 18:30. </p><h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  After visiting the Grote Markh, many tourists rush to a narrow street located near the Belfort tower.  After walking a bit along it, travelers go to Burg Squar.  This is the second city square, which in its attendance and beauty is in no way inferior to Market Square.  There are also many attractions of the city of Bruges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Town Hall in Bruges" class="if uuid-2453834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2453834.jpg"></div><p>  The Town Hall looks especially elegant on this square.  This building houses the City Council.  The Town Hall was built in the 15th century.  And today it is considered one of the most popular attractions in Bruges.  Indeed, the building is a worthy example of Flemish Gothic architecture with its light facades and openwork windows, small turrets located on the roof, as well as luxurious ornaments and decor.  The Town Hall is so impressive that it could well decorate not only the small Bruges, but also the capital of the country. </p><p>  During the restoration of the building, its Small and Big Halls were combined.  Today it is the Gothic Hall, in which the city council holds its meetings, as well as register marriages.  At the same time, tourists can visit the Town Hall.  The city museum is also located in this building. </p><h2>  Church of the Holy Blood of Christ </h2><p>  In addition to the Town Hall, on Burg Square there is a religious building, which is well known not only in Bruges.  The Church of the Holy Blood of Christ is a special attraction throughout Belgium.  It contains a relic, which is important for all Christian believers.  This is a small piece of fabric that Joseph of Arimathea washed off the blood that appeared on the body of Jesus. </p><p>  Those tourists who are interested in ancient architecture, this building will certainly attract.  After all, the church has a rather interesting design.  The lower part is made in a heavy and strict Romanesque style.  The upper one was erected in a Gothic, lighter and more airy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eatanddrinklikeaeuropean.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Holy Blood of Christ" class="if uuid-2453846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2453846.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, those who used the guide to the sights of Bruges and planned to visit this shrine, it is recommended to study in advance information about what is inside this building.  This will make it much easier to navigate to see more interesting details. </p><p>  Every day at 11:30 a piece of cloth on which is the blood of Jesus, the priests take out in a beautiful glass capsule.  Everyone can come up to her and, by touching, just watch or pray.  Tourists note that entry here is free, but photographing inside the building is prohibited. </p><h2>  Brewery Museum </h2><p>  Some sights of the city of Bruges in Belgium are not only interesting to visit, but also tasty.  One of these unique places is the existing brewery called De Halve Maan.  From 1564 to the present, it is located at 26 Walplein Square. This place is the historical center of the city.  Inside the brewery there is an enclosed courtyard with tables.  Several dining rooms are also open.  The building is also located here, which houses the beer museum with a viewing platform on the roof. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.duvel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beer hall" class="if uuid-2453858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2453858.jpg"></div><p>  The duration of the tour is 45 minutes.

After all, it was here that a simple pharmacist tried to get a new cough medicine.  The result of his efforts was not at all a cold medicine, but dark chocolate.  The pharmacist was upset and pleased at the same time.  Yes, the mixture he received did not cure, but at the same time it tasted good. </p><p>  Next, confectioners took up the matter.  At the beginning of the 20th century.  they wanted to surprise the Duke of Plesi Pralin and added nuts to the chocolate.  The result was pralines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bonggamom.blogspot.com.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chocolate egg" class="if uuid-2453867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2453867.jpg"></div><p>  A chocolate festival takes place in Bruges every year.  For a period, this small town becomes a haven for sweet tooth.  Chocolate fountains begin to beat on its streets, and confectioners prepare real masterpieces from the goodies.  After the end of the festival, all their works are transferred to the Choco Story Museum.  It is located in the medieval castle of Harze. </p><p>  When compiling a list of attractions in Bruges, be sure to include this museum in it.  On its ground floor it will be possible to plunge into the atmosphere of the past, when the Aztecs and Mayans mixed water, spices and cocoa, while preparing a ceremonial drink.  He, of course, was bitter.  However, this was the first step towards the invention of such a popular treat today. </p><p>  On the second floor of the museum, visitors can familiarize themselves with the path that cocoa beans have to go in order to then become chocolate. </p><p>  The exposition of the third floor of the museum will tell about the benefits of this product.

The pond, in which swans and ducks swim, gives a special cosiness and tranquility to the park.  By the way, some shots of the movie "Get Bottom in Bruges" were shot here. </p><h2>  Windmills </h2><p>  What else is worth seeing in Bruges?  Many tourists speak remarkably about the eastern outskirts of the town.  This is a wonderful place where you can enjoy the scenery of a medieval city, being almost in a rural idyll.  There are no cars in this urban area and crowds of people do not go.  A river, a natural hill and a landscape with mills are opened to the eye.  By the way, climbing one of them, you can admire the city from afar.  There are four mills.  Two of them are operational.  Those wishing to inspect the mills from the inside can go to one of the already not working facilities. </p><p>  Getting to this place is not difficult.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the road from the center of Bruges in the direction of the north-east will take no more than 15-20 minutes on foot.  At the exit from the city, sights await travelers at almost every step.  These are churches and ancient buildings.  It is only necessary to carefully examine the old buildings and read the signs on them.  There are several beer bars along the road to the mills.  It is impossible to find them on the tourist map of the city.  These bars are preferred by locals. </p><h2>  Minnewater Lake </h2><p>  This is a very romantic and amazingly beautiful place.  There is Lake Minnewater in Minnewaterpark.  A flock of snow-white swans is immediately evident to any visitor.  There are about 40 of these graceful birds on the lake. Moreover, swans are considered a symbol of the city of Bruges.  Many fauna and legends are associated with these representatives of the fauna. </p><p>  Experienced tourists recommend visiting the lake early in the morning.  There are few people here at that time, which makes it possible to take beautiful pictures in memory of Bruges. </p>
