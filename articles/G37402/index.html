  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yuri Gagarin was the one who first flew into space</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br>  Space exploration began long before the flight.  Many scientists and designers have tried to create a rocket in order to give humanity the opportunity to explore outer space.  The main rivals in this struggle were the USSR and the USA.  Both countries sought to become pioneers of outer space.  But <span>on April 12,</span> 1961, the world found out who first flew into space.  It was a citizen of the USSR, Yuri Gagarin. </p><p>  Experimental space flights began a little earlier.  But dogs were used as astronauts.  First, rockets were launched at a low altitude.  Scientists have studied the effect of weightlessness on the body of animals.  After this, development in this area continued.  At the same time, the first manned space flight was being prepared. </p><p>  Then they designed a rocket for longer flights, but it did not have a return mechanism to the ground.  Therefore, a dog named Laika, who flew on it into space, did not return to earth and died.  Then on a high-altitude rocket two dogs Gypsy and Desik flew into space.  They successfully completed their flight and successfully landed on the ground. </p><p>  Therefore, speaking of who first flew into space, one cannot help but mention these astronauts. </p><p>  But, of course, the first flight into space of man was a real breakthrough in this area.  It was a historic day not only in the <span>development of astronautics,</span> but also of all mankind.  The whole world knew who was the first to fly into space. </p><p>  Thanks to the launch vehicle, a spaceship entered orbit, the only passenger of which was a man.  The duration of the first flight was only 108 minutes.  But these were moments of pride for the Soviet people and the Russian cosmonautics.  Today, when astronauts work in space for several months in a row, this period seems so short.  But for the first flight it was a huge achievement. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The one who first flew into space showed the whole of humanity that it is possible to master this unknown space.  People got the opportunity to work and live in space.  So the word astronaut came into use, and a new profession appeared. </p><p>  People in this profession should have many skills and knowledge.  The most important and initial requirement that they make is excellent health.  During the flight, the astronaut experiences very large overloads.  They are especially felt when landing and entering orbit.  Weightlessness is also a test for the human body.  Therefore, health requirements are so high. </p><p>  In addition, the astronaut must have courage and courage.  The ability to make the right decision in difficult situations is also a necessary quality.  Outer space is an unusual environment for humans.  There are radiation harmful to humans, a vacuum.  But the ship's hull is durable and impervious.  It has everything you need for a full life and work. <br>  The astronaut must know thoroughly the structure of the spacecraft.  The combination of all these qualities just characterized the first cosmonaut of the Earth. </p><p>  Yuri Gagarin was the one who first flew into space.  But this was only the initial step.  Further exploration of outer space continued.  The complexity of the flights and the tasks that confronted the astronauts increased.  The technique has become more complex.  The following flights lasted more than a day.  Then there was a man‚Äôs exit beyond the spacecraft.  It was made by <span>Alexei Leonov.</span>  Orbital stations were created and launched, which allowed the crews of astronauts to replace each other in orbit. </p><p>  The development of astronautics is going faster.  But the flight of the <span>first man into space</span> is the main event in this area, which has opened up new tasks, opportunities and prospects for mankind. </p>
