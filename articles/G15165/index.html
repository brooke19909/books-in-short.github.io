    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The three-star hotel "Vezhen" has all the necessary infrastructure for an excellent holiday.  Here at your service there is a 24-hour reception, currency exchange, a safe at the front desk, laundry, dry cleaning and shuttle service, wireless Internet access in the lobby and free parking. </p><h2>  Vezhen 3 * (Bulgaria): reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order for travelers planning to spend their holidays in the Golden Sands resort to have a more complete picture of the Vezhen hotel, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots who have already stayed here this year.  In short, we can say that most tourists were satisfied with their choice of hotel and did not regret the money spent.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  As for the rooms, our compatriots found them quite comfortable, clean, with fresh repairs, good furniture and properly working appliances.  If any breakdowns occurred, then after contacting the reception they were very quickly fixed.  A big advantage of the Vezhen 3 * hotel (Golden Sands, Bulgaria), tourists considered the presence of air conditioning in its rooms, as many hotels in the neighborhood did not have them, and therefore guests complained about the heat in the rooms.  But back to "Polite."  Cleaning in hotel rooms, according to vacationers, was carried out daily.  Also, towels were changed every day.  Bed linen was updated approximately once every five days.  The only minor drawback of the rooms of this hotel, our compatriots considered a weak Wi-Fi signal in some rooms.  However, in the lobby of the hotel the Internet is very good, so you can go down there if necessary. </p>

    <p>  Some tourists complained about the location of the hotel.  Since, in their opinion, it is located far from the center of Golden Sands.  However, most travelers specifically chose the Vezhen 3 * hotel for a calm and measured stay away from city noise.  At the same time, hotel guests always had the opportunity to make a pleasant half-hour walk to the city center with lots of shops, retail shops, restaurants, taverns, bars, attractions, clubs and other entertainments.  You can also get here by taxi or bus in just a few minutes. </p><p>  As for food, then, according to our compatriots, it is consistent with the level of a three-star hotel.  So, it is not possible to name the various local menu, however, all the food is well prepared with quality products.  Experienced tourists recommend those people who want to eat varied, when booking a room, order only breakfast, and not "all inclusive".  In this case, you will have the opportunity to try delicious dishes in the surrounding restaurants and taverns. </p><p>  Basically, our compatriots were satisfied with the local beach.  Despite the fact that walking to it from Vezhen 3 * for about 15-20 minutes (and on the way back you need to climb the mountain), most tourists found this physical activity very pleasant.  In addition, for those who find it difficult to walk, a shuttle service is available here.  There are several beaches in the vicinity of the hotel.  All of them are municipal, sandy.  For the rental of sunbeds and umbrellas you must pay extra.  However, you can always stay on a towel brought with you on the beach space that is not occupied by deck chairs for free. </p>
