But in one thousand nine hundred and third year at the Second Congress, which was held in Brussels, Lenin and Martov disagreed on the rules of membership.  Which led to the separation of the Bolsheviks, which required more active action. </p><h2>  The perspectives of the two main leaders </h2><p>  Vladimir Ilyich advocated small parties of professional revolutionaries.  Julius Osipovich did not agree, believing that it was better to have a large group of activists.  He based his ideas on the experience of the <span>socialist parties</span> that existed in other European countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the Bolsheviks are" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/584652.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Vladimir Lenin argued that the situation in the Russian state was completely different.  There it was impossible to form political parties under the autocratic rule of the emperor.  At the end of the discussion, Julius Osipovich still won.  But Vladimir Ilyich did not want to admit defeat and organized his own faction, and the Bolsheviks were those who joined her.  Those who remained faithful to Martov began to be called Mensheviks. </p><h2>  Each batch needs cash </h2><p>  The Bolsheviks play a very insignificant role in the revolution of one thousand nine hundred and five, because most of their leaders live in exile and mainly abroad.  And the Mensheviks are making tremendous successes, both in the councils and in the trade union movements.  Already at one thousand nine hundred and seventh Vladimir Ilyich abandoned the hope of an armed uprising. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the Bolsheviks are who" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/584655.jpg" width="498"></div>

The Bolsheviks are a party that was supposed to somehow exist, and Vladimir Lenin spent a lot of time searching for fundraising for the further development of his faction.  Big donations were from Maxim Gorky and Sava Morozov, the famous millionaire of Moscow. </p><h2>  Ways to make money in split fractions </h2><p>  When the parties split, and further separation became apparent, one of the most significant differences between them was how each faction decided to fund its revolution.  The Mensheviks settled on collecting membership dues.  And the Bolsheviks are those who resorted to more radical methods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro bolsheviks" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/584653.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of the most common ways was bank robbery.  A similar attack, which was committed in one thousand nine hundred and seventh year, brings the party of Vladimir Ilyich about two hundred and fifty thousand rubles.  And, unfortunately, this was not the only case.  The Mensheviks naturally outraged this way of earning. </p><h2>  What did the revolutionaries get money for </h2><p>  But the Bolsheviks constantly needed money.  Vladimir Ilyich was convinced that the revolution can bring maximum results if people who devote their whole lives to the cause participate in it.  And to compensate for the time and effort spent, he handed them a good salary for the sacrifice and dedication.  This measure was specially taken to guarantee the <span>full employment of the</span> revolutionaries and focus on their duties, as well as to force them to carry out their work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the Bolsheviks are red or white" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/584657.jpg" width="600"></div>

Such methods of financing became the obvious difference between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks and their beliefs. </p><h2>  Did the Bolsheviks have principles </h2><p>  By the beginning of one thousand nine hundred and ten years, support for the principles of the Bolsheviks was becoming almost non-existent.  At the <span>beginning of World War I,</span> Vladimir Ilyich lived in Austria.  At a meeting of the Bolsheviks in Bern, he outlined his views on the war.  Lenin stigmatized the war itself and all those who supported it, since, in his opinion, they had betrayed the proletariat. </p><p>  He was shocked by the decision of most socialists in Europe to endorse hostilities.  Now Vladimir Ilyich has devoted all the forces of his party to turning the imperialist war into a civil war.  The most exceptional difference between the parties was that the Bolsheviks were those who, with ferocious stubbornness, were pursuing their goals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bolsheviks are communists" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/584659.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  And in order to achieve them, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin often even deviated from his political ideas if he saw a guarantee of long-term benefits for his party.  And this practice was widely used by him when trying to recruit peasants and illiterate workers.  He convincingly promised them that a glorious life would come after the revolution. </p><h2>  The strongest propaganda on German means </h2><p>  And, of course, today many people have the question of whether the Bolsheviks are who?  A group of like-minded people who deceived the common people to achieve their own goals?  Or, after all, those who worked to create more optimal living conditions for the Russian proletariat? </p><p>  First of all, it was a <span>party whose goal</span> was to overthrow the interim government and create a new one.  At the same time, the Bolsheviks really had loud slogans that promised significant changes in living conditions for the common people.  Their agitation was so strong that they received public support. </p><p>  The facts are known that the Bolsheviks are communists sponsored by the Germans, as they knew that Vladimir Ilyich wanted to pull Russia out of the war.  And it was this money that helped develop such advertising campaigns that promoted a better life and other benefits for the population. </p><h2>  A few questions arising in connection with the advent of the Bolsheviks </h2><p>  In politics, those areas that embody the ideas of social equality or improve the lives of ordinary people are called leftists.  They strive to create a level playing field, independent of national origin or ethnicity.  Therefore, answering the question of whether the Bolsheviks are right or left, it is safe to attribute them to this particular direction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bolsheviks is a party" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/584654.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  As for the white movement, it was already created during the Civil War, which began in one thousand nine hundred and seventeen, and the Bolshevik party at that time was already formed.  And the first task of the whites was the struggle against <span>Soviet power</span> and Bolshevik ideology.  Therefore, if someone has a question about whether the Bolsheviks are red or white, then based on these facts it is easy to find an answer to it. </p><h2>  Metro Bolsheviks, features of architectural design </h2><p>  What distinguishes this station in the first place is the main symbol of the proletariat of rather impressive dimensions - Hammer and Sickle.  It was opened on the thirtieth of October, one thousand nine hundred and eighty-fifth.  And the metro called the Bolsheviks, which is located in St. Petersburg, "Prospect Bolsheviks." </p><p>  The walls of the station are very beautifully decorated with light gray marble.  The floor is laid with granite slabs of gray and red.  And the arch of the station is illuminated by powerful lamps that create an atmosphere of airiness.  The lobby is no less beautifully decorated. </p><p>  And yet, the Bolsheviks-who is this?  How necessary was the creation of this party for the country?  First of all, Vladimir Ilyich himself and the faction organized by him (which they began to call the Bolsheviks) are part of the history of the Russian state.  Whether they made mistakes or acted for the good of the people and the country, these people should take their place on the pages of textbooks and related literature.  And only he who does nothing is not mistaken. </p>
