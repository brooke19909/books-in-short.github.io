The sights of this city attract tourists from different parts of Russia and beyond.  There are many educational institutions, monuments, museums, galleries, theaters, mosques and many other unique objects.  It is about them that we will discuss further. </p><h2>  Museum of the History of Makhachkala </h2><p>  Perhaps, it is worth starting acquaintance with the city with a visit to the Museum of History.  Despite the fact that he is the youngest, here you can learn a lot about the history and culture for which Makhachkala is famous.  Sights of this city begin with this museum. </p>

    <p>  The facility was opened in honor of the 150th anniversary of the city and is located in the building of the Memorial complex near Lake Ak-Gel.  It is worth noting that the museum opened with zero funds, which is quite unusual.  However, after 5 years, its halls were filled with numerous exhibits, which appeared thanks to the efforts of both employees and citizens.  Today in the museum you can see objects of ethnography, archeology, as well as a collection of old photographs.  Thus, this cultural object perfectly fulfills the originally assigned function of preserving and popularizing the cultural and historical heritage of Makhachkala. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Theaters </h2><p>  Considering the sights of the city of Makhachkala, it is worth paying attention to the theaters located on its territory.  So, on <span>R. Gamzatov</span> Avenue <span>,</span> 38 is the Laksky Music and Drama Theater, which was opened in 1935 and named after E. Kapiev.  In the post-war years, the theater hosted productions led by professional directors invited from neighboring cities - this is what significantly raised the artistic level of the theater, the location of which is Makhachkala. </p>

    <p>  Attractions for theater enthusiasts also include the Avar Musical Drama Theater, which was founded in 1935.  A. Magaev became its creator and first director, joined by P. Shiyanovsky and <span>A. Artemov.</span>  In 1951, the theater was moved to Buinaksk, where he was named after G. Tsadasa.  However, in 1968 he was again returned to Makhachkala, where he is today. </p><p>  In the city, they did not forget about the youngest spectators who may not be so interested in the sights of Makhachkala, but they are ready to watch an interesting performance with pleasure.  For them, the Puppet Theater, located on Gamzatov Avenue, 40, works here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  City mosque </h2><p>  The religious sites of the city that deserve attention are the Central Juma Mosque, the prototype of which is Istanbul's Blue Mosque.  This object was built in 1996 at the expense of one rich Turkish family and is one of the largest in Europe.  On its territory can simultaneously accommodate about 17,000 people.  According to Imam Magomedrasul Saaduev, there are no analogues of this shrine throughout the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Museum of History and Architecture </h2><p>  It was created in 1923 at the initiative of the Russian doctor I. Kostemerevsky.  He dreamed of opening a museum and for this purpose in 1891 bequeathed a significant part of his personal savings.  However, his idea was not realized until 22 years later, when the total amount, thanks to interest, increased to the size necessary to create a museum. </p><p>  But during the Civil War, almost all collections were lost.  The restoration of the museum began only in 1923.  Some of the exhibits were transferred from museums in Russia and Georgia.  The population of such a city as Makhachkala also took an active part in the restoration.  After all, the sights have always been of interest to citizens.  Thanks to these efforts, today the museum has 16 collections, including 140,000 exhibits, including firearms and cold steel, works of fine art, ethnographic objects, etc. </p><h2>  Monuments: photos and descriptions </h2><p>  Makhachkala has many interesting monuments on its territory.  Sights, photos of which you can place in your album after visiting this city, will be a great reminder of an interesting excursion.  And among them there will certainly be a monument to Leo Tolstoy, made in the form of a large open book.  The creator of this attraction, located at the crossroads of <span>M. Gadzhiev</span> and L. Tolstoy streets, is the Dagestan sculptor Sh. Karagadzhiev. </p>

    <p>  On the station square you can see the monument to Makhach Dakhadaev, which was installed in 1971.  It was in his honor that in 1920 the city of Port Petrovsk was renamed Makhachkala. </p><p>  Another famous monument of the city is a sculpture of the five-time world champion in <span>freestyle wrestling</span> - Ali Aliyev.  The monument was erected in 1998 near the building of the sports complex. </p><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter for what reason you were in such a beautiful city as Makhachkala.  Sights (museums, theaters, monuments, mosques, cathedrals and other interesting objects) will surely attract your attention. </p>
