    <p>  As for food, the hotel has its own restaurant.  Breakfast is included in the price. </p><h2>  Seahorse Resort Spa 4 * <span>(Vietnam): reviews of</span> Russian travelers </h2><p>  Experienced tourists do not need to prove the importance of choosing the right hotel in which you plan to stay during a trip to a particular country.  This is especially true of hotels operating in the all-inclusive format popular with our compatriots.  Indeed, in this case, most of the time, guests will bring on the hotel territory, leaving it only for walks in the surroundings, shopping and trips on excursions.  Therefore, the hotel should meet the needs of travelers as much as possible so that the rest leaves only positive impressions.  According to tourists, the study of the reviews of real people who have recently had a chance to stay in a place of interest to you plays an invaluable role in the proper planning of a trip and choosing a hotel.  Indeed, in their comments, they try to touch not only on the pros, which in most cases are obvious, but also the cons, which can be important for other vacationers.  But collecting and studying reviews often takes a lot of time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

After all, travelers really liked the hotel in many ways.  Now we offer to learn about everything in detail. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  According to tourists, most of them were very pleased with the apartments offered to them at the Seahorse Resort (Vietnam) hotel.  So, the rooms here are quite spacious, pleasantly decorated in a national style.  The apartments are equipped with everything that vacationers may require.  So, here there is comfortable furniture, a TV with a Russian-language channel, a minibar, a hairdryer, an electric kettle, a safe, a balcony, a bathroom.  Many guests note large comfortable beds.  However, there is a peculiarity here - you will not find duvet covers here.  But this did not cause any problems.  As a plus, guests note the fact that the rooms have not only air conditioning, but also a <span>ceiling fan.</span>  In addition, the air conditioner is located very well, it is impossible to catch a cold under it.  Therefore, you can safely turn it on even at night.  Another pleasant feature of our compatriots considered the presence of a small window in the bathroom.  So while taking a shower, you can admire the beautiful garden.  As for the dryer for things, then it is available in the bathroom.  However, some Russian tourists prefer to dry their things on the balcony or terrace.  They advise to take from the house a small piece of rope and several clothespins.  Thanks to this, you can arrange a dryer anywhere.  Also, guests note that the rooms have bathrobes, slates, an umbrella, a sewing kit and much more that you may need during your stay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cleaning service </h2><p>  About the work of the maids of the Seahorse Resort 4 * hotel (Phan Thiet, Vietnam), our compatriots respond positively.  According to them, cleaning was carried out every day.  Moreover, the maids each time not only dusted and vacuumed, but also washed the floors, which is rarely seen even in expensive hotels.  In addition, bed linen, towels were changed daily and replenished supplies of personal hygiene products in the bathroom.  Every day, maids report two bottles of drinking water into the minibar.  The rest of its content is paid.  As for personal hygiene products, there is everything you need - toothpastes and brushes, shampoo, shower gel, cotton swabs, a razor and much more. </p>

    <p>  Also, according to the guests, if your birthday will be during your stay at this hotel, then from the administration you will be delivered to your room a small but very tasty cake, a bottle of wine and a basket of fruit.  The birthday people liked this attention. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  According to Russian tourists in their reviews, after arriving from the airport at the Seahorse Resort 4 * hotel, room keys will be handed to you almost immediately, without condemning them to long waiting.  Of course, sometimes there are situations when previous guests have not yet managed to vacate their apartments, but this does not happen so often.  The reception administrators are well aware that travelers arrive at the hotel after a long flight and several hours from the airport, so they do everything possible so as not to create difficulties for them and comfortably accommodate them as soon as possible.  If you come with heavy suitcases, then you do not have to carry them yourself.  For you, the hotel employee will do this.  Our compatriots, who were resting here, also noted with pleasure that upon checking into their room they were provided with a free fruit basket and a foot massage voucher in the hotel spa. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel in the evening, then if you wish, you can extend your stay for several hours at an additional cost.  However, it is advisable to inform the receptionist in advance about this. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Many of our compatriots in their reviews mention that they really liked the territory of Seahorse Resort Spa 4 *.  According to them, it is small, so it doesn‚Äôt take much time for guests to move between residential buildings, a swimming pool and other infrastructure.  The territory itself is very well-groomed, green.  There is a nice pond, a small river flows, a picturesque bridge is built and a small waterfall is equipped.  So walking here is a pleasure.  In addition, here you can find picturesque places for a photo shoot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seahorse resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1056771.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Insects </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the hotel is regularly treated with special chemicals.  Nevertheless, this does not allow to completely get rid of sometimes annoying insects.  However, in fairness, it is worth noting that a similar situation is characteristic of many hotels not only in Vietnam, but also in other countries popular with tourists.  As for the Seahorse Resort, the guests say that sometimes mosquitoes somewhat annoyed them.  Also, travelers recommend not to leave food in their rooms if possible, so as not to attract ants.  Otherwise, there are no problems with insects. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in Seahorse Resort Spa 4 * (Vietnam, Phan Thiet) includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, they feed very well in the mornings.  So, during breakfast, you can eat traditional Vietnamese pho soup, grilled vegetables, various fish and meat dishes, porridge, delicious pastries, various sausages and cheeses, salad, sweets.  Various freshly squeezed juices, tea and coffee are also offered.  There is always the opportunity to treat yourself to fruit.  During the day, vacationers have the opportunity to eat both in the hotel restaurant and in the many cafes in the vicinity.  According to tourists, they cook very well everywhere, and the prices will pleasantly surprise you.  Experienced travelers are advised to try different dishes of Vietnamese cuisine.  Surely by the end of the vacation you will have your favorite dishes of local cuisine. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  A big plus of the Seahorse Resort hotel is the fact that it is only a couple of hundred meters from the beach.  So guests can reach the sea in literally two minutes.  The sea here, according to our compatriots, has its own characteristics.  So, going to the beach is best in the morning.  The fact is that before lunch, waves are rare here.  However, in the afternoon, the sea often becomes turbulent, as a result of which rescuers hang out a red flag prohibiting entry into the water.  In addition, the waves are accompanied by a fairly strong wind, which may make it not very comfortable staying on the beach.  By the way, many of our compatriots preferred to be located on sunbeds, located not directly on the shore, but by the pool.  To go to the sea in this case is very close.  As for the beach itself, it is quite spacious and very clean.  Every day, workers clean algae, shells and garbage thrown by the sea onto the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel seahorse resort 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1056770.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Seahorse Resort Spa 4 * (Vietnam), according to our compatriots, is designed for a calm and measured vacation.  Therefore, you will not find cheerful animation and noisy discos here.  Hotel guests mostly prefer to relax, sitting on the sun terrace by the pool.  There is a sufficient number of sun loungers and umbrellas for everyone, there is a bar where you can enjoy a cold or alcoholic drink, as well as a snack if you wish.  As for the pools, there are two of them at the hotel - an adult and a children.  Both pools are open, large enough.  There is also a jacuzzi on site. </p><p>  Outdoor enthusiasts can play tennis or volleyball at specially equipped courts.  The hotel also has a gym. </p><p>  Those wishing to relax have access to the spa.  Here you will be offered a number of cosmetic and wellness treatments, including an excellent massage, according to our compatriots.  By the way, as tourists note, in the vicinity of Seahorse Resort there are several massage parlors.  Therefore, vacationers have plenty to choose from. </p><h2>  Water sports </h2><p>  Due to the presence of winds, this region is very popular among fans of kite and windsurfing.  According to the guests of Seahorse Resort, there is a kite school near the hotel on the beach.  Here you can rent the equipment you need for this sport and, if necessary, use the services of a coach. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Judging by the comments, our compatriots had no complaints about the employees of the Seahorse Resort hotel.  More likely, on the contrary, tourists speak exclusively about the staff of this hotel in a positive way.  According to them, the hotel employees are always smiling, welcoming, hospitable, happy to please and help guests.  As for the knowledge of foreign languages, nobody speaks Russian here.  However, you can easily explain yourself by remembering school English lessons. </p>
