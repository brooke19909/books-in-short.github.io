The emerald quarry of Chelyabinsk is one of the largest reservoirs in the forested area.  It has long been a favorite vacation spot for locals in the summer heat and during the winter holidays. </p><h2>  Geography and Ecology </h2><p>  Located in the southern part of the city, surrounded by a forest with a unique microclimate and clean air, the Emerald quarry in Chelyabinsk is far from large industrial enterprises. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pitstop.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement Park Panorama" class="if uuid-2407973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2407973.jpg"></div><p>  There is clear and clean water, as the bottom is rocky.  Pine forest, steep banks form beautiful landscapes at any time of the year, however, as elsewhere in the Southern Urals. </p><h2>  The appearance of mines </h2><p>  The region is rich in natural resources, and mining has long been a profitable business.  One of the mining items was granite and marble, which were in abundance in the nearest modern suburb of Chelyabinsk. </p><p>  200 meters from the <span>Shershnevsky reservoir,</span> where gold ore was mined, granite was mined at the beginning of the 19th century at the site of the current Emerald quarry of Chelyabinsk, then abandoned quarries were flooded.  Actually, that’s the whole story. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The road to the reservoir lies through the village of AMZ, where there are shops of various formats, as well as cafes and restaurants.  This means that at any time, vacationers can replenish supplies of drinking water, other provisions, if necessary. </p><p>  In emergency cases, you can seek medical help, as in the territory there is a large medical clinic. </p><p>  And on the opposite side of the village and in the immediate vicinity of the quarry there are two excellent sanatoriums “Emerald” and “Wave”. </p><p>  Built in the Soviet era, these health-improving institutions have been modernized with the latest technology and enjoy well-deserved popularity among citizens in any season. </p><p>  If in the hot summer days they swim here, play beach games, then in winter there is more entertainment.  You can have a great time fishing in the winter at the Emerald quarry of Chelyabinsk.  Previously, according to experienced fishermen, in a pond you could catch a pike.  The current situation has not yet been commented on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pitstop.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zine View of the Emerald Quarry" class="if uuid-2407976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2407976.jpg"></div><p>  And for outdoor enthusiasts, slides for tubing and sledding were organized, ski runs were laid, and an ice rink was set up on ice.  For fun feasts zones with barbecue facilities, bath houses in Finland were equipped. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter fun" class="if uuid-2408366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2408366.jpg"></div><p>  All this is united by one name - Ice-Park "Emerald" amusement park.  Opened in 2013, unfortunately, it is currently going through hard times, and many structures are unfinished and are already collapsing under the influence of natural factors and time. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  The biggest plus is the love and care of the townspeople for the reservoir.  Beginning in August 2016, on the shore of the Emerald Quarry of Chelyabinsk, the “Clean Beach” campaign has been held.  The initiators were public eco-organizations.  The event was attended not only by environmental volunteers, but also by local residents and vacationers.  During the season, thus, the Emerald Pond cleared of three tons of garbage. </p><p>  Of the minuses, the fact of the appearance of this garbage is worth mentioning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pitstop.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Natural relief" class="if uuid-2408015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2408015.jpg"></div><p>  The second significant drawback is the lack of nearby public transport.  There are good parking for cars, but without a personal vehicle you have to walk. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.1240247" data-lng="61.33372399999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/4/4/7/2447.png"></div><p>  Here are the options for getting to the Emerald quarry in Chelyabinsk: </p><ol><li>  First you need to get trolleybus number 5, 7, 11, 12, 16;  buses No. 51, 66;  minibuses number 14, 17, 29, 36, 40, 48, 66 to the stop "Energy College".  And then 5 kilometers through the Chelyabinsk city forest on foot along the popular trodden paths. </li><li>  But you can reduce the walking time by taking minibuses No. 14, 17, 36, 40, 48 to the stop “Prospect Shop”.  Then for a walk on foot will remain 2 kilometers on the street.  Obskaya and st.  Shakhtostroevskaya directly to the sandy beach. </li></ol>
