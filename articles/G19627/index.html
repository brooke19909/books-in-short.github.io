But sometimes you want to relax from them!  Leave your children in the care of your grandmother, you will come to the resort ... And there the kids scream, run, scream and rage, and at the same time strangers.  In order to free adults from all the hardships of parental concerns, the concept of the Edalts ONLY hotels was invented.  Persons under the age of sixteen are not accepted at such hotels. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about one of these "hotels for adults" - Numa Beach Hotel 5 * (Alanya).  We will supplement the description of the hotel with reviews and photos taken by tourists from Russia.  Until September 2016, this hotel had a different name - Sunprime Numa Beach.  But the owner remained the same.  This is the Numa Hotels hotel chain.  Numa hotels are known on the Alanya Riviera for their high level of service.  Their rating is a stable 4.8 out of five points. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Numa Beach Hotel 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2123640.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Numa Beach Hotel 5 * (Turkey) administratively belongs to the village of Avsallar.  It is located 21 kilometers west of Alanya.  The difference between Avsallar and other Turkish resorts is that it is always several degrees higher than in neighboring areas.  A unique microclimate is created by hills and a bay protecting Avsallar from the north winds.  Here even small, but no less sweet bananas ripen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Getting to the hotel will not be difficult.  After all, Avsallar is located on the highway that connects Alanya with Side.  The last resort with the ruins of the ancient city is located forty kilometers from the hotel.  Daily on this route mini-buses "dolmushi" ply.  You can get from Alanya to Avsallar in half an hour.  Antalya International Airport is one hundred and forty kilometers.  Tourists should prepare for a two-hour shuttle.  But if your plane lands at Gazipasa (Alanya) airport, then the distance from the ramp to the hotel will be only 60 km.  Numa Beach Hotel 5 *, is located on the very shore of the Mediterranean Sea and has its own beach.  It is located on the territory of the ancient port (II century BC. E.). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Numa Beach Hotel 5 Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2123637.jpg"></div>
