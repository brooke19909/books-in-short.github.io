He was lucky because he is surrounded by mud and salt lakes of Iletsk, which can easily compete with the Dead Sea.  It is natural that a <span>balneological resort</span> was to appear on their shores <span>.</span>  <span>These are the</span> main attractions of Sol-Iletsk. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to mud, water and speleotherapy, you can tidy up the nervous, reproductive, skeletal systems and get rid of long-term non-healing ulcers.  Those who value their health come to the resort.  In addition to the listed types of therapy, treatment with koumiss and medicinal herbs, watermelons and melons is offered here. </p><p>  Together with all the lakes, Sol-Iletsk occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äã53 hectares.  In the composition of the bottom silt mud of the lakes, in addition to a high concentration of brine, there is a certain amount of bromine.  Environmentalists are sure that these are the main attractions of Sol-Iletsk.  Photos of the lakes are decorated with local calendars and tourist souvenirs. </p><h2>  Features of the collapse lake </h2><p>  Razval Lake is distinguished by its impressive size, a real gem of a resort town.  Each of the other six healing reservoirs - Small and Big City, Dunino, Tuzluchnoye, New, Hungry funnels - is inferior to it in occupied area, but their value does not decrease from this. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The water of the upper layers of the lake. Collapse is very warm.  But with further immersion, after overcoming the five-meter mark, a decrease in temperature is observed.  At the very bottom, it is below zero -12 degrees Celsius.  This indicator does not change throughout the year.  This phenomenon is explained by the absence of convection flows; the upper and lower layers are not mixed.  But during severe frosts, the lake is not covered with ice. </p><h2>  How much salt is in the lake? </h2><p>  In terms of salt content - 320 grams in one liter of water - Razval Lake is almost not inferior to the famous Israeli Dead Sea.  Since the density of brine (brine) in the lake exceeds the same indicator of the human body, the buoyancy force, according to the <span>law of Archimedes,</span> will not let the swimmer drown.  In water, it is as if in a state of weightlessness.  A high concentration of brine does not contribute to the development of living organisms in a reservoir, i.e.  <span>the lake is dead.</span>  Only on some coastal areas where salt is covered with a ball of loam does solonchak vegetation occur. </p><p>  Steep shores of three to nine meters are characteristic of the Razval Lake.  These are layers of <span>rock salt,</span> which gradually dissolve in lake water. </p><p>  Sights of Sol-Iletsk are not only monuments and museums, but also famous salt ponds. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the resort on the Iletsk Lakes </h2><p>  About the benefits of mineral water in the Iletsk lakes, the local population guessed many centuries ago.  The healing properties were discovered by the Kyrgyz and Bashkirs, who were healed in the lakes from various ailments.  After this steppe region became part of the Russian Empire, salt was mainly mined here, which was used as a food product. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The situation changed after 1856, when, by order of military officials in the settlement of Iletskaya Zashchita, the lakes were directly used.  Here was built the first resort for the so-called "weak team" - lower military ranks, including soldiers from Uralsk.  They had the opportunity to heal in the baths.  The heated baths were filled with brine from the lakes and were located in the ‚Äústudy rooms‚Äù for procedures right on the shore.  Each "office" was fenced with wattle fence.  Nearby were accommodations for vacationers. </p><p>  At that time, Sol-Iletsk was famous throughout Russia.  Recreation, attractions and wellness procedures are combined into a single program.  People dreamed of going to the miraculous shores in order to regain their strength and regain health. </p><h2>  Sanatorium development </h2><p>  In subsequent years, the resort developed, transformed, gradually acquiring the features of a full-fledged medical institution.  In the second half of the 19th century, the tenant Lebedev (from local residents) seriously began to equip the sanatorium on 50 tithes.  The resort contained a staff of doctors.  At the disposal of visitors, everyone who needed treatment, were salt mud, warm baths, as well as swimming in cool lakes.  These sights of Sol-Iletsk were highlighted in the first place. </p>

    <p>  The truly miraculous properties of salt waters of Sol-Iletsk are evidenced by the case, which was described at the beginning of the last century by Professor N.N. Fenomenov.  The condition of a woman who was exhausted after a complicated operation to remove uterine cancer improved significantly after she took baths with healing salt water. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Not only lakes are famous for the city of Sol-Iletsk.  Sights of a different level will be interesting to all tourists and vacationers in sanatoriums: </p><ul><li>  Open Air Museum "Cossack Kuren".  Here, the visitor learns how the Cossacks lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  From the city it is 25 kilometers along the Kural River. </li><li>  Pokrovsky <span>Cretaceous Mountains,</span> created by nature about 70 million years ago on the site of a pre-existing ancient sea.  In the thickness of the written chalk are the remains of ammonites (extinct mollusks). </li><li>  The Church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God, in the design of which the Russian-Byzantine style dominates.  The temple was built in 1902 at the expense of citizens and public organizations. </li><li>  <span>The salt mine</span> is deep underground (300 meters), the ceiling height is almost thirty meters. </li></ul>
