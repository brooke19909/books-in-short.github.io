This device is purchased by those people who are easier to scan photos at home, when you do not need to work with films and slides, and for rare scans you do not want to pay in services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiamart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canon lide 120" class="if uuid-2949466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2949466.jpg"></div><h2>  Product Description </h2><p>  In reviews of the Canon Lide 120 they write that the device weighs a little - no more than 1.6 kg.  Its dimensions: 25 x 37 x 0.4 cm. The device is an update of the previous version of Lide 110. It is on its hardware base that the described scanner works.  Resolution - 2.400 ppi.  There is a slight difference in software between them.  There are features in the form of updated features and restrictions.  The manufacturer did not add a photo editor, so you can‚Äôt immediately edit the photos.  However, there is My Image Garden, a utility that allows you to slightly adjust the scanned files.  In addition, a text recognition function has been added.  Due to this, immediately after scanning in PDF format, you can search the text. </p><p>  According to reviews on Canon CanoScan Lide 120 scanners, the device does not have a built-in system that would import all captured images to the cloud.  However, it is possible to install a utility that allows you to save files in a directory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.superkomputer.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scanner Packaging" class="if uuid-2949481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2949481.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the scanner is a tablet.  The process of copying the image is carried out using a contact sensor.  Color source: 3-color LEDs.  Resolution 2,400 at 4,800 pixels.  It is possible to select a resolution: range 25-19200.  Interface Hi-Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãUSB 2 version. </p><p>  The color gradation at the input is 48 bits, at the output 24/48 bits, as for black-and-white scanning, the indicators are 16 bits and 8 bits, respectively.  The maximum size of documents is A4 and Letter.  There are 4 keys on the Canon Lide 120 that provide scanning. </p><p>  The device consumes from 1.5 watts in standby mode to 11 mW in the off state.  In operation, power consumption is 2.5 watts.  The scanner can operate in a humidity range of 10 to 90% and at temperatures between 5 and 35 degrees.  Compatible with almost all operating systems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="egypt.souq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canon lide 120 reviews" class="if uuid-2949471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2949471.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of work with the scanner </h2><p>  The reviews on the Canon Lide 120 scanner indicate that it is easy to work with the device.  There are four keys, control is also carried out through a computer.  The installer installs drivers that make working with the scanner easier. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thanks to the keys, you can copy the file, send it by e-mail, scan in PDF format, perform the AutoScan function.  The latter function allows you to process images in JPG and PDF.  In this case, the scanner itself determines which one to choose.  In the reviews they write that the device is very rarely mistaken.  In the settings, you can change the functions of the buttons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meta.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canon lide 120 scanner" class="if uuid-2949469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2949469.jpg"></div><h2>  Scan quality </h2><p>  The Canon Lide 120 Scanner works well, according to customers.  Many people prefer to work with automatic mode.  If the result is not satisfactory, you can always change the scan settings.  Thanks to the Advanced mode, you can access most of the options that are not recommended for people without experience.  For beginners, there is a special Basic mode.  A minimum number of functions are available in it. </p><p>  Special settings were added to the basic settings: the ability to change resolution, brightness, contrast are complemented by a color recovery function.  It works perfectly and perfectly copes with "resuscitation" of any shades.  Fine spots from dust can be removed using the function designed to remove dust and scratches from the photo.  However, the latter are difficult to fight.  They even remain after processing by the program.  A similar nuance is typical of such a function. </p><p>  During testing, the Canon Lide 120 performed perfectly.  Thanks to him, high-quality images are obtained.  Color reproduction at a good level.  Moreover, the scanner perfectly conveys small parts that other devices cannot cope with.  We are talking about such nuances as glare and so on.  Differences from the original photos are almost invisible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.currys.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scanner canon canoscan lide 120 reviews" class="if uuid-2949476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2949476.jpg"></div><h2>  Document scanning </h2><p>  Unfortunately, using such a scanner for office purposes is prohibited.  There is no automatic document feeder, so working with a lot of papers will be terribly inconvenient.  At home, working with text files, when there are not many, the described device will be more than enough.  After scanning, if the file is converted into accessible text for editing, formatting is lost. </p><p>  Of the advantages of the device, it should be noted that the scanner uses a little electricity.  This is due to the fact that it is connected via USB.  The scanner is operated through an LED light source that does not have mercury and does not require heating.  Thanks to this, energy is saved. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Canon Lide 120 scanner is perfect for the role of an inexpensive device that can work with both print files and photos.  The device has a low price and a nice interface.  However, if you need a scanner in order to work with a large number of text documents, then it is better to look for more expensive options from this or other manufacturers.  In general, in terms of functionality, they do not differ much from the described device, but in terms of ease of use, the latter is significantly inferior to specialized devices. </p><p>  Among the advantages, it is worth noting the ability to scan a text file in PDF format with a search, the presence of a color recovery function and the high quality of the resulting photos.  The disadvantages of buyers include poorly designed software that does not allow you to edit scanned images.  If this nuance does not bother the buyer, then you can safely take a scanner! </p>
