    <h2>  Login </h2><p>  The first thing we need is to register with the Sberbank Online service, and then go through authorization there.

Enter your identification code (easier login) on the official page of Sberbank Online, and then enter the password below.  A message with a special secret code will arrive on your mobile phone.  Enter it in the appropriate box.  This is a confirmation that the real user decided to use the services.  Are you done?
