  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Household Appliances Needed For Making Juice And Cocktails</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the shelves of shops you can find many blenders and juicers of various modifications.  Our task is to choose those that are useful for daily use, with which you can easily cook various goodies from fresh fruits, berries and vegetables, which are loved not only by children but also by adults. <br><br>  First, a few words about blenders.  They are of two types.  Some are very convenient and quick to crush solid foods: nuts, crackers, etc., while others are ideal for preparing a variety of cocktails with the addition of juice, milk, ice cream, etc. <br><br>  In this case, we are interested <noindex>  <span>blenders</span> </noindex>  second type.  This is a device with a bowl, at the bottom of which the knives rotate, they perform the tasks: grinding and mixing the products.  He is able to beat whites, and even crack the ice.  The speed of the operation depends on the engine power: the more powerful - the faster the smoothies and milkshakes will be prepared.  For a large family, buy a device with a large cup.  Remember that the technical specifications indicate the volume of a full bowl, but it is not recommended to fill it to the top, so 200-300 ml should be taken from the figures indicated by the manufacturer.  Blenders with plastic containers are more affordable, with glass containers - more expensive.  But glass weighs more, and it can break.  Plastic absorbs odors and eventually loses its original appearance. <br><br>  It is hard to imagine a healthy breakfast without a glass of freshly squeezed juice.  When choosing a device for its preparation, the following points should be considered.  In this case, we are interested in a device for daily use, capable of making several glasses of juice.  There are appliances specifically for citrus fruits.  Universal model - <noindex>  <span>vegetable juicer</span> </noindex>  and fruits. <br><br>  The first type is a cone with a motor.  To press the juice, you must yourself keep the cut fruit.  However, there are models with special holders, but they cost an order of magnitude more expensive.  Most often, juices from oranges and tangerines are obtained with a high content of pulp, but modern models allow you to control its concentration.  Juicers, the cone of which rotates in one direction or the other, are more productive, they are able to squeeze out more wholesome drink. <br><br>  When choosing a universal juicer, pay attention to its type.  Cylindrical have a high efficiency, but they are not able to put pressure on the juice of the whole large family without additional purification of the sieve.  Without a break, they can press 2-3 glasses of juice - this is quite enough for a small family.  Choose juicers that are equipped with a grater speed adjustment feature.  To effectively squeeze juice from soft berries and hard vegetables, you must use different modes. </p></div></article>
