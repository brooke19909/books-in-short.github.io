IP without a current account</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An individual entrepreneur may open a r / s for conducting his activities in any bank at his discretion.  Moreover, such an action is not the obligation of the entrepreneur.  However, if an IP decided to work without a current account, a lot of questions will appear about how to settle accounts with partners, receive payments from customers and others.  Sometimes the only way to solve these problems is precisely r / s. </p><h2>  How much is needed </h2><p>  In the coming 2019, account opening is carried out in the same way as before.  The relevant agreement with the bank is concluded on a voluntary basis.  The current account plays an important role in the financial activities of the entrepreneur.  Thanks to him, it is possible to separate the funds received in the process of commercial activity from personal money.  It is easier to compile and report, as well as exercise control over the fulfillment of obligations under the contract. </p><p>  An additional guarantee when concluding contracts is provided by the bank details of the IP settlement account.  Payments reflected in the bank statement confirm the solvency of the entrepreneur in the event that borrowed money is required.  The bank is more likely to issue loans to individuals whose activities are characterized by financial stability. </p><p>  If payments exceed 100,000 rubles, then cash will not be limited.  Is it necessary to open a current account for individual entrepreneurs in this case?  Yes.  In addition, wholesalers usually prefer cashless transfers when transferring large amounts of money. </p><p>  In the case of retail, more and more people prefer to pay with a plastic card.  In this regard, the need for this bank account becomes even greater. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.entrepreneur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banks for IP" class="if uuid-3133238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3133238.jpg"></div><h2>  Can I use a personal account? </h2><p>  Some entrepreneurs use their own personal bank account for their activities, where they store their own savings.  To some extent, this is beneficial, namely: </p><ol><li>  The fee for maintaining an individual‚Äôs account is significantly lower than the cost of servicing a current account for individual entrepreneurs. </li><li>  You can withdraw cash with less restrictions than with a current account. </li></ol><p>  The rest of the personal and settlement accounts are almost no different from each other.  So, money coming from third parties may well be credited to the personal account. </p><p>  An individual entrepreneur has the right to pay taxes and settle accounts with his suppliers.  Banks also issue plastic cards, with which you can conduct payments remotely. </p><p>  Also, entrepreneurs sometimes use a deposit account for settlements.  However, this is inconvenient, since the use of funds stored in such an account, as a rule, has different restrictions, as well as an additional commission when transferring to third parties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ghanatalksbusiness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Documents for opening a current account" class="if uuid-3133487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3133487.jpg"></div><h2>  Responsibility for using a personal account </h2><p>  The Central Bank is obliged to use deposits and accounts of individuals exclusively for accumulative purposes that are not related to commercial activities.  The Central Bank of the Russian Federation obliged banks to open settlement accounts for doing business.  At the same time, for the fact that this rule is neglected, legal liability for IP does not arise.  Therefore, even if the bank security officers find out that the personal account is used for commercial purposes, fines will not be imposed on individual entrepreneurs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In an effort to fulfill the obligation of the Central Bank, some financial organizations in the purpose of payment require customers to add the phrase that the money transfer is not related to commercial activities.  However, such a requirement is illegal. </p><p>  If the entrepreneur gave himself a negative answer to the question of whether an individual entrepreneur needs a current account, he also does not always remain honest with the financial institution in which he opened a personal account.  So, using it for commercial purposes, the IP does not indicate the basis of the payment, which is true. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SP current account: payments" class="if uuid-3133258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3133258.jpg"></div><h2>  What can lead to the use of a personal account for commercial purposes? </h2><p>  Such an approach for an entrepreneur can be risky for the following reasons: </p><ol><li>  The bank may delay the transfer of funds if the counterparty indicated in the corresponding line ‚ÄúIP Ivanov I. I.‚Äù  instead of "Ivanov I.I."  Such a delay will be explained by the fact that the name of the recipient does not correspond to the status of the owner of the personal account, and therefore the payment cannot be identified. </li><li>  The use of a personal account will raise questions from customers, especially if the entrepreneur himself asks not to indicate ‚ÄúIP‚Äù in the name of the recipient. </li><li>  In addition, regular payments may be of interest to regulatory authorities.  If there are personal receipts among commercial payments, they can be included in the tax base of individuals.  In this case, the tax service will charge a corresponding fine, and the funds will accrue income in contributions. </li></ol><p>  This situation can only be dealt with through the judiciary.  Moreover, going to court is not a guarantee that it will be possible to return the payments listed erroneously. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the bank finds a violation when using a personal account, it can terminate the contract with the client and close the account.  Many banks warn that it is impossible to make commercial payments on a personal account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IP without a current account" class="if uuid-3133248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3133248.jpg"></div><h2>  Bank selection </h2><p>  Having answered the question of whether a current account is required for an individual entrepreneur, positively, the entrepreneur proceeds to the choice of a financial organization.  At the same time, it is worth asking about where it is located in the reliability rating.  This is especially true in cases where the country has an unstable economic situation and banks often have their licenses revoked. </p><p>  The second most important factor in accordance with which a bank is selected for individual entrepreneurs is the cost of servicing the account.  The size is set by the financial institution, but may increase depending on the payments made by the account holder.  Also, a certain amount must be paid for opening a settlement account. </p><p>  When choosing a financial organization, you must first familiarize yourself with the rates.  In addition, it is worth finding out about the timing of the transfer of funds.  Reliable banking organizations strive to transfer money during the day.  You can also ask about the necessary documents for opening an IP settlement account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsb.stanford.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is a checking account mandatory for individual entrepreneurs" class="if uuid-3133245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3133245.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents for opening </h2><p>  Different banks require their own package of securities.  But the main ones include the following: </p><ol><li>  Identification. </li><li>  Registration certificate. </li><li>  INN </li><li>  Extract from the USRIP. </li></ol><p>  Also, the bank will need to fill out an application, a customer questionnaire, as well as a card with the possibility of signing and concluding an agreement.  If you have all the necessary documents with you, the procedure does not take much time. </p><h2>  Nuances when opening an account </h2><p>  Documents should be provided in the original.  If necessary, the bank will make copies.  It should be borne in mind that some of them have a limited period of validity.  For example, an extract is relevant for a month.  After that, you need to order a new document. </p><p>  After signing the contract, you need to carefully study all the items and find out the prices.  If in any doubt, you can contact a lawyer for advice. </p><p>  Separate banks for IP are asked to put a print of the seal.  However, individual entrepreneurs are not required to use a stamp in their work.  Therefore, many of them assure the contract only with a signature. </p><h2>  Bank Rating </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.franchisegator.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The cost of servicing a current account for individual entrepreneurs" class="if uuid-3133260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3133260.jpg"></div><p>  As of the beginning of 2019, experts have developed the following best banks for entrepreneurs: </p><ol><li>  "Point". </li><li>  Tinkoff. </li><li>  Promsvyazbank. </li><li>  "Modulbank". </li><li>  "East Bank". </li><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  Sovcombank. </li><li>  "Expert Bank". </li><li>  LokoBank. </li><li>  "Opening". </li><li>  Ural Bank. </li><li>  Bank Zenit. </li><li>  "Alfa Bank". </li><li>  Raiffeisen Bank. </li><li>  VestaBank. </li></ol><p>  Let's consider some of them.  The "point" began to be chosen by many businessmen, especially at the start of entrepreneurial activity.  It offers free service and favorable offers from partners of the bank.  In addition, IP can register through a special online service. </p><p>  Tinkoff Bank is convenient in that you do not need to go anywhere to open a current account, since the manager himself comes to the office with the necessary documents and a card. </p><p>  Promsvyazbank is an organization with state participation.  The Central Bank recognized it as one of the systemically important in the country.  It is also one of the 3 largest banks in Russia.  Therefore, the license of such an organization will not be recalled for sure.  It offers free service and opening, as well as some fixed translations. </p><p>  Modulbank is a project of former employees of Sberbank.  Positions itself as a financial organization for small businesses.  A very convenient site, fast technical support and the ability to perform operations through online banking, as well as a mobile application. </p><p>  Whether an entrepreneur needs a checking account, the entrepreneur decides for himself.  But if he decides in favor of opening, then at present he can choose a suitable financial institution from the many profitable options presented above. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.entrepreneur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do I need to open a current account for individual entrepreneurs" class="if uuid-3133243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3133243.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of a current account </h2><p>  Having dealt with the question of whether a checking account is required for individual entrepreneurs, it is necessary to compare the advantages and disadvantages of its availability.  Economically p / s has both positive and negative properties.  The main benefits include the following: </p><ol><li>  Current account provides excellent safety of money. </li><li>  Settlements with counterparties become comfortable and transparent. </li><li>  Tax authorities do not closely monitor money transfers, since this function is under the supervision of the bank itself. </li><li>  An IP can manage money remotely through an online banking system. </li><li>  Transfer and return of taxes with the help of r / s is much more convenient and reliable. </li></ol><p>  At the same time, it is impossible not to say about the shortcomings.  You will have to pay for settlement and cash services, and in some cases to visit the bank, for example, to obtain an extract and collection. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Do I need a checking account for an individual entrepreneur?  By law, you can do without it.  However, the benefits of the presence of r / s, of course, more.  Therefore, in order to conduct business in a normal mode, it is advisable to open this bank account and entrust the financial organization to control cash flows. </p>
