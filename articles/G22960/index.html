The latter circumstance led to the fact that representatives of monarchist movements left the political arena, and a struggle for power unfolded in the government.  The unsuccessful offensives of the Russian army on the front led to an aggravation of the situation, which contributed to new internal disasters. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The July crisis of 1917 erupted as a result of accumulated contradictions between various factions that fought for influence in the cabinet.  Until June of that year, the leading position was occupied <span>by the Cadet Party,</span> which, however, quickly withdrew from the political arena.  The Octobrists and Progressives could not stay at the helm.  But, despite this, the remaining groups continued the struggle. </p>

    <p>  The primacy passed to the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who supported the <span>Provisional Government</span> and advocated an alliance with the Cadets.  Another influential group was the Mensheviks, who were not uniform power.  However, they also advocated an alliance with the interim government and with the bourgeoisie.  Both parties were inclined to the need to wage war to a victorious end.  The reasons for the July crisis of 1917 are that there was no agreement at the top of the government regarding the fate of the country and its continued participation in hostilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The participation of the Bolsheviks </h2><p>  This party demanded the provision of power to the councils.  The Bolsheviks were the only force that opposed the Provisional Government and demanded Russia's withdrawal from the war.  They became especially active after the return of Lenin to the country in April of the year under review. </p>

    <p>  A few months later, mass demonstrations took place in Petrograd under Bolshevik slogans.  The demonstrators demanded Russia's exit from the war and the transfer of power to their local cells.  The July crisis of 1917 began in the early days of the month.  In response, the government ordered the protesters to be shot, and also issued an arrest warrant for the leaders of the Bolsheviks. </p><h2>  Accusations </h2><p>  The party was accused of conducting subversive work in the country with German money and deliberately organized an armed uprising against the official authorities. </p>

    <p>  As regards this problem, two points of view have been established among scientists.  Some researchers believe that Lenin really enjoyed the support of Germany, which was interested in Russia's military defeat.  Other historians argue that there is no reason for such a conclusion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So that the reader can get at least some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow and in what sequence events unfolded, we put brief information on this topic in the table. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  date </td><td>  Event </td></tr><tr><td>  July 3-4 </td><td>  The beginning of mass demonstrations in Petrograd under the Bolshevik slogans for Russia's withdrawal from the war and the transfer of power to the Soviets.

    <p>  The new leader tried to maneuver between the groups, but he still could not achieve at least some stability in the country.  The July crisis of 1917, the results of which led the Bolsheviks to embark on an <span>armed uprising</span> , caused a new military uprising, which almost led to the fall of the government. </p>

    <p>  This is a speech by General Kornilov.  His rebellion was suppressed with the help of the Bolsheviks, whose positions were significantly strengthened after the incident, which facilitated their coming to power in October of the aforementioned year. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The July crisis of 1917 contributed greatly to the success of the coup. The table in this review shows the main chronology of events.  After the execution of the demonstrators, Lenin wrote a new work in which he announced that the peaceful phase of the revolution had come to an end.  Thus, he substantiated the need for an armed overthrow of power.  Another important result of the crisis was the elimination of dual power in the country.  This was due to the departure of the Bolsheviks underground.  One of the most pressing issues remained the problem of the country's participation in the war. </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  The July crisis of 1917 showed the weakness of the Provisional Government and its inability to solve the problems of the country's development.  Subsequent events further strengthened the influence of the Bolsheviks, who without much difficulty seized power in just a few months.  Therefore, the rebellion in question should be considered the penultimate one in a series of crises that shook the supreme power in the summer of the said year. </p>
