    <h2>  Karlovy Vary </h2><p>  So, you arrived in the Czech capital, examined all the sights, and now you want to make yourself an impression of other parts of the country.  And of course, the idea comes to you to visit the famous health resort, which was famous even during the Soviet Union, - Karlovy Vary.  The beautiful resort town is like a gingerbread house, comfortably nestled among the greenery of the hills, with amazing water properties.  Then you need to think about the optimal route Prague - Karlovy Vary.  How to get there on your own?  There are many options.  You can order a transfer or taxi, rent a car, and go to the resort by public transport.  It can be a train or a bus.  Now we will consider how it will be faster, better and more comfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Car </h2><p>  How to get to Karlovy Vary from Prague on your own?  A car is the best way.  The distance between both cities is one hundred and thirty kilometers.  By car, even taking into account traffic jams and speed limits, it is easily overcome in two hours.  If you have rights, it‚Äôs cheaper to rent a car.  Then you will pay a maximum of sixty euros for a full day (including the cost of gasoline).  Fuel on the way back and forth will take about twenty liters.  The cost of gasoline in the Czech Republic is about 30 crowns per liter of the 95th and 28 crowns per diesel. </p><p>  And your path will pass through the lovely towns of Rakovnik and Kladno.  The fastest way to get to Karlovy Vary is if you leave on the road number 6 when leaving Prague. Route E 48 will take you directly to the resort.  Please note that parking in Czech cities is paid.  If you want to leave the car and still not give any money, look for parking near a supermarket, a shopping center or in a residential area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Karlovy Vary how to get there on your own" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1718068.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Taxi and transfer </h2><p>  A trip to Karlovy Vary from Prague can be independently provided by ordering a car with a driver.  It can be either a private car or a minibus.  Typically, companies that provide such services operate on a one-to-one basis.  That is, you are taken away from home and taken exactly where you need it.  As a rule, the company requires fifty percent advance payment.  The transfer cost is quite high - from 140 to 170 euros.  Travel time is about one and a half hours.  Transfer can be ordered at any time of the day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you prefer a taxi, then the average price for such a trip is about 85 euros.  It‚Äôs best to order a car online.  Then the cost of your trip will be determined in advance.  And even in the case of traffic jams, you will have to pay no more than a hundred crowns.  Sooner or later in the morning or later in the evening, a taxi is almost the only way to get to Karlovy Vary.  Nothing else goes there at this time of day. </p>

    <h2>  Bus Prague - Karlovy Vary </h2><p>  This mode of transport is easily accessible to this famous Czech resort.  Almost all flights depart from the main Prague bus station, which is called Florenc.  It is easiest to get there by metro.  Moreover, this <span>station of the</span> same name with a <span>bus station</span> is a hub.  There intersect lines C and B. Well, if you are light, walk.  From the historic city center to the bus station is only a quarter of an hour's walk.  In the morning, especially in fine weather, the walk will be enjoyable. </p><p>  Buses run frequently, from half past six in the morning until almost ten in the evening, every thirty minutes in the morning, and after 18.00 - every hour.  A ticket costs 170 kroons.  You will spend a little more than two hours on the way.  The main carrier is a company that started with budget travel for students.  Her cars are easy to recognize, they are yellow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Buses, by the way, are very comfortable.  They are with leather chairs, air-conditioned, there are sockets and headphones, decently catches Wi-Fi (and the whole trip), and on the way you have the right to a cup of coffee or tea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour choice.  Keep in mind that the bus in Karlovy Vary makes two stops.  The first is Trznice, opposite the Albert supermarket.  The second is the bus station (the railway station is also nearby).  From both stops to the resort center about ten minutes on foot.  But it will be necessary to go back precisely from the railway or bus station.  Therefore, it is more practical to get to the end station in order to understand where to return from. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus Prague Karlovy Vary" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1718065.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When and how to pay for a bus ride </h2><p>  Experienced tourists are advised to buy tickets in advance, and online.  All carriers have sites with the English version.  Then you pay by card and have the opportunity to choose a place.  Especially buying tickets in advance is necessary for morning flights.  The fact is that many guests of the Czech capital also prefer to travel to Karlovy Vary from Prague on their own.  Most often, they go there for one day, and already return in the evening.  Therefore, buses may be crowded.  In this regard, tickets are best taken round-trip, especially on weekends.  It must be borne in mind that each company has its own travel documents, which it sells only on its flights.  They also have their own schedule. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="A trip to Karlovy Vary from Prague on your own" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1718054.jpg" width="538"></div>

    <h2>  A train </h2><p>  This is not the fastest option on how to get to Karlovy Vary from Prague on your own.  Unlike two hours, for which a bus arrives at the resort from the capital, the train requires as much as three and a half hours.  After all, his route is completely different: he makes a detour through the north of the country, and therefore the distance overcomes almost twice as much.  But the landscapes that open from the windows of the car are much more picturesque. </p><p>  Trains to the resort leave from the <span>main Prague train station</span> named after <span>Tomas Masaryk.</span>  This is a large beautiful building with arched ceilings.  It is located in the city center.  A red metro line stops there. S. Direct flights to Karlovy Vary about eight a day.  You can also go with a change in Usti nad Labem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Karlovy Vary how to get" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1718067.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Railway tickets </h2><p>  The price of a train ride will cost more than three hundred crowns (if you count without discounts).  For such a price, you buy them at the station at the box office or in vending machines directly at the train station.  If you take tickets for stocks, then they can be as cheap as bus ones.  It is convenient to take tickets on the English site of Czech Railways.  Just type in the form ‚ÄúPrague - Karlovy Vary‚Äù. </p><p>  How to get there by train and not overpay?  Pay attention to the terms of the shares.  Discounts are provided to a group of people (even a married couple or two friends are considered to be such), children under the age of fifteen.  If you buy round-trip tickets, it is always cheaper.  The price is also reduced when ordering a trip for one and a half to two weeks. </p><p>  By the way, if you decide to take a ride in other small towns in the Czech Republic, keep in mind that often there are no stations, train stations, or even automatic machines.  You just get in the car and wait until the controller comes to you.  Then you call the station where you sat down, and if there really was no ticket office, you will be sold a regular ticket, no extra charge.  And if it was possible to purchase a travel document there, then they will charge an additional fee. </p><h2>  <span>Prague</span> International <span>Airport.</span>  Karlovy Vary: how to get there </h2><p>  The cheapest and easiest way to do this is to take a bus.  Almost all flights from the Florenc bus terminal pass through <span>Prague's Vaclav Havel Airport.</span>  Just keep in mind that in this case, the more you need to buy a ticket in advance.  After all, the likelihood that you will find free space is almost zero.  After all, the flight is passing.  But from <span>Prague airport</span> to Karlovy Vary, you can also get on your own by bus, whose terminal station is not far from the hub.  It is located right at the exit of the building, under a white canopy.  Buses depart every half hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get from Prague to Karlovy Vary" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1718007.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  By plane </h2><p>  Alternatively, you can take a plane directly to Karlovy Vary.  The airport has been open at this world-famous resort since 1929.  Aeroflot planes fly there too.  The eighth bus runs from <span>Karlovy Vary Airport</span> to the city.  However, tourists are not advised to fly to the resort by plane from Prague.  It‚Äôs expensive, and often takes longer to complete in time than on the same bus or train.  After all, you have to arrive at the hub in advance, wait for check-in for the flight, and then still go from the airport to the city. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who were interested in advance with the question of how to get from Prague to Karlovy Vary are very satisfied.  They did not have to miss crowded buses and get nervous.  They also leave positive feedback about their trip.  Independent trips on buses deserved the best reviews.  It is fast, cheap and convenient.  The salon not only serves hot drinks, but also plays movies and videos.  From the bus station to the city center can be reached on foot.  But if you are tired and want to return by transport, this is easy to do.  The resort has 18 bus routes and two cable cars.  The latter also carry public transport tickets. </p><p>  Travelers are also not advised to come to Karlovy Vary for just one day.  Thus, in their opinion, you will not see the main thing and you will not feel the city.  It is better to go for two or three days and stay somewhere for a couple of nights.  And it‚Äôs easier to leave back in this case.  You can stay in Karlovy Vary in hotels, in the private sector, and in inexpensive hostels.  But if you get out only for a day, try to make it sunny.  Then you are guaranteed pleasure. </p>
