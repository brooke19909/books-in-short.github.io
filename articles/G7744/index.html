And it is especially relevant for those locals who daily have to go to work in Moscow and return home in the evening.  Mytishchi is a fairly large city <span>near Moscow region</span> with well-developed industry in various areas and numerous research centers.  Transport problems here have been brewing for years.  Their optimal solution, of course, would be the subway.  Mytishchi are adjacent to the Ring Road, and it would seem that the right decision to continue the Kaluga-Riga line for it.  Moreover, the Chelobityevo metro station is indicated on the orange line as the terminal.  But in reality, things are much more complicated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro mytishchi" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/315340.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h3>  How long will Mytishchi live without the metro? </h3><p>  <span>Chelobitevo metro station</span> should be built three kilometers northeast of the MKAD.  But at present it exists only on paper.  No real construction work is being done either at the station itself or on laying a tunnel stage in its direction.  Moreover, the Moscow authorities are thinking about whether or not the Mytishchi metro will do at all.  This question is constantly being thrown into the information sphere, and the reaction to it has been closely studied.  In the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãnear Moscow, the</span> problem of the construction of the metro has long been the duty declaration on the intention to build it on the part of all local officials entering the phase of the election campaign.  Residents of Mytishchi without a metro simply cannot imagine their future.  They are tired of recognizing themselves as Muscovites of the second grade.  The metro for <span>the satellite city of Moscow</span> is a matter of paramount importance.  But the authorities clearly want to save financial resources in this direction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mytishchi metro station" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/315341.jpg" width="496"></div>  As an alternative, a project of the so-called light metro is thrown to residents, the final point of which should be the Mytishchi station.  This kind of metro does not need to be built at all, it means the delivery of passengers with special electric trains along the already existing railway section to the Yaroslavsky railway station of the capital.  With all its cheapness, this option has many disadvantages.  The main one is the fact that the light metro will not be integrated into the general scheme of the Moscow metro.  On <span>Komsomolskaya Square,</span> passengers will have to switch to a regular subway.  And for some reason, such a perspective does not please many. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when they will build the metro in Mytishchi" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/315339.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h3>  What is new about the metro in Mytishchi </h3><p>  Recently, a number of official statements have been made by senior officials from the Moscow administration.  But they did not bring the slightest clarity to the question of when the metro would be built in Mytishchi and what it would be like.  The public was simply informed that the decision was postponed.  The cost of various options is currently being analyzed.  The final decision is expected to be made after 2014. </p>
