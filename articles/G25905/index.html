    <h2>  To the office of communication </h2><p>  The first scenario, as a rule, is not very popular with customers.  Indeed, for its implementation, you will have to independently come to the office of a mobile operator with a request to turn off the Internet.  And now, customers don‚Äôt really like to go to such places, wait a few hours for their turn, and then get an answer in just a minute.  Nevertheless, this is one of the ways to turn off the Internet (MTS) on the phone. </p><p>  Take your passport with you, and then your phone.  Now you can go to your operator‚Äôs mobile office.  Wait for your turn, and then inform the employee of their intentions to abandon the Internet.  Sometimes you may be asked for <span>passport data.</span>  This is necessary in order to establish your rights to the number.  Next, transfer your phone to an employee (sometimes this may not be necessary), and then wait for the result.  In a few minutes you will receive a message that confirms the rejection of the Internet.  It is not so difficult to bring our idea to life.  With MTS, you can turn off the Internet on your phone using other methods.  Which ones?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  How to disable Internet MTS on the phone?  For example, you can resort to the use of the World Wide Web.  More precisely, a personal account on the official website.  What does that require?  Let's understand this issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable internet pay on the phone" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867744.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that the first step is to go through the authorization on the official website of the mobile operator.  Now, when you complete this step, you will be able to think about how to turn off the Internet MTS on the phone.  In the window that appears, you will have to select "Services", and then find your tariff plan.  Look carefully at the "Internet" item.  If you click on this line, then you will have several available functions.  Find "Disable" there, and all problems are resolved. </p><p>  In fact, this is a great approach that will help answer how to turn off the Internet (MTS) on the phone.  In truth, this is the way most clients registered on the site use it.  You do not have to wait in line or long request processing.  A few clicks - and now there‚Äôs an alert about the rejection of Internet services on your phone.  Nevertheless, there are a number of rather interesting and simple options for the development of events.  Which ones?  Let's try to deal with them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  application </h2><p>  <span>How to disable the Internet</span> on MTS?  Useful tips that we have already considered are far from all approaches to solving the problem.  The thing is that you can use a special application from the operator.  It is called MTS service.  And this particular program will help you realize the idea. </p><p>  Go into it on your gadget.  Now, if you want to give up the Internet on your phone, just click on "Services" and then select "Internet" there.  Find your plan, and then select it.  You will see a number of available actions.  In the same way as with the official site.  Now click on "Disable" and all problems will be resolved.  You wait for the SMS notification, and then rejoice at the achieved result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay internet disconnect on the phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867745.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In fact, the use of the MTS service is not such a frequent occurrence.  Why?  Because the processing of such requests, as a rule, takes a lot of time.  And this is not particularly pleasant for customers.  Let‚Äôs try to figure out how to disable the Internet (MTS) on the phone using other methods. </p><h2>  We call the operator </h2><p>  Well, now that we are already familiar with several options for the development of events, the time has come to resort to the most popular methods.  For example, you can try to call your mobile operator and refuse to provide the Internet by phone. </p><p>  To implement it, to be honest, just dial 0890 and then wait for an answer.  Now communicate your intentions.  Sometimes you may be asked for passport details.  They are necessary to establish the rights to the number.  This is usually not necessary.  Only in exceptional cases.  After that, wait a while. </p><p>  You will receive a notification on your phone that will contain a text stating that the access to the World Wide Web has been denied.  As a rule, this kind of ‚ÄúSMS‚Äù comes within 5 minutes after a conversation with the operator.  Maximum - 10. And no more. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the considered option has one significant drawback.  This is the risk of getting into a voice call to a robot.  So, in order to get to the Internet disconnection, as a rule, you will have to spend about 15-20 minutes of "virtual conversation".  Not a particularly pleasing fact.  Thus, let's try to implement our idea by other methods.  Which ones?  Now we will try to get to know them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable mobile internet on mts" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867746.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Messages </h2><p>  Another rather interesting approach is the use of SMS requests.  They will help to answer how to turn off the Internet (MTS) on the phone.  True, there is a plan of action for each tariff.  And now we will get acquainted with all the options for the development of events. </p><p>  If you have the ‚ÄúBIT‚Äù tariff activated, you can dial 2550 and send a message to 111. ‚ÄúSuper BIT‚Äù is disabled using the combination of 6280, ‚ÄúMini BIT‚Äù - 620, <span>‚ÄúBIT Smart‚Äù</span> - 8649, ‚ÄúSuper BIT Smart‚Äù - 8650. Now it's enough just to pick up and wait for an alert from the operator.  It will also come to you in the form of a message.  It will say that you have abandoned the mobile Internet.  In addition, a combination will be written there that is suitable for reconnecting.  That's all the problems are solved. </p><h2>  Teams </h2><p>  So, the final step can be considered special USSD-commands.  As a rule, now many users use this method.  To be honest, for each tariff you have to use your own combination.  What are they like?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable internet on pay useful tips" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/867747.jpg" width="600"></div>

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If you have ‚ÄúBIT‚Äù connected, then dial * 252 * 0 #, for ‚ÄúSuper BIT‚Äù use * 111 * 628 * 2 #, ‚ÄúMini BIT‚Äù - * 111 * 62 * 2 #, ‚ÄúBit Smart‚Äù - * 111 * 8649 #, "Super BIT Smart" - * 111 * 8650 #.  After you type the appropriate command, click on "Dialer".  And now it remains only to wait for the results.  You receive an SMS notification, and then rejoice at the achieved result.  As a rule, many people use this approach.  That's all the problems are solved.  Now you know how to disable the Internet (MTS) on the phone. </p>
