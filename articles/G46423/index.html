    <h2>  Which resort in Turkey is the best </h2><p>  Many people, tired of constant stress and fuss at work, think about such a vacation, where there would be only relaxation.  And often they like Turkey.  This is not surprising.  A flight to Turkey from Moscow, for example, is not as expensive as to Thailand, and the quality of service, according to reviews, is better than in Egypt or Tunisia.  But which resort to choose?  The most popular destinations among Russians are the Anatolian and Aegean coasts.  They are completely different.  <span>Antalya resorts</span> are usually popular with lovers of shopping, entertainment, nightlife and huge five-star palaces with all-inclusive.  And the Aegean coast is suitable for those who want to ride the sights of ancient Asia Minor and look at the "Europeanized" Turkey.  Therefore, it all depends on your preference. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kusadasi resort - what you should know about it </h2><p>  This city is located south of Izmir, in other words, the ancient Smyrna, which is mentioned in the Gospel.  Therefore, if you are a lover of various monuments of antiquity, then this place is for you.  In addition to Smyrna, there are still such ancient cities as Miletus, Didim and Ephesus.  Yes, and a beach holiday here is good.  The city of Kusadasi is located on the coast of the Aegean Sea.  Not far from it is the Dilek National Park.  The history of the city begins with the fact that once these places served as a refuge for pirates.  And now this is a famous resort with well-developed infrastructure.  It is full of nightlife, many clubs, bars and discos.  Kusadas fish restaurants are known all over the coast.  And the local beaches are good in that they are interspersed with picturesque secluded bays.  The most famous attraction of the city is the Genoese fortress on the Pigeon Island.  He gave the name to the city itself.  This 16th-century fort looks great both from land and from the sea, and is connected to the mainland by embankment.  Kusadasi resort is also good because it is perfect for independent travel.  It is a major transport hub, and from its bus station you can reach all <span>major cities in Turkey.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ephesia Hotel 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2106632.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  From the hotel to the sea - no more than a hundred meters.  The coast near the hotel is sandy, equipped with umbrellas, sunbeds, mattresses.  It has a blue flag for cleanliness.  Although the strip of sand is very narrow there is always enough space, you do not need to get up early in the morning to take a sunbed.  Therefore, beach lovers really appreciate the Ephesia Hotel.  Sea with shallow entrance, warm.  Depth begins meters after a hundred.  There are many water sports on the beach at an additional cost.  This is riding a "banana", and surfing, and canoeing.  The sea is often worried, it is turbulent, especially after lunch.  May cause algae.  But the waves are usually low, not too dangerous, jumping into them, at least for an adult, is a pleasure.  Along the sea there is a beautiful walking path.  In the evenings people leave the hotels there for a walk.  The hotel also has two outdoor pools, one of which is a children's pool.  Near them is a green lawn, where the servants put umbrellas and sunbeds.  You can always have a good time there if the wind blows on the beach.  You can lie on this lawn even at night, no one will drive you away.  Beach towels are issued on deposit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ephesia Hotel Sea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2106631.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  First of all, guests of Efesia Hotel write that they walk around the resort, the beautiful Guzelchamly embankment, parks and the surrounding area.  Many people buy boat excursions on a yacht or boat in the bays and nearby islands.  Of course, one should not disregard the ancient Greek cities, which are simply ‚Äúscattered‚Äù like pearls near Kusadasi.  And if you apply for a Schengen visa, which is very easy to do in the summer at any travel agency, you can take a ferry ride to the homeland of Pythagoras.  This will not be difficult, because the Greek <span>island of Samos</span> is located a few tens of kilometers from this resort. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Since the Ephesia Hotel is mainly in demand for children, it is probably better not to go here for people who are prevented by screaming and running around during the day.  On the other hand, here you will not see drunk orgies or anything indecent.  The contingent from different countries as a whole behaves very dignified.  There are few Russian tourists here, mainly the British, Germans, Danes, Belgians, Poles, as well as local residents.  Good soundproofing in the rooms, so you can sleep well.  The staff is working, friendly, helpful.  Many guests write that after staying at this hotel they no longer think about which resort in Turkey is the best.  They would just love to come back here again.  Tourists like it even more than some of the "fives." </p>
