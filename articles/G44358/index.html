A striking example in the history of science of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation is the family of academicians Scriabin, which will be discussed in the article.  The most outstanding, of course, can be called the oldest member of this dynasty - Konstantin Ivanovich Scriabin. </p><h2>  Academician Scriabin Sr. </h2><p>  In 1878, the future scientist was born, the luminosity of microbiology of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union.  They called the baby Konstantin.  By 1905, the young Scriabin had already graduated from the Yuryev Veterinary Institute, having received higher education.  Just after graduating from a university in the Russian Empire, a wave of revolutions began, because of this he had to look for a job for a rather long time.  But after 2 years he managed to find a place in Central Asia, where he worked as a veterinarian.  From 1917 to 1920, Scriabin worked as a professor at the Don Veterinary Institute.  At this time, his son was born.  The scientist lived for 93 years and was buried in the city of Moscow.  Everyone knew Academician Scriabin as a very <span>intelligent person,</span> who was not only an outstanding scientist, but also an excellent family man.  During his life, he received many awards of state significance, including the title of academician, as well as the Lenin and Stalin Prizes, which at that time was extremely prestigious.  His merits also include the upbringing of two prominent figures in biology: the son of George and the grandson of Constantine. </p>

    <h2>  Academician Scriabin: biography </h2><p>  Son George was the next in a series of famous academics.  He was born in 1917 in the city of Petrograd.  Georgy devoted his whole life to science and research, for which, during his lifetime, he was awarded many prizes of national importance in the Soviet Union.  <span>The Order of Lenin, the Order of the</span> October Revolution, the State Prize of the USSR ‚Äî all this deserved one person.  Academician Scriabin was an outstanding luminary in the field of microbiology and biochemistry of microorganisms.  To this day, his <span>scientific works</span> are studied at universities in many CIS countries and not only: he made a huge contribution to the development of domestic science.  Georgy Scriabin lived 71 years and died in 1989, was buried in Moscow.  After himself, he left many works, research reports, and another talented biologist - his son. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Konstantin Scriabin Jr </h2><p>  As already customary in this family, a scientist with a capital letter reappeared.  Born in the post-war period, in 1948, Konstantin received a very good education.  In 1970, he graduated <span>from the Faculty of Biology of Moscow State</span> University.  Lomonosov.  The young man had clearly decided that he would follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, devoting his life to science.  In 1970, at the age of 22, he began work as a graduate student at Moscow State University and since then he has not left science for a year and has been fruitfully engaged in molecular biology, and later that he has breathed new life into this field - genetic engineering.  The contribution that this scientist made to the development of Russian science cannot be overestimated, therefore he can proudly say about himself: "I, Konstantin Scriabin, is an academician." </p>

    <h2>  Government facilities </h2><p>  A huge scientific heritage was left by the most senior academician Scriabin.  A street named in his honor bears its name naturally: it houses the Moscow State <span>Academy of Veterinary</span> Medicine and Biotechnology named after  K. I. Scriabin.  It was renamed back in the days of the Soviet Union, which testifies to the universal recognition of the genius Konstantin Ivanovich, and in those days it was a fair veneration of talent and merit.  Until 1973, the street was called Kuzminskaya, at the moment, only a small part of it remained with a historical name.  Although it is worth noting, many people believe that the name unites all three well-known academicians of the family, which greatly flatters Konstantin Jr.  In general, in all countries of the former Soviet Union, there are streets that are named after such a famous person as academician Scriabin.  The street is not the only one, just as it is not the only university bearing this name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Helminthology as the main direction of scientific research </h2><p>  Academician Scriabin, whose biography is not filled with any superinteresting facts, lived a busy life in science.  His work left a bright mark in biology and medicine.  Helminthology - a science that studies the structure and behavior of parasitic worms, as well as the diseases caused by them in humans and animals, was the main activity.  During the youth of Scriabin Sr., the name of this sphere <span>did not exist either;</span> all worms were studied by zoologists without any connection with medicine or veterinary medicine.  The academician, living in the East, noted that people are very often affected by the parasite paragonimus, and the picture of the course of the disease is very much like tuberculosis, which has repeatedly led the doctors astray.  Since then, the science of helminthology began to develop, and all thanks to the outstanding academician Scriabin. </p>

    <h2>  As a result </h2><p>  It was this family that made a huge contribution to the development of Russian science.  We can say that three lives were given to scientific and research work, which makes us respect these people as geniuses in their field and take an example from them.  One can only hope that the Russian land has not become scarce with talents who will put their whole soul into work, sparing nothing for their beloved work.  Everyone can become a specialist in any field, the main thing is desire and motivation, and this is often not enough for <span>modern youth,</span> which is very unfortunate to realize. </p>
