    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Lawsonia Hotel Apartments (Cyprus) is located next to the busy roadway, the hotel rooms are always quite quiet.  The fact is that they do not overlook the road, but the sea.  Therefore, you will be ensured not only silence, but also a magnificent view.  In general, the rooms, according to our compatriots, are quite spacious, comfortable, pleasantly decorated.  Here you will not find much luxury, but all the furniture and appliances are of high quality and in good condition.  Guests in their reviews note that the rooms have everything you need.  So, in addition to basic furniture (beds, cabinets, tables and chairs) and appliances (TV, phone, refrigerator, air conditioning), here you will find a full kitchenette with a full set of dishes (pot, pan, kettle, cups, plates, forks , spoons, etc.).  Therefore, you can always save on food by buying products in the market and in the supermarket and preparing food directly in your apartment.  Also, tourists liked the spacious balconies with plastic tables and chairs.  Here you can spend your time enjoying the view of the sea and the surrounding landscapes.  As for the TV, as noted by travelers, you will not find Russian channels here.  But you can always take a flash drive with recorded films or programs from home.  Some complaints from guests related to the Internet.  You can connect to it at the hotel for an additional fee (about 30 euros per week).  However, the connection speed, according to our compatriots, leaves much to be desired.  Therefore, it is best to get a SIM card of a local mobile operator with a mobile Internet package upon arrival.  It will be cheaper and will allow you to always be in touch. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Many tourists who visited the Lawsonia Hotel Apartments 3 * (Cyprus, Protaras) note that even in case of an early arrival at the hotel, they were given the room keys almost immediately.  Of course, this is a big plus, because for sure you will want to immediately unpack your things and go to the sea, and not wait for the checkout time, sitting in the lobby. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, according to the rules, the occupied apartments should be vacated before 12 noon.  However, as former guests note, this hotel very often meets tourists and allows you to stay in your room for a few more hours if you need to leave the airport later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lawsonia hotel apartments 3 cyprus protaras" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1267202.jpg" width="600"></div>
