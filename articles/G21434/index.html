This applies to both the natural and cultural features of the peninsula, located at the junction of the eastern and western worlds, the disappeared civilizations and replacing one another state.  Some of them managed to be present here in one time interval.  An example of a witness to such events is the Funa fortress in Alushta. </p><h2>  What is remarkable? </h2><p>  The name "Funa" is translated from Greek as "smoky."  It received its name in honor of <span>Mount Demerdzhi.</span>  Funa Fortress is just built at the foot of this beautiful peak of the southern coast of Crimea.  Incidentally, the legendary "Caucasian Captive" and other Soviet films were filmed in these places. </p>

    <p>  In ancient times, the Small Silk Road passed through this place, going from Gorzuvit (Gurzuf now) and Aluston (Alushta in modern times) to Kafu (now Feodosia). It was not by chance that a fortress appeared on such a popular trade route to protect trade caravans, but at the same time to collect money from them for the possibility of passage. </p><p>  Fortress Funa was listed as part of the Orthodox <span>Principality of Theodoro,</span> who was in constant confrontation with the Genoese and Muslims.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fortification was small - 56 meters wide and 106 meters long.  From the western side it entered the rock, and from the rest it was covered with defensive walls of 15-meter height.  The Funa fortress was first mentioned in 1384.  But in most of the sources, the end of the construction of the complex dates back to 1422. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Long story </h2><p>  A powerful earthquake that occurred immediately after this date led to the fact that the fortress was rebuilt again already in 1425.  But the tests did not end.  And the blows of the elements were replaced by repeated fires, each time literally incinerating the fortress of Funa.  In 1459, a significant reconstruction was carried out in the building, which transformed this structure into a castle.  After that, a three-tier dungeon was built at the entrance gate with a height of 15 meters and a wall thickness of 2.3 meters.  It contained the apartments of the heir to the Theodore throne. </p><p>  In 1475, the fortress was again damaged, this time by the Ottoman Turks.  The most preserved was the temple dedicated to <span>Theodore Stratilates</span> - the holy and great warrior of the time of the Byzantine emperor Constantine I, nicknamed the Great.  Then, in 1475, Crimea was captured by the Turks, who finally destroyed the Funa fortress.  And all the locals left this place after the huge collapse that happened in 1894, which buried the former glory of this complex. </p>

    <p>  Now the important role in the historical heritage of the architectural ensemble of the Fun fortress is played by the ruins of the church of St. Theodore Stratilates, the best preserved during the attack of the Ottoman Turks.  The church was repeatedly rebuilt and renovated, therefore it existed until the beginning of the 20th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not far from the ruins is the so-called blocky chaos in the form of a heap of pieces of rock, stones of various sizes.  This is material evidence of a powerful collapse of 1894, as well as subsequent smaller disasters.  So, a very noticeable damage to the remains of the structure was caused by the Yalta earthquake of 1927. </p><h2>  Archaeological finds </h2><p>  When excavating the complex in the masonry walls, archaeologists discovered charms.  The builders of the fortress in masonry, most likely to protect themselves from dark forces, walled crosses with the relics of saints.  A marble stone was discovered with the date of construction of the building and the princely symbols of Theodoro.  A copy of this find is set in front of the entrance. </p>

    <p>  After the capture of Crimea by the Nazi invaders in the footsteps of local legends about the Queen of the Goths and the treasures of the Gothic crown hidden in these places, large excavations were organized.  They did not lead to any significant results, but the legends of the buried crown are still alive. </p><h2>  Current state </h2><p>  Today, the Funa fortress is a ruin, which is a pile of stones on the site of a two-story church, a front yard and the whole of Funa with merchants' shops, tavernas and apartment buildings.  Only the only fragment of the church apse hanging over a large garden by the road recalls the former grandeur of the fortification.  Inspecting the ruins, one can easily imagine the scope of construction and the power of fortification, the width of the walls of which in some places reached two meters. </p>

    <p>  A semicircular ledge is visible above the ruins - the apse, which once served as the altar of the fortress church.  The altar was almost intact until the thirties of the last century.  Nearby were residential buildings, on the site of which there is now only a pile of stones.  About three hundred meters north of the ruins are the burials of residents of the village and the Funa fortress. </p><h2>  Museum work </h2><p>  Today, at the location of the former fortress is an open-air museum.  On its territory, tourists are greeted by a layout showing the view of the existing fortress.  Almost from all cities of Crimea tours are organized here.  The cost of a tour of the open-air museum is the lowest.  Walking along the nearby cliffs is free.  The museum is open from 8:00 to 17:00. </p>

    <h2>  Funa Fortress: how to get there? </h2><p>  An important advantage of Funa is its accessibility for tourists.  Tourists pass by her, traveling from Simferopol to Alushta.  Stopping along the road, in just an hour and a half you can explore the ruins that the real medieval fortress of Funa left behind.  A memory photo against the backdrop of the famous Crimean landmark must definitely remain in your album. </p><p>  This interesting <span>monument of archeology</span> and medieval architecture is located north of the village of Luchistoe, about two kilometers from it.  You can get from Alushta by regular bus from the city bus station.  From the Luchisty side, a little lower than the Kutuzovsky fountain, an <span>asphalt road passes.</span>  You can drive by car.  By the way, in the Radiant itself there is an opportunity to ride horses.  A number of companies organize these excursions. </p>
