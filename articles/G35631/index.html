A huge contribution to the development of human civilization was made by scientists and dreamers.  But no less merit is the warriors: during the campaigns they studied the face of the planet, made a map, got acquainted with the variety of flora and fauna.  Powerful conquerors, terrifying all coastal lands, and brave travelers, conquerors of water and skilled traders.  I wonder who we are talking about?  Of course, these are the Vikings.  Their ship was both a home, and a means of transportation, and the last refuge in which they went to another world.  The significance of this building in the life of the Scandinavians is difficult to overestimate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vikings ship" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/304432.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The scarcity of nature, difficult living conditions determined not only the <span>occupation</span> and nature of the Vikings.  It was reflected in the development of the culture of their neighbors, both closest and more distant.  The Scandinavians lived in the clans ruled by the Konungs.  Often these sea kings did not have their own land holdings, but controlled a certain water area.  All members of their clan entered their squad and went camping.  The Vikings, whose ship was considered the main wealth and value of the tribe, were required to carefully take care of the ship.  He was sheltered from the weather, stored in a special barn when not in use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what were the Viking ships called" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/304433.jpg" width="293"></div>

After all, this building was not only expensive, but also time-consuming and complicated.  Equipment and provisions were also stocked up by joint forces - all further life of a community depended on a successful campaign. </p><p>  In that distant era, ships of various types were built by Vikings.  A ship of one kind was intended for sailing at the <span>mouths of rivers</span> and along the coast cut by fjords.  Others were more stable and maneuverable, so they boldly went to the waters of the Atlantic.  With the development of seafaring, ships became larger with a higher carrying capacity.  Already at the end of the tenth - at the beginning of the eleventh century, the Norwegian kings could launch a ship fifty meters long, for which thirty or more pairs of rowers were needed.  Also brave Normans made extensive use of sail. </p><p>  What were the Viking ships called?  ‚ÄúBig Serpent‚Äù, ‚ÄúDragon‚Äù - they terrified the English, Germanic and French lands only by their appearance.  Undoubtedly, they were the pride of their owners, therefore they were decorated very skillfully.  Carved <span>wooden sculptures</span> (snake, dragon head) were installed at the stern or bow of the vessel.  They not only frightened enemies, but also protected from evil spirits.  They were filmed on land, since the Scandinavians believed that their monsters could anger the local gods. </p><p>  There is no doubt that some astronomical knowledge was not alien to the brave sailors.  The Vikings, whose ship reached the territory of America much earlier than the Columbus expedition, were well oriented by the stars.  <span>Icelandic sagas</span> mention driver stones and sun stones: perhaps these were the predecessors of the modern compass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="viking ship photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/304430.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  The ship - this is exactly what allowed the Vikings for a long time to dominate the sea and ocean.  He introduced them to distant lands, previously unknown food, and also helped them establish cities and entire states in the depths of the mainland. </p>
