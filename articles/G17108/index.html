    <h2>  Elabuga in antiquity </h2><p>  The opening of the Ananyinsky burial ground near this city, dating from the VIII-V centuries.  BC  e., and studies of the Elabuga settlement and adjacent territories, allowed scientists to conclude that this settlement arose at the turn of the X-XI centuries.  The mysterious tower of the Devil's Hillforts is a witness to medieval events.  Once there was a ferry across the Kama River.  And it is also known that near the settlement in the XII century a white stone mosque with eight towers was erected, similar to architectural structures in Bulgaria.  Now only the remains of the ruins are visible at this place.  This is the only building of the pre-Mongol era that has survived to our time.  Archaeologists have found that in the IX-X century BC.  e.  the Bulgarian state included the ancient city of Alabuga (Elabuga).  Its sights are described in historical sources.  First of all, it is the ‚ÄúElabuga hillfort‚Äù described above, which, in fact, is the remains of the ancient city of the Bulgarian state.  One of its towers was restored, and now it is a place of pilgrimage for tourists coming to the city and believers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City Formation </h2><p>  Subsequently, a monastic cloister arose on the site of the Devil's Hillfort.  It happened in 1614.  Then the Trinity Monastery grew up, which was subsequently abolished.  By the same time, the foundation of the village of Trekhsvyatsky can be attributed to this.  Historians suggest that the name of the settlement was due to Ivan the Terrible, who, after the conquest of Kazan, laid the Church of the Intercession here and personally granted it the image of the Three Saints.  This ancient relic is still kept in this church.  A map of Elabuga with landmarks is presented below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of elabuga with landmarks" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12064/471117.jpg" width="550"></div>

During the reign of Empress Catherine II, the village received the status of a county town.  At that time, only about 1000 residents lived in the village.  But in the XIX century, the heyday of industry began here.  And by the beginning of the 20th century, Elabuga already totaled more than 10,000 inhabitants.  There were many merchants here, among whom 12 were millionaires.  The well-known dynasty of the Stakheyev merchants supplied bread not only to the regions of Russia, but also to the countries of Europe.  The local businessmen Ushkovs founded the first chemical plants in the Kama region, which in terms of production size were the largest and most profitable enterprises of this kind in then-Russia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Damn hillfort" </h2><p>  What is famous for Elabuga?  Its sights are so diverse that not a whole day will be enough to visit them all.  The symbol of the city is the tower "Devil's hillfort". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="elabuga sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12064/471132.jpg" width="600"></div>  This unique historical monument was once a tribal settlement of one of the local tribes.  In the X century, a Bulgarian fortification was built here.  Now most of the structure is destroyed.  Only the corner tower is preserved, which is a hollow stone building of cylindrical shape, covered with a metal domed roof.  It is worth noting that even in this form this ancient relic came to us thanks to the efforts of the merchant I.V. Shishkin, who in 1867 at his own expense organized the restoration of the building on the old foundation and covering it with iron.  The original masonry, consisting of uncouth stones, was preserved only on the north side.

    <h2>  Places of worship </h2><p>  The largest temple in Yelabuga is the Cathedral of the Savior Cathedral, which was consecrated in 1821. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral of the Savior" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12064/471136.jpg" width="600"></div>  Famous artists and academics participated in the mural of this magnificent building: the brothers Vereshchagin, I. A. Osokin, and Bruni.  The five-headed building with a five-tiered bell tower was created in the spirit of classicism.  Once, before the revolution of 1917, the cathedral was richly decorated, striking visitors with a large number of gold and silver jewelry and precious salaries.  The main shrine of the temple is the miraculous image of Christ the Savior.

    <p>  Another worth noting is the Intercession Cathedral, built in the Empire and Baroque style with elements of classicism.  The time of its creation also falls on the XIX century.  On the territory of the city there is also a functioning female Elabuga Kazan-Bogoroditsky monastery, founded in 1856. </p><p>  Another place that you should definitely visit when you are in Yelabuga is the St. Nicholas Church.  Her wooden "progenitor" existed in the XVII century.  In the next century, the building found stone walls.  Subsequently, the temple was rebuilt at the expense of parishioners.  Thanks to donations, the church had a rich decoration.  The main shrines of the temple are the icons of the Miracle Worker Nicholas and the Savior, the Holy Chalice, found near Mamadysh in the first half of the 18th century.  The very first church in Elabuga is Pokrovskaya, built by decree of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.  In 1813, it was rebuilt in stone.  It was later restored. </p>

    <h2>  Jamig Mosque </h2><p>  We should also talk about the next attraction of the city.  <span>The</span> Jamig <span>Cathedral Mosque</span> was built here in 1992-1999 according to the project of the architect F. Sh. Galiev.  This is a modern building.  To create it, the highest point of the city was chosen.  The mosque is richly cleaned.  Its ceiling is crowned by a huge glass chandelier weighing 500 kg, made at the Saratov glass factory.  The floor is covered with 27 emerald-colored carpets brought from Tajikistan.  The height of the minaret is 57 meters.  Every day, dozens of Muslims rush here to make prayers. </p>

    <h2>  Natural monuments </h2><p>  Where else you should definitely visit when you are in Yelabuga?  There are two unique <span>natural monuments:</span> Red Hill and the Holy Key.  The first of them owes its name to the red color of the cliffs of the high bank of the Kama River.  This amazing place was once depicted by the famous artist I. I. Shishkin in his painting ‚ÄúKrasnaya Gorka near Elabuga‚Äù.  Looking at a water source called the Holy Key, one involuntarily recalls another work of the same master called ‚ÄúThe Holy Key near Elabuga‚Äù.  The monument is dedicated to St. Panteleimon, to whom all Orthodox Christians pray for deliverance from disease. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="elabuga sights" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12064/471143.jpg" width="375"></div>
