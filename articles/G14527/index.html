    <p>  Although the head unit on Android may be different on each car, but the main characteristics are similar on all devices: </p><ul><li>  The processor in this unit is usually set to medium capacity.  In most devices, it goes 2-core at 1-1.5 Ghz. </li><li>  RAM is also designed to perform simple manipulations.  It is installed on 512-1000 Mb. </li><li>  Internal memory plays a big role, since the standard device can be used as a DVR.  As a rule, these devices come with a small memory, but in such cases you can install an additional SD-card. </li><li>  The recorder contains an acceleration sensor.  Usually it has the following characteristics: 1.3MP sensor, 30fps. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Android head unit" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1187920.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Regular devices, as we have already found out, have many functions and necessary parameters.  Let's consider them better. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The head unit on Android has a resistive, but rather responsive screen.  Like a tablet, you don‚Äôt need to press it with great force.  Also usually comes with a stylus.  Most of these modern devices are covered with a matte film, due to which fingerprints become invisible.  It should be noted that in the sun the screen is readable, although dull. </p><h2>  BLUETOOTH Hands Free </h2><p>  The head unit on Android cannot work as a headset, because of this it is necessary to connect the phone.  Only basic functions will work in such a system: receive a call, dial a number, go to the list of dialed and missed calls.  In some devices, you can go to the contact list and dial a number, respectively, when you call, you can see who is calling.  You can also include music from your phone.  Only Bluetooth allows you to work with other devices, but with their help you can not access the data of the car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android multimedia headunits" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1187938.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rear View Camera </h2><p>  You can <span>connect a rear view camera</span> to a standard device <span>.</span>  This is a great feature, it can be used by everyone who does not have a built-in "native" screen.  If you have one, then you won‚Äôt be able to connect an additional camera. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  DVR </h2><p>  The DVR can go as a set, or separately.  This is a good feature to help you prove your worth on the road.  You can install it both in conjunction with the GU, and separately.  If you choose the first option, you will be able to watch recorded videos from the screen.  In this case, the quality will be poor, this is due to the fact that the signal passes through the analog port. </p><p>  Videos will be recorded to internal or external memory (up to 32 GB).  To watch your videos, you must go to a special program.  On some standard devices, videos are recorded in a non-standard format, so opening up on a computer may not work. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the quality of the videos leaves much to be desired.  In sunny weather, the quality of the videos drops dramatically, there are highlights.  But still, the DVR will cope with its task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="head devices for android reviews" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1187916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Networking features </h2><p>  The head unit on Android usually has two USB outputs.  The first is useful to connect WiFi, and the second is necessary for a 3G modem.  As a rule, WiFi is built into the device and works well.  Perfect for surfing the Internet, pages load pretty quickly, the browser works smartly.  But the 3G modem will have to be bought separately. </p><h2>  Loading </h2><p>  The standard device boots up quickly, usually this procedure takes up to 1 minute.  A good feature is that the device automatically downloads the last running application, but this only applies to "native" programs, third-party ones will not start. </p><h2>  Multitasking </h2><p>  The head staffing device has a relatively simple multitasking.  Embedded applications can run in tandem with third parties.  It will look like this: you connect the navigator and turn on the radio, they will work together.  During the trip, you will play music, and you can hear the navigator, but from time to time it will muffle the song. </p><h2>  Music and video player </h2><p>  The head unit has built-in players.  But they do not always work adequately.  Sometimes they can "get out" various errors or simply the device will not include ordinary music of the MP3 format.  Movies have the same problems, but most formats play.  It‚Äôs better to immediately install a good player so that later there are no unnecessary questions and problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android head unit" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1189190.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  Each standard device has a built-in navigation program.  Usually they automatically update maps and are quite convenient. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Android multimedia head units have great sound.  Most of these models have clear and bright sound.  This allows you to enjoy music on the road. </p><p>  These were all the built-in qualities of standard devices on Android.  Additional applications, the necessary programs can be installed from the GooglePlay service.  All devices support external drives, so you can freely download all the necessary applications, movies, music, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android head unit" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1187915.jpg" width="600"></div>
