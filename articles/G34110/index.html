What is the mythology of the Scandinavians about him?  You will find answers to these and other questions in the article.  Siegfried (Sigurd) is one of the most important characters in the Scandinavian-Germanic epic and mythology.  He is the protagonist of the Song of the Nibelungs. </p><h2>  Mythology </h2><p>  The characters of <span>Germanic-Scandinavian mythology are</span> amazing.  Scandinavian odinism is part of ancient Germanic mythology.  The basic source of data about him are the works “Younger Edda” (prosaic) and “Elder Edda” (poetic) by S. Sturluson of the 12th century A.D.  e. </p>

    <p>  Around the same period, in Danish Acts, the Danish chronicler Grammatik Saxon broadcasts many stories of legends.  Valuable information about the mythology of Ancient Germany is in the "Germany" of Tacitus. </p><h2>  The origin of the legend </h2><p>  So who is Siegfried?  In mythology, what is said about him?  The question of the starting point of this epic personality has not yet been fully clarified.  Some wanted to see in it an epic gleam of memories of Arminius (historical prince of the Cherusks), who defeated Vara in the <span>Teutoburg forest</span> .  Most likely, Siegfried, next to Hagen and Brünnhilde, is the bearer of the mythical central motif of the saga, which was later joined by other, partly historical details. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The saga is based on the common Indo-European myth (demonic or divine), which is interpreted in different ways: some find in the hero’s struggle with enemies a mythical expression of the change of night and day, darkness and light, others - summer and winter.  Therefore, Siegfried is identified with the <span>thunder god</span> Thor (Donar), then with the <span>god Balder,</span> then with Freyer.  Depending on this, Brünnhilde is understood either as terrestrial vegetation, or as spring, or the sun.  There are also scientists (Heinzel, Fischer) who in the legends about Siegfried see the result of the merger of several legends and myths. </p><p>  The Song of the Nibelungs is magnificent.  The form in which the basic motive was preserved in it, he received on the Rhine from the Franks.  From here he, not earlier than the VI century, passed to other Germanic peoples, including Scandinavia.  Here the name Sigfrid, incomprehensible to people, was replaced by the name Sigurd.  There, the legends about his father, Sigmund, and his ancestors, available on the mainland, were richly developed.  The Welsung Saga connects the genus of the hero with Odin, the supreme deity. </p><h2>  Siegfried </h2><p>  What is Siegfried in mythology?  He is the son of the Frankish Queen Siglinda and King Sigmund, a royal from the Lower Rhine.  Siegfried - the winner of the Nibelungs, who captured their treasure - the Rhine gold.  He has all the features of an epic ideal hero.  He is courteous, brave and noble.  Honor and duty are above all for him.  In the “Song” his extraordinary physical power and attractiveness are constantly emphasized. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Plot </h2><p>  The “Song” of which we spoke above is an epic medieval poem written by an anonymous author in the 12th-13th centuries.  She is among the most famous epic writings of mankind.  It tells about the relations of Germanic tribes of the 5th century and the desire to establish family ties with the Huns, who at that time had strengthened in Eastern Europe and threatened the banks of the Rhine. </p><p>  The plot of the poem is based on the marriage of the Frankish legendary hero - "dragon warrior" Siegfried to the princess of Burgundy Krimhilda, his death due to a quarrel between Krimhilda and Brünnhilde - the wife of her brother Gunther.  An important point is also the revenge of Krimhilda with the help of the Hun ruler Etzel to his fellow Burgundians for the elimination of his first beloved husband Siegfried.  The catalyst for all actions is the mysterious third force in the face of the all-knowing and omnipresent villain Hagen. </p>

    <p>  The content of the poem is reduced to 39 songs (parts), which are called "adventures."  The spelling of toponyms and character names is given according to the translation of Yu. B. Korneev, which was published in the series “Literary Monuments” in 1972. </p><h2>  Dragon winner </h2><p>  What are the main exploits of Siegfried?  In ancient times, ruled on the Lower Rhine, in the city of Xanten, Queen Siglind and King Sigmund.  They had a son, Siegfried.  From childhood, the boy was distinguished by strength, beauty and courage.  Already in his youth, he showed unprecedented heroism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Once, a young Siegfried came to the blacksmith Mime, an experienced old craftsman.  He saw how the master and his henchmen work at the anvil, and wished to become a student of the venerable Mima.  The blacksmith kept it at his place.  The next day, the blacksmith brought his newly minted pupil to the forge and ordered him to hit the workpiece with the heaviest hammer. </p><p>  Siegfried fulfilled his desire, and the anvil went into the ground, and the red-hot billet shattered into pieces.  The helpers were surprised, and the disgruntled blacksmith refused to teach Siegfried.  But the young man told the master that he would die his strength, and the blacksmith left it with him. </p><p>  Soon Siegfried began to quarrel with the apprentices, and the blacksmith regretted his decision.  The henchmen threatened to leave the forge if a newcomer remained.  Then the owner decided to get rid of Siegfried.  He sent him into the woods to harvest charcoal.  And in the forest under a linden lived a mighty dragon.  The master thought that the monster would swallow a young student. </p><p>  And Siegfried went into the forest and began to fell trees.  He completed his work, lit a fire, and he sat on a stump and began to observe the bonfire.  Suddenly a huge monster crawled out from under the roots with a huge mouth.  The dragon approached Siegfried and began to sniff.  Siegfried immediately grabbed a burning tree from the fire and began to beat the dragon until he fell down dead. </p>

    <p>  Smoky blood flowed in a stream of a dragon.  Siegfried dipped his finger into it and saw that the finger was horny so that no sword could cut it.  Then he undressed and bathed in this blood.  Siegfried became all horny, with the exception of the small area between the shoulder blades on the back, where the linden leaf fell.  Next, the young man dressed and went to the castle of his parents. </p><h2>  Sharing </h2><p>  Consider another major feat of Siegfried.  He did not stay at home, often traveled in search of adventure and performed many miracles, since he was very strong.  Once Siegfried was in the forest, where he saw how noble men carry out an impressive treasure from the cave.  These were the treasures of the Nibelungs.  Siegfried had never seen such wealth before. </p><p>  Shilbung and Nibelung - two kings were going to share the treasure.  Siegfried approached them.  The kings greeted him and asked him to share the treasures honestly.  They had so much gold and precious stones that they could not be taken away even in a hundred wagons.  As a reward, the kings gave Siegfried the Balmung sword of the Nibelungs. </p><p>  Siegfried began to share the treasure, but each of the kings decided that he was cheated.  Before the hero had finished the section, the kings attacked him.  But Siegfried destroyed the debaters with the glorious sword of Belmung. </p>

    <p>  This was seen by the powerful dwarf Alberich.  He decided to avenge the death of his masters.  The dwarf had an invisibility cloak giving strength to twelve warriors.  He threw it over himself and rushed at Siegfried.  The hero defeated the dwarf in a fair fight, then took his invisibility cloak from him and took all the treasures of the Nibelungs. </p><p>  So Siegfried defeated the overseas knights, became the ruler of the land of the Nibelungs and the owner of their treasures.  Siegfried ordered the treasure to be taken back to the cave, the dwarf Alberich ordered him to guard and took an oath from him to be his faithful servant. </p><h2>  Brünnhilde </h2><p>  So, you know what Siegfried says in mythology.  And who is Brünnhilde?  She is the heroine of Scandinavian-Germanic mythology.  Brunhild or Brünnhilde (the “duel”) is the most beautiful and warlike Valkyrie that Odin challenged: she gave the victory in battle not to the one whom God had prepared for her.  Almighty, as a punishment, put her to sleep and sent her to the ground, where Brunhild was supposed to sleep on the Hindarfjall hill, surrounded by a wall of fire. </p><p>  Only Sigurd (Siegfried in the Germanic epic), the famous hero who defeated the dragon Fafnir, could break through the raging flame.  What is said further in the legend of Siegfried and Brünnhilde?  Siegfried woke up the beautiful Brünnhilde, and promised to marry her.  He left the warlike beauty pledged to the dwarf Advari’s ring, not knowing that a curse hung over this ring. </p>

    <p>  The witch Grimhild gave Siegfried oblivion nectar, and having forgotten about his bride, he took the witch's daughter, the beautiful Gudrun (in the German legends of Krimhild), as his wife.  When his memory returned, Siegfried's heart was filled with sadness, shame and suffering. </p><p>  Meanwhile, Brother Krimhilda, the Burgundian king of the Burgundians (in the German legends of Gunther), turned to Brungilde.  But the Valkyrie vowed to marry someone who passed through the wall of fire surrounding her, which only Siegfried could do. </p><p>  Siegfried expressed his willingness to help Hunter.  He changed his guise with Gunther during the marriage test and went through the fire instead.  Brünnhilde was forced to become Gunther's wife.  When the deception was revealed, embittered Brunnhilde demanded that her husband kill Siegfried.  In the end, Gunther and his brother Hagen mortally wounded Siegfried on the hunt.  The traitor Hagen, aiming between the shoulder blades, threw a spear at the unarmed hero.  He managed to get to exactly the place that was once covered by a fallen linden leaf. </p><p>  Dying on his deathbed, Siegfried called to his beloved Brünnhilde.  The beauty could not bear the remorse and killed herself to be with her lover even in the grave. </p><p>  Only after the death of Siegfried and Brünnhilde did they find peace in love, previously destroyed by vile intrigues.  And the anathema of the dwarf Andvari, along with the inherited ring, passed to Hagen and Gunther.  Subsequently, both of them died a painful death, but they did not reveal the secrets of the ill-fated treasure of the Nibelungs. </p><h2>  Symbolic meaning </h2><p>  The killing of the dragon Fafnir Siegfried can be interpreted as an act of a cultural hero defeating the forces of chaos.  In a large number of legends that have a symbolic deep meaning, the dragon appears in this meaning - a primitive adversary, the battle with which is the highest exam. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the patrons of chivalry, the holy archangel Michael and righteous George are depicted at the moment when they are killing the monster.  Dragon symbolize disasters that haunt a person or country. </p><p>  The plot, when Siegfried awakens Brünnhilde, is a symbol of searching for the path of the soul and releasing it from prison. </p><h2>  The meaning of the legend </h2><p>  So, you already know Siegfried's characterization.  The myth of it has become one of the main texts for the Germans, and its different versions date back to the pagan period.  For Germany, Siegfried is a cult figure.  In the attitude of the people of this country, he is presented as an ideal balance of body and spirit. </p><p>  With the help of the legend of Siegfried, images were created that became archetypal in world culture.  Ancient German-Scandinavian legends in the 19th and 20th centuries occupied an important place in the cultural consciousness of Europeans, and became its significant component. </p>
