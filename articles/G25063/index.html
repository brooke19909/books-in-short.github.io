It is located on the shores of the bay of the same name, not far from the place where the Bensafrin River flows into the Atlantic Ocean.  Lagos and Lisbon are 184 km away. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The history of this city in Portugal has more than two thousand years.  Initially, the Carthaginians lived here, united with the Celts during the Punic Wars.  After the colonization of the settlement by the Romans, Lagos (Portugal) became part of the Roman region of Lusitania.  Traces of this period of history are still found not only in the city, but also in the surrounding villages. </p><p>  From the sixth century, Lagos passed from the Visigoths to the Byzantines, then to the Moors.  It was then that the oldest church of St. John the Baptist appeared in the Algarve district today. </p><p>  Lagos passed from the Moors under the rule of King Athos III only in 1241.  In 1361, the city acquired a new status and became legally independent.  And after King Joao I in Lagos harbor assembled a fleet to conquer Ceuta in the early 15th century, the city became an important maritime harbor.  Lagos (Portugal) reached particular importance during the Great Geographical Discoveries (early 15th century - 17th century).  It was from here that the son of Jo√£o I directed many expeditions to the western coast of Africa and to Morocco, and the famous navigator Zhil Eanesh made a swim for Cape Bohador, refuting the theory that it is the end of the world. </p><h2>  Lagos today </h2>

    <p>  Many architectural sights of Lagos were destroyed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 1755.  Nevertheless, today there are still a lot of interesting places that are mandatory points of the city excursion program: </p><ul><li>  Lagos Castle.  It is considered the main attraction and striking with huge walls, many corridors and rooms, where a large number of secrets and secrets are hidden.  The history of the castle begins in 1174.  During this time, he survived several warriors and a powerful earthquake.  After 1755, the castle was subjected to several cosmetic repairs and comprehensive restoration of the walls. </li><li>  Monastery of Nossa Senhora do Carmo.  It was erected in the 13th century.  At the end of the 18th century, the library and the church connecting the monastery and the Santa Teresa temple were severely damaged by an earthquake and fire.  Part of the building was restored only at the beginning of the 20th century.  The rear is built in the Baroque style, but in the exterior decoration there are small elements of Gothic and classic.  Inside the monastery there are a large number of wood and gold items. </li><li>  Fort Meia Praia.  It is built in the mannerism style and reflects the trends of military architecture.  The earthquake destroyed the Fort completely, but by 1796 the local authorities completely restored it, and in 2009 the attraction was included in the list of official monuments of the country. </li><li>  Church of San Sebastian.  One of the oldest architectural structures.  In addition to the three naves, separated by Doric columns, and a stunning altar, the ancient plan of Lagos can be found inside the church.  Changes affected him only at the end of the 19th century.  Then a new structure was added to the plan - a tower with bells. </li></ul><h2>  Natural monuments </h2>

    <p>  Beaches are the pride of this city.  There are not only a lot of them, but each has its own peculiarity.  All Lagos beaches can be divided into two categories: open elongated along the coast or closed bays of unusual shapes.  What unites them is that almost everyone has a developed infrastructure and is well equipped with amenities for people with disabilities. </p><p>  Popular beaches include the following: </p><ul><li>  Meia Praia is the largest and largest.  From all sides the beach is surrounded by gentle slopes, so there are practically no winds here.  In Maya Praia provides everything for outdoor activities: water skiing, catamarans, various attractions and so on. </li><li>  Donna Maria is an ideal beach where you can retire. </li><li>  Donna Ana.  It is considered the most beautiful beach, near which is one of the most popular hotels.  It offers stunning views of the cliffs.  Nearby are two hotels. </li><li>  Sweet potato is small and picturesque.  It is sandwiched between a rock, but despite this there are always a lot of people. </li><li>  Solarium, like the beach mentioned above, is very close to the city center.  But on the other hand, it pleases with size.  It provides sunbeds, umbrellas and rental of various sports equipment. </li><li>  Praia to Carvalho.  It is a very small beach sandwiched between rocks.  Here you can rent a boat to visit the picturesque grottoes and caves located nearby. </li><li>  Praia to Amado.  It is considered an ideal place for surfers: the wave is good here, but there are not so many people.  Both experienced athletes and beginners will like it, because there are several surf schools on the beach. </li><li>  Praia de Marinha is a beach for a relaxing holiday.  There is no influx of tourists and you can not only soak up the golden sand, but also have a good swim with a snorkel and a mask. </li></ul><h2>  Other entertainment Lagos </h2>
