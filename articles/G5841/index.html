And when the question arises, where to go on summer vacation, many want to visit this piece of land, among the azure waters of the most romantic of the seas - the Mediterranean.

In most three-star hotels, the price for accommodation is very low, and the conditions are quite comfortable.  So, for example, the Naiades Almiros River 3 * hotel (Heraklion, Agios Nikolaos) in Crete offers tourists excellent conditions at very affordable prices. </p>

    <h2>  Rest in the city of St. Nicholas in the hotel ‚ÄúNaiad Almiros Rive‚Äù </h2><p>  In Crete, Agios Nikolaos is considered the local Saint-Tropez.  This is a very comfortable and sought-after resort in the entire island of Greece.  It mainly attracts tourists who, in addition to beach vacations, are drawn to nightlife, because there are many opportunities to spend time for every taste.  Agios Nikolaos was once built by residents of other regions of Crete, who fled from the oppression of the Turks.  Here they hid from the Mohammedans, who wanted to eradicate the local inhabitants of the island.  Over time, the Greeks, who are famous for their optimistic nature and craving for fun and entertainment, turned this small village into a thriving resort.  Today there are many hotels of various categories - from luxury hotels to the simplest 2 * and guesthouses.  However, three-star hotels such as Naiades Almiros River 3 * (Crete, Agios Nikolaos) are most in demand among average Russians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  This resort is located on the shores of Mirabello Bay.  Its name speaks for itself.  The word ‚Äúmirabello‚Äù is translated from Italian as ‚Äúa bay with a beautiful view‚Äù.  In Agios Nikolaos, the tourist infrastructure is well developed, however, local authorities, as well as private entrepreneurs, are not willing to rest on their laurels and will improve the resort every day.  However, they try not to upset the harmony of the pristine beauty of this resort.  And yet, all the favorable conditions are nothing before the gifts that nature has given to this place.  The beaches are simply magnificent, and the color of the sea wave captures the spirit and makes the heart beat faster with delight. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  If you want to buy a tour to the Naiades Almiros River 3 * hotel, then, of course, you will be interested in for what period it is better to buy a ticket when the weather on the island is most comfortable.  The beach season opens on the island from mid-May and ends at the end of October.  The hottest is August, when the air temperature warms up to +35 or more degrees.  But the sea water all the time of the beach season warms up to 22-25 degrees.  There is no winter as such on the island.  It rains frequently in the colder months, and yet even during the ‚Äúoff-season‚Äù in Crete you can have a great time, there are enough sights to not get bored. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Naiades Almiros River 3 *: vacationers reviews </h2><p>  Do tourists like to relax in this hotel?  This is what they write in their reviews.  The ratings of most couples are positive.  After all, there is everything for a quiet measured family vacation.  But the youth, hungry for entertainment, believes that the hotel in the evenings is very boring.  However, there is plenty of entertainment in Agios Nikolaos, some of which are within walking distance of the hotel, while others can be reached by taxi.  Almost all tourists complain about infrequent cleaning.  There were even cases when the number was not cleaned for a whole week.  There are also complaints about the restaurant menu.  Although it is tasty, it is not diverse, and very soon dishes can get bored.  Everything else (especially the beach, nature, the possibility of excursions) is rated by tourists as a solid five. </p>
