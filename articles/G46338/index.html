Here we talk about some beautiful places in China. </p><h2>  the great Wall of China </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient-origins.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The great Wall of China" class="if uuid-2600396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2600396.jpg"></div><p>  This grandiose building is undeniably an amazing result of the activity of an ancient civilization.  The rampart today is a symbol of China.  Its total length is 8,851 km.  It was built more than one thousand years ago and still throws scientists surprises and questions that they cannot find answers to. </p><h2>  Yangtze River </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mundycruising.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in beijing" class="if uuid-2599792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93188/2599792.jpg"></div><p>  This waterway is the longest river in the Asian continent; it deserves to be on the list of what to see in China.  It is a kind of line dividing North China and South.  These areas really differ markedly in cultural traditions, economics, climatic and natural features.  The Three Gorges Dam, on which the world's largest hydroelectric power station is located, was built on the river. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Huangshan Mountains (Yellow Mountains) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.absolutechinatours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Huangshan mountains" class="if uuid-2600417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2600417.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most beautiful places in China.  They formed about 100 million years ago.  Later, when the surrounding landscape was washed by glaciers, the rocks acquired a great height.  The mountain complex is located 300 km from Shanghai (Anhui Province).  Seventy-seven mountain peaks exceed 1000 m, and the highest mountains - Lotus Peak and Light Peak - reach 1800 m. Peaks rise above the clouds, which allows tourists to sometimes observe various light phenomena that have already received specific names, for example, ‚ÄúBuddha Light‚Äù (circular rainbow) and "Cloudy Sea". </p><h2>  Geological Park Danxia </h2><p>  Danxia Nature Reserve is located west of Zhangye (Gansu Province, northwest of China).  In 2010, the territory was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  The natural rocky landscape of Danxia is a unique geological phenomenon.  The red sandstone rock has formed huge colorful hills.  They resemble perfect painting, despite the fact that they were created by nature itself.  The surface of the geopark is painted with stripes of different shades: from scarlet to blue.  This unique natural phenomenon appeared as a result of a complex of factors: the movement of the earth's surface, weathering and erosion, which lasted millions of years.  The relief and rocks, different in color, size and texture, form fantastic landscapes with numerous cracks and lowlands, grottoes, caves, columns and towers of natural origin.  The cost of admission to this beautiful place in China is about $ 6, another $ 3 is worth the excursion program.  Independent walks in the park are prohibited. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tianzi Mountain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful places of china" class="if uuid-2599798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93188/2599798.jpg"></div><p>  The peak of Tianzi is one of the four famous tourist places and the most picturesque corners of the Wulingyuan Nature Reserve.  This is an unspoiled islet of nature with primeval forests, mysterious caves, pristine ponds, beautiful waterfalls and a rich wildlife.  In the east, the Suo Xiyu Valley adjoins the mountain, in the south - the National Forest Park of the Zhangjiajie Urban District, and in the north - the Sanzhi District.  Thus, Tianzi is one of the <span>most beautiful places in</span> China and the center of the "golden triangle".  The highest point is the Kunlun peak (1262.5 m), the lowest (at the foot) is the Shilan Valley (534 m above sea level).  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mountain is 68 square meters.  m, the perimeter at the foot - 45 km.  For those who find it difficult to independently hike through the forests, there is a cable car to climb to the top. </p><p>  The most interesting view opens from the Platform of the Emperor or the Platform of the Son of God.  The local population leads a traditional lifestyle.  Tourists can get acquainted with everyday life and try simple, but tasty and healthy dishes.  Tianzi Mountain got its name in honor of the nickname of the rebel Xiang Dakong, who during the reign of Emperor Hunu (Ming Dynasty), led a local farmer uprising, he was nicknamed "the son of heaven."  There is a legend that the rebel groups camped on the mountain.  Since that time, the peaks of the mountains, distinguishable from Tianji, are compared with a large cavalry army. </p><h2>  Jiuzhaigou valley </h2><p>  Jiuzhaigou Valley (Valley of Nine Villages) is a nature reserve in the north of Sichuan (southwest of China), formed as a result of tectonic, glacial and hydrological activities.  Jiuzhaigou Valley - these are three huge lowlands called Rise, Zecheva and Shujeng, which, due to their size, are also called valleys.  The area is famous for its beautiful cascades of waterfalls, picturesque lakes, a protected ancient forest landscape and rare species of animals and plants.  The main local attractions are the primeval forest, Grass Lake (completely covered with vegetation), Swan Lake (also known as Long, since its length is more than 2 km), Five Flower Lake (a shallow reservoir with water of different colors), Pand Lake and waterfalls (a two-color reservoir with three-stage waterfalls), Mirror Lake (with an absolutely smooth surface reflecting the surrounding landscape). </p><h2>  Lake of a thousand islands </h2><p>  Qiandaohu Lake (150 km from Hangzhou) is an artificial reservoir with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã573 square meters.  km, which appeared in the late 50s of the twentieth century, after the construction of the hydroelectric station.  There are 1,078 large and small picturesque islands.  It is the largest freshwater lake in eastern China. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitourchina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reserve tribute" class="if uuid-2599796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93188/2599796.jpg"></div><h2>  Hemu </h2><p>  Hemu Village is one of the most beautiful <span>Chinese villages.</span>  Since the winter in this area is long, tourists can see local beauties only from June to the end of October.  The best time to come is at the beginning of summer, when nature is just awakening and meadows are covered with many bright colors.  Hemu Village is located in Burchun County in the north of Xinjiang, at an altitude of 2 km above sea level.  This is the floodplain of two rivers, Hemu and Kanas, surrounded by majestic mountain peaks and dense forests.  More recently, this area was almost completely isolated from civilization. </p><h2>  What to see in Beijing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dissertationreviews.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="National Museum of China" class="if uuid-2600410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2600410.jpg"></div><p>  If you arrived in the <span>capital of China</span> for a period of days to a week, it makes sense to limit yourself to acquaintance with the sights of the city.  And believe me, there are many of them: the National Museum of China, Tiananmen Square and the <span>mausoleum of Mao Zedong.</span>  The museum exhibits both its own collections of exhibits and various visiting exhibitions from around the world.  Entrance to the mausoleum is free.  Gongwanfu Palace and Park complex, built in the 18th century for one of the princes, is also noteworthy.  Here you can feel the national flavor and have fun.  The Forbidden City will be of interest to anyone who knows the art of feng shui. </p><p>  What to see in Beijing yet?  Of course, Yunhegun Monastery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mandarinzone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yonghegun Monastery" class="if uuid-2600415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2600415.jpg"></div><p>  A great place for fans of kung fu and Tibet.  Be sure to visit the Temple of Heaven - the famous complex with a unique sound effect. </p><p>  The temple of Awakening, or the Great Bell, is very interesting.  The sound of this giant is heard at a distance of 50 km, in addition, the temple still has a lot of interesting things.  For example, the brightest show celebrations are held here during the New Year week. </p>
