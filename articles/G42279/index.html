This development of an extra-curricular event is focused on a very important goal: the formation of patriotism is one of the main <span>goals of the work</span> of history teachers, which is why this topic is one of the most relevant. </p><h2>  <span>Extracurricular activities,</span> history, Grade 5 </h2><p>  Pupils of fifth grades are not yet fully studying the history of Russia, but they should know this topic.  This extra-curricular event on history is designed for what they need to understand: what horrors the scary word ‚Äúfascism‚Äù is fraught with, what heroic feat each of those guys went about, which will be told at the <span>classroom</span> what war is and what it is effects.  In addition, this year the whole country celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the Great Victory.  Every student, even the smallest one, must understand the importance of this event, although history lessons on topics about the events of the twentieth century are still ahead of them. </p>

    <p>  (10 minutes) </p><p>  And what is terrible in the war?  War is pain, the death of many people, hunger, suffering. </p><p>  Right.  All of you, of course, have heard about the victory of the USSR army in the Great Patriotic War.  But not everyone understands how hard it was, what forces it was achieved.  This is our current lesson.  After all, it was you, the younger generation, who had the honor to keep this experience, this memory and pass it on to your descendants, so that this would never happen again. </p><p>  But let's go in order.  The Great Patriotic War is called the military events that took place in the middle of the twentieth century, more than seventy years ago, between the USSR and Nazi Germany.  Fascists who wanted to destroy entire nations on earth could come to power in the world. </p><p>  Which of you grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and maybe other relatives fought on the battlefields?  (Raise their hands) </p><p>  Do you know how this war began? </p><p>  Your great-grandmothers and great-grandfathers were then still very young, perhaps they just graduated from high school, and someone, maybe, also studied.  So, in the morning, when it was just beginning to get light, a strong and sonorous voice of radio speaker Yuri Borisovich Levitan thundered over the country (the recording of the declaration of war is included). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thousands of fascist guns thundered simultaneously with this voice on the borders of our country, and everyone knew that war had come.  The war, which lasted almost one and a half thousand days and claimed more than one million Soviet lives. </p><p>  Can you figure out how old it is?  (4 years) </p><p>  But which was won. </p><h2>  The feat of the pioneer heroes </h2><p>  (20 minutes.) <strong></strong></p><p>  But do you know that in the lists of names of the heroes of this war there are many names of those who were not much older than you?  I am talking about pioneer heroes who fought for their homeland, but often without raising arms.  Knowing these names is worth it, this is a tribute to the respect that each of them, undoubtedly, deserves. </p><p>  (Slide 1) </p>

    <p>  I will tell you about a very young girl, Zina Portnova, who was only sixteen years old at the time the war began.  Oh, how much this girl fell to the lot, she visited the ranks of the partisans and made sorties into the camp of the enemy, and later got into the enemy‚Äôs kitchen and mixed the poison with the Nazis in food.  Once she was even suspected of this and forced to try the poisoned soup herself, she almost died, but still remained alive and continued to help the Soviet troops in every possible way.  Up until the moment when she was caught and after prolonged torture she was sent to be shot.  What did Zina Portnova, who was eighteen years old at the time of her death, see in her short life?  Probably nothing.  Never mind.  And she understood every day of her life that she could die.  So why then took the risk?  Because of love for the motherland, desire to win. </p><p>  Right.  But in the list of names of pioneer heroes, this name is far from the only one. </p><p>  (Slide 2) </p>

    <p>  There are many glorious names in the annals of the Great Patriotic War, and one of them is Vitya Cherevichkin.  The most ordinary boy of twelve who loved his poultry very much.  He bred white doves under the roof of the house.  When the Germans came to the town where Vitya lived, it was forbidden to raise pigeons, since the Nazis were afraid that with their help the locals would be able to transmit encryption to the <span>Soviet army.</span>  And only the boy Vitya disobeyed this order, for which he was shot. </p><p>  What do you think, how does this act characterize the Soviet boy Vitya?  (Brave, brave, patriot ...) </p><p>  (Slide 3) </p><p>  Well, another boy that I‚Äôll talk about today is Volodya Dubynin. </p><p>  He was among the partisans who fought near the city of Kerch.  A fourteen-year-old boy persistently sought that adults take him into their ranks.  He was a real scout, independently obtained the most valuable information about the number of enemy troops, their location, etc. </p><p>  Kerch was liberated, but Volodya was still helping the Soviet troops.  He helped professional sappers to clear the territory near his hometown.  On one of these mines Volodya Dubynin was blown up.  At that time he was only fifteen.  What can you say about this person?  (Determined, persistent, real hero, brave boy). </p><p>  Even the children understood at that time that they had to make every effort to win and took risks at the cost of their lives. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  (10 minutes) </p><p>  Patriotism is an amazing quality that can make a little person truly a hero.  And this is not all the names and surnames that could be told today. </p><p>  Among the Soviet heroes are the names of men, women, the elderly and children.  Everyone did everything they could to win. </p><p>  In this lesson, I want to give you an important assignment.  Arriving home, take an interest in your relatives, perhaps among your relatives there are participants in the war.  And then write a short essay - a story about this person.  Tell him about what he did, whether he received rewards and where he fought.  Ask to find his photo in the family photo archive.  Then from these works we will create an entire exhibition where you can get acquainted with the deeds of great people, winners. </p><p>  Do you guys help create such an exhibition?  (Positive answers) </p><p>  In conclusion, I want to ask you why those children that I told you about today are called heroes?  (Did not spare their lives for the sake of the Motherland) </p><p>  You absolutely correctly understood everything.  War is a terrible event, and deciding to sacrifice life for victory is a real feat. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Analysis of extracurricular activities</span> on history </h2><p>  An extracurricular event on the history of Russia was carried out according to this plan.  An extracurricular event on history was chosen very urgently, especially when you consider that it was in this year that the seventieth anniversary of the Great Victory.  This class hour should be held in conjunction with similar topics that tell about the heroes of the Great Patriotic War, about the events of the war and about the victory.  Only then will students have a fully formed idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis historical period. </p>

    <h2>  Performance of tasks </h2><p>  The goal and objectives of the event will be fulfilled if the guys learn new material and draw some conclusions for themselves.  This extra-curricular event on history is more educational in nature, should be conducted in the form of a free conversation that arouses keen interest among students, and almost all should complete the task that they will receive after the lesson.  In their writings, the guys write that they are proud of their Fatherland, as well as the grandfathers who fought for the victory.  And some even mention what they themselves would do as pioneer heroes. </p>

    <h2>  Results of the work done </h2><p>  There are different topics for extracurricular activities for fifth graders, and it may be too early to tell them about the history of wars, but everyone living in our country should know the events of the Great Patriotic War.  Thus, it is safe to say that the event was not wasted, but will remain in the children‚Äôs memory, will help them in future history lessons and will reflect on their attitude to the history of their people.  This development of an extracurricular event on history may well be used not only in the fifth grades.  Similar events, as well as history lessons on the same topic, will be useful at any age.  Topics of extracurricular activities on a similar topic are systematically held in our schools. </p>
