    <h2>  Where did the name <span>Misty Albion</span> come from <span>?</span> </h2><p>  What is this name - Great Britain?  Why is Britain considered Great?  The thing is that it is the largest island in Europe in size.  It used to be part of the continent, but then separated from Eurasia by the English Channel.  Misty Albion - what is it, where does this name come from?  This is the question most curious travelers ask.  Albion is an ancient name for the <span>British Isles.</span>  The word is of Celtic origin.  Under this name, modern England was known to the <span>ancient Greeks.</span>  In Celtic, the word "albus" meant "mountains", but translated from Latin - "white".  What does the prefix ‚Äúfoggy‚Äù mean?  Everything is very simple - the sea is constantly enveloped in sea fog.  It is so thick that it completely paralyzes the traffic, and people are even afraid to take a step so as not to get lost in the familiar streets.  The blind, accustomed to navigate in the dark, offer their services to the sighted, accompanying them to the desired place.  Dense fogs in England are not uncommon, it is a visiting card of the country, therefore their description is found in many works of British writers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient name of the british islands" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/452749.jpg" width="450"></div>
