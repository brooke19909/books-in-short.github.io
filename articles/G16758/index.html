  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Useful applications on the phone: names, news, features and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All that a modern smartphone is capable of without third-party applications is to receive calls from SMS, and take photos from video.  To fully unleash the potential of a mobile gadget, you need to install additional software. </p><p>  There are a lot of the latter on the Internet: for multimedia, games, surfing, booking tickets, learning languages, etc.  But not every program can be called necessary and useful.  Some utilities may harm your device.  So the choice of useful applications on the phone must be approached more carefully.  In addition, the abundance of software simply does not physically allow you to install all of it on your smartphone and try it out. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out which applications are needed on the phone and will be useful.  Here is a list of the most popular programs that have distinguished themselves by a high-quality component and a large number of good reviews from users.  We will consider software for the two most popular platforms - Android and iOS. </p><h2>  Whatsapp </h2><p>  Most owners of smartphones consider Vatsap one of the most needed applications for an Android phone.  Social messenger allows you to chat with other users: write messages, send photos, videos and other content.  And all this is done absolutely free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whatsapp.en.softonic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="most useful phone apps" class="if uuid-3146733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3146733.jpg"></div><p>  Vatsap does not charge a subscription fee from its users and works on all communication protocols, starting with EDGE and ending with Wi-Fi protocols.  In addition, one of the most useful applications for Android phones offers full-fledged calls, both in regular and in video format. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The program interface is simple and clear, so dealing with it will not be difficult even for beginners in this matter.  It is also worth noting that Vatsap remains a useful phone application even if there is no Internet connection.  The messenger accurately collects all incoming messages on its servers, and when you resume communication, you receive them without any loss.  Regular SMS and MMS protocols installed in the gadget firmware, alas, cannot offer this. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the absence of international fees for short messages.  You can chat with friends around the world without fear of emptying your personal account.  So the title of the most useful application on the phone "Vatsap" fulfills in full. </p><p>  Users, and there are almost more than 200 million of them, leave mostly positive reviews about the messenger.  The average score on Google Play is around 4.5 points.  The application is really easy to use, has wide functionality and takes up a very small part of system resources. </p><h2>  Pocket </h2><p>  This is a multi-platform program that works both under the Android operating system and under iOS.  Moreover, on both OSs, the utility functions equally well.  "Pocket" can also be called one of the most useful applications for iPhone and Android phones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tunesgo.wondershare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="useful phone apps for girls" class="if uuid-3146734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3146734.jpg"></div><p>  The program is designed for offline storage of a variety of content that you stumble upon while surfing the Internet: interesting news, articles, stock and sports reports, audio and video materials, food recipes, etc.  So the utility is a useful and necessary application for a phone without the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the program interface allows you to configure the formatting of web pages.  The World Wide Web has always been full of bright colors and a variety of sites.  And from such a variety of fonts, sizes and colors, many have sore eyes.  With "Pocket", you can configure the display of web pages in a very wide range. </p><p>  The reviews about this useful phone app are all positive.  It really helps a lot when the Internet connection is unstable, and the smart setting of the visual part for sites also deserves all praise. </p><h2>  <span>Clean Master</span> (Cheetah Mobile) </h2><p>  Another useful and necessary <span>application for the phone.</span>  <span>The program</span> is responsible for the security of the mobile gadget and its optimization.  The utility will clean your device from various ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù like cache and unnecessary files, and the built-in antivirus will protect your phone from malicious code. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techdrivein.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="useful iPhone applications" class="if uuid-3146736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3146736.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by user reviews, the Wedge Master application is quite effective.  It finds even the most hidden data and correctly processes them.  The program carefully approaches the procedure and does not affect important system files, so that after the diagnosis and cleaning of the device, the platform functions normally.  Moreover, the speed increases significantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is remarkable about Clean Master </h2><p>  Local antivirus also pleases with its effectiveness.  The impressive virus database, which is located in the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, helps to recognize all types of threats, ranging from ‚Äútrojans‚Äù to serious ‚Äúworms‚Äù.  Users in their reviews also note that this useful phone application does not load the processor and practically does not touch the device‚Äôs RAM.  You can not say about other competing software. </p><p>  In addition, in the utility interface you can find the section responsible for working with the battery.  The program offers a detailed analysis of applications running in the background and, if necessary, will disable them.  There is also a special hibernation mode that allows not only to significantly increase battery life, but also to extend the life of the battery. </p><h2>  Prisma </h2><p>  Prism is one of the most popular programs in Google Play and the Apple Store, and many users, despite the positioning of the product, consider it also a very useful application for the phone.  For girls and other creative natures, this is a real find that takes you a lot of time, but you will not regret it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mspoweruser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="useful useful phone apps without internet" class="if uuid-3146740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3146740.jpg"></div><p>  The program allows you to turn ordinary photographs into a real work of art.  The local library is packed to the brim with all kinds of filters and effects.  Here everyone will find what is more to their liking. </p><p>  If someone is too lazy to delve into the library and look for the filter you need, then at your service are full-fledged templates that support a certain style: Van Gogh, Picasso, Levitan and others.  It is also possible to decorate the image with an ornament or pattern.  Support for neural networks, coupled with artificial intelligence, will turn your memorable moments into real masterpieces. </p><p>  Users, and there are almost a million of them, speak very warmly about the Prism.  The application will be extremely useful for those who want to organize not just a photo gallery on a mobile gadget, but a beautiful exhibition of their works. </p><h2>  Aimp </h2><p>  This iconic music player is probably familiar to many users of personal computers.  The developers were able to correctly adapt the utilities for the Android platform.  Judging by the feedback from users, the player remained as functional, efficient and cute as the original for the PC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phonearena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="necessary applications for the phone" class="if uuid-3146739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3146739.jpg"></div><p>  The program supports almost all audio formats, even such exotic extensions as opus, dff, dsf and it.  The application also allows you to change the sound output methods from OpenSL to AudioTrack and vice versa.  There is support for CUE and Android Auto. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the player is a novelty on this platform, users do not note any bugs, lags or other shortcomings in their reviews.  The player‚Äôs interface has not changed much and remains the same simple, intuitive and decorated in the familiar red-black tones.  I was also pleased with competent integration with the lock screen, where to work with tracks it is not necessary to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù the entire system. </p><h2>  Runtastic </h2><p>  This application will be extremely useful to users who lead a healthy lifestyle.  Professional athletes leave very good reviews about this program.  Some even use this utility as an alternative to branded products for smart gadgets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what applications are needed on the phone" class="if uuid-3146735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3146735.jpg"></div><p>  The app with due meticulousness keeps track of all user indicators: distance, time, energy expended, speed, climb, etc.  Moreover, all the functionality is implemented not just for show, but really works as it should. </p><p>  Even the free version of the program offers a wide range of features.  Among others, voice accompaniment can be noted, which allows you not to be distracted by a smartphone while running or performing some other serious exercises.  It is possible to track progress for the year. </p><p>  You can also create your own groups and compete with like-minded people, sharing records and achievements.  A competently constructed leaderboard will show the best of the best at the end of the designated period (hour, day, week, etc.). </p><h2>  Duolingo </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular, and at the same time useful multi-platform applications.  Almost all the reviews about the program are positive.  The product‚Äôs effectiveness is also confirmed by the number of downloads - more than 7 million on Google Play. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cntraveler.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="necessary applications for android phone" class="if uuid-3146737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3146737.jpg"></div><p>  The program helps to improve your knowledge of foreign languages: reading, speech perception, writing.  The application interface can not be called complicated.  All menu items are correctly divided into sections, and it is almost impossible to get lost in them. </p><p>  The process of training and fixing material is designed in the form of a game, which is much more effective than boring lectures.  The user needs to answer questions, complete assignments and, day after day, increase the existing vocabulary, as well as improve knowledge of grammar.  Beginners in the shortest possible time will be able to master the base: the simplest verbs, phrases and the construction of sentences. </p><h2>  Features Duolingo </h2><p>  The developers boldly declare that the 34 hours spent in the program can be compared in terms of effectiveness with a semester in a higher educational institution.  Judging by user reviews, for the most part this is true.  Many students use this application to prepare for lessons, tests and exams. </p><p>  Another obvious plus of the program is its free distribution license.  This format implies an abundance of advertising, and here it is, but you can‚Äôt call it aggressive in any way.  There are no half-screen banners or pop-ups without end. </p><h2>  Shazam </h2><p>  Another multi-platform, popular and very useful application for determining music tracks.  Reviews about it are mostly positive, and the quality of the product is confirmed by the number of downloads.  Judging by the statistics of the service, "Shazam" is installed on more than 100 million devices worldwide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.macstories.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="useful applications on android phone" class="if uuid-3146738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3146738.jpg"></div><p>  In just a couple of seconds, the application will determine not only the name of the unfamiliar composition, but also the author, album, year of release, and also offer (if available) clips and some related materials.  The program allows you to share your favorite tracks with friends through social networks and help them recognize them. </p><p>  The product is distributed completely free of charge and, of course, burdened with advertising.  But it is correctly integrated into the code and does not interfere with the application. </p>
