Near the complex there is an art gallery, cafes, museums, night clubs, casinos, a zoo, an amusement park, an aquarium. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Bayshore Ocean View 4 * <span>(Phuket, Patong)</span> makes its demands on hotel guests.

Therefore, you should understand where and why you are going: to relax or have fun.  The largest is Patong Beach.  Its infrastructure is developed, there is everything you need for a good vacation.  However, many people believe that it is not as clean as before, since thousands of tourists visit it every year, and even after sea disturbances the water on it is not very clean.  In general, there are an incredible number of calmer and cleaner beaches in the area, so tourists should decide their own preferences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket bayshore ocean view" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1554872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  How Phuket resort began to develop recently (about 50 years ago).  For this short period of time, the island attracted tourists from all over the world.  The island is connected to the mainland by two parallel bridges (Thepkrasattri and Sarasin).  One of them is a pedestrian and has long become a real symbol of the entire province.  And the second bridge provides the full connection of Phuket with the big world.  There is a sea connection on the island.  There are no large ports here, but ferries ferry people to the nearest islands and to the province of Krabi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The island is quite large and embossed.  It is convenient to walk on it to the nearest distances.  If you want to get acquainted with the sights and see the nature, then you can not do without personal transport. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Phuket is a fairly cheap resort, which can be attributed to its undeniable advantages.  In addition, the island is of interest in the sense that there is something to see.  A two-week vacation is not enough to see a small part of this wonderful place. </p><p>  Tourists with children should visit the Phuket Zoo, which has been operating since 1997.  It is located in Chalong Bay.  The zoo has the right to boast a large collection of animals and amphibians.  Some birds here are about 60 species and 5,000 crocodiles, more than 100 species of butterflies.  The zoo is interesting in that a large number of tropical exotic plants grow on its territory, there is even a garden of orchids.  A daily show is held for visitors with the participation of elephants, crocodiles and monkeys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bayshore ocean view 4 phuket" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1554873.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Museum of Sea Shells will be interesting not only for kids, but also for adults.  It presents a collection that has been collected for forty years.  The museum is located in the Rawai beach area.  His collection has more than two thousand exhibits, among which the most unusual and rare shells are represented. </p><p>  Since 2013, an ecological park with the beautiful name "Kingdom of the Tigers" has been operating on the island.  Here in natural conditions 19 tigers live.  In the mornings and evenings, demonstrative feeding of predators is carried out. </p><p>  Every self-respecting tourist seeks to visit the mountain of monkeys.  This is the highest point in Phuket, on top of which is an observation deck with a beautiful view.  The mountain got such an unusual name due to the fact that many monkeys live on its slopes.  Animals are incredibly nimble, and therefore tourists need to keep track of their things. </p><p>  Not far from the island are small but very beautiful islands.  Tourists love to visit the <span>island of James Bond,</span> which in 1974 filmed episodes from the famous film "Golden Gun".  There is also a shell market. </p>

    <p>  In the area of ​​Chalong, a snake farm operates, which is the most popular among three such establishments on the island.  There are shows with dangerous and poisonous snakes.  And after the completion of the program, you can take pictures with exotic representatives of the tropics.  There is a shop on the farm with medicinal and cosmetic products based on snake venom.  You can also buy genuine leather products (belts, bags, wallets) in it. </p><h2>  Bayshore Ocean View: reviews </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of vacationers who have been here.  If you are planning to visit Phuket, Bayshore Ocean View could be your budget vacation destination.  The hotel has a good location away from noise.  The whole Patong beach is visible from the complex in full view, even if there is very lush vegetation around.  From the hotel to the beach walk about 20 minutes on foot.  The hotel has a free shuttle service.  But according to tourists, the shuttle bass does not go so often and carries tourists only in one direction.  If you rent a vehicle to see the island, you can travel the entire coast and choose the most suitable place for yourself.  On the way to Patong there are many cafes, restaurants and shops.  But not quite healthy people will make such transitions difficult. </p>

    <p>  The hotel itself is surrounded by a tropical garden.  Its territory is beautiful and well-groomed.  The rooms of the complex are very spacious and equipped with everything necessary.  All apartments have furnished terraces where you can spend your time contemplating the beautiful view of the coast and the surrounding area.  In general, the rooms are clean, the furniture is ok.  Ants do not appear if you do not leave food.  The apartments are cleaned with sufficient quality, which is rare in Thailand.  Towels and linen are changing according to the schedule.  As for the furniture, the rooms have a bed and bedside tables, a wardrobe, but there are no chairs and armchairs, except for plastic furniture on the balcony. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The price includes breakfast at the hotel.  According to many tourists, the food is very monotonous and quickly bored.  The same assortment is served every day: boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, toasts, two types of jams, bacon, sausages, several pieces of fruit. </p><p>  If you order lunch or dinner (naturally, at your own expense), then the food in the restaurant is quite normal.  Many vacationers prefer to visit the nearest cafes and restaurants where you can try a large assortment of local dishes. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel makes a good impression, but has a number of nuances that can be perceived differently.  In general, if you do not pay attention to minor flaws, the hotel is quite worthy for an economical vacation.  On its territory there is a beautiful pool, which is cleaned daily.  The complex is located a little away from all entertainment, if it is important for someone.  Front desk does not work around the clock.  Therefore, it is difficult to rent a room from one in the morning until six in the morning, it is necessary to negotiate.  You can get to the sea by renting a moped or a tuk-tuk.  The hotel building itself is new and well decorated.  The staff is quite polite. </p>

    <p>  Active tourists can combine traditional beach vacations with sightseeing trips.  Experienced vacationers claim that Phuket is full of interesting and exotic places to visit. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Bayshore Ocean View 4 * (reviews above) is an economy class hotel.  The location can be considered its advantage, but far from everyone likes the distance from the beach.  The complex is suitable for those tourists who like to walk a lot or can afford a taxi or rent a car. </p>
