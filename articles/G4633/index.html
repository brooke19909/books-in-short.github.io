    <h2>  Piazza di Spagna in Rome: how to get there and what's next </h2><p>  It is located in the city center, in an area called Campo Marzio <span>(Champ de Mars).</span>  Metro line A leads here.  Next to the square is Via Condotti shopping avenue, as well as Happy Street, where Nikolay Gogol lived and wrote the first volume of the novel Dead Souls.  And in the first coffee house in Rome, they enjoyed Stendhal, Goethe and Andersen.  At one of the corners of the square is the Palace of the Propagation of Faith - the property of the Holy See.  In the 16th century, it was the private residence of Bishop Amelia.  Now there is the Missionary Museum.  From here it is easy to get to other interesting places in the Italian capital - for example, the Trevi Fountain and Villa Borghese. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel rome square spain" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1859973.jpg" width="600"></div>

Since 1620, there has been a palace.  It is called the "Palazzo of Spain."  The kingdom's ambassador to the Vatican lived here.  At that time, the palace was on the periphery of the city, but then gradually turned out to be in the center.  Before him, in the nineteenth century, a marble column was built in honor of the adoption by the Roman Curia of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception.  At the top of this pillar is an 11-meter bronze statue of Madonna by Giuseppe Obichi.  She is surrounded by images of Moses, David, Isaiah, and Ezekiel.  Every year, the pope arrives here, decorates the head of the sculpture with a wreath with the help of a team of firefighters and stairs, and also says a special prayer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Square in Rome photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1860021.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Staircase and church </h2><p>  But the most popular attraction in Piazza di Spagna in Rome is undoubtedly the so-called ‚ÄúSteps‚Äù.  This is a grandiose baroque staircase.  It consists of 138 steps.  They lead to the hill of Pincho.  There is the Trinity del Monti church with two domes.  There are twelve flights of stairs - narrow and wide.  The church is considered one of the largest Franciscan temples in Europe.  Not only its portal is good, but also the interior with frescoes of famous masters, including Descent from the Cross.  It was built by order of the French monarchs, and since there was a representation of their relatives, Spanish monarchs on the square, both places were connected by a staircase.  True, this project was not brought to life immediately because of a quarrel between the pope and the sun king.  After the death of the latter, the staircase was built by the architect Alexander Speccy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rome staircase in plaza spain" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1860022.jpg" width="600"></div>

"Barkaccia" is the name of a small, but very famous fountain.  It is also built in the Baroque style, and its author is one of the most outstanding sculptors of the time - Bernini Sr.  Ordered the fountain Pope Urban Eighth.  The history of this architectural structure is interesting.  In 1598, such a severe flood occurred in Rome that the area was completely flooded, and in the middle of it a boat ran aground.  The sculptor placed a longboat in the center of the fountain.  It is as if drowning in the waters.  This was done as a reminder of the disaster.  Jets flow from the stern and bow of the sculpture.  Water in the fountain comes from the ancient aqueduct "built by the slaves of Rome," as Mayakovsky wrote.  It is called Aqua Virgo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Area spain in rome how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1860024.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cultural space: films, books and festivals </h2><p>  All roads, as you know, lead to Rome.  The staircase in Plaza de Espa√±a attracts lovers.  This is a famous place for dating.  It is not for nothing that she is regularly shown in films and described in various literary works.  But perhaps the most popular scene of all time is the shots from the movie "Roman Vacations", where Audrey Hepburn eats ice cream on the steps of the stairs.  It also hosts flower shows.  This happens in the spring, so the beauty of the square is simply indescribable at this time.  But even in winter it is not empty.  Various theatrical performances are organized in the square.  In a word, this place does not know such a thing as ‚Äúlow season‚Äù.  It is always crowded, fun and colorful.  There are many living statues, artists parade on stilts, read poetry.  In addition, the square is the center of modern fashion.  Here the most modern brands and directions are presented and various spectacular presentations are held, including from Valentino.  There are several museum houses of famous poets, such as John Keats and <span>Mary Shelley.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rome hotels in swiss square" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1860023.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rome hotels near Plaza de Espana </h2><p>  Swiss is one of the most famous hotels nearby.  It is located on Via Gregoriana, just between the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps.  The hotel has free Wi-Fi, and it is well-maintained, therefore suitable for families with children.  The price includes breakfast.  At the very top of the <span>Spanish Steps,</span> on a hill, is the five-star Hassler Rome (hotel).  Plaza Spain is surrounded by other hotels - Del Corso, At the Steps, Inn ... But the hotels here are often very expensive, and they are preferred by wealthy American tourists.  On the other hand, travelers recommend settling in this square, because it is located in the heart of the city, and if you want to cover as many routes as possible in a short time, it is worth choosing accommodation somewhere in the area.  Of course, there are a lot of expensive hotels here, but if you try, you can find a budget hostel from the "Bed and Breakfast" series.  There is no need to expect luxury from such a hotel, but you will hardly have to spend money on transport and you can wander around the streets of night Rome as much as you like.  Each of these hotels is located in an old house and is imbued with an authentic Italian spirit.  So, having lived in Plaza de Espana, you will recognize the soul of the city.  And you will feel its rhythm when you take a cup of coffee in the morning and watch the audience. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The reputation of this place is such that many people rush at any time of the year to Piazza di Spagna in Rome.  Photos will come out good when you come here early in the morning.  In this case, no one will bother you to remove all the attractions of the square.  There are no crowds of tourists, and you can safely walk along the famous Spanish Steps.  Then from very different angles very good views open up.  But experienced travelers say it's even better to visit the square at night.  Then a mysterious, unique atmosphere reigns here.  Romantics prefer to sit on the stairs during sunset.  It‚Äôs also convenient to shop from here.  Some gourmets recommend local pastry shops and restaurants, although due to the fact that this is a tourist area, a snack and coffee can be expensive. </p>
