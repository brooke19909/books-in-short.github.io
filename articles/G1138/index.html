This is due to the fact that many people live their whole lives in loans.  Sometimes payments exceed average monthly earnings, while meanwhile, needs are growing.  What to do?  Our fellow citizens are looking for a way out of the situation, and specifically, ways to reset the credit history (CI).  We will find out about this. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="creditoskop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit history" class="if uuid-3192649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/3192649.jpg"></div><p>  Many people somewhere heard how to reset the credit history, but they do not know how.  There is an opinion that it is being updated in three or five years, but again, the exact dates are unknown.  Before answering this question, we will give a definition of credit history directly. </p><p>  This is the name of all information on the creditor, which characterizes a person as mandatory or optional in relation to the payment of debts. </p><p>  The document was created in order to foster responsibility and a conscientious attitude to paying off debts.  This is due to the fact that when you try to take another loan, a banking organization will find out about all the violations committed on loans and agree or refuse depending on the reputation of the borrower. </p><p>  How to reset a credit history?  To answer the question, you need to know the regulatory framework.  So, the receipt of information is regulated by the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Credit Histories‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How is CI formed? </h2><p>  The credit history begins to take shape from the very first request sent to receive a loan.  As a rule, before this, a person signs consent to the processing of personal information by unauthorized persons.  If the consent causes a lively protest, then the bank begins to be wary of the borrower and may even refuse funds. </p><p>  The credit history is stored for fifteen years from the moment of the last change. </p><h2>  What does KI consist of? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="srochnyi-mikrozaim.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank check" class="if uuid-3192656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/3192656.jpg"></div><p>  Any business contains several parts, and credit history is also a business.  So, the dossier consists of three parts: </p><ol><li>  Introductory.  This includes personal data, SOPS number, TIN and more. </li><li>  Main.  Here you already indicate the place of residence and registration, payment periods, amount of debts, all information on the changes, unfulfilled obligations, rating of the subject, as well as litigation regarding debts. </li><li>  Additional.  Here indicate the source of information, date and user.  All this is done every time a request for CI comes. </li></ol><p>  All information is stored in the credit bureau.  There are approximately eighteen companies in our country.  In order to find out where your story is personally located, you will have to make a request to CCKI. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of Stories </h2><p>  Before you think about how to reset your credit history, it is worth sorting out the types.  The division is very arbitrary, nevertheless it allows at least roughly dividing the borrowers into categories: </p><ol><li>  Zero  Such a CI indicates that the person either did not apply for loans or refused to process the data. </li><li>  Negative.  Appears to those borrowers who did not pay their debts on time, they were fined and other not very pleasant methods of influence.  It is these people who are interested in whether it is possible to correct the credit history. </li><li>  Positive.  The borrower repaid the debts according to the schedule, the bank did not make any claims to the person. </li></ol><p>  Again, do not be scared, because each banking organization has a different attitude to KI.  For some, the lack of history will be a reason for refusing a loan, and another bank simply will not pay attention to it.  It is worthwhile to understand that in the event of such a loyal attitude, the lender is trying to find a profit for himself, which means that he will tighten credit conditions and increase the interest rate. </p><p>  All information on the borrower first goes to the history bureau, and then to companies that decide whether to grant a loan or not. </p><p>  Often, on the basis of only credit history, the bank refuses the applicant, even if the latter has increased wealth.  For this reason, we recommend that people with a bad history do not think about whether it is possible to correct a credit history, but to form it correctly from the very beginning. </p><h2>  Why does KI spoil? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="chelny-izvest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank borrower" class="if uuid-3192661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/3192661.jpg"></div><p>  The question interests many citizens, not only those who do not pay their debts, but also those who want to protect themselves for the future. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Let‚Äôs take a look at this moment.  Usually the story goes bad for those people who take a loan for the first time.  Paradoxical as it may sound, nevertheless it is.  People do not read the contracts, but simply put a signature.  Then they decide to postpone the payment of the loan, without even knowing what will happen in case of delay.  It is from this moment that a bad story begins to take shape. </p><p>  Consider the most common mistakes people make.  They first get loans, and then look for how to fix their credit history.  So, what does the client do and what aggravates his situation: </p><ol><li>  Payment deadlines are violated on an ongoing basis. </li><li>  Payments are ignored for a particular loan. </li></ol><p>  By the way, if there is a delay of up to five days, then it does not affect the rating in any way, since it is considered the norm.  It turns out that for a positive story, you only need to be responsive to obligations and read the contract. </p><p>  It also happens that the bank is to blame for the tainted story.  Yes, don‚Äôt be surprised.  This happens if: </p><ol><li>  There was a shift and the bank employees did not make a note about the payment. </li><li>  Bank employees did not pay on time, for this reason the money is debited later.  Note that this item usually refers to payments through a bank. </li><li>  There was a technical failure. </li></ol><p>  In such situations, borrowers also ask how they can fix their credit history.  To do this is quite simple: you just need to write a statement and confirm the payment with a receipt.  After that, all negative moments will be removed from your story. </p><h2>  When KI is reset </h2><p>  How to reset the credit history and write off everything?  So we come to the most important issue. </p><p>  We already know that a deterioration in credit history may not be the fault of the borrower, or, conversely, a person simply could not correctly calculate his budget.  Whatever the reason, all people are looking for the answer to the question of whether it is possible to reset the credit history. </p><p>  To answer the question, you need to know the retention periods of stories.  By law, a story is stored for fifteen years from the closing of the last loan.  That is, only after this time all old data is canceled. </p><p>  But what about the three years that everyone talks about?  Yes, indeed, such information does occur, but it depends more on the policies of individual banking organizations.  The latter are ready to lend to any person who for the notorious three years had no problems with paying debts.  Typically, such loyalty is characteristic of small or young banks.  Banking flagships will check all information about the borrower before parting with the money. </p><p>  By the way, sometimes even after fifteen years the information is not completely cleared.  A person learns about this only at the time when applying for a new loan.  For this reason, it is very important to check your own rating, so that later you do not have to restore it. </p><h2>  We check the rating </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What does KI look like?" class="if uuid-3192675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/3192675.jpg"></div><p>  Is it possible to reset the credit history?  We have already answered this question, we also said that the rating requires periodic verification.  To implement it, you can use one of the methods: </p><ol><li>  Send a written request to the bureau of stories.  It is important to submit documents that confirm the identity of the applicant. </li><li>  Request officially the Central Bank of our country through the online portal.  Once a year such a service is free, subsequent applications will cost about three hundred rubles. </li><li>  Register on the website of the Credit History Agency (AKI) and get access to your business. </li></ol><p>  To use the latter method, you must know the individual code in advance.  These data can be taken from the same banking organization that approved the loan. </p><p>  Of course, you can hope that you don‚Äôt have to clean the story, and they will approve the loan even so, but still such miracles happen extremely rarely. </p><h2>  Correct CI </h2><p>  Can I reset my credit history?  Everything that the law says about this, we wrote above.  Thus, we can conclude that the credit history cannot be reset by itself, but it can be corrected.  There are several ways by which even the most malicious deadbeat can correct the situation: </p><ol><li>  Credit Doctor.  Service from Sovcombank, the essence of which is to arrange several loans in a row and repay them in a timely manner during a certain flow of time. </li><li>  Work with microfinance organizations.  The essence is about the same as in Sovcombank, only the payment terms are shorter, and there are some benefits. </li><li>  Registration by installments.  This method is good in that you do not need to overpay interest, and paying it off in a timely manner, you can correct the CI.  Then you do not have to ask how you can reset your credit history. </li></ol><h2>  Myth or reality? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dolg.guru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Correct CI" class="if uuid-3192664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/3192664.jpg"></div><p>  It is believed that by removing the credit history from the database, the debtor will solve all his problems.  We would not undertake to state this.  The fact is that the common base is simply absent, and the history of one borrower can be stored in several bureaus.  Information on which bureaus is kept in the dossier is available only in the Central Catalog of Credit Histories (CCCH). </p><p>  It turns out that resetting your credit history or deleting it is pointless, because you cannot delete data from everywhere. </p><h2>  Agree with a creditor? </h2><p>  If you need to take out a loan with a damaged history, you can try to negotiate directly with the bank to which the application is submitted.  Try to explain to the employee why you have a negative history, as well as the reasons for late payments. </p><p>  The situation in your favor can be changed by documents that confirm the inability to pay debts.  For example, it may be a certificate of illness.  In general, any paper that refutes the opinion of dishonesty or lack of income will come in handy. </p><p>  The chances of getting a loan will increase if you submit to the bank: </p><ol><li>  Income statement. </li><li>  Statement of deposit accounts. </li><li>  An extract that confirms the availability of money and their movement on accounts. </li><li>  Receipts that confirm payment of housing and communal services, tax fees and Internet and communication. </li></ol><p>  Most likely, you do not understand what these papers are for.  Everything is commonplace: checks and receipts will show the lender that you are responsible and have funds not only to maintain a comfortable life, but also to pay the loan. </p><h2>  Change last name or passport </h2><p>  How the bank or any credit institution relates depends on what passport details are indicated in the document of the borrower.  For this reason, some people think that if they change their surname and passport, then the debt will be written off in the credit history.  Of course, this is not so, because at least a new passport will not be contained in the database, but do not forget that notes about old documents are always put down. </p><p>  If the banking organization is quite serious, then this method will not be able to deceive it.  Large banks always carefully check data on past documents. </p><p>  That is, the method can be called a worker, but you should not rely on it only.  And the change of surname among some lenders will cause even greater suspicion. </p><h2>  Big loan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="viplawyer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Financial humor" class="if uuid-3192666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/3192666.jpg"></div><p>  You can correct the credit history in the bank if you take a loan for a large amount.  When the client repays the debt on time and never misses the payment, notes about this will fall into his dossier, and thereby the credit history will begin to straighten out. </p><p>  If for some reason it‚Äôs not possible to take a large amount, you can arrange several small loans.  Here we return to the methods listed above.  For each loan repaid, the borrower improves the quality of the story. </p><h2>  Good relationship </h2><p>  How to fix a credit history quickly, we have already told.  If necessary, urgently raising the rating is best to use the services of microloans.  But we were distracted.  Let's talk about a method that will help not worsen your CI. </p><p>  If you have been working with a bank for quite some time, then try not to spoil your relationship with it.  So you are interested in further relationships and show your best side.  If some force majeure happens, then the bank will meet it and, possibly, delay the payment for some time. </p><h2>  Patience </h2><p>  How to make a clean credit history?  The question is quite common.  It all depends on how urgently it needs to be done.  You can wait a few years, but this does not guarantee the zeroing of the story. </p><p>  You, therefore, just take a break and then act in the same way as in the case of an urgent correction.  Remember that a miracle will not happen and your rating will not be reset in two or three years.  You just can tighten your financial situation, which means that banks will meet. </p><h2>  Caution: scammers! </h2><div class="photo" data-original="phg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Memo to the borrower" class="if uuid-3192671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/3192671.jpg"></div><p>  Since the credit issue is relevant for most of the population, then, as they say, demand creates supply.  Recently, there have been many offers with approximately the following content: ‚ÄúI will correct my credit history.  Quickly.  Qualitatively.  Cheap".  And people trust such people or organizations, bring them the last money. </p><p>  Before, twisted in pink dreams, turn to such craftsmen, you should think carefully.  Firstly, such activities are illegal.  This is due to the fact that it is impossible to delete information without violating the law, because only a handful of history bureau employees have access to it. </p><p>  Secondly, such an event may result in a person getting into the black list of banks and other financial organizations for good.  And we are not talking about the fact that with remote access, you can simply lose your own money. </p><p>  It turns out that such "wizards" are looking for gullible citizens and make a fool of their heads.  Think carefully, because there are many more minuses than pluses, and practice shows that such things do not end there. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, do not joke with banks and other lenders.  There may come a time when a loan is needed, but there will be nowhere to take it. </p><p>  It is better to show yourself on the good side as a responsible and obligatory person.  In this case, even in a situation with some violations, banks will go towards a good client. </p><p>  But there is an option even better - to learn financial literacy.  Then, even with a small income, you do not have to go into loans and other loans.  Why are all these bad stories?  Because people do not know how to manage money.  Needs exceed possibilities, and now you give all your salary to banks. </p><p>  If you understand that you will not pull the loan, then maybe you should not take it?  It is much easier to accumulate or try to increase income.  You can live well with any salary; the main thing is to be able to manage it correctly.  Remember that if your expenses are greater than or equal to your income, you will not be able to live well. </p><p>  Plan a budget, save for some goals, learn the material part of money.  Then you do not have to live in debt and hide from collectors.  Adequately evaluate your own material condition and live in proportion to it.  Do everything wisely, and then prosperity and prosperity will not take long. </p>
