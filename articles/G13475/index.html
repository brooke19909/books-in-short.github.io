    <h2>  Lakhtinsky spill: general characteristic </h2><p>  This wonderful place, perhaps, is known to all residents of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof St. Petersburg.</span>  The spill is located within the city.  It is located in the Primorsky district.  This lake has been known for a long time, many residents of the city like to relax here.  It is also worth noting that the reservoir is located on the banks of the Neva Bay, however, it is separated from the bay by a sand embankment.  It has railway tracks, and also runs the Primorsky highway. </p><p>  I wonder where the name of the Lakhta spill came from.  There is a version that it is derived from the Finnish word <em>lahti</em> , which means a bay or bay.  Thus, it becomes clear why the lake is named that way. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth saying a few words about the size of the reservoir.  The Lakhta spill is a fairly large <span>body of water.</span>  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 1.8 square meters.  km  Its length is about 2.5 kilometers, width - 1.5 kilometers.  As for the depth of the reservoir, on average it is just over 4 meters, and in the deepest place - about 8.3 meters.  Thus, we can say that the lake is quite large. </p><h2>  Where is the spill located? </h2><p>  This issue was touched upon a little higher, but it is worth talking about the place where the Lakhtinsky spill is located in more detail.  As you know, it is located in the Primorsky district.  Several rivers flow nearby.  Some of them flow into the body of water - these are Kamenka, Glukhark and Yuntolovka.  In addition to the listed rivers, various drains and ditches form here at different times of the year. </p><p>  It is also necessary to tell about how the shores of the reservoir look.  Here you can often see marshy areas abundantly covered with various species of reeds and reeds.  Interestingly, the spill belongs to the lowland type, which is why there are so many swamps. </p><p>  There is also a small duct.  It connects the reservoir with the <span>Neva Bay.</span>  Its length is about 500 meters.  Above it passes the 1st Lakhtinsky bridge, which has existed for more than 60 years. </p><p>  Nearby is a village called Lakhta and a whole range of treatment facilities.  However, this is not all that the Primorsky district can boast of.  St. Petersburg also includes a large forest zone called Yuntolovskaya forest cottage.  This is another unique natural site.  About it will be told a little later.  Thus, we got acquainted with the place where the lake is located.  Lakhtinsky spill is quite popular among vacationers.  Nearby there are also several interesting places that attract many tourists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The history of the reservoir and its appearance </h2><p>  Now it is worth paying attention to the history of the spill.  According to many sources, this reservoir 100 years ago did not possess such dimensions as it is now.  The depths of the Lakhtinsky spill at the beginning of the 20th century averaged no more than 2.5 meters.  A lot of time has passed since then, and the topography of the bottom of the reservoir has changed dramatically.  Despite the fact that the depth at that time was less, the surface area itself was much larger.  It is known that then the size of the spill was about 13 square meters.  km  Such changes occurred due to the large development of the northern part of the Neva Bay.  For these purposes, it was actively washed.  Thus, we see that over the past 100 years, the body of water has noticeably changed.  This applies not only to its depth and area, but also to many other, less noticeable components, such as the animal and plant world. </p>

    <h2>  Recreation and fishing in this pond </h2><p>  Of course, many have already become interested in the Lakhtinsky spill.  This is not surprising since it is great for a variety of recreational purposes.  The existence of the lake is known to many people who often visit the Primorsky district.  St. Petersburg boasts such a wonderful place to relax, you can often meet fishing lovers here. </p><p>  More recently, this pond was not very suitable for fishing.  This was mainly due to the fact that a large number of networks were installed here.  In this regard, it was impossible to fish on a spinning rod.  Due to poaching in the Lakhta spill, the fish population has noticeably decreased.  Recently, however, close monitoring of the reservoir has been carried out, special raids have been periodically carried out to combat illegal fishing methods.  Thanks to such measures, the number of fish in the pond is increasing.  Sometimes quite large individuals are found here. </p>

    <h2>  Where is better to catch? </h2><p>  Any fishing enthusiast knows that for a good catch in any pond you need to know certain places.  Such secrets exist on the Lakhtinsky spill.  The first thing you should pay attention to is that the lake is quite popular, therefore, going here on a day off, it is better to leave in advance.  Otherwise, finding a place can be quite a long job.  Also, it should be chosen taking into account the direction of the wind.  Often fishermen can be seen from the village of Olgino.  Those who prefer fishing on a feeder should pay attention to another place where a river called Glukharka flows into the lake.  Also, good places are available from Yuntolovka.  It‚Äôs best to catch spinning here.  Often found fish such as pike, perch, pike perch, etc. </p><p>  The lake is also suitable for lovers of winter fishing.  In the cold season, it is likely to catch perch.  However, summer and autumn are the best seasons to visit the Lakhtinsky spill.  Fishing at this time is of most interest and is most often accompanied by a rich catch. </p>
