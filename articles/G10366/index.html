The village is located 19 km from the regional center, the city of Noginsk.  The nearest large settlement is the city of Elektrougli, Moscow Region.  It is not often possible to meet tourists here, however, Kudinovo is a popular place among lovers of country and fishing vacations. </p><h2>  History and description of the village </h2><p>  D. Kudinovo of the Noginsky district is one of the ancient villages of the Moscow region.  There is evidence that this settlement existed in 1742.  There was a lot of clay, and serfs from neighboring villages mined this mineral in the village. </p><p>  In later times, industrial production developed in Kudinovo.  In 1900, the businessman Zhokhovs organized a brick factory here.  He worked until 1914, and then temporarily ceased operations in connection with the First World War.  In the 1920s, the work of the plant resumed.  This enterprise exists to this day, now it is called Kudinovsky Combine OJSC. </p><p>  In 2010, the population of the village of Kudinovo of the Noginsk region was about 3,000 people.  This is a fairly large settlement.  In 2004, the nearby village of the state farm named after the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution was annexed to the village of Kudinovo.  This led to a sharp increase in the number of villagers.  Today Kudinovo is the largest village in the Noginsky district. </p><p>  The weather in Kudinovo of the Noginsky district practically does not differ from the capital, as this village is located relatively close to Moscow.  On the outskirts of the village in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsummer cottages there is a mixed coniferous-deciduous forest.  Here you can pick berries and mushrooms.  There is also a reservoir - Kudinovsky quarry.  This place attracts lovers of fishing and relaxing by the water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  On the territory of Kudinovo there are: a secondary school, a kindergarten, grocery stores, an outpatient clinic, a building materials market, a culture house.

Its construction began in 1820 and was completed by 1835.  In 1901, a new bell tower was built in the church.  There was a parish school, a sobriety society and a large church choir at the temple. </p><p>  In the 1930s, the church was closed.

    <p>  Currently, the Intercession Church has been completely restored, and services are being held there.  There is a Sunday school at the church, as well as a ringer school.  In 2012, the first festival of church bell ringers was held here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 1990s, a <span>new temple</span> was built in the village <span>.</span>  It is consecrated in honor of John the Baptist.  This small building is intended for the sacrament of baptism. </p><h2>  Kudinovsky quarries </h2><p>  Clay and sand were once mined in the village.  This is how the Kudinovsky careers came about.  They even had a special railway line.  Then the quarries were abandoned and naturally filled with water.  Ponds formed on the outskirts of the village. </p><p>  It used to have very clear water.  The nearby <span>Biserovsky fish factory</span> used quarries for breeding valuable breeds of fish.  But over time, the situation has changed for the worse.  In quarries, waste began to be drained, as a result of which the quality of water and the quantity of fish significantly deteriorated. </p><p>  However, people still come here for summer and winter fishing.  The fauna of the reservoir has decreased, but here you can still catch even such valuable fish as trout or pike perch.  Roaches, bream, pike, and perch are also found in quarries.  Paid fishing for carp is organized at one of the ponds. </p>

    <p>  In the summer in quarries you can meet bathing summer residents.  People come to ponds from nearby cities and towns.  Many consider the Kudinovskie career a good place for a beach holiday.  However, it is officially believed that you can only sunbathe on these ponds, as the water does not comply with sanitary standards.  Those who nevertheless decided to immerse themselves in the Kudinovsky quarries, need to remember that there is a very large depth - about 18-20 meters. </p><h2>  Sale of apartments </h2><p>  There are practically no new buildings in the village.
