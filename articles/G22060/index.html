    <p>  "Quick Payment" is implemented from a mobile device.  We can say that this is one of the services of mobile banking, which greatly simplifies the work with finances.  But how to use it?  How does it connect? </p><h2>  Connection Methods </h2><p>  Knowing this is important.  After all, it is far from always possible to quickly replenish the balance of a SIM card using a telephone or to make a money transfer from bank plastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interested in a service called Fast Payment?  Sberbank offers to connect it within the framework of using the Mobile Bank.  Only with its presence does activation of the opportunity take place.  In other words, if the client does not have Mobile Bank connected, then he will not be able to use "Quick Payment". </p><p>  Accordingly, Sberbank's mobile banking is activated by the following methods: </p><ol><li>  In a branch of a financial organization.  A citizen writes a statement on his behalf to connect Mobile Bank.  After the operation, you can make a "Quick payment". </li><li>  Through terminals / ATMs from Sberbank.  Mobile Bank is selected in the list of actions of a particular machine, after which it is connected. </li><li>  Through call centers.  Not the most popular, but relatively simple scenario.  Sberbank offers to activate the ‚ÄúQuick Payment‚Äù service in a similar way to those who want to bring their ideas to life without leaving home. </li></ol><p>  It is the latter method that requires special attention.  What should each client know if he decided to go this way of solving the task?  <span>How to connect "Quick Payment" (Sberbank)</span> via phone? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="option quick payment sberbank how to connect" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1572496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Required data </h2><p>  To do this, you need to have certain information.  Without it, you won‚Äôt be able to activate Mobile Bank.  Accordingly, you can also forget about the "Quick Payment". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First of all, you need to pay attention to the fact that only the owner of banking plastic has the right to activate the service being studied.  And no one else.  This fact will have to be remembered. </p><p>  Do you want to use the option "Quick payment"?  Sberbank offers to activate the Mobile Bank service (and with it the mentioned opportunity) by telephone only if the citizen has the following information: </p><ul><li>  passport data of the card holder (F. I. O., registration); </li><li>  <span>bank card number</span> ; </li><li>  a mobile that connects to banking; </li><li>  code word from plastic. </li></ul><p>  Only in this situation, the operator will fill out an application for the connection of the Mobile Bank.  All this will help to understand that the caller is the real owner of the Sberbank card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fast payment sberbank connect sms" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1572498.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Phones to connect </h2><p>  It is proposed to activate the ‚ÄúQuick Payment‚Äù service (Sberbank) via a mobile phone.  The main thing is to know what numbers to call.  There are several of them.

The combination is round-the-clock.  A call can be made at any time.  Operators will connect the Mobile Bank without much difficulty. </p><p>  But in Russia it is proposed to use the number - 8 800 55 555 50. This is the telephone number of the Sberbank hotline.  Free, also works around the clock. </p><h2>  Connection Instructions </h2><p>  To use the option called "Quick Payment", Sberbank offers to activate "Mobile Bank".

Need to wait for an answer. </li><li>  Tell the operator about the intention to connect the Mobile Bank.  It is advisable to clarify which tariff to activate.  There is free (it is recommended if mobile banking is needed only for quick payments) and paid for 60 rubles per month. </li><li>  Name the information requested by the interlocutor.  A pin code is not required from the card.  But the passport data, card number, as well as the secret word and mobile phone - this is mandatory information. </li><li>  Wait for the application and SMS on the successful connection of the "Mobile Bank". </li></ol><p>  Accordingly, now you can start using the "Quick Payment".

    <h2>  Using Quick Payment </h2><p>  This is not so hard!  It‚Äôs clear how to connect ‚ÄúQuick Payment‚Äù (Sberbank).  SMS teams help activate money transfer services after the Mobile Bank function is activated on the mobile. </p><p>  Which teams to send by number 900 to quickly replenish the balance of a SIM card or transfer money to another account from Sberbank plastic?  Everything is very simple.  It is enough to follow some instructions. </p><p>  Namely: </p><ol><li>  To replenish a particular phone number, you need to write a combination in the message to which the money is transferred (only 10 digits of the number), and then after a space - the amount debited from the card.  In other words, the SMS format looks like this: XXXXXXXXXX 100, where XXXXXXXXXX is the phone number. </li><li>  To transfer certain funds to a bank card in a message, you first need to write "TRANSFER".  Then, with a space, the mobile number is assigned, tied to one or another Sberbank plastic.  After - the amount of the transfer. </li></ol><p>  After all the described actions, the write-off operation is confirmed.  The client will receive an SMS with a secret code, which is sent to 900. Only after that, "Quick Payment" will be made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a quick payment sberbank via phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1572500.jpg"></div>
