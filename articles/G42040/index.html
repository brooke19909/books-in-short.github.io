    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  So where is the Golden Gate Bridge?  It is located in San Francisco, connecting the city with Marine County, Northern California.  The bridge owes its name to the strait of the same name.  The state with the famous landmark is located in the northern part of the San Francisco Peninsula, near the Pacific Ocean.  A large-scale suspension bridge is extremely important for <span>transport infrastructure,</span> but at the same time it appeared not so long ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge in san francisco" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/796550.jpg" width="600"></div>

Steam went through the strait.  It seemed impossible to build a bridge in San Francisco because of the depth of these waters and the incredible distance.  In addition, constant fogs and a strong current in the strait became an obstacle for the workers.  The idea was only a dream.  But for Joseph Strauss, she was the goal.  He created a unique design project and offered his suspension bridge to the city authorities.  Discussions dragged on for a dozen years, attracted new specialists to the construction, and together they came up with an even more perfect solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Suspension bridge" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/796551.jpg" width="600"></div>  The overall plan was developed by Leon Moiseyev, who also had a hand in the creation of the <span>Manhattan Bridge.</span>  Calculations were carried out by Charles Ellis.  Finally, Irving Morrow owes the building a modern-style architecture; he also proposed a recognizable orange-red hue.

    <h2>  Process of creation </h2><p>  The place where the Golden Gate Bridge is located seemed to the opponents of the project extremely dangerous.  The sailors believed that a possible accident would cause the harbor to be blocked, railroad workers feared that the construction would disrupt the ferry service, and trade unions demanded special conditions for employees.  Most severely undermined the architects plans of the <span>Great Depression.</span>  Only the issue of bonds helped finance the construction.  In January 1933, work began on a future <span>US landmark.</span>  The Golden Gate Bridge was built by Strauss, the author of the original project.  He came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing a safety net stretched over water during work.  This decision saved several lives.  In April 1937, the bridge was completed, and in May a grand opening ceremony took place, during which two hundred thousand people crossed the strait.  The next day, the movement of cars began, the start of which was given by telegraph by President Roosevelt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  The area where the Golden Gate Bridge is located is influenced by special <span>environmental conditions.</span>  Therefore, the construction of the structure is unique.  The length of the Golden Gate Bridge is 2737 meters.  The width is <span>27 m.</span> The span between the tall towers is 1280 meters.  The structure rises above the water by 67 m. Not only the dimensions of the structure, but also its details, are impressive.  For example, the diameter of the support cables is almost a meter, and they are made of steel threads coated with zinc.  Every fifteen meters, additional metal cables descend to strengthen the structure.  The length of the cables exceeds two kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="USA, bridge" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/796552.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  In the United States of America, where the Golden Gate Bridge is located, this design is still one of the largest.  For thirty years after the completion of construction, the construction retained the palm as the largest.  Only in 1964, the record passed to <span>the Verrazano Bridge</span> in New York State.  But now the attraction of San Francisco remains important: along the length of the main span, it is in second place in the country.  During operation, the bridge changes and transforms.  During its existence, ropes and cables were replaced, work was underway to increase seismic resistance, and lighting was changing.  Special railing appeared on the bridge, as well as a steel mesh from below.  It is designed to prevent suicide.  It‚Äôs sad, but true: those who want to take their own lives attract a place of amazing beauty, and in previous years dozens of people committed suicide here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge length" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/796553.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <h2>  Some statistics </h2><p>  With each passing year, San Francisco is increasing in size.  Previously, it was the center of the gold rush, and now it is an intellectual paradise, a place with many advanced companies working in the field of computer technology.  Therefore, the number of residents is growing steadily, which means that the relevance of the beautiful bridge is also increasing.  Forty million different vehicles pass through it during the year.  This means that 110 thousand cars cross the strait per day.  The trip from Marin to San Francisco is paid, which brings the state a profit of $ 100 million annually, making it an element of not only the transport, but also the financial structure.  It is also an incredibly popular tourist attraction.  Even those who do not need to go to the other side of the strait come here.  Every year, ten million tourists come to see the Golden Gate Bridge.  This building is considered one of the most photographed in the world.  Its recognizable lines and color inspire people throughout its history. </p>
