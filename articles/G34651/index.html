He is known primarily thanks to the work of the same name by Victor Hugo.  This <span>French writer</span> was a true patriot of his native country and, with his work, tried to rekindle his compatriots' love for the cathedral.  I must say, he completely succeeded.  Indeed, the French love for this building was no longer doubted: during the French Revolution, the townspeople meekly paid a bribe to Robespierre, who otherwise threatened to destroy the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris.  We offer to learn more about this Parisian attraction, the history of its creation and how it can surprise tourists today. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral" class="if" height="478" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/447578.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Notre Dame de Paris (France) - the architectural inspiration of an entire nation </h2><p>  This building was erected at a time when most of the country's inhabitants were uneducated people who transmitted the history of religion by word of mouth.  The Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral, built in the Gothic style, keeps within its walls paintings, murals, portals and stained glass windows with biblical episodes and events depicted on them.  By analogy with other Gothic buildings, you will not find wall paintings here.  They are replaced by a large number of high stained glass windows, serving as the only source of paint and light inside the building.  Until now, visitors to Notre-Dame-de-Paris, whose photo adorns almost any tourist guide to France, note that <span>daylight</span> passing through a colored mosaic of glass gives the building a mystery and inspires sacred awe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This attraction is known to someone firsthand, someone remembers it from the novel of the unforgettable Hugo, and for someone it is associated with a popular musical.  One way or another, the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris is an amazing place with a rich history.  If you are planning a <span>trip to Paris,</span> then do not deprive yourself of the pleasure of visiting this attraction. </p>

    <h2>  History of the foundation of the cathedral </h2><p>  The construction of this structure began in 1163.  The interior decoration was completed only after a century and a half - in 1315.  In 1182, the main altar of this church building was consecrated.  The construction work itself was completed by 1196.  Only the interior decoration lasted a very long time.  Notre-Dame-de-Paris Cathedral was built on the island of Cit√©, considered the heart of the French capital.  The main architects of this monumental structure, whose height is 35 meters (the bell tower of the cathedral rises to 70 meters), were Pierre de Montreux, Jean de Schel. </p><p>  The long construction time also affected the exterior of the building, since for a century and a half Norman and Gothic styles were mixed, thanks to which the image of the cathedral turned out to be truly unique.  One of the most visible parts of this structure is a six-ton ‚Äã‚Äãbell located in the right tower.  For many centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris has served as the venue for the royal weddings, as well as their coronations and burials. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  XVII-XVIII centuries </h2><p>  This magnificent building was subjected to great tests in the last decades of the seventeenth century.  During this period, marked by the reign of King Louis XIV, beautiful stained glass windows and graves were destroyed in the Cathedral.  During the French Revolution, Parisians were warned that this magnificent building would be wiped off the face of the earth.  However, they have the opportunity to prevent this if they regularly pay a certain amount of money for the needs of the revolutionaries.  It is rare that a Parisian refused to fulfill this ultimatum.  Thanks to what the cathedral was literally saved by the local population. </p>

    <h2>  Cathedral in the 19th century </h2><p>  During the reign of Napoleon in 1802, Notre Dame Cathedral was re-consecrated.  And four decades later, its restoration began.  In the course of it, the building itself was restored, broken statues and sculptures were replaced, and a spire was also built.  Restoration work lasted a little less than 25 years.  After their completion, it was decided to demolish all the buildings adjacent to the Cathedral, due to which a magnificent square was formed. </p>

    <h2>  What is worth paying attention to when visiting the Notre Dame Cathedral? </h2><p>  In addition to its magnificent appearance, the cathedral can offer visitors a lot of interesting things hidden within its walls.  So, it is here from ancient times that one of the nails with which Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross is stored.  There is also the famous bas-relief of the alchemist Notre Dame. </p><p>  If you come to the cathedral on Sunday, you can hear organ music.  And the organ located here is the largest in all of France.  On <span>Good Friday,</span> all believers are given the opportunity to bow to such shrines of the cathedral as the <span>crown of thorns</span> and a piece of the Holy Cross with a nail preserved in it. </p><p>  Indulge in the opportunity to admire the surroundings from an observation deck located on the south tower of the cathedral.  However, keep in mind that to climb it you will have to overcome 402 steps.  In addition, do not lose sight of the bronze star located in the square in front of the cathedral.  It marks zero kilometer, and it is from it that all French roads are counted back from the 17th century. </p>

    <h2>  Make a wish </h2><p>  It is safe to say that a visit to Notre Dame is a very significant event for any person.

    <h2>  Cathedral Hours </h2><p>  The main hall of Notre Dame is open every day from 6:45 to 19:45.  However, keep in mind that from time to time the flow of visitors is ‚Äúhindered‚Äù by local ministers.

During this period, it is not so crowded, and you can enjoy the relative silence and in a relaxed atmosphere to see this attraction.  Also, if you have the opportunity, come here at sunset.  At this time, you can enjoy the magnificent picture, which is a play of light passing inside the cathedral through multicolored fancy glass stained-glass windows. </p><h2>  Paris, Notre Dame Cathedral: cost of visiting </h2><p>  Entrance to the main hall of the cathedral is free.  Please note that all year round every Wednesday at two in the afternoon, as well as every Saturday at 2:30 in the afternoon there is a tour in Russian.

Entrance to the treasury will have to pay adults three euros, schoolchildren and students two euros, and children from 6 to 12 years old - 1 euro. </p><p>  If you want to climb the tower of the cathedral, then adult visitors will have to pay 8.5 euros, for students - 5.5 euros.
