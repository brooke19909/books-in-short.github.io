    <h2>  Housing in Odessa </h2><p>  Rest in Odessa is, first of all, comfort and warmth.  Such an atmosphere is created not only due to the unique climate and special mood of local residents, but also due to the many comfortable hotels, pensions and rest houses located in the city.  Here you can choose housing for every taste and for any money. </p><p>  Most housing offers come from the center or Primorsky <span>district of Odessa,</span> as these places are most suitable for a quality vacation.  In all this diversity you can find cheap hotels in Odessa. </p><h2>  Hotel "Zirka" </h2><p>  In the very center of the city is a cozy hotel.  The institution received its "starry" name from the cinema of the same name in the building of which it is located.  Hotel "Zirka" (Odessa) is a budget accommodation option, as it has some rooms that do not have windows.  They are the cheapest.  But, despite this, the rooms have all the amenities.  Therefore, this drawback does not affect the level of comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
