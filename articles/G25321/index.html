    <p>  As for architecture and interiors from a professional point of view, in this case almost everything is done in the recent neoclassical style, which ideally combines the environmental friendliness of the materials used and minimalism.  It should also be noted that the color scheme in which the hotel is decorated is selected perfectly. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  To date, the Prestige Hotel (Adler, Sochi) has 60 excellent rooms of various categories.  By the way, 12 suites stand out from the total number. </p><p>  The infrastructure of this hotel project is well developed, and this allows the guests of the institution to spend time interestingly and at the same time not to go outside the tourist complex. </p><p>  Service is one of the most important advantages of the Prestige Hotel, which has 4 stars.  Any guest of the project has the opportunity to visit the beach, Finnish bathhouse, restaurant, pool, cafe and bar.  In addition, not far from the hotel there is the so-called ‚Äúresort town‚Äù, where a variety of discos are constantly held, nightclubs, a casino work and bowling is available for visiting.  If you came to Adler with your children or just want to have fun, then you should definitely mark the local dolphinarium, Amphibius water park, as well as other important infrastructure objects, not of the hotel, but of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

This, by the way, is a unique feature of this hotel complex, because there are not so many establishments with at least a similar location in Sochi. </p><p>  You can reach the beach in a matter of minutes, and it will happen something like this: you leave your room, go down to the exit and find yourself in a chic alley with palm trees, along which you will reach the warm waters of the Black Sea.  By the way, a well-equipped aerator is personally located for hotel guests on the sea coast. </p><p>  Another feature of this institution is the presence of a night pendant on the beach area, thanks to which each guest has the opportunity to plunge into the Black Sea even at night, and this swimming will be not only pleasant, but also convenient.  In addition, from almost all balconies of the hotel rooms there is a breathtaking view of the sea, which is very romantic. </p><p>  Even more comfortable your <span>stay in Adler</span> will be made by modern hotel rooms, where there is everything, so you will definitely like it here.

If you want to get a new experience, then you definitely need to spend some 30 minutes to get to the foot of the Caucasus Mountains and have an unforgettable time at the ski resort.  As you can see, both in winter and summer, holidays in Sochi can be not only interesting, but also truly unforgettable. </p><p>  If you are reading this article, then you should definitely remember the truth: when arriving in Adler, the Prestige Hotel (Education Street, 163rd Building) should be one of the first to visit.  The staff of this project will answer all your questions, and after that you will definitely want to stay in this hotel complex.
