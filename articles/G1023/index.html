    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Tourists visiting the Ellaidhoo Maldives by Cinnamon Hotel note the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The island, although not large, but very picturesque. </li><li>  Beach lovers will be pleasantly surprised to see a snow-white beach with comfortable sunbeds and umbrellas.  By the way, with the availability of free places on the beach, as a rule, there are no problems. </li><li>  For those who follow their figure even on vacation, a large fitness center is provided.

However, like every hotel.  A big minus of the hotel, all guests call the presence of breakwaters, which are around the entire perimeter of the hotel.  Concrete slabs are so high that they can be seen in almost every corner of the island, so it is sometimes problematic to make beautiful photos against the backdrop of beautiful landscapes.  These facilities protect the island from natural disasters, but due to their unpretentious appearance, the overall impression of the hotel is spoiled. </p>
