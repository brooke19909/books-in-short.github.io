    <p>  There are no negative responses towards the material, but only so, simple wishes regarding the burning of yarn in the sun.  Indeed, under its scorching rays, quite often there is a loss of the former color of the threads.  But consumers are hoping that the manufacturer will take into account their recommendations and improve the technology of fiber production. </p>
