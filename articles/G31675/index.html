In the harsh winter of 1935, he, the chief of staff of the brigade of torpedo boats, to save the personnel and their families from freezing in the barracks thoroughly blown through, called ... firefighters from the city.  Golovko asked them to pour water over the barracks, in a hard frost an ice dome immediately formed, which protected the house from the wind and bad weather.  So we wintered. </p><h2>  Don Simon Garcia Galvis </h2><p>  <span><span>The biography of Admiral Golovko</span> <span>is as stormy, abruptly changing and rebellious as the mountain river of his native land.</span></span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>In 1936, Arseniy Grigorievich departed from the Pacific Fleet to Moscow to continue his education at the Naval Academy.</span>  <span>But again failed to finish their studies.</span>  <span>With a group of volunteers, he was seconded to Spain, on the territory of which battles with the fascist invaders had already been fought.</span> </p>
