The first category ironing clothes and linen leads to a great mood, soothes.  The latter are extremely physically tired in the process of ironing.  However, both ‚Äúamateurs‚Äù and ‚Äúhaters‚Äù will rightfully appreciate the advantages that a wireless iron offers.  What kind of miracle is this?  Let's get it right. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Among the first ‚Äúirons‚Äù we can name a pan familiar to everyone.  Prepared hot coals were poured into it and then transported with a heated bottom over the surface that needed to be smoothed out.  A little later in Russia for this purpose they used a special corrugated board - the ruble.  However, with its help, only coarse cloth could be put in order. </p>

    <p>  For more delicate materials, the first iron was invented, which was cast iron.  For ironing, two such units were used at once, which were alternately heated on a hot stove.  A little later, they began to use a hinged iron with a hinged lid.  In the middle it was hollow - red-hot coals fell here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As you can see, if you look, then initially all the irons were wireless.  In the late nineteenth century, an electric iron was invented.  From this time a new era began in the history of this useful subject in the household. </p>

    <p>  Technology, as you know, does not stand still, but moves with huge steps forward.  Modern manufacturers go further.  Today they offer their consumers another novelty - a wireless iron. </p><h2>  Main </h2><p>  Like other industries, this segment has its own ‚Äútrendsetters‚Äù - these are world- <span>famous brands</span> Panasonic, Tefal, Philips.  The wireless iron consists of a body and a special station through which the sole will be heated.  Different models have different configurations, however, they are similar in this heating method.  Consider some of the most popular wireless irons. </p><h2>  Philips Azure Cordless </h2><p>  This wireless iron has a beautiful modern design.  This device is made of high quality material and assembled with the latest technology - no gaps, backlashes or crevices.  The iron of this series is very comfortable in the hand. </p>

    <p>  The contact group is located behind the device.  Through it, during the installation of the iron on the base, a heating element is connected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This model, unlike similar products of other companies, can be installed not only horizontally in the docking station, but also, like a regular iron, vertically. </p><p>  The sole of this unit is covered with a special coating that is resistant to various scratches.  With the help of it, a wireless iron glides perfectly along the fabric, it does not scratch about various zippers, buttons and buttons located on clothes. </p>

    <p>  On the handle of the device is a regulator with which you can adjust the mode of operation.  However, due to the special, not very successful location of the handle, you should carefully select the appropriate mode.  The controller switches are indicated by a small click. </p><p>  On the handle of the iron are two buttons that control the flow of steam.  One of them sprays moisture immediately in front of the iron, and the second includes vertical steam.  Using the sharp nose of the unit, you can perfectly iron the fabric even in the most inaccessible places. </p><p>  The DOK station has a three-mode switch.  The wireless iron can be removed and mounted on the stand in the first position.  On average, the unit is attached to the stand.  The third position turns the wireless iron into a conventional appliance, with a cord.  The latter option allows you to conveniently and easily iron heavy, large items. </p><h2>  Tefal Freemove FV9920 </h2><p>  This model as a whole has characteristics similar to the previous unit.  <span>The Tefal cordless iron</span> also has a special stand with which it heats up.  ‚ÄúFree‚Äù work lasts 30 seconds.  After this time, a special indicator starts flashing red on the stand, and an <span>audible signal sounds.</span>  This device "calls" to return the iron to the platform for recharging.  It does not last long - just a few seconds. </p><p>  Unlike the previous model, this Tefal iron cannot stand upright.  This causes some inconvenience - users are used to old models that need to be set in this way.  However, after some time, the hands "get used" to place the device as required by the instructions. </p><p>  The convenience of using a cordless iron is obvious.  Users will appreciate the mobility of this device - there is no need to carry uncomfortable wires.  If necessary, you can easily iron the product anywhere in the room without being tied to a power source. </p><p>  The power of the <span>Tefal</span> wireless <span>iron</span> is 2400 W, while the steam boost reaches 170 g / min.  This device has several steaming modes, including vertical.  With this device you can carry out normal dry ironing. </p><p>  The sole of this model of iron is self-cleaning, with a double anti-drip system that protects linen from unaesthetic stains during ironing. </p><h2>  Panasonic NI-1500Z </h2><p>  This wireless iron, like the previous models, is equipped with a special stand with which it is recharged.  The convenience of this electric seamstress was especially appreciated, because during their work it is often necessary to iron individual parts directly on the mannequin. </p><p>  Panasonic has equipped its model with a removable water tank.  The convenient shape of the platform makes it easy to iron the fabric near the buttons.  Both professional seamstresses and ordinary users will appreciate the convenience of the super-steaming mode. </p>

    <p>  Among the additional advantages, it is worth noting the shock resistance of this device - if it falls from small heights, for example, from an <span>ironing board, the</span> sturdy case will remain intact. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Wireless irons are becoming more and more part of everyday life.  And this is by no means accidental.  The versatility, mobility, practicality, as well as the modern design of these devices make them a welcome acquisition as an assistant at work and at home. </p>
