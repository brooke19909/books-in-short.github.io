The developers of this equipment have raised miniature security cameras to a new level due to their endowment with more efficient automatic, and in some cases robotic intelligent control systems.  Partially similar technologies were used in the first generations of video surveillance systems, but modern solutions differ markedly in a number of parameters, which is confirmed by the PTZ camera as an example.  What does this mean in practice of use?  First of all, it means more control over the settings of the camera, and in remote mode.  In addition, the creators of PTZ models pay attention to the basic characteristics of shooting, allowing you to get high quality images while maintaining the modest size of the camera itself. </p>

    <h2>  Overview of PTZ Cameras </h2><p>  This is a non-standard camera, the main difference of which is the presence of an integrated electronic-mechanical drive.  Moreover, the matrix itself, which ensures the fixation of the video stream, fully complies with the characteristics of traditional compact cameras for video surveillance.  Features are determined precisely by a drive with a robotic control principle, which, by the way, can act as a separate part - a configuration item.  However, the latest models of this type differ in their internal structure.  Optical zoom, in particular, allows you to change the viewing angle that the PTZ camera captures.  What is this from a consumer perspective?  In essence, this means a variable <span>focal length</span> with optical reduction and enlargement of the target object.  Signals for controlling the drive mechanism and internal sensors can come from the remote control, or can be generated by controllers that interact with the computer.  That is, through the software, the user can configure the fully automatic operation of the camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key Features </h2>

    <p>  The number of pixels is the main indicator of the quality of work for all types of such cameras.  The simplest versions are provided with 0.3 MP matrices, while the high-tech versions are provided with 5 MP modules.  The number of recorded frames per second is usually in the range of 6-30 units.  Of course, in assessing the quality of the image, you can not do without the resolution of the PTZ device - HD cameras, for example, confidently support the 1920x1080 format.  At the same time, the aging and aging VGA matrix at 640x480 remains relevant.  In security complexes, the use of such modules is often justified.  But if the above-described characteristics fully fit into the set of qualities of conventional surveillance cameras, then PTZ has noticeable advantages in the speed of rotation and increase in focus.  So, the optical zoom can be 36x, and the digital one is 18x.  As for the turning speed, in modern models it reaches 400 ¬∞ / s.  Also, advanced modifications are equipped with 3D-positioning technology. </p><h2>  PTZ Applications </h2>

These are security systems for security and video communications in conference rooms.  In both cases, users appreciate the flexibility of the equipment in terms of control and practically unlimited possibilities for the physical installation of equipment.  It is important to note here the wireless connection systems that the modern PTZ camera supports.  What does this mean during operation?  Wireless technology virtually eliminates the need for cabling to the device.  From the point of view of disguise, this is the best solution, since an attacker will have less chance of detecting signs <span>of a video surveillance system.</span>  Conversely, the operational work of the rotary mechanics of the camera will allow you to track what is happening in the room with the most advantageous positioning. </p><h2>  Types of video camera designs </h2><p>  Manufacturers produce cameras of this type in several variations.  The most widely used PTZ PTZ camera in the form of a hemisphere.  This variety is called Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãDome and is characterized by high fault tolerance.  Due to its geometrical shape, the design itself minimizes the risk of dust and moisture particles entering the enclosure. </p><p>  Another option is a spherical design, which in many respects is similar to cameras in the form of a hemisphere.  Such models are usually equipped with powerful infrared illumination and protection against vandals.  In general, PTZ dome cameras are designed in such a way that all the mechanical components of the filling have minimal chance of direct contact with the environment.  This advantage is especially manifested in the cases of street models, which deserve special attention. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features of street models </h2>

    <p>  Operation of outdoor video surveillance systems requires consideration of a number of additional factors.  Among them are the nuances of ensuring communication between the camera and the control panel, the organization of the power supply system and issues of protecting equipment from external influences.  In terms of protection, enclosures usually receive a thermal casing with dust and moisture insulation.  Some models are additionally equipped with a heater and ventilation system, which provide the ability to cold start at peak negative and positive temperatures.  Power can be provided directly or through batteries.  By the way, the use of uninterrupted power supply sources is justified.  Even the typical PTZ camera setup allows you to automate the process of switching to backup power in case of unstable power supply.  Communication, in turn, is also organized either directly via cable or wirelessly using a radio module. </p><h2>  Analog and Digital Models </h2><p>  In analog models, the resulting record is automatically processed by a digital processor.  Further, the material is sent to an electronic converter, in which conversion takes place again, but in the reverse mode.  Communication communication of such equipment is provided by coaxial wires.  The disadvantages of this type of model include a low resolution, which does not allow you to rely on a high-quality image when shooting at long distances.  Digital PTZ surveillance cameras also provide preliminary signal processing in the processor, after which the material can be transmitted via TCP / IP in the originally specified format.  The main advantage of digital models is precisely the high-quality "picture", since in terms of communication and mechanical equipment, analog devices in some cases turn out to be a more reliable solution. </p><h2>  Camera control </h2>

    <p>  In addition to adjusting the basic shooting parameters, PTZ cameras provide a host of control options already in the process of directly using the device.  When installing the camera on the object, the user can pre-program it into hundreds of predefined positions.  For each mode, a whole set of position parameters is assumed, including the angle, zoom level, etc. Some models also allow you to assign individual automatic scanning scenarios.  For example, the outdoor PTZ camera is the most developed in this regard, since it has to cover large areas, including those with long-range plans.  Remote control, in turn, makes it possible to correct <span>panoramic shooting</span> with an inclination.  For this, the telemetry console is most often used. </p><h2>  PTZ Camera Manufacturers </h2>

    <p>  High-tech segments are quickly filled with products from large manufacturers.  In this case, the situation is somewhat different, since the less successful companies demonstrate less well-known companies.  The Axis PTZ camera occupies a leading position, the modifications of which are focused on both specialized and universal surveillance tasks.  Also noteworthy are offers from Dahua, Geovision and integrated solutions from Optimus.  Of the major world-famous brands, Samsung engineers have mastered PTZ technology quite well, although due to the high cost, these products are not so popular compared to their counterparts from the above manufacturers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Not so expressed is the interest of consumers themselves in CCTV systems of this type.  Despite the obvious technological breakthrough of individual solutions, these products still occupy a separate narrow niche.  Manufacturers who are trying to develop new options and functionalities that, in principle, a PTZ camera can also understand this.  What does this mean in the context of the overall development of the segment?  At this stage, technologists are betting on optimizing the communication interaction of the camera itself and the control complex.  In practice, this will mean a simplification of the means of organizing communication between the individual components of video surveillance systems, and at the same time, a closer convergence of the mechanics of cameras and software. </p>
