    <h2>  Some interesting historical information </h2><p>  These edges were inhabited about 1700 years ago.  But after 300 centuries, Genoa, competing with Venice, occupied this area to put its trading posts leading to the Middle East.  And a century later the lands began to belong to the Ottoman Empire, there were only about three hundred people living there and fifty-six courtyards stood. </p><p>  The village was gradually growing.  At the end of the XVIII century, it became part of the Russian Empire.  After numerous disturbances, only forty-two yards remained.  In the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, he was changed names and postscript to various regions and provinces.  The village, which has long been called Kapsikhor, however, grew and was inhabited by the Tatars, who had a mosque and two trading shops, and about 500 people gathered residents.  They actively cultivated grapes because they had their own land. </p><h2>  After World War II </h2><p>  When the revolution took place, the population was already about 1,500 people.  Then the Second World War came to Crimea, and in 1944, after the liberation of the peninsula, all Crimean Tatars were resettled in Central Asia.  Residents from different regions and republics of the USSR began to gather on free lands.  These were mainly collective farmers from the Krasnodar and Stavropol Territories, and then from Ukraine.  In 1945, Kapsichor was renamed.  It became known as Marine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The village of Morskoye </h2>

    <p>  The advantages and features of this sparsely populated area are that there are mountains nearby where you can walk around freely.  The sea is very close by and there are no noisy entertainment establishments that you get tired of in cities.  Morskoye (Crimea), according to reviews of vacationers who have not been to foreign resorts, does not disappoint.  There is a huge selection of housing, to which many relate very carefully, writing off by e-mail and choosing the best option for themselves. </p><p>  For new arrivals who have never been to this cozy place before, the village seems quite large.  Its location is also attractive: nearby are villages and cities where you can go for a change. </p><p>  But the most important thing that strikes is a very long beach, consisting of pebbles.  There is always a place on it where there will be no crowding.  The water in the sea is clear and clean when it does not storm, of course.  The beach is free, which is important for those who visit it in the early morning until ten o‚Äôclock, and in the evening, after 17-18, when the most even tan is laid down and there is no chance of sunburn. </p><h2>  How is the beach arranged? </h2><p>  Everyone who visited Morskoye (Crimea), reviews about the beach were generally favorable, but some would like their cleanliness to be monitored more carefully and put more litter bins and toilets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="village sea crime reviews" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/2034677.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is they who are missing not only on the beach, but in the entire village.  This is noted by all vacationers.  Therefore, many people go and carry garbage in bags.  This is not very convenient.  Everyone likes that the water is so clean that the bottom is visible.  The jellyfish takes out closer to the shore only when the sea is worried.  The highway runs along the coast.  But there are not too many cars, and they do not interfere with the peace of swimming and sunbathing people.
