In 2017, the manufacturer decided to continue production, but of an already improved model.  As a result, the B7 line appeared.  One of the televisions of this line is the LG OLED55B7V.  Reviews about him are mostly positive. </p><p>  In the article we will consider in detail the characteristics of this new product, its features.  We also bring to your attention the comments of the owners of this TV, in which they report on the advantages and disadvantages of the model. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  This TV can be described in one simple phrase - perfection in simplicity.  There is absolutely nothing superfluous in it. </p><p>  But there is a stylish black frame (the thickness has decreased, when compared with the previous model) and a convenient silver stand. </p><p>  The pictures of the TV presented in the article speak about all its visual features.  But in fact, this model is much more interesting.  Owners of LG OLED55B7V in the reviews report, if you look at it from the side, you can‚Äôt see the panel itself, it is so amazingly thin! </p><p>  The only thing that catches your eye is the lower half of the screen.  It was decided to expand it to install speakers. </p><p>  The upper part of the screen is bordered by a thin frame, the thickness of which reaches only a few millimeters.  Many users even compare the thickness of the TV with their smartphones.  Most buyers are shocked - LG is even thinner!  Such technology will amaze anyone. </p><h2>  About display </h2><p>  This topic is the subject of most reviews of the LG OLED55B7V TV.  The display is truly impressive - 55-inch (139 cm), and the screen resolution is 3840x2160 (UHD).  But much more attention is drawn to the type of matrix, which is also indicated in the name of the model itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="preporucamo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LG OLED55B7V reviews" class="if uuid-2864523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2864523.jpg"></div><p>  OLED is the abbreviation for <span>organic LED.</span>  The technology is unique.  To create such LEDs, it is necessary to use multilayer thin-film structures, which consist of layers of several polymers. </p><p>  This technology gives the display amazing features.  And be sure to list, performing a review of LG OLED55B7V.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  The maximum display brightness exceeds 100,000 cd / m¬≤.  Since the service life depends on exactly what power the TV host sets, it is recommended to keep it at around 1,000 cd / m¬≤.  This is the standard brightness level. </li><li>  The display contrast is infinite.  The indicator is more than 1,000,000: 1. </li><li>  Energy consumption is economical, but it also depends on brightness. </li><li>  This TV has a very wide range of operating temperatures.  It ranges from ‚àí40 to +70 ¬∞ C. </li><li>  The viewing angles are huge, which allows you to enjoy high-quality image from anywhere (at any angle). </li><li>  The OLED TV responds instantly.  Inertness is completely absent. </li></ul><p>  Are there any disadvantages of the LG OLED55B7V?  The review is objective, because it should be noted and cons.  If we do not talk about the high price (the technology has not been worked out, so the creation of such TVs is a costly process), then we must mention the high sensitivity of the display to moisture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, not everyone knows that the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and ‚Äúred‚Äù OLEDs work much longer than the ‚Äúblue‚Äù one.  Because of this, the image may distort slightly after years of use.  This nuance is the ‚Äúscourge‚Äù of all TVs with OLED technology. </p><p>  If you believe the statements of LG manufacturers, then they managed to eliminate this drawback in the model in question.  The developers managed to bring the "blue" OLED to high levels. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  This is the heart of the TV.  In the reviews left about the LG OLED55B7V model, a lot is said about the quality of the image transmitted to the screen.  The processor plays a role no less important than the display. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv lg OLED55B7V reviews" class="if uuid-2864524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2864524.jpg"></div><p>  Manufacturers classify it with the word "smart."  The Œ±9 processor has the following features: </p><ul><li>  4-step noise reduction.  On the displayed image, grain is practically absent.  The same can be said of the stripes. </li><li>  Sharpening at the edges of objects.  The image becomes detailed, and the texture becomes sharper.  The picture looks more realistic, deeper. </li><li>  Improving the depth of field.  Due to this feature, the main object is clearly separated from the background.  The processor analyzes its edges and texture, processes them.  The subject becomes sharper and the edges sharper.  In general, this gives a significant increase in image sharpness.  The viewer distinguishes even small, inconspicuous details. </li><li>  True Color Accuracy Pro.  The palette used by the intelligent processor contains 7.3 times more shades (when compared with conventional TVs).  Therefore, the colors look natural, natural, displayed without any distortion. </li><li>  HFR technology.  Thanks to its presence, the processor reproduces even the content whose frequency exceeds 120 frames per 1 second.  Therefore, even sharp movements look very smooth on the display. </li></ul><p>  Judging by what LG OLED55B7V TV receives, all of the listed technologies really work.  However, there is no doubt about that.  After all, LG has been using the technology of the future for a long time, annually expanding the functionality of its equipment.  The TV of this model is another proof of this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  TV Features </h2><p>  About them, you also need to tell without fail before moving on to the reviews left about the LG OLED55B7V model.  The main features of this TV include the following options: </p><ul><li>  Security Manager in webOS3.5.  It provides a high level of privacy.  No wonder this TV model was noted with prestigious certificates of international standards that confirm its compliance with safety criteria.  The dispatcher does not allow unauthorized installations of various programs, data leakage, as well as hacking attempts. </li><li>  Surround sound.  Another important feature of the new LG TV (55 inches).  OLED55B7V is equipped with modern Dolby Atmos technology, which is responsible for the most accurate audio support.  How does she work?  The system literally ‚Äúbinds‚Äù the sound to specific spatial points.  This forms a rich, rich sound field. </li><li>  Remote Magic Remote.  It would seem that what could be special about such a simple thing?  But the developers were able to prove themselves here.  The remote control from LG 55 (OLED55B7) is a standard of simplicity, harmoniously combined with convenience.  From it you can control the TV, set-top box, as well as other devices connected via HDMI.  The remote control of this particular model has additional buttons.  There are three of them: Magic Zoom, rewind, and access to an online movie theater. </li><li>  Appendix IVI.  This is the same online cinema for which a separate button has been created.  With the application, a movie library with many feature films and documentaries, cartoons and TV shows becomes available to the viewer.  The assortment has everything from the latest innovations to the immortal classics. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="hdtelevizija.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="OLED TV LG 55 inch OLED55B7V" class="if uuid-2864531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2864531.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, the forecasts of many amateurs and experts that the 2017 models will not differ much from the previous line did not materialize.  LG OLED55B7V TV with OLED technology turned out to be more modern and perfect.  Its characteristics are a vivid confirmation of this. </p><h2>  HDR </h2><p>  This option needs to be described in more detail.  HDR can safely be called a step in the development of TV technology, following Ultra HD, which, it would seem, has conquered everyone recently. </p><p>  This is a completely new video format.  It contains both ultra-high resolution and maximum color and brightness information.  It is important to note.  that such functions do not work for the overall picture, but for each pixel separately. </p><p>  Thanks to this technology, which is also used in the OLED55B7V, it was possible to transfer a much more realistic image to the screen, since HDR is what removes a lot of restrictions that other TVs have. </p><p>  Some do not understand why this technology is needed.  In simple terms, home versions of cult films will no longer lose in quality.  It will remain at the studio level, at which it was originally. </p><p>  The features of the OLED55B7V TV acquired with HDR are impressive: </p><ul><li>  The display shows complex scenes where objects are much brighter than on ordinary screens. </li><li>  The wider the palette, the higher the detail.  Little things become noticeable even in the lightest and darkest corners of the image. </li><li>  Colors look many times more saturated.  This is not surprising, because HDR uses a special color space known as Rec.  2020. It significantly exceeds the standard palette in depth of shades. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="comercialcountry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LG OLED55B7V OLED TV reviews" class="if uuid-2864530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2864530.jpg"></div><p>  Model OLED55B7V boasts the presence of Dolby Vision.  But this is an advanced version of HDR!  It is used by such world film studios as XXI Century Fox, Warner Brothers, Walt Disney Studios, Universal, etc.  The TV correctly supports Dolby Vision, because it is equipped with a special hardware chip. </p><p>  Modern content is created in this format.  Yes, and online movie theaters have already adapted to it, so additional data is transmitted to the TV without the slightest delay. </p><p>  Even the usual comparison of images shown by different TVs (without and with HDR), allows us to understand the obvious difference.  Those people who once watched something on the OLED55B7V no longer want to pay attention to other TVs.  LG has created the product that you really want to buy. </p><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  The above functions are only part of the technical characteristics that the novelty we are considering has.  The OLED LG 55 ‚Ä≥ also has many more features.  The OLED55B7V TV also boasts the following options: </p><ul><li>  Management via smartphone.  To do this, install the functional application LG TV Plus. </li><li>  The connection of the TV with the phone.  The option is called ‚ÄúMobile Connection‚Äù.  It allows you to use a smartphone instead of a remote control. </li><li>  WiDi option.  Allows you to transfer information from a phone, tablet, laptop or other device to a large TV screen. </li><li>  Miracast function.  Allows you to transfer the image from any connected device to the TV screen.  If, for example, you connect a phone and start taking pictures with it, then everything will be displayed on the LG display. </li><li>  SIMPLINK option.  Significantly simplifies the work with a whole range of devices.  SIMPLINK helps to turn on, for example, a home theater and TV, and then turn them off just by pressing a single button. </li><li>  Parental control.  An option that helps adults ‚Äúprohibit‚Äù any channels by encoding them, set a timer that limits the time a child watches TV, etc. </li><li>  Powerful linguistic support.  In the "dictionary" of the TV - 35 languages. </li><li>  Reception of satellite, cable and terrestrial TV. </li><li>  HbbTV support option. </li><li>  Subtitles </li><li>  Electronic TV program. </li><li>  Connectors for external devices: 4 HDMI, 3 USB, input for RF and SAF antennas, as well as cables (LAN and optical), Bluetooth, separate headphone output, CI slot, as well as RS-232C and Wi-Fi. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LG 55 inch OLED55B7V" class="if uuid-2864527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2864527.jpg"></div><p>  Based on such a rich list of options, we can conclude that the OLED TV LG OLED55B7V is one of the most versatile and modern devices.  This model is ideal for maximum enjoyment from watching movies, TV shows, matches, cartoons, shows, etc. </p><h2>  Customer feedback on quality </h2><p>  Now you can pay attention to the reviews left about the LG OLED55B7V Ultra HD TV.  Here are just some delighted user comments: </p><ul><li>  The picture is so realistic that you can‚Äôt take your eyes off the TV.  Some even joke that in this LG everything looks more beautiful than in real life. </li><li>  There is really everything on the TV.  All new technologies that you can come up with.  Nowadays, almost every month some kind of electronic novelty is released.  However, this 2017 TV is also relevant in 2018. </li><li>  Football on such a screen will be watched even by a person who has never been fond of it, since the viewer has the impression that he is sitting not in front of the TV, but in the VIP box, in the stadium.  Thanks to all the qualities and technologies listed above, it is possible to trace all the emotions of the players, the slightest facial expressions.  This is impressive. </li><li>  Watching movies on an LG 55 '' OLED55B7V TV is a pleasure.  Its owners do not go to the cinema.  Why would they go somewhere if there is a better alternative at home? </li><li>  When viewing content in total darkness with an aspect ratio of 21: 9, viewers see only one picture.  The finest panel is not noticeable at all. </li><li>  Content in 4K quality and with HDR support can transfer the viewer to another reality.  Nowadays there are a lot of such videos.  You can watch them and enjoy all the technical potential of the TV. </li><li>  Also, LG OLED55B7V with OLED technology is an ideal choice for gamers.  Fans of playing in the X-Box or Play Station in admiration.  They write in their reviews that it seems as if you are playing on some powerful computer, and even with the graphics settings set to the maximum. </li><li>  The sound is really good.  So much so that most users include it by 30-40%, no more. </li><li>  SMART options are fast enough.  It is especially convenient to use them with the remote control.  The operation process is somewhat similar to using a computer mouse.  You just need to drive the remote control in front of the display, and the cursor will repeat the movement.  Many say this is the most convenient option management solution they have ever encountered. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="jpstrings.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LG OLED55B7V customer reviews" class="if uuid-2864529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2864529.jpg"></div><p>  The price of the LG OLED55B7V TV exceeds 100,000 rubles.  Despite this, absolutely all the people who bought it assure that it is really worth it. </p><h2>  Objective Pros </h2><p>  When the first emotions of such a gorgeous acquisition pass a little, people are able to reasonably talk about the advantages and disadvantages of their gadget.  After examining the <span>reviews</span> left about the <span>OLED TV LG OLED55B7V,</span> you can understand that users refer to its main advantages: </p><ul><li>  A much less noticeable ABL (when compared with the previous B6V model).  This contributes to high contrast. </li><li>  Impressive zoom quality. </li><li>  Play content in 4K without freezes and delays. </li><li>  Functionality.  To study the Internet, you no longer need to have a laptop.  Watching videos, reading news, even sitting on social networks is now possible using the TV. </li><li>  Great sound.  In this model there is bass and even a soundbar.  There is no need to connect external speakers. </li><li>  Two-point controllers in HDR mode. </li><li>  Improved display of HDR tones with the least clipping of bright details. </li><li>  A better anti-reflection filter that does not suffer from a purple hue due to light. </li><li>  Warranty service.  This is really a significant plus.  If problems arise, LG specialists come to the client‚Äôs house and quickly eliminate the defects that have arisen.  This is very pleasing to many users, since usually almost all stores require delivery of equipment purchased from them to them in the event of a breakdown. </li><li>  Working with external media is impeccable. </li><li>  Matrix.  She is beyond praise.  Due to the excellent contrast, all the scenes in the films are perceived at a completely different level.  When viewing already familiar films, it seems that you open them for yourself anew. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.flatpanelshd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV 55 LG OLED55B7V" class="if uuid-2864528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2864528.jpg"></div><p>  We cannot but rejoice at the fact that all the characteristics declared by the manufacturer are noted by users.  It is important that buyers are not disappointed with their purchase, but receive the promised. </p><h2>  Customization Features </h2><p> The best option is to pay specialists upon purchase so that they bring the TV and set it up right away.  But many do not.  Some buyers try to figure out all the nuances on their own.  However, faced with the menu, almost everyone decides to invite a specialist. </p><p>  Some try to familiarize themselves with the training video.  Only on it is not the same as on more familiar models.  In the reviews, many note this.  In addition, you will need to deal with dozens of settings, including black level, white balance, dynamic contrast, OLED, super-resolution, noise reduction, TM, edge extension, IRE, etc. </p><p>  Not everyone understands which option is responsible for what, not everyone manages to find some items in the menu.  Therefore, it is better to use the services of professionals if you do not want to spoil your mood after a pleasant purchase.  This is the main operating tip. </p><h2>  Are there any problems </h2><p>  Unfortunately, they happen with all the equipment.  The 51-55 '' LG OLED55B7V OLED TV is no exception.  Reviews left by people after a certain operational period are direct evidence of this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hdtvtest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LG OLED55B7V Review" class="if uuid-2864525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2864525.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, it cannot be argued that all the troubles faced by some users are sure to expect others.  But they do happen, so you need to mention them.  Here are the problems that some owners of LG OLED55B7V (55-inch) OLED TVs have: </p><ul><li>  Wi-Fi signal reception quality is affected.  It constantly disappears after turning off the TV.  You have to re-enter the password.  Many are outraged that the TV, which costs more than 100,000 rubles, has such a terrible adapter.  It is sad that in 2018 not a single update came out that would contribute to the improvement of its work. </li><li>  Too complicated menu.  Not everyone likes this.  It does not work out intuitively - you have to study everything with instructions. </li><li>  The motion smoothing system does not always work as we would like.  Either the camera is smooth, but the edges of the objects blur, or it twitches, but the picture is clear.  Many because of this feature disable this feature. </li><li>  Deep black is not always good either.  For the detail of dark objects disappears.  For example, a person watches a scene in which a hero stands in a dark room in a black suit.  The TV does not draw any pockets, no buttons, no seams, or anything else.  It will be just black. </li><li>  Many complain that the screen glare.  In this case, the light is reflected crookedly.  You have to either adapt, or do a permutation (TV or lighting). </li></ul><p>  From user reviews of the LG OLED55B7V, you can understand that they are most unhappy that the device, which costs more than 100,000 rubles (and many took it when the price was more than 130 thousand), generally has disadvantages.  According to buyers, they should not be at all. </p><p>  Given the fact that the bulk of the comments are positive, this TV continues to be acquired quite actively. </p><p>  Even Harmonic, an official partner on NASA's UHD channel, used it for its presentation.  Its representatives stated that the sensations from viewing are close to those that a person experiences during his real stay in outer space. </p>
