The great Russian commander Alexander Vasilievich Suvorov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Alexander Suvorov is an unsurpassed Russian commander, innovator and one of the founders of the Russian military art.  For half a century of his career, he did not know a single failure on the battlefield.  In addition, Suvorov was a brilliant innovative theorist, author of works on military affairs, in which, ahead of his time, he managed to significantly enrich his traditions.  Let us get to know better the personality and activities of this great man.  The final stage of the career of the celebrated commander was the Italian and Swiss campaigns of Suvorov.  Even today they cause admiration for posterity. </p><h2>  The childhood and youth of the great commander </h2><p>  Alexander Suvorov was born into the family of an army general.  Therefore, he did not choose his future fate.  The year of birth is not known exactly.  His father, Vasily Ivanovich, was famous for his harsh disposition, and he closely monitored the education of his son.  Therefore, upon reaching the required age, he identified the offspring at a military school. </p>

At this time, Alexander Vasilievich Suvorov managed to show himself not only as a brave officer and partisan, but also as a talented leader. </p><p>  Since 1761, he successfully disposed of the cavalry regiment.  For courage, valor and endurance he was awarded a new rank.  So he managed to become a colonel, having made the way to this rank in just over six years. </p>

    <h2>  Career under Catherine II </h2><p>  The formation of a commander‚Äôs career took place during the reign of Catherine II.  For six years, Suvorov led the Suzdal Infantry Regiment.  During these years he developed and wrote his first work - ‚ÄúRegimental Institution‚Äù.  It described in detail the main rules of education and combat training of soldiers. </p><p>  The developed and constantly improving system was used in many subsequent campaigns of the commander, one of which was the Italian campaign of Suvorov in 1799. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1768 he was again promoted and given the rank of foreman.  In 1769-1772, he took an active part in the battles against the Bara Confederation.  During the campaign in Poland, the results of the training of soldiers by the methods of Suvorov were obvious.  His team was able to quickly travel huge distances, while the number of cases was minimal. </p><p>  In the campaign itself, the training and tactics system developed by Suvorov was also applied.  For numerous victories in battles, he received his first awards and was promoted to the rank of major general.  It is known that it was the actions of the commander who played a decisive role, significantly influencing the development of an entire campaign and leading to success. </p><h2>  <span>Russian-Turkish wars</span> and the role of Suvorov </h2><p>  And Suvorov could be enlisted in the great Russian commanders already for his actions during the two wars with the Turks.  At the end of the first of them he controlled a separate detachment.  The most famous operations were the victorious captures of the Turtukai fortress and the famous battle near the city of Kozludzhi. </p><p>  There, with his efforts, the forty-thousandth <span>Turkish army</span> was defeated <span>.</span>  The actions of the commander at Kozludzhi in many respects determined the outcome of the campaign and became the most important factor in the success of the Russian army.  It is interesting that the city has since been called in his honor - Suvorovo. </p>

    <h2>  The most significant victories </h2><p>  However, the genius of Alexander Vasilyevich was fully revealed during the second war with the Turks.  It was on her that the truly brilliant victories of Suvorov fell.  The first two of them - in 1789.  On July 21, the famous battle at Fokshan took place, when Suvorov, together with a seven-thousand-strong detachment, rushed to the aid of the Austrian corps.  Together, they completely defeated the Ottoman army, exceeding their number by more than four times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And on September 11, a battle took place on the Rymnik River, when a Turkish army, consisting of one hundred thousand soldiers, attacked a small Austrian corps.  Then Suvorov rushed to the rescue, after less than three days having traveled a hundred kilometers.  Leading a detachment of seven thousand people, the commander showed miracles of maneuvering, defeating a huge enemy army in parts.  Then the losses of the Ottoman army totaled 18-20 thousand soldiers, half of whom were killed. </p><p>  The battle on the river Rymnik has been inscribed for centuries in the history of Russian military art.  For success in it, Suvorov was awarded the title of Count.  It was after this battle that the glory of the unsurpassed military leader was entrenched in him. </p><h2>  The assault of the Izmail fortress </h2><p>  When they say: ‚ÄúGreat Russian military leaders‚Äù, it is Suvorov who is immediately remembered.  Largely thanks to the capture of Ishmael - the battle that became the brightest star in his career.  This fortress was one of the most powerful, it was considered impregnable, yes, in general, it was like that. </p><p>  The siege of Ishmael was carried out by Potemkin, but after unsuccessful attempts to assault her, he instructed Alexander Suvorov.  The commander has been training soldiers for more than a week, having built a training camp that imitates the moat and ramparts of the fortress.  After this, Ishmael was stormed in less than eleven hours. </p><p>  This battle went down in world history as the bloodiest, unparalleled in losses on both sides.  It largely predetermined the outcome of the entire war and is recognized as the true feat of Alexander Suvorov. </p>

    <h2>  The final stage of a career </h2><p>  The commander‚Äôs career developed quite rapidly.  After the Russian-Turkish wars, Suvorov participated in many battles, confirming his glory as a fearless warrior and a brilliant commander.  However, when Paul I came to power, he was sent into exile.  This was explained by the fact that the commander openly opposed the Prussian traditions and rules of warfare introduced by the new emperor that were alien and unusual to the Russian army.  Despite the highest orders, he continued to educate and train soldiers according to his own rules. </p><p>  Suvorov‚Äôs exile in his estate Konchansky lasted approximately two years, until 1798, when the political and military situation on the continent escalated.  Russia joined the <span>anti-French coalition.</span>  Then the heads of Austria and England insisted that Paul I turn to Suvorov for help.  He was again admitted to military service. </p><p>  So, the Italian and Swiss campaigns of Suvorov became a brilliant conclusion to the career of the celebrated commander.  The first of them today is amazing in its power, speed and maneuverability, so it is worthwhile to dwell on it in more detail. </p><h2>  Italian hike.  Alignment of forces </h2><p>  The Italian <span>campaign of Suvorov</span> (year 1799) is the general name for the military operations of the combined army of Russians and Austrians against the French.  With the commander it was planned to nominate an army of 65 thousand people.  The Austrians were already in their position.  There were about 85 thousand, the same number was expected in martial law. </p><p>  The French, in turn, occupied the entire territory of Italy.  In the north there were 58 thousand soldiers under the command of Moreau, and in the southern part of the country - MacDonald's army. </p>

    <h2>  Campaign progress </h2><p>  Speaking on the famous Italian campaign, Suvorov from the very beginning demonstrated his brilliant skills as a commander and the perfection of military art.  Immediately after arriving at the scene of the fighting, he managed to capture about five thousand French soldiers subordinate to Moreau.  The latter had to retreat beyond the Addu River, clearing the territory of Milan. </p><p>  Thus, the very beginning of the Italian campaign of Suvorov was marked by swift victories.  Having occupied Milan, allied forces were deployed on both sides of the Po River to simultaneously monitor the armies of Moreau and MacDonald and prevent their formation.  Turin was just as quickly captured.  Then came Suvorov's convincing victory over the French under Trebius and Novi. </p><p>  Within a month, the north of Italy was completely cleared of enemy troops.  However, MacDonald's army went to the aid of Moreau.  Suvorov decided to attack them separately.  First of all, he turned his attention to MacDonald and went out to meet him with the army.  A swift march, having passed 85 miles in less than two days, completely defeated the French army, which did not expect such an onslaught.  This brilliant maneuver for centuries went down in the history of martial art. </p>

    <h2>  Brilliant Finish and Swiss Trekking </h2><p>  Leading the Italian campaign, Suvorov showed all his talent as a commander.  The state was released in record time.  The success was achieved mainly due to the fearlessness and valor of the Russian soldiers and the unsurpassed military talent of Suvorov.  Meanwhile, relations between the allies have substantially deteriorated.  The Austrians feared the success of the Russian commanders. </p><p>  Speaking on the Italian campaign, Suvorov was endowed with all the fullness of power.  However, the Austrians restricted it, giving him the right to dispose only on the battlefield.  And after Suvorov‚Äôs army liberated all territories, the Austrians demanded that the Russian troops, instead of going further to France, keep their way to Switzerland. </p><p>  So began the final stage of Suvorov's career.  They became the Italian and Swiss campaigns.  The famous path through the Alpine peaks, the assault on the Devil's Bridge and the most difficult crossings on mountain ranges.  This time, Suvorov defeated not only the enemy troops, but also the very power of nature.  In the battles for these points, the military leader and his soldiers showed genuine miracles of heroism and courage. </p><h2>  Suvorov's contribution to the development of Russian military art </h2><p>  For his Italian campaign, Suvorov received the highest of the ranks - Generalissimo.  His talent is already evidenced by the fact that during his half-century career he has not suffered a single defeat.  Moreover, most of the battles were won with a significant numerical advantage of the enemy.  And Suvorov's Italian campaign, in short, was the apotheosis of his career. </p>

Ahead of his time, he argued for the most progressive battle trends.  One of its main principles was surprise.
