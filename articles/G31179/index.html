  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human anatomy: gall bladder, location, function</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The gall bladder (GI) is considered to be an organ of the digestive system up to fifty to seventy cubic centimeters in size, which accumulates bile (up to sixty milliliters), regulates its pressure in the ducts, releases it during food absorption, thereby carrying out the digestion process. </p><p>  It should be noted that the <span>gallbladder</span> has the following arrangement: to the right of the liver (on its lower surface), between the third and fourth <span>metatarsal bones,</span> and has the shape of a pear, the end of which comes out from under the liver (it comes in contact with it and is connected by a network of <span>blood vessels )</span> in the place where the eighth and ninth ribs join.  Its other end has a direction to the gate of the liver and is covered with visceral peritoneum.  The bubble has a length of up to twelve centimeters and a width of up to five centimeters, consists of muscle cells.  In this case, the vessels and the peritoneum fix its location, preventing mobility.  In some cases, the bladder is wrinkled, shortened or ovoid in shape and can reach large sizes. </p><p>  It is customary to distinguish between the bottom, body, neck of the gallbladder, they create a light arc, the ends of which are turned down to the left side.  When a person takes a vertical position, the bottom of the bubble is located below all other three parts, then the body of the bubble goes, and behind it is the neck.  So, the bottom of the gallbladder is placed in front of the liver (at its edge), in rare cases, it does not reach the edge of the liver or is closed by its parenchyma. </p><p>  The body of the gallbladder is almost completely covered by the peritoneum and is adjacent to the <span>transverse colon.</span>  Medial are the pylorus and duodenum.  If the position is lateral, then the gallbladder will have an arrangement closer to the vertical part of the duodenum, and its bottom touch the right kidney. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The neck of the gallbladder forms an angle, dodging forward, it is adjacent to the left side of the bladder and touches the right branch of the portal vein. </p><p>  It should be noted that when food enters the duodenum, the gall bladder (which side <strong> </strong>  it is located in the body, we know), contracting, secretes bile, which enters the intestines through the ducts.  In this case, the bile ducts are located between the renal ligaments, on the right side of the renal artery, they are directed downward and connect to the pancreatic duct. </p><p>  There are some malformations of the ZhP, these include congenital anomalies, for example, a change in its size, as well as position.  Most often, with malformations of the gallbladder, the location is incorrect or completely absent.  In this case, its dimensions and capacity also change.  Anomalies in the development of the GP can be accompanied by pain in the ribs on the right side or proceed without symptoms. </p><p>  It should be noted that the bladder has three layers: the mucous membrane, muscle layer and fibrous, consisting of connective tissue and peritoneal cover.  The muscle layer is underdeveloped, the <span>mucous membrane is</span> dotted with short villi.  In its walls are arteries, veins, blood vessels and nerves. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that the gallbladder location changes depending on the age and physique of a person.  Usually it is located on the anterior abdominal wall in the place where the right parasteral line and the line connecting the ends of the ribs (tenths) or at the level of 1-11 vertebrae intersect. </p><p>  Thus, it became known where the gallbladder is located.  Once again, we note that it performs an important function, since it is involved in the digestion process.  If, for any reason, the pancreas was removed, bile flows slowly, and its bactericidal properties do not appear, so the microflora is disturbed in the intestine, which causes pain in <span>the abdomen.</span>  In this case, all the functions of the bladder are transferred to the bile ducts. </p>
