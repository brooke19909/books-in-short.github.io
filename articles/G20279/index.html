Regulations on the Cossack ranks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Cossacks have always been fanned by a touch of romance, and many consider the Cossacks to be some kind of knights without fear and reproach of ancient times.  However, few people know that they had a very serious organization and a clear list of ranks, which is not typical of medieval knights.  As they developed, the ranks and ranks were increasingly reduced to analogues in the regular army of Russia.  Cossacks belong to the received ranks and the rights and duties implying them are much more reverent than some representatives of the army. </p><h2>  Cossacks.  Ranks, ranks and shoulder straps </h2><p>  Initially, all Cossack ranks, ranks and epaulets were awarded in an elected manner.  However, over time, as the Cossacks became troops and the development of military affairs itself, they gradually expanded, and as a result, according to the provision on Cossack ranks and production, all such insignia were brought into a more convenient, simple and understandable form.  Thanks to this, the interaction between the units of the Cossacks and the regular army was greatly simplified, and as a result, the combat effectiveness of all the troops as a whole increased.  Naturally, this had a positive effect both on the spirit of the army and on the results of military operations carried out jointly by regular and Cossack forces.  Despite the fact that initially many representatives of the Cossacks opposed such changes, over time they could not help recognizing the positive properties and did not change their point of view.  Or leave her with you, even if you stubbornly refused to acknowledge but did not want to leave the service to the country and the sovereign. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Lower ranks </h2><p>  The lowest rank was considered an ordinary Cossack, on the shoulder straps of which there were no bastards at all.  He corresponded to the rank of ordinary ordinary and had the same responsibilities.  Following him, in increasing order, there was a clerk, on the pursuit of which one little tag flaunted.  He corresponded to the corporal in the ordinary forces and performed the same functions.  Then came the officer, who was divided into the junior officer, the officer and senior officer.  He was an analogue of the sergeant in the standard army and had the same insignia on uniform.  Two for the junior officer, three for the officer and one wide for the senior officer.  The officers not only corresponded to sergeant ranks, but also were responsible for exactly the same areas of service.  It was customary for the officers to be contacted by ‚ÄúMr. Order‚Äù, regardless of whether he was senior or junior.  That is how the lower ranks and shoulder straps of the Cossacks of the Russian Empire at that time looked. </p>

    <h2>  Junior ranks </h2><p>  As mentioned above, as the Cossack army was becoming and, as a result, the need for new ranks appeared, they gradually increased in number.  So, the Cossack ranks, ranks and shoulder straps of the junior command staff were as follows: junior wahmister, wahmister and senior wahmister.  He was an analogue of the modern rank of ensign.  He performed the duties of assistant commander in terms of providing the Cossacks with everything necessary and monitored the internal order.  On the shoulder straps of the junior wahmistra there was one long parallel parallel to the shoulder strap, the wahmister had two small stars located along the shoulder strap, and the senior wahmister had three.  By tradition, the bearers of this rank (or rank, to be more precise) were referred to only as "Mr. Wahmister."  At the same time, it was absolutely not important, the junior or senior, this particular vahmister. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Senior ranks </h2><p>  Cossack ranks and epaulets of senior command staff were more diverse.  They were treated in ascending order: undercountry, corral, centurion and podesaul.  Undercounter and coronet were the Cossack version of the second lieutenant and lieutenant, and the centurion - the senior lieutenant.  They were responsible for the same elements of the combat effectiveness of the Cossack army as their counterparts in the regular army.  Podesaul served as captain and possessed all the same rights and duties as his counterpart in conventional troops.  On the shoulder straps of the underling there was one long, parallel to the epaulette, plaque directly on which one small asterisk was located.  It was customary to appeal to him, "Mr. Undercount."  The cornet had the same long string shared two similar stars, and the centurion had three.  Four stars appeared on the chase of the subaul, two of which were separated by a long little ribbon, and two were directly on it.  To all, except the under-jungler, "your nobleness" addressed.  It was understood that all the nobility belonged to the officers, and the attitude was appropriate.  As, in fact, the demand from them, significantly increasing as you receive more and more new titles. </p>

    <h2>  Top ranks </h2><p>  Cossack ranks, ranks and shoulder straps of higher Cossacks in their positions consisted of Yesaul, who was an analogue of a major, army foreman, who performed the duties of lieutenant colonel and Cossack colonel, who was, in fact, colonel, with all the rights and duties that leave this rank.  On the esaul's shoulder straps, as well as on the underling, there was one long, parallel to the shoulder strap, but there were no stars.  The shoulder strap of the military foreman was immediately decorated with two parallel streamers and three stars, and on the shoulder straps of the Cossack colonel were just two streamers, like a military foreman, and there were no stars at all.  The traditional appeal to all the main ranks is your high nobility.  It was a senior officer who, for the most part, commanded directly large Cossack forces both during combat operations and in peacetime. </p>

    <h2>  High rank </h2><p>  Cossack ranks, ranks and shoulder straps of the highest command staff are represented by only one rank - the Cossack general.  The highest and most honorable post in this army, whose orders were the highest priority and not subject to discussion.  The epaulette was absolutely without bastards, with two stars.  This ends the Cossack ranks and titles, the description of which is given above.  At present, this structure has not undergone any changes and remains the same as many years ago.  The Cossacks now have a slightly different form than in ancient times, but they still respect the old traditions and adhere to the code of honor, adopted a long time ago. </p>
