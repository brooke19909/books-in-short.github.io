When and for whom was it built?  What does it look like today?  Read about it in our article! </p><h2>  Travel Palace (Tver): address and description of the monument </h2><p>  Travel palaces, as you know, were built for the rest of the royal family and other noble people who went on long trips.  There were no charter flights and cars in those days, so those in power needed to spend more than one day to get from one city to another.  Of course, they needed to provide proper comfort while resting and spending the night on the road. </p><p>  In total, 14 such complexes were erected in the Russian Empire.  Only nine of them have survived to our time.  And one of those is the Travel Palace (Tver), a photo of which you can see below.  It is located on the banks of the Volga, within the historical core of the city (on Cathedral Square).  By the way, his first guest was Catherine the Second. </p>

    <p>  The Track Palace (Tver) was built in the 1760s in the classical style, designed by Peter Nikitin.  However, the experienced eye of the architect will see baroque features and elements in this building with two pavilions.  Today the building is <span>an architectural monument</span> and a real decoration of Tver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Getting to the palace is easy.  At the main railway station, take tram No. 5 or No. 11 or minibus No. 52. </p><h2>  The history of the architectural complex </h2><p>  The Imperial Travel Palace in Tver was erected on the spot where the bishop‚Äôs house used to be.  The latter burned down in a fire, and local authorities initially planned to restore it.  But later, when there was a need to build a Travel Palace, they decided that the best place for this could not be found in the city. </p>

    <p>  The builders already knew that the palace was being built for the great Empress Catherine, so they worked wonderfully.  According to the project of the chief architect, the building was a huge central building with two wings extended on each side.  A magnificent hall was arranged in the palace, and in the wing of the eastern side - chambers for the empress.  In the opposite part was a library and a house church.  Stables and sheds appeared a little later. </p><p>  Catherine II stayed in this palace.  However, after that he loses his former importance.  Soon the palace in Tver becomes the residence of Princess Ekaterina Pavlovna and Geogrg of Oldenburg, her husband.  The building served as an inspiration for many poets, political and cultural figures.  So, he was very fond of Zhukovsky, Glinka, the scientist Nikolai Karamzin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the battles of World War II, the architectural complex was significantly damaged.  Immediately after the end of the war, reconstruction of the palace began, which was carried out under the direction of <span>I.E.</span>  <span>Bondarenko.</span> </p><h2>  Restoration of the palace </h2><p>  The Palace of Perm (Perm) has become very dilapidated over the past 60 years.  Therefore, in 2012 funds were allocated for its capital restoration.  To date, all work is almost complete. </p><p>  So, the walls and ceilings in the building are already completely ready.  The interiors of the palace promise to be decorated with 16 emblems of the district towns of the region.  In St. Petersburg, two gorgeous chandeliers are to be made especially for the Tver Palace.  But small lamps are made at the local glass factory.  In general, the internal work in the palace has already been completed.  Soon they should deliver new pieces of furniture and interior. </p>

    <p>  Restorers significantly transformed the front lobby of the palace.  Only four columns remained from the previous decoration, two more were replaced by plaster.  Granite decorative elements for the lobby were also made in the "Northern Palmyra", but the floors were brought from abroad.  When changing the front steps, they found fragments of genuine German tiles.  Subsequently, they were used to recreate the original pattern and coating tones. </p><h2>  Travel Palace (Tver): opening hours and excursions </h2><p>  Today, the palace houses expositions of the Tver Art Gallery.  It can be visited on any day except Monday and Tuesday, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  It should be borne in mind that ticket offices finish their work at five in the evening.  Access to the area around the Travel Palace is open around the clock. </p>
