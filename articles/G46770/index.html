And for the domestic ordinary consumer, this is especially true. </p><p>  According to its characteristics, ‚ÄúSony Xperia E3 Dual‚Äù is just such a gadget.  Not particularly powerful, but nonetheless, something he is capable of.  The device neatly fits at a price in the budget sector, where its cost does not exceed the mark of 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  We present to your attention a review of the inexpensive Sony Xperia E3 Dual phone.  Reviews, specifications and other notable features of the smartphone will be discussed in our article.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The smartphone looks quite modern, and its style can be called bright and youth.  The brand concept of the Omni brand at Sony Xperia E3 Dual (photo below) is clearly visible.  For a generation of smartphones, the company adheres to such a style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia E3 dual specifications" class="if uuid-3148530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3148530.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners and without regard to the other characteristics of the Sony Xperia E3, they consider the appearance of one of the strengths of the device.  Despite the constancy in design from generation to generation, the features of the gadget are not boring and still look fresh. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the case, you can see an invariable lateral shiny frame, stretching around the entire perimeter of the smartphone.  And judging by the description for Sony Xperia E3 Dual, the only external difference between the model and the more noble brethren of the brand is the material of manufacture.  The frame of the gadgets from the mid-price and premium segment is made of plastic, not metal. </p><p>  The situation is similar with the back cover.  Here it is not made of glass, as in older models, but of the same plastic with a matte finish.  The owners in their reviews took this moment very warmly.  Thanks to the matte finish with a barely noticeable pattern, the gadget does not try to slip out of hands. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The case characteristics of the Sony Xperia E3 smartphone can be called classic.  Dimensions (137.1 x 69.4 x 8.5 mm / 143 g) allow you to conveniently place the device in your pocket or in your palm.  For its size, the model is a bit heavy, but for some users, judging by the reviews, this is on the contrary a significant plus. </p><p>  So in general, with the ergonomic characteristics, the Sony Xperia E3 is all right.  The gadget is comfortable to control with one hand, which can not be said about modern shovel-shaped smartphones. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the right side you can see the brand's signature touch - an aluminum power button.  There is also a volume rocker, but already made of plastic.  It is located flush with the body, so finding blind edges without the proper experience is quite problematic.  The micro-USB interface in its usual place - on the left side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sonymobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia E3 Dual Description" class="if uuid-3148531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3148531.jpg"></div><p>  In the upper part of the front panel there is a front camera peephole, a sensor and an event indicator.  The speaker grill is located on the bottom cover at the bottom, so that when the unit lies on a hard and flat surface, the sound is muffled.  At the top, you can see the peephole of the rear camera, and a little at a distance the LED flash. </p><p>  The characteristics of Sony Xperia E3 allow you to work with two SIM cards.  There is also a modification with one card.  All slots, including those for an external drive, are under the cover.  The battery, alas, is a non-removable type, but this solution allowed to increase the volume of the battery. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The smartphone‚Äôs display is protected by high-quality glass, which in its qualities is close to the level of the famous ‚ÄúGorilla‚Äù.  Judging by the feedback from users, it is quite difficult to scratch it, so the gadget is not afraid of the proximity to the keys in your pocket. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia E3 Dual Photo" class="if uuid-3148534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3148534.jpg"></div><p>  IPS-matrix received average performance characteristics.  Sony Xperia E3 has a diagonal of 4.5 inches with a resolution of 854 by 480 pixels.  By modern standards, this is not enough, especially if you look at the proposals of the "Chinese".  Pixelization with such a spread and diagonal does not strike the eye, but with a closer look it is still visible. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, they have no complaints about the viewing angles, the margin of brightness with contrast and the transmission of the picture.  Everything is implemented at a very decent level.  Under direct sunlight, the screen naturally fades, but in the shade and indoors it behaves appropriately.  Also pleased and the automatic brightness adjustment, which can be called at least sensible. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The hardware of the gadget is built on the Snapdragon 400 platform: four cores and a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The 305 series Adreno video accelerator is responsible for processing the graphic part. The amount of RAM is 1 GB, which is not enough by modern standards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.china-prices.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony ixperia e3 dual reviews and specifications" class="if uuid-3148533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3148533.jpg"></div><p>  The internal memory is also small - only 4 GB, where the user can access a little more than 2 GB.  But in any case, it will have to be expanded (up to a maximum of 32 GB) with the help of external drives, because today's media content is very voracious to gigabytes. </p><p>  Feedback on the interface is only positive.  No lags, friezes or delays were noticed.  Tables switch smoothly, and regular and undemanding software starts and works quickly enough. </p><p>  Problems begin when opening serious gaming applications.  Simple programs like ‚Äúthree in a row‚Äù, Angry Birds, etc. work fine.  But here shooters, races, and other applications demanding on the system part start to slow down terribly, if at all.  So this model is perfect for surfing and socializing on social networks, but if you like to play serious games, then it's better to look at other options. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The 0.3 MP front camera is suitable for communication in video messengers and more.  For everything else, it is better to use the main device.  It also uses a more powerful matrix - 5 megapixels with f / 2.4 aperture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.infovisual.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia E3 Smartphone Features" class="if uuid-3148536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3148536.jpg"></div><p>  There is also a proprietary brand technology for automatic recognition of shooting conditions (36 types), as well as a very good HDR mode for advanced photographs.  Judging by user reviews, the camera more or less tolerably shoots in automatic mode, but if you really need high-quality frames, then it‚Äôs better to delve into the manual settings.  In addition, the latter are very extensive. </p><p>  The camera can also shoot video in a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels.  Reviews of the video footage at the output are not the most flattering.  So cameras are far from the strongest part of the smartphone, which is a shame given the brand‚Äôs reputation.  In this case, it is better to pay a couple of thousand rubles and take Iksperia, which is more advanced in this regard. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The device received an average by current standards battery with a capacity of 2330 mAh.  But in view of the modest set of chipsets, as well as the small diagonal of the screen, the autonomy of the gadget is at a very decent level.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, this parameter completely suits them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mega.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia E3" class="if uuid-3148532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3148532.jpg"></div><p>  A significant role in increasing the operating time of the device was played by the company's proprietary technology - Stamina.  When activated, it increases the autonomy of the gadget by almost 30%. </p><p>  If you load the smartphone with gaming applications or watch video in high resolution, then the battery charge will last about six hours.  Surfing, music and other undemanding tasks plant a battery in 12-14 hours.  If you use your smartphone as an e-book, periodically making calls and answering SMS, then the device will last about 20 hours. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Sony got a good device: beautiful, excellent in communication, with good speakers and a smart interface.  But looking at the ubiquitous "Chinese" in this segment, you can find options much more attractive.  The same "Huawei" or "Xiaomi" for the same price can offer much more. </p><p>  In the case of E3 there is a substantial overpayment for the name.  So we can recommend this model only to ardent fans of the brand.  The rest is better to pay attention to more practical in terms of return devices from China. </p>
