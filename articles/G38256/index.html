    <h2>  Hotel Overview </h2><p>  Horus Paradise Luxury Resort &amp; Club 5 * was built about nine years ago, but after the opening it had a different name and only after three years of operation changed it.  Sometimes tourists can see the complex in advertising catalogs called Side Holiday Village, so do not be alarmed - this is the very luxurious hotel that is well known throughout the Turkish coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the hotel complex consists of several buildings.  They were built at different times, which is noticeable in the design and deterioration of the number of rooms.  The main building has seven floors and was commissioned the very first.  It contains one hundred and thirty apartments.  Renovation in this building was carried out three years ago. </p><p>  A year ago, two five-story buildings were built.  There are twelve new cottage-type buildings in the garden and by the sea.  They have two and three floors, all apartments were updated about a year ago.  Almost all hotel guests note that the number of rooms is in excellent condition and is fully consistent with the stated five stars. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHorus Paradise Luxury Resort &amp; Club 5 * is approximately eighty square meters.  The territory reminds the guests of the <span>Garden of Eden,</span> filled with lemon, orange and olive trees.  It is very pleasant to walk on it even in the midday heat, and in the evening, along the alleys, the backlight turns on and the walk turns into a real fairy tale.  However, the entire hotel area causes a lot of positive emotions.  She is well-groomed and is the pride of the hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  Features of accommodation </h2><p>  The hotel has connecting rooms.  They are chosen by large families who cannot accommodate in ordinary apartments. </p><p>  Please note that rooms are strictly non-smoking.  Fans of this bad habit in the hotel complex will have to tight, because for them there are no corresponding apartments and places for smoking. </p><p>  People with disabilities will feel very comfortable at the hotel.  They can provide six rooms with special equipment. </p><p>  Check-in at the hotel complex is carried out at two in the afternoon, eviction - before noon.  Guests often write that they have been issued and given the room keys much earlier than the deadline.  Moreover, this procedure passes quite quickly, which immediately places guests at the reception desk. </p><p>  Drawing conclusions from all of the above, we want to recommend Horus Paradise Luxury Resort &amp; Club 5 * to our compatriots.  They will definitely be delighted with the rest and will want to return here again as soon as they have such an opportunity. </p>
