They belong to the business class segment, as they are decorated in the style of the old city, the author’s architecture is developed. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.townhouse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Ivakino-Pokrovskoye" class="if uuid-3079967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079967.jpg"></div><p>  There are several ways to get to these townhouses quickly.  This can be done both on personal and public transport.  It is most convenient to drive your car along the M11 highway.  There are many similar residential complexes and townhouses around.  This is the “Golden Arch”, “Northern Palmyra”, “Green Grove”, so the neighborhood promises to be pleasant. </p><p>  The journey by public transport will be more complex and ornate.  First you need to get to the Rechnoy Vokzal metro station.  After passing 500 meters, you will find yourself at the bus stop of the same name, where you must wait for route No. 342.  Both a regular bus and a fixed-route taxi are suitable for you.  You reach the stop “Victory Square” - the journey takes about a quarter of an hour.  Here you need to transfer to bus number 41 or number 62.  Get to the stop called "Cottage Village".  This section of the road will take you about 20 minutes.  From here on foot to a residential complex about one kilometer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  Layouts of apartments in the residential complex "Ivakino-Pokrovskoye" the developer company offered the most diverse.  For example, now you can buy a townhouse with an area of ​​200 square meters at a price of 76 thousand rubles for one "square".  The cost of housing in this case will be 15 million 200 thousand rubles. </p><p>  For such money, in addition to the townhouse itself, the buyer receives one hundred square meters of land ownership.  The apartment is located on three floors of a three-story building, built from high quality building materials with reinforced concrete floors.  Outside, decorative finish was made, inside - a gray key (screed is flooded on the floors). </p><p>  The house is intended for living all year.  The classic layout is as follows: on the ground floor there is an entrance hall, a combined bathroom, a garage and a kitchen-living room with access to a private fenced area.  On the second floor there is a bathroom and two bedrooms, and on the third there are two more bedrooms, a bathroom, large panoramic windows in the rooms. </p><h2>  Utility networks and beautification </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Ivakino-Pokrovskoye" class="if uuid-3079965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079965.jpg"></div><p>  The houses are supplied with electricity, central water supply, gas, central sewage.  It is possible to connect to the Internet.  A good access road (to the plot rolled into asphalt), the entire territory of the cottage village is guarded.  Many say that this is the best combination of price and quality. </p><p>  On the site there is a lawn of the correct form, a flat landscape, the territory is surrounded by a wooden fence.  Around the forest, the channel named after Moscow.  Developed infrastructure is present in Khimki. </p><p>  The advantage is the possibility of acquiring a townhouse in a mortgage. </p><h2>  Interest holders </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.townhouse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews from real estate investors about residential complex Ivakino-Pokrovskoye" class="if uuid-3079968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079968.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the investors who invested in this property faced serious problems, since the company that raised the money was not in a hurry to fulfill its obligations during the construction of townhouses. </p><p>  The deceived equity holders in the Ivakino-Pokrovskoye residential complex were actively reported in 2011.  Then the subsidiary of the developer Urban Group, the limited liability company Ivastroy, even went to court to protect its goodwill.  They demanded that the journalists and social activists who defend the rights of interest holders cease to mention the Ivakino-Pokrovskoye residential complex as a problem, stating that the company has no overdue obligations to interest holders. </p><p>  At the same time, the deceived citizens themselves claimed that back in 2003 they paid approximately one hundred thousand dollars to each construction company called "Real Estate Trading House", which undertook to build cottages on this site together with Invecon.  The project was never implemented, and the head of the firm "Real Estate Trading House" was imprisoned due to embezzlement of funds.  After this, the land for the construction of townhouses was acquired by the Ivastroy company. </p><h2>  The court's decision </h2><p>  Representatives of Ivastroy claimed that the plots they acquired were free from any encumbrances, the company itself did not enter into any contractual relations either with the Trading House of Real Estate or with Invekon.  Therefore, they are not going to answer for their obligations. </p><p>  Later, the arbitration court recognized the citizens as deceived equity holders, establishing a connection between all the listed companies. </p><h2>  Tragedy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vedomosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Andrey Puchkov" class="if uuid-3079983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079983.jpg"></div><p>  On this the trouble of the residents, when they had already moved to the town houses, did not end there.  In November 2018, it became known that one of the co-owners of the company "Urban Group" became the defendant in the next criminal case. </p><p>  We are talking about Andrei Puchkov, who is already on the wanted list in connection with financial fraud.  Now, the investigation suspects that he, in collusion with gas producers and builders, participated in providing residents of this cottage village with services that did not meet safety requirements.  This led to the death by negligence of three people, among whom was a 4-year-old child. </p><p>  The tragedy occurred in January 2015 in one of the three-story apartments.  The deaths of residents in the residential complex "Ivakino-Pokrovskoye" occurred as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.  The victims were: her husband (financial director of Project Izbenka Limited Liability Company) Natalia Demchenko named Alexander, as well as their son Anton.  Doctors managed to save the woman herself. </p><p>  A criminal case was instituted on the basis of causing death by negligence.  As a result, the central apparatus of the department began to deal with it.  During the trial, another tragedy occurred.  In December 2016, a neighbor of an injured family died from carbon monoxide poisoning. </p><p>  Investigators found that a number of causes were the cause of death.  In particular, the townhouses themselves were sold unfinished.  In addition, with serious violations during the installation of ventilation and heating systems.  It turned out that according to the initial project, the cottages were supposed to be unheated, as they were intended only for summer living.  However, as a result, they went on sale as fully heated.  At the same time, the installation of gas equipment by the developers was not organized.  As a result, work was performed poorly, for example, part of the pipes was completely unsuitable for this.  Because of this, the temperature of carbon monoxide began to fall regularly, which was not completely removed from the premises, which led to the deaths.  The criminal investigation is ongoing. </p><h2>  Impressions of residents </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Ivakino-Pokrovskoye" class="if uuid-3079969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079969.jpg"></div><p>  Due to so many problems that residents had to face, there were a lot of negative reviews about the Ivakino-Pokrovskoye residential complex. </p><p>  However, many still call it a prestigious cottage village, despite the relatively high prices.  At the same time, there are additional difficulties.  For example, they are associated with constant noise from taking off planes, as the Sheremetyevo Airport is located in close proximity.  Given this condition, prices here really look overpriced. </p><p>  In addition, from the Khimki themselves, steady smells of burning are heard from time to time.  Without a car, buying housing here is completely unprofitable, you can already see how much time, money and effort you have to spend to get there by public transport. </p><p>  At the same time, the townhouses themselves really look very presentable. </p>
