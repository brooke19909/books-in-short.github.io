Today, the <span>capital of Tatarstan</span> has a fairly developed infrastructure with an expanded hotel industry.  Kazan hotels can offer a different level of service and a variety of services.  Prices in them can also vary from quite affordable (budget option) to very high (luxury rooms). </p><h2>  Features of choosing a hotel in the capital of Tatarstan </h2><p>  Kazan hotels, as in most modern cities, offer a fairly wide selection of rooms at various prices.  If this is your first trip to this city, it is recommended that guests make a reservation in advance to avoid unpleasant surprises for visitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan hotels" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1095634.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During the year, large and developed cities often become a place for tourists to visit.  Basically, they host business meetings, forums, conferences and other events.  A sufficiently developed million-plus city is Kazan.  The Chaliapin Hotel is ideal for negotiations and business meetings, as it is located in the very center of the capital.  Such a location will appeal not only to ordinary tourists, but also to those who visit the city solely for business purposes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pricing policy of hotels in Kazan </h2><p>  The price of a room in a <span>4-5-star hotel</span> in the capital of Tatarstan, on average, ranges from 3 to 7 thousand rubles per day.  Naturally, if there is a desire to stay in a deluxe room, this amount will be much higher.  The most expensive 5-star hotels, which are distinguished by excellent rooms and high quality services in Kazan, include the Korston, Giuseppe, and Mirage hotels.  The 4-star Chaliapin Hotel also belongs to the ‚Äúabove average‚Äù price category.  Kazan, taking annually a fairly impressive number of tourists, can offer cheaper options. </p><h2>  Economical accommodation options in Kazan </h2><p>  Hotels that have 2-3 stars may not differ in exquisite interiors, but at the same time their rooms are quite suitable for overnight stays.  The cost of a room, as a rule, is on average from 1300 to 2500 rubles per day. </p><p>  The most economical option in Kazan are mini-hotels that are not classified by the presence of stars.  They can offer rooms with a minimum of furniture, simple furnishings with no frills, which are mainly intended only for the night.  Their cost is about 500 rubles. </p><p>  For those who are not experiencing any special financial problems, or are leaving for Kazan on a business trip (which includes meetings and negotiations on the hotel territory), many resources recommend choosing ‚ÄúChaliapin Palace Hotel‚Äù as a stop.  This place was recognized as one of the best hotels in the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kazan: Chaliapin Hotel </h2><p>  This 4-star hotel is located on Universitetskaya Street, in the very center of the city, not far from the Ring Shopping Center.

    <p>  For various business meetings and negotiations, the hotel has 4 conference rooms that can accommodate up to 130 people.  For free use, they provide: </p><ul><li>  stationery; </li><li>  sound equipment; </li><li>  projectors and video screens; </li><li>  flipcharts. </li></ul><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, for those who visited Kazan, the Chaliapin Hotel makes a good impression.  Most reviews of your stay at this hotel are positive.  The courtesy of the staff and the ability to solve any problems encountered within a few minutes (if, for example, a second blanket is required) are noted.  Clients of this establishment speak of perfect cleanliness both in the rooms for living and in all other rooms in the hotel.  Also, many note a very high quality daily cleaning. </p><h2>  Hotel Disadvantages </h2><p>  Hotel "Chaliapin", whose reviews about the interior are positive, successfully combines the attributes of national decor and modern technology.  But on some information resources you can see information that the last major overhaul of the hotel was carried out in 2009.  Although all the rooms and rooms of the hotel are in almost perfect condition, some customers believe that the interior can already be updated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel chaliapin reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1095566.jpg" width="337"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is almost always fully loaded with residents, but despite this, many say that there is complete silence in the living rooms and the sounds from the neighboring rooms of the residents do not bother.  The situation is slightly different with the rooms whose windows face Bauman Street (the central pedestrian street of Kazan).  These rooms can be quite noisy, and at night.  Those traveling to a hotel with young children are advised to choose rooms with windows facing the hotel courtyard. </p><p>  Parents traveling to Kazan with their kids should pay attention to another factor.  If the trip is planned for the winter, then, according to numerous reviews, it is quite possible to encounter cold in the room, especially for the attic rooms on the upper floors.  Customers who managed to visit the hotel in the winter of 2016 say that they did not see the promised heaters, they were offered only additional blankets. </p><p>  Another disadvantage of the hotel service is the inspection of things.  As part of the fight against terrorism, hotel guards may ask you to open a suitcase and check its contents.  If a person is not ready for such a demonstration of the contents, in order to avoid unpleasant situations, he should initially choose another hotel in Kazan. </p><h2>  Advantages of the Chaliapin Hotel </h2><p>  Throughout the hotel there is the possibility of using wireless Internet for free.  Also free for regular customers is a visit to the pool and gym.  On the territory there is quite beautiful, judging by the reviews of the residents, a winter garden, where it is possible to conduct free photo sessions.  For pet owners, a pleasant fact may be the opportunity to check into a hotel with their pet.  Pets are not allowed in the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel chaliapin palace hotel" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1095561.jpg" width="538"></div>
