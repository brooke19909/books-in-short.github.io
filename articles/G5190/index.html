    <p>  It is worth noting that all rooms of the Occidental Punta Cana hotel are located in small three-story buildings with equipped terraces and balconies that are decorated with flower pots.  As in most hotels, there are no elevators in such buildings, so if you find it difficult to go up to the second or third floor, ask the reception to settle you on the first floor.  All buildings are scattered throughout the Occidental Punta Cana.  Some of them are located near the amphitheater and pool, so they hear noise and music.  Others, on the contrary, are far from noise sources and are very quiet places for a relaxing holiday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2011, part of the room stock was repaired and equipped with modern technology.  All apartments have approximately the same equipment.  Higher-level rooms give the right to use some additional services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Occidental Hotel Punta Cana" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1988498.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All apartments feature terracotta tiled floors and wooden window shutters.  The room is divided by a translucent curtain, which allows you to divide the room into a relaxation area and bedroom. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  Occidental Punta Cana works on an all-inclusive basis.  The cuisine of the hotel is very diverse.  The local chef offers a wide range of delicious dishes.  In addition, guests of the complex can appreciate the advantages of local food in nine a la carte restaurants: </p><ol><li>  Lee Buffet treats guests with fresh seafood and meat dishes.  The restaurant works like a buffet. </li><li>  The institution "Forest Resses" specializes in cooking delicious steaks and all kinds of grilled food. </li><li>  La Hesinda is a Mexican restaurant with colorful national dishes. </li><li>  The Italian institution "Via Viento" offers the best dishes of national cuisine. </li><li>  But lovers of Asian dishes should visit the Dorienthal.

The hotel has concentrated everything that tourists might need.  The hotel complex is equipped with three pools.  The largest of them forms a kind of lagoon.  Through the pool passes the bridge on which the restaurant is located.  The pool has a large size and decent depth, some of its parts are more shallow and suitable for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Occidental Grand Punta Cana" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1987513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is a pool for adults only, it is more calm and quiet than the main lagoon.  The hotel has a conference room that can accommodate 250 people. </p><h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  Occidental Grand (Punta Cana), like any self-respecting resort hotel, has its own spa center, which is part of the Caribbean Princess chain of establishments.  The modern spa offers a soak in the jacuzzi, a hammam, sauna, shower, and hair care treatments.  The qualified staff of the center offers hydrotherapy, a wide variety of massages, body and face treatments, body wraps and masks with natural extracts. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  Occidental Grand Hotel (Dominican Republic, Punta Cana) offers guests not only relaxation, but also active sporting events.  Sports enthusiasts can head to the gym.  In the daytime, animators offer to attend water aerobics, dance classes, as well as play volleyball and tennis, shoot archery and shotguns, as well as engage in water sports on the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Occidental Punta Cana 5" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1987516.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the evenings, a fun entertainment show awaits guests at the resort. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Hotel Occidental Punta Cana 5 *, caring for the youngest guests, offers children to use the playground with swings, a special pool for kids or go to a kids club.  If necessary, parents can ask for a baby bed. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Occidental Grand Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) is located on the coast and has its own spacious sandy beach, which is well equipped for relaxation.  On the shore there is a zone for playing volleyball and aerobics.  The hotel also has a water sports center. </p><p>  The beach of the hotel is wide enough.  Its white sand is washed by sea waves, alluring to its depths.  Smooth entry into the water is ideal for children. </p><h2>  Reviews for Occidental Grand Punta Cana </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who recently rested in it.  A large number of positive reviews gives reason to recommend the Hotel Occidental Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) for a holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Occidental Grand Punta Cana" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1987515.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel complex has a small but well-groomed and beautiful area.  The staff of the institution speaks Spanish and English, understands a little Russian, so you can always explain.  Many Russian tourists talk about being lodged in building 10, whose rooms have long been in need of repair.  At the reception, the staff offers the possibility of relocation to other apartments, but subject to a surcharge of $ 100, then the cost of the service is reduced to the level of $ 30-50.  However, tourists recommend first inspecting the room, and then making a decision - whether it is worth changing or not, because this is not always necessary. </p><p>  Vacationers note that the hotel consists of already renovated apartments and those that have not yet been updated.  Of course, the updated rooms delight with fresh repairs and beautiful interiors, as well as good plumbing and new linen.  Rooms are cleaned daily; there are no complaints about its quality, especially if you leave a bonus in the form of one or two dollars. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  What about food at the Occidental Punta Cana?  Reviews from tourists give reason to say that there are no problems with food.  The complex has a main restaurant and many √† la carte establishments, as well as bars.  The concept of "all inclusive" makes it possible not to think about nutrition.  Basically, the restaurant always has a lot of meat and fish dishes, fresh eggs and pancakes are prepared in the mornings, on the tables there is always a decent selection of fruits and vegetables, as well as sweets. </p><p>  The staff is very fast.  If a dish ends, the waiters quickly replenish its supplies.  The staff is very friendly and serves visitors well.  All soft drinks included the concept of nutrition.  But alcohol is not all free. </p><p>  In general, the food in the hotel is of high quality and organized at the proper level, which is very important for the resort. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  For those tourists who like to relax in the Dominican Republic, the Occidental Grand Punta Cana 5 * hotel can be a great place for a vacation, numerous positive reviews are a direct confirmation of this. </p><p>  The complex has swimming pools with numerous small lagoons for children.  If you prefer sea water, then the beach is around the corner.  There are bars throughout the territory where you can take soft drinks and alcohol.  Almost all bartenders make cocktails based on rum, which is logical for the region.  In the evenings, guests are entertained in the lobby with live music.  Here at the bar you can order free and paid cocktails. </p><p>  In the daytime, tourists are actively entertained by local animators.  Competitions, songs and dances - all this is provided to you.  Activities also work on the beach.  Therefore, if desired, idle reclining on deckchairs can be diluted with sports games.  There is a water sports facility on the coast.  In it, once a day, you can take a catamaran or a boat for free for riding.  In addition, on the beach, animators invite you to play volleyball, table tennis and soccer.  In general, you do not have to be bored on the shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Occidental Grand Punta Cana reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1987517.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beach is equipped with free sunbeds.  There were umbrellas before, but now there are none, but the shade from the palm trees is enough for a comfortable stay.  Evening entertainment is always accompanied by Latin music, the usual repertoire of songs for our tourists is not here. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel is unreasonably expensive Internet services.  If your price does not include Wi-Fi, then you will have to pay for it separately.  The rate offered at the reception is $ 35 per week.  Local SIM cards cost twelve dollars, which is also not a particularly suitable option. </p><h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  In the lobby of the hotel there is always a representative of the tour operator who offers sightseeing trips.  The cost of each starts from one hundred dollars per person and above.  According to tourists, prices are unreasonably high.  Exactly the same trips offer street barkers, the cost of their services is much lower.  Hotel guides always scare tourists, which dangerously goes beyond the hotel.  In fact, the complex is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPunta Cana, so walking to the nearest shops or other facilities is quite safe.  Of course, you should not show the phone or money, extra caution will not hurt. </p><p>  The hotel territory itself is reliably guarded; strangers are not allowed in.  And throughout the complex there are surveillance cameras.  This adds a sense of security. </p>
