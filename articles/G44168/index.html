    <p>  An amazing land where you can see cozy villages, high <span>mountains, temples,</span> beautiful beaches that are reflected in the clear waters of the Ionian and Aegean Seas.  These places are filled with legends, myths.  It was in these parts that famous heroes, philosophers, and talented writers lived.  Greece gives inspiration to many, it pacifies and fascinates.  It is no coincidence that Hellas is considered the cradle of world culture, because it was here that its foundation was laid, philosophy and democracy, art and science were born.  All this left an indelible mark on the further development of history and humanity.  Everyone knows that the first Olympic Games were held in Greece.  Hellas is the birthplace of theater: tragedy, comedy and drama. </p><h2>  Greece.  Difference in time </h2><p>  Everyone who is preparing to visit sunny Hellas should ask in advance about the time zone in which the country is located.  Such information will avoid possible misunderstandings associated with the transfer of hours, even such commonplace as being late for dinner at the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 1916, Eastern European time (EET) has been officially used in Greece with the transfer of hands to winter and summer.  The time difference with Greece is World UTC - plus two hours in winter and plus three hours in summer.  At winter time, Greece changes the clock at the end of October (last Sunday). </p>

    <p>  After the cancellation of the seasonal change of hours in Russia, the time difference with Greece increased.  Previously, it was one hour with Moscow, now in the winter with Greece we are two hours apart.  Of course, this is not very convenient for those who travel to this country from Moscow.  But Kiev has zero difference with Greece - they live at the same time all year round. </p><p>  Greece itself is not divided into time zones; the whole time is the same, whether it be Athens, Thessaloniki, Crete, Rhodes or Corfu.  Fraternal Cyprus is in the same time zone. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2>
