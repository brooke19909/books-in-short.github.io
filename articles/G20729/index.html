Shopping here is not as brisk as in the UAE, Turkey or Egypt.  There are no such incendiary parties to the sounds of samba, as in the resorts of the Dominican Republic or Cuba.  There is no "lady-boy show", as in Thailand.  But the Maldives conquers the heart of tourists to others, namely the Relax Atmosphere.  These two words really need to be written with capital letters, since they are the main slogan of the tourism industry of the island nation. </p><p>  Tell the knowledgeable traveler the word “Maldives”, and he will immediately remember the quiet bungalows on stilts in the middle of a turquoise lagoon, about the endless bliss in your own pool, about dinners in the light of torches on the beach, about aromatic massages, about sunsets or insanely beautiful sunsets, which you see from the bungalow terrace.  It is this atmosphere of relaxation that is painstakingly created in Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives A Premium All-Inclusive Resort 5 *.  Let us take a closer look at the amenities, rooms and services at this hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives - pools" class="if uuid-3213430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3213430.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Maldives </h2><p>  Inaccessibility is the only minus of the island state.  The Maldives is a collection of archipelagos, and those, in turn, consist of islets or sparsely populated atolls.  All international flights are accepted by the airport.  I. Nasira, located near the capital, the city of Male, on the island of Hulul.  There, tourists do not stay long.  Some are on small airplanes of local airlines, some are on speed bots, and some are on ferries - guests are sent to rest on their islets.  Sometimes one hotel can occupy the entire atoll. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Russian tourists can get to the Maldives from Moscow by direct flight.  How much to fly to this tropical paradise?  If you get a direct regular Aeroflot flight (it leaves from Sheremetyevo on Wednesdays and Saturdays), then the trip will take about nine hours.  The transfer route will be cheaper, but depressingly long: with Emirates (via Dubai) - 13 hours, with Turkish and Qatari Airlines (via Istanbul or Doha) - 14 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="atmosphere-kanifushi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives - how to get there" class="if uuid-3213433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3213433.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives is located on the Laviyani Atoll.  The length of this patch of land is two kilometers, and the width does not exceed 100 meters. The hotel occupies the entire atoll.  Rather, the villas are concentrated in one part of it, where the sea is the most calm.  If you want to look at the "paradise beach" without human intervention, then this is also possible.  How to get from the international airport in the capital of Male to the atoll of Laviyani? </p><p>  The hotel is not in vain bears the full name “Premium All-inclusive Resort”.  When you go through all the necessary procedures with border guards and customs officers, you will be met in the domestic flights area and taken on board a small but comfortable seaplane.  There is no airfield on the atoll; planes land on the water and swim to the pier.  The entire flight lasts 35 minutes.  Meets and escorts guests to the entire hotel management team.  The tourists are very impressive.  No need to wait for an hour of check-in - the keys to your villa will be issued to you immediately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="5.365072" data-lng="73.334744" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/2/9/6/17296.png"></div><h2>  When is it best to go to the paradise islands </h2><p>  The Maldives archipelagos are located in the Pacific Ocean, almost at the equator.  In this regard, seasonal fluctuations here are very weakly expressed.  But they are still there.  And before you get to the Maldives, you need to find out when it is better to visit this country. From May to October, the southwest monsoons blow, which bring rain.  But precipitation falls mainly at night and they do not cool the air with water.  From November to February, monsoons from the north-east, called the “Iruvai,” bring dry and clear weather.  Then comes the high tourist season. </p><p>  And what are the Maldives in March?  This month is transitional, which means that the weather depends on what decade of the month is on the calendar.  For example, in early March, the sea can be stormy, stormy.  Closer to April, the winds also increase and there is a chance of rain.  But in the middle of March the “Fusbadurava” period begins - calm, clear weather, just like in the winter months of the high tourist season.  But, again, rainfall will not ruin your vacation.  The air temperature in the Maldives is always around +30 degrees, and the sea is constantly very warm (+28 ° C). </p><h2>  Description of the hotel territory </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives occupies almost the entire atoll, leaving only a small space for wildlife.  The villas are lined up in a narrow chain right on the beach.  There are more than a hundred of them.  Which one to book?  To ensure that the atmosphere of relaxation is not disturbed by the buzz of the hydroplane, tourists recommend settling away from the reception and the pier located opposite it.  These are villas at around 200. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Such accommodation is also beneficial because the sea and the beach are cleaner.  How to solve the problem that you have to get to the main restaurant in one and a half kilometers?  Very simple!  From morning to evening, electric buggies scurry around the atoll.  Stop any car and it will take you to your destination in a matter of minutes.  All villas are new.  After all, the hotel was opened in 2013.  But this is the minus of the hotel.  The green spaces on the atoll, especially the trees, are still very low.  The hotel has two public pools, several bars with restaurants, a kids club, a water sports center and a spa complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="atmosphere-kanifushi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives - Territory" class="if uuid-3213438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3213438.jpg"></div><h2>  Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives: room description </h2><p>  Hotel guests settle exclusively in villas.  The distance between them is at least 4 meters, which allows guests to enjoy peace and not depend on neighbors.  All villas are lined up along the sea on the west coast of the atoll.  Therefore, they are called Sunset.  You can admire the sunset both from the terrace of the villa and from your own beach.  Cottages are divided into four categories: “Beach”, “Family”, “Junior Suite” and “Pool”.  It should be said that the villas differ not only in amenities.  Residents of the highest categories of cottages have some advantages, which we will talk about later. </p><p>  Villa Sunset Beach consists of a bedroom, a living area with a sofa.  The bathroom is outside and is located in the open air.  The room is adjacent to the veranda with sunbeds.  The total area of ​​Villa Beach is 100 square meters.  It is designed for two, maximum three people. </p><p>  Villa "Family" (200 m <sup>2</sup> ) is a house with two rooms of the type "Beach" with separate entrances, but an adjacent door.  Such a cottage can be a great vacation spot for both family and large company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kayak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives 5 * - description of rooms" class="if uuid-3213442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3213442.jpg"></div><h2>  Villas and services for VIP guests </h2><p>  The cost of a trip to the Maldives to call a democratic language does not turn.  To rent a bungalow in a 4-star hotel, you will have to say goodbye to at least 107 thousand rubles.  But if you want your vacation in the Maldives to be remembered for a long time, it is better to pay out 132 thousand for a VIP villa at the Atmosphere of Canifushi hotel.  What is she like? </p><p>  “Junior Suite” (132 m <sup>2</sup> ) is made exclusively of natural materials, wood, stone.  The room consists of a bedroom, a living room, an open-air bathroom, a spacious veranda.  Filling out documents upon check-in is already at the villa.  New arrivals are welcomed with a bottle of champagne with canapes.  The minibar for this category of guests bursts with exquisite alcoholic drinks.  Daily maids bring a bottle of red and white wine, as well as a basket of fruit.  Such clients eat at the à la carte restaurant on the Platinum Menu. </p><p>  Exactly the same VIP services are received by the residents of Pool Villa Sunset.  The first word means pool, and it is present on the veranda.  These chic villas stand a little apart in the northern part of the atoll.  The area of ​​the house is 200 square meters, and the swimming pool is 30 m2.  The villa has a bedroom, living room, dressing room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aqua-travelgroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The cost of trips to the Maldives" class="if uuid-3213443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3213443.jpg"></div><h2>  What's inside the room? </h2><p>  Guests at Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives can enjoy a cloudless, chic holiday, even if they occupy the lowest category villa.  Let's look at the decoration of such a number in full detail.  Air conditioning, a hairdryer and a TV now will not surprise anyone.  These are mandatory attributes of a room even in a 4 star hotel.  In the rooms of the "five" should be bathrobes and slippers, luxury cosmetics.  But how do you like having a jacuzzi?  A hot tub is available in all villas without exception.  Hotel guests can use not only the coffee maker and electric kettle.  Each room has a bar with alcoholic drinks - completely free. </p><h2>  How to feed </h2><p>  Atmosphere Kanifushi hotel practices the Platinum Plus system.  It differs from the simple All Inclusive in a wider range of services.  Main meals are served at the Spice Restaurant.  According to tourists' reviews, there is a children's table, a corner where dishes are made in front of the client (mainly grilling and cooking pancakes, scrambled eggs, waffles and fritters). </p><p>  There are two more à la carte restaurants: Teppanyaki, specializing in southeastern cuisine, and Just Veg, a fully vegetarian restaurant.  Residents of the villas "Beach" and "Family" can visit them once for the entire stay in the hotel.  VIP guests can sit there at least every day.  Two bars - Liquid and Sunset - offer guests a variety of snacks and drinks for free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.paguromaldives.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to have dinner in the Maldives" class="if uuid-3213447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3213447.jpg"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Service at Atmosphere Kanifushi Maldives is beyond praise.
