  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Historical city. The most prominent areas of the Yaroslavl region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Yaroslavl region is one of the most historical subjects in the Russian Federation.  Its number includes 17 municipal and 3 urban settlements.  This article will focus on the most interesting areas of the Yaroslavl region. </p><h2>  Borisoglebsky district </h2><p>  Absolutely all areas of the Yaroslavl region have incredible appeal.  The Borisoglebsky municipal district was no exception.  Pine trees surround it from all sides: in the vicinity there are not only magnificent landscapes, but also ecologically clean air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.photosight.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="borisoglebsky monastery" class="if uuid-2448325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44874/2448325.jpg"></div><p>  The historical attractions of the area are ancient monasteries.  Borisoglebskaya fortress was founded back in 1363 by Sergius of Radonezh.  Despite such a respectable age, the building managed to maintain its original appearance.  Now there is a man‚Äôs monastery in its walls, and in Soviet times, a post office, a museum, a store, a state bank, an archive, etc. replaced each other. </p><h2>  Gavrilov-Yamsky district </h2><p>  Each region of vast Russia has its own characteristics.  The greenest in the Yaroslavl region is Gavrilov-Yamsky district.  47% of the total area is occupied by dense forests and conifers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gavlilov-Yamsky district" class="if uuid-2448355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44874/2448355.jpg"></div><p>  Quite interesting is the history of the toponym.  Historians put forward two versions of its origin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to one, the settlement was named for the simple reason that there was an old Russian pit - a post station with an inn, stables, on which a coachman named Gavrila kept accelerating horses.  From here the name "Gavrilov-Yam" appeared. </p><p>  Translated from the Tatar "yam" means "beautiful."  But the places here are really amazing beauty! </p><p>  The main attraction of Gavrilov-Yam is the largest flax processing company in Russia.  Here you can buy high-quality linen products. </p><h2>  Nekrasovsky District </h2><p>  More than 10 thousand people live in the Nekrasovsky district of the Yaroslavl region.  A small village in the middle of the XVII century was the largest center of salt production in Russia.  As many as 20 enterprises worked on the creation of salt with an amazing taste, which was even delivered to the royal table.  To date, almost all manufacturing enterprises have been liquidated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="temples.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nekrasovsky district" class="if uuid-2450856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44874/2450856.jpg"></div><p>  Several historical and architectural structures are concentrated on the territory of the district: the Nikolo-Babaevsky Monastery, the churches of the Nativity of the Virgin, the Temple in the name of the Entry into the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p><h2>  Danilovsky district </h2><p>  There is another district in the Yaroslavl region - Danilovsky (formerly Danilovskaya Sloboda), which is famous for its attractions. </p><p>  It was this place that attracted the attention of the fourth son of Prince Alexander Yaroslavich Nevsky.  In this picturesque place he built stables and princely chambers.  Earlier, pottery was actively developed here.  For many craftsmen, this type of activity was the main source of income. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picsserver.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Danilovsky district" class="if uuid-2450860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44874/2450860.jpg"></div><p>  The historic sites of this place include the <span>prison castle, the</span> house of culture, St. Nicholas Church and the Ascension Church. </p><p>  Each district of the Yaroslavl region is of historical value.  Believe me, it is worth visiting here in order to study each of them. </p>
