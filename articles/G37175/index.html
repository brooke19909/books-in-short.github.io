    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A rare hotel without criticism.  The Emerald Cove Koh Chang complex was no exception.  Reviews that describe serious flaws are quite rare.  However, minor service flaws still exist.  We list the main disadvantages that distinguish hotel guests: </p><ul><li>  in the rooms, which are located in the same building as the restaurant, it smells very damp and musty; </li><li>  uncomfortable old pillows, inside of which clumps of filler have already formed; </li><li>  superficial cleaning of rooms - maids do not wipe dust under beds, bedside tables in other hard-to-reach spots; </li><li>  the hotel has a large number of Chinese people who sometimes make a lot of noise; </li><li>  poor massage at the spa. </li></ul><p>  Amari Emerald Cove Koh Chang is a popular tourist destination.  It can be recommended to those tourists who prefer a calm and respectable vacation. </p>
