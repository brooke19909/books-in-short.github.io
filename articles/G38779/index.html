Perhaps you rarely meet a person who would never have heard of this amazing and unique city, and those who visited it one day, of course, dream of returning.  What attracts many tourists here?  Without any doubt, a mild climate and amazing nature can be identified among the main factors. </p><p>  As a rule, Batumi attracts those who want to not only relax from the hustle and bustle, but also enjoy the wonderful sea, beautiful sunny days and fresh air saturated with aromas of citrus, magnolia and oleander. </p><p>  <strong>Section 1. Batumi.</strong>  <strong>Georgia.</strong>  <strong>How to get there</strong> </p>

In principle, it is quite possible to fly to Batumi with a transfer in Tbilisi.  But it is recommended to do this only if using a direct flight for some reason is not possible.  By the way, a taxi ride to the city center from the airport takes 15 minutes.  The regular bus will be a little longer.

    <p>  Traveling by rail attracts with the relatively low cost of tickets.  It should be noted that a train trip to the most beautiful places will certainly give tourists a lot of pleasant experiences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Buses and minibuses, which are always at the service of vacationers, will allow you to quickly get to the center of Batumi from other Georgian settlements.  And in the city you can travel by taxi or rent a bicycle. </p><p>  By the way, pay attention to the fact that in Batumi <span>(Georgia) hotels of</span> both high and middle class (for example, Piazza Boutique <span>Hotel, Hotel</span> Iberia, Guest House Nino) offer the service of meeting their guests at the airport or at the railway station.  A car will be sent specially for you, the receptionist will pick up your suitcases and deliver you to the hotel in a matter of minutes.  Such a service is not very expensive, therefore, probably, they are turning to the administration for it more and more recently. </p><p>  <strong>Section 2.</strong> <strong>Rest in Georgia.</strong>  <strong>Batumi</strong>  <strong>Prices are pleasing!</strong> </p>

    <p>  This land is actually a real paradise for gourmets and food lovers.  Why?  Yes, because, according to a fairly widespread opinion, delicacies can be found here, as they say, for every taste and budget. </p><p>  What do not treat dear guests!  At any time of the year, a varied fish cuisine and fresh vegetables, fruits and greens are certainly present on the table.  You should definitely try savory snacks and original sauces. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All this is presented in abundance in the <span>restaurants of Batumi.</span>  And the remarkably cooked kutaba, kebabs, lobio, satsivi and Ajarian khachapuri will always remain in the memory of tourists. </p><p>  The cost of a full three-course lunch will cost the traveler 8-12 euros. </p><p>  What to bring with you from Batumi (Georgia)?  This question sooner or later arises from every traveler. </p><p>  In small shops on the Batumi embankment, a large number of various souvenirs are offered to the attention of tourists.  In the city center there are <span>specialized shops</span> where travelers will always be welcome.  Home-made wine is very popular among guests of the region.  The cost of one liter bottle is an average of 3-5 euros.  Of course, it all depends on the manufacturer. </p><p>  From a trip to this fertile land, mistresses always bring aromatic herbs and seasonings that can be used at home to prepare meals, recalling beautiful days spent in a wonderful place.  There is no fixed price for spices.  But experienced travelers know that in fact, high-quality and cheaper goods are sold in local markets, away from the city center. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3.</strong> <strong>Batumi <span>(Georgia).</span></strong>  <strong><span>What to visit</span> first?</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Georgia.

    <p>  There is a lot of interesting here for those who are interested in sights.  For example, the Botanical Garden, as a rule, causes great curiosity.  Here you can not only see many wonderful plants, but also relax after spending some amazing hours.  Experts note that the collection of flora representatives in <span>the Batumi Botanical Garden</span> has no analogues in the world. </p><p>  A visit to the dolphinarium will undoubtedly give a joyful experience.  You can even swim with dolphins!  I really like to watch these creatures for children. </p><p>  But in the Seaside Park with a palm grove you can not only take a walk.  Bars, music, attractions - all this attracts cheerful tourists and allows you to get a vivid unforgettable experience. </p><p>  Those who are interested in historical monuments will be very interested in visiting the fortresses of Tamaristsikhe and Gonia, singing fountains and the ancient part of Batumi, which was built in the 19th century.  Local temples are wonderful architectural monuments of great interest to connoisseurs of beauty. </p>
