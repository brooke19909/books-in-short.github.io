Becoming a customs officer at an airport or at border crossing points is not easy.  This requires special knowledge, qualifications, as well as good orientation in the field of customs legislation and documentary circulation.  Remuneration for <span>customs officers</span> can be impressive.  Today we will find out how much customs officers receive in Russia, and also compare with earnings abroad. </p><h2>  Job Responsibilities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thebarentsobserver.com" data-author=": Thomas Nilsen, "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do customs officers earn" class="if uuid-2928338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2928338.jpg"></div><p>  In ancient times, people calmly moved from one country to another, carrying goods with them.  As society developed, states began to form.  Their rulers began to control the movement of goods across the borders of their country.  In order to benefit, duties were imposed on the transported goods.  Thus, the treasury of the corresponding state was replenished by a significant amount.  So the profession of a customs officer arose. </p><p>  In the modern world, this position is occupied by an employee whose duties include controlling the movement of people and goods across the border.
