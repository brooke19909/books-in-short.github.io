For this reason, a huge number of modern fashionistas want to get her.  But the problem is that finding the right model in stores is not always possible.  And then some young ladies literally take matters into their own hands.  Especially for them, we have prepared an article with detailed and step-by-step instructions for the implementation of a fashionable product. </p><h2>  We study the features of the model </h2><p>  Professional knitters often talk about how important it is when knitting any wardrobe item to maintain style, pattern, color and other little things in harmony.  They do not recommend loading the conceived jacket too much.  She will attract the attention of those around her anyway, because she is distinguished by her original wide sleeves, reminiscent of bat wings.  It is important to note the feature of knitting.  After all, the jacket "Bat" does not fit like most other similar products.  While various pullovers, jumpers, cardigans and other models are made from the lower edge to the shoulder seams, the studied wardrobe item fits from the cuff of one sleeve to the cuff of the other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a sweatshirt bat" class="if uuid-2973664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2973664.jpg"></div><h2>  We select the perfect yarn </h2><p>  Earlier we talked about the importance of harmony.  But I want to add that experienced craftsmen advise performing stylish sweaters with plain yarn.  Therefore, we leave various motley, gradient, "shaggy" and other original knitting threads for a different model, preferring the cold gamut.  The latter condition is not mandatory, and each knitter has the right to knit a thing of a saturated or even vigorous shade.  However, fashion experts are convinced that the models in the style of "Bat" look soberly soaked.  For sweaters, it is better to choose yarn in beige, gray, black or dark blue.  In this case, you can use a knitting thread of any kind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Making work easier by choosing a good tool </h2><p>  Many beginning masters, having come to the needlework store, get lost and literally take the first thing that catches their eye or manages to foist a seller.  However, professionals are convinced that the success of the upcoming process directly depends on the tool.  For this reason, you should treat the choice of knitting needles with special care.  It is recommended to choose those that are made of metal.  The thread glides along them, and the knitter does not tighten the loops, knits much faster and better.  The yarn tag will help determine the size.  If it is absent, select a tool equal to the thickness of the thread.  It is also important to note that for knitting sweaters "Bat" knitting needles are more suitable circular.  They are presented in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweatshirt bat" class="if uuid-2973346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2973346.jpg"></div><h2>  We measure a beautiful lady </h2><p>  It will be much simpler to knit any conceived product if you calculate the parameters needed for knitting.  This requires taking measurements from the person for whom the fashion jacket will be made.  Although some beginners prefer to use standard measures, experienced craftsmen are convinced that such a solution is not always the right one, because each person is individual.  This also applies to the structure of the body.  In addition, taking measurements yourself is not difficult at all.  You just need to prepare a centimeter tape, a piece of paper and a pencil.  And then measure the following parameters: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the desired length of the jacket "Bat"; </li><li>  the distance from the lower edge to the armpit - the level of the armhole; </li><li>  chest girth through the most convex points; </li><li>  neck width (measure the base of the neck through the seventh vertebra); </li><li>  estimated sleeve length (from shoulder); </li><li>  girth of a palm clenched into a fist. </li></ul><h2>  Counting loops and rows </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit a bat jacket" class="if uuid-2973670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2973670.jpg"></div><p>  Having marked the necessary parameters on a piece of paper, put it aside.  We take the selected yarn and knitting needles, after which we knit a fragment of the intended product - a sample of the pattern.  It should be small in size - 10 x 10 centimeters.  We tie to the desired length, do not close the loop.  In some models of ‚ÄúBat‚Äù sweatshirts, the sleeve and the lower part are separated by an elastic band.  In this case, it is required to prepare two samples for each pattern used.  After carefully consider the number of loops and rows that fit in the fragment.  Then again we return to the taken measurements.  Divide each value by 10 - the length and width of the sample.  And it‚Äôs better to use a calculator to round the totals, they are intermediate.  After that, multiply by the amount: </p><ol><li>  loops in the sample, the value obtained by dividing the girth of the chest and girth of the palm; </li><li>  rows in the sample, the value obtained by dividing the product length, armhole level, neck width and sleeve length. </li></ol><p>  After we draw the scheme of a jacket "Bat".  We mark on it all the totals, if necessary, rounded to the nearest whole. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater jacket scheme" class="if uuid-2973656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2973656.jpg"></div><h2>  Knit a sweater </h2><p>  In one of the previous paragraphs we mentioned that a spectacular jacket fits across.  Therefore, we begin with a set of loops equal to the fist girth.  Further technology varies depending on the model.  In the first version, the Bat sleeve starts from the wrist, in the second - after several rows.  Which most often knit with a single elastic band.  Based on this, technology is changing. </p><p>  First option: </p><ol><li>  We make simple calculations.  Subtract the palm girth from the armhole level.  And divide the new value by the entire length of the sleeve.  Thus, we find out how many loops to add in each row to make a smooth transition from narrow to wide. </li><li>  We begin to knit the conceived product.  We make allowances from the very beginning after the first loop and before the last. </li><li>  Professional knitters are advised to record every step.  Because, by analogy, we will also knit the second sleeve.  But doing instead of adding decreases. </li></ol><p>  Now consider the second version of the description of the jacket "Bat": </p><ol><li>  We knit an elastic band of the necessary length.  Traditionally to the elbow. </li><li>  We count the number of connected rows. </li><li>  Subtract the girth of the palm from the armhole level, and from the total length of the sleeve, the number of rows that went into the elastic.  Next, divide the first value by the second, thereby calculating the number of loops required for addition. </li><li>  Then we make an increase. </li></ol><p>  The intermediate part is carried out with an even cloth to the gate, then each half is separately and again together.  The total number of rows is ¬Ω chest circumference.  Then we reduce the loop, making the second sleeve. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater bat description" class="if uuid-2973685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2973685.jpg"></div><p>  Now the reader knows how to make a bat jacket with knitting needles.  And she can safely get to work. </p>
