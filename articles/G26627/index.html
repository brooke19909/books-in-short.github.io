The Eqtrades.com service is not an exception, reviews of which are found on the forums both positive and negative.  Someone is satisfied with the professionalism of its organizers and a responsible approach, while for someone the work of this company is displeasing.  However, how to understand what is fiction and what is real facts? </p>

    <h2>  Conscious fraud or market specifics? </h2><p>  It is clear to any sane broker that there is no way by which one can achieve a 100% guarantee of the return and increase of investments made in the purchase of securities on the Forex market or spent on foreign exchange transactions.  Although the basis for building a stock trading scheme is trend analysis in detail on the market, but still this does not make them a less risky activity.  There is no way to predict everything, so even the most experienced specialists can suddenly soar or fall. </p><h2>  The reason for the negative experience </h2><p>  Many investors collaborating with brokerage companies do not fully understand the specifics of this business.  Consequently, if the invested funds are ‚Äúburnt‚Äù, then they accuse the partner of lack of professionalism, dishonest attitude and a tendency to fraud.  Sometimes this really happens, but not so often.  How then to understand why failures of a brokerage company happen and how conscious are its actions related to losing?  Maybe it's still market features?  A similar circumstance is confirmed by an example: reviews about EqTrades are both negative and with approval. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The value of experience and attention </h2><p>  Among the key factors that require special attention is the experience in the brokerage market.  Reviews are often biased, so you need to reckon with them when evaluating services.  Service www.eqtrades.com, reviews of which are no exception, has no problems with the presence of this parameter.  Its owner is Global Equity Brokers Ltd.  This broker has been successfully engaged in brokerage activities for almost twenty years.  It can be stated with confidence that it cannot be considered as a desk created yesterday, seeking to write off commissions.  This is evidenced by the IFSC license, which provides the right to complete control over financial transactions. </p><h2>  Customer relationship </h2><p>  EqTrades is attentive to each client, therefore, in case of dissatisfaction with the work of a particular contractor, he will be offered cooperation with another broker.  The service, located at http.eqtrades.com (reviews of which are present in large numbers), does everything to make its partners satisfied! </p>

    <p>  There are quite a lot of brokerage firms in Russia now.  Not everyone provides a quality service, so the reviews are not always positive.  However, negative reviews are received not only by dubious firms, but also famous brands!  Why is that?  This can be analyzed using a specific example and conclude: EqTrade - scam or not. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to choose a suitable broker? </h2><p>  First you need to find out which brokerage company is worth your time and worthy of trust.  The list of things that you need to pay attention to is not large: </p><ul><li>  working hours in this business: at least one or two years, this alignment will give an occasion to reveal one-day trips; </li><li>  financial transparency: availability of necessary licenses, transparency of operations, ease of withdrawal of money are required; </li><li>  state-of-the-art technologies: without IT tools it is impossible to make a universal test of trends - without them, the risks are very high; </li><li>  customer focus: to understand your chances of winning and to understand the reasons for the transactions, it would be nice to consult with a broker. </li></ul><p>  What is this - EqTrades.com - in terms of these criteria?

    <ul><li>  Firstly, the company is licensed by IFSC and has nearly 20 years of experience in this field. </li><li>  Secondly, all its functioning is fully monitored by the regulator (plus cash withdrawal issues). </li><li>  Thirdly, on the accounts of the company customer funds are separated from each other and from the company funds. </li><li>  Fourth, they use the modern MT5 platform.  In addition, brokers provide qualified assistance to customers around the clock.  Everything seems to be fine.  Then why do some people speak badly about the company?  Why do some EqTrades reviews sound negative? </li></ul><h2>  How to choose risks? </h2><p>  The most important thing is understanding the characteristics of exchange trading as such (it does not matter what it is connected with - currency or stocks on Forex).

But, unfortunately, experience shows that not all potential investors understand this (especially when they do not want to master the bidding process). </p>

    <p>  All this leads to thoughts of scam.  Therefore, a loss should not stop you, but give an excuse to increase your knowledge and recognize mistakes.  This will help EqTrades - a broker, reviews of which are not always fair.  To verify this, you need to find out as much information as possible about this company.  How does it differ from its competitors? </p><h2>  Why are reviews not always fair about the company? </h2><p>  EqTrades, as already mentioned, has been operating on the market for a very long time.  First of all, it is worth noting that honest companies have nothing to hide: they understand that a client who trusts them with their money wants to be sure of their safety. </p><p>  EqTrades (reviews are often positive) relies on the principles of openness and perfect transparency in its work, which allows us to say that the transactions are completely safe and as much as possible safe from risks. </p><p>  The EqTrades broker itself has been presented on the market for several years: it belongs to the company Global Equity Brokers (Belize) Ltd, which began its activity back in 1998.  The EqTrades brand, reviews of which are so widespread, appeared in 2008, and since 2014 entered the international markets.  He has an official license of the International Financial Services Comission, which regulates all the activities of the company.  In addition, absolutely all operations are under constant monitoring. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the segregation of customer accounts, as they are separated from the fixed assets of the broker.  This is an additional guarantee in case of force majeure, for example, in case of bankruptcy of a company. </p>

    <h2>  EqTrades Broker Support Reviews </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the company‚Äôs website contains a very large amount of information, including educational information.  There are even introductory articles on basic topics that talk about what Forex is, how trading occurs, how charts are read, and even how the exchange rate can change.  All content is available in three languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Russian, English and Turkish. </p><p>  Employees of the company are always ready to tell all the subtleties of the principles of the online broker and clearly demonstrate the absence of any fraudulent tactics.  The company‚Äôs website contains over 350 different instruments, and the platform itself operates on the MT5 platform, which allows you to monitor transactions and all exchange changes.  Moreover, the resource not only offers a presentation of this platform, but also gives a detailed description of it.  Moreover, there are educational articles introducing the beginner to how to carry out technical and <span>fundamental analysis</span> on MT5, as well as how to use trading signals correctly. </p><p>  At the same time, you can monitor the current situation through applications on iOS and Android.  The broker's website has a whole subsection devoted to mobile trading.  If you have questions, the user has access to round-the-clock technical support, and for those who seek continuous development and self-improvement, they have a whole collection of training webinars. </p><h2>  Credit opportunity </h2><p>  In addition, of the important advantages of the service, it is worth noting the presence of a leverage of up to 400: 1, the possibility of prompt withdrawal of funds and a low commission.

    <p>  In other words, fair reviews about EqTrades.com are available in a positive way.  On the part of those who speak negatively about the project, similar opinions are possible with other brokers.  Exchange trading is always fraught with significant risks, so in any case, any loss of investment will occur.  For those who do not wish to understand this phenomenon, thoughts about fraud will always be relevant. </p><p>  Trading in the foreign exchange market can never be profitable always, with each transaction.  In any case, failures will sometimes occur.  EqTrades faithfully fulfills its obligations to traders, and some unprofitable transactions made during regular trading are an inevitable consequence of risk.  It is necessary to be well aware that any resale work is hard and responsible work. </p>
