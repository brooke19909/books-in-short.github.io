    <h2>  Selection of tools and yarn </h2><p>  The variety of patterns, patterns and textures of yarn gives rise to the most amazing forms of hats, and the main role is played by a pattern that is correctly selected for a particular type of yarn.  Therefore, we will talk about materials and tools before starting to consider patterns for <span>caps with knitting needles, schemes</span> and a description of which will be offered.  Getting started, it is necessary to remember that the preliminary stage is the selection of knitting needles corresponding to the thickness and texture of the thread from which the future product will be made.  For example, thin knitting needles (up to 2 mm in diameter) are designed to work with thread, the meter of which in a hundred-gram skein exceeds 600-800 meters.  Note that knitting with a thin thread is aerobatics in the execution of hats of various styles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most fertile material for knitting hats is yarn of medium thickness.  The selection criterion is the number of meters in a 100 gram yarn skein - 250-300 meters.  The optimal size of the knitting needles for a similar thickness of yarn is No. 2.5 - 3. The correct ratio of the thickness of the thread and the number of knitting needles will give a more even fabric and help to avoid unnecessarily loose or too tight loops when working. </p><p>  Today, fashion models of hats made of very <span>thick yarn</span> have come into fashion <span>.</span>  They are knitted on knitting needles No. 8-12 with a facial or garter stitch.  It is not customary to use various patterns on such knitted fabrics, since, due to the volume and thickness, any pattern on them will look like an excessive pile of loops. </p><h2>  Yarn </h2><p>  The composition of the thread can be any.  The variety of fibers makes it possible to choose exactly that yarn, the implementation of the model from which it seems to the master the most convenient or suitable.  Of course, elite brands of natural wool are the best, albeit expensive, material for making a knitted pattern.  But today, hats made of wool blend, modern mixed fibers, cotton or linen look no worse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns for hats" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1045080.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  So, having prepared for the start of work, you can proceed to the next step and choose a pattern for the cap with knitting needles, the scheme of which will be clear and will not cause problems in the process of product execution.  Let's start to choose from the simplest knitting patterns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting patterns for hats: simple and effective </h2><p>  For beginners needlewomen, masters recommend simple patterns based on shawl, front or back smoothness, as well as alternating loops, various versions of which create spectacular geometry from rhombuses, triangles or squares, as, for example, on the diagrams presented in the article. </p><p>  Shawl knitting is the easiest knitting option.  All rows are knitted with facial loops both from the face and from the inside of the knitted fabric.  Hosiery is characterized by a smooth surface on the front side of the work and the wrong side - from the inside.  Depending on the model conceived, the face can be any side of the resulting canvas. </p><h2>  Elastics as patterns of knitted hats </h2><p>  Different types of elastic bands formed from vertical stripes of combinations of various loops are often used in knitting hats.  Front loops in such a fabric form a spectacular bulge, while the wrong ones form a concave strip.  Good elasticity of the resulting fabric is a feature of this pattern.  To do it, you need knitting needles one size lower, this will make the rubber band more effective and contrast.  Here are common types of rubber bands used: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ <em>Simple.</em>  It is based on the change of front and <span>back loops</span> performed one above the other.  In this case, it is important to maintain a clear line between the strips of the front and the wrong side.  These are simple patterns for knitting caps.  With the description and their implementation usually there is no difficulty.  The elastic band 1 * 1 is knitted as follows: each row - * 1 persons., 1 out. *.  Elastic bands are also considered to be elastic, the stripes of which contain 2, 3 or any other number of loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern for knitting hats" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1045065.jpg" width="359"></div>

It fits simply, starting as a simple elastic band 1 * 1.  It has the following rows: the front loops are made of the front, and the wrong loops are sewn down onto the right double crochet.  In a word, only the front loops are knitted, the wrong ones are removed, and then on the opposite side they are performed with the crochet. </p><p>  The method of dropping the inside of the double crochet and then knitting it in the next row is used in many patent gum.  There are a lot of them, we will not list all the patterns based on gum, we only note that the implementation of a knitted fabric in this way is simple and productive.  Elastic band - a common pattern for knitting hats.  Its outline is very simple.  Now let's talk about other commonly used drawings. </p><h2>  Alternating loops in a knit fabric </h2><p>  In addition to the elastic band, simple patterns are used in knitting hats, obtained by the method of alternating the back and front loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hat with spikelet" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1045138.jpg" width="213"></div>  Using simple patterns, such as those presented in the article, knitters get various patterns, very spectacular and always unique.

    <h2>  Braids and weaves in knitting hats </h2><p>  Various harnesses, braids, aranas and other weaves are often used in the creation of accessories such as knitting hats.  <span>Patterns of braids are</span> varied and textured.  The interweaving of the front bands at different intervals gives additional volume and significantly thickens the product, so braids are often used in knitting winter options.  Create a similar drawing like this: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Make a spread of loops - 6 faces for each braid, 6 loops between them.  The pattern repeat is 12 loops.  After performing a loop test, the required number of loops for the cap is calculated, multiplying the number of loops of 1 cm by the volume of the head.  On the knitting needles gain the number of loops, a multiple of 12, plus 2 edge. </p><p>  - 1 row: * 6 lts., 2 out., 2 lts., 2 out. *; </p><p>  - 2nd and other even rows are performed according to the created pattern; </p><p>  - 3rd row: perform braids on the front strips, consisting of 6 loops, - remove 3 loops on an additional needle, leaving it at work, knit the remaining 3 loops, then loops with extra.  needles.  Between braids, according to the drawing, 2 of., 2 persons., 2 of.  This rapport is done to the end of the row. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted hat patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1045086.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Next, knit 6-10 rows, like the first two, then weave the braids again.  This is the easiest option.  If two braids are placed side by side and cross in opposite directions, you can get a completely different pattern - a complex braid.  The fantasy of the master in the development of various drawings of braids and aranes is unlimited. </p>

    <p>  There are an infinite number of weave patterns.  It is important to understand the principle of knitting, on which the rules for weaving facial bands are based. </p><p>  An imitation of an ordinary braid is the spikelet fashionable today.  A cap with a spikelet pattern with knitting needles is usually made as a transverse strip with a central scythe.  Then the bottom is tied to the strip. </p><h2>  Combination of patterns of various textures </h2><p>  In the presented pattern, the braid is not located on a flat field, but combined with an elastic band 2 * 2.  A common technique for combining different patterns gives a lot of all kinds of options - braids, interspersed with various elastic bands, openwork, patent or crossed loops.  A good example in the photo below - braids with openwork Christmas trees.  You can perform a similar pattern according to the above diagram, replacing the 2 * 2 elastic between the braids with an openwork strip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted hats patterns" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1045118.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The matching textured <span>patterns with knitting needles for hats are</span> spectacular and original. </p><h2>  Openwork when knitting hats </h2><p>  No less loved by the craftswomen and openwork patterns.  Most often they are used in light summer models, since the abundance of holes suggests good breathability of the headgear.  In models for winter and off-season, lace is also used, but in addition, a second layer is used, which serves as a kind of lining. We offer openwork patterns for hats with knitting needles.  Schemes and description of the implementation of the drawings are simple and understandable.  They are given using generally accepted symbols, where the circle indicates the crochet, the vertical dash - the front loop, the horizontal - the wrong side, the inclined one - knitting two loops of one. </p>
