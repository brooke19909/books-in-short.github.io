    <h2>  Reason for trust </h2><p>  An organization such as Uralsib Bank has a very solid rating.  And he is supported by the results of analytical agencies.  Take, for example, Standard &amp; Poors.  This analytical agency is one of the three best organizations in this area at the international level.  Standard &amp; Poors assigned Uralsib a B- credit rating with a positive outlook (the most recent data is 16.06.16).  That is, in principle, this level is slightly below average (by international standards), which in the future can become an order of magnitude higher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Uralsib Bank also has a good rating among organizations that issued the largest number of car loans.  In the top 10, he is on the 9th line.  In the list of 15 organizations that registered the largest number of mortgages, Uralsib Bank is in 14th place.  His rating is also high in the field of lending - the organization is among the top 10 best financial companies that provide the most profitable programs for small businesses.  And according to the results of the Mystery Shopping Awards, he was recognized as one of the best private banks. </p><p>  The mobile industry, which is gaining popularity today, deserves special attention.  Uralsib entered the top three in the field of mobile banking.  And received the Markswebb Rank &amp; Report award for this.  In terms of security and convenience, he entered the top 10.  And all this data is direct evidence of the reliability of such an organization as Uralsib. </p>

    <h2>  Awards </h2><p>  A couple of words should be said about them too.  The reliability rating of an enterprise such as Uralsib Bank is further confirmed by the distinguishing marks of Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG.  They are awarded for the high quality of execution of payment documents in euros. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, Uralsib was recognized in 2015 as the best client bank in the state precious metals market.  He is also a laureate of an international competition known as ‚ÄúBest Risk Management‚Äù.  There are several nominations in it, namely, Uralsib passed under the ‚ÄúBest Risk Management Program‚Äù. </p><p>  This organization also does charity work.  The project, organized by him and the Victoria Children's Fund, has become one of the 30 best social programs in the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  Nowadays, this type of loan is very popular.  Because everyone needs housing, but not everyone has the opportunity to purchase it.  So, there is a list that lists banks that offer the best conditions for mortgage loans for the purchase of housing in the secondary market.  On December 15, 2016, news appeared that Uralsib Bank received a place in the rating, and not bad at all - it entered the top 10. </p><p>  And the conditions are really good.  The most profitable was the program with a rate of 13.5% and an initial payment of 10-30%.  Although there are other suggestions.  ‚ÄúMortgage for state employees‚Äù, for example, with a preferential rate of 10.8%.  It may be even lower for people using Uralsib products (cards, for example).  The fee is 20% for verified customers and 40% for those who contact the bank for the first time. </p>

    <h2>  Promotions and interesting offers </h2><p>  As you can see, Uralsib Bank has a solid rating among banks.  And therefore, the organization often arranges various promotions for its customers. </p><p>  So, for example, during this December, the offer ‚ÄúTablet for free!‚Äù  from Uralsib and Samsung.  If the client draws out a <span>Galaxy S7 edge S7</span> phone on credit <span>,</span> then the Galaxy Tab A 7.0 tablet computer will get him as a gift.  By the way, a 10% discount is provided on the loan.  The rate is 15.5% per annum. </p><p>  More privileges and gifts were provided to Moscow Mir cardholders.  For them, figure skating and hot chocolate are available at the VDNKh skating rink for free.  They can also take part in the drawing of tickets for the most striking event of the outgoing year - the New Year holiday.  Which will also be held at the rink. </p><p>  These are just a few examples.  In general, it is not surprising why Uralsib entered the top 10 banks most beloved by Russians in 2016.  By the way, such a rating also exists. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  You can tell a lot of interesting things about Uralsib Bank.  He has a high place in the ranking of the best financial organizations of the Russian Federation, but he also holds good positions in other "top" lists.  Some are worth a list. </p><p>  In November of this year, for example, the organization took second place on the list, which listed banks issuing the best credit cards with charity programs.  At Uralsib, this tariff is called "Decent Home for Children."  The rate on this credit card is 28% per annum.  The conditions are as follows: 0.5% of the amount given for each purchase is transferred to the settlement account of the children's fund, from which payment is made for the improvement of housing conditions in boarding schools. </p><p>  In November, Uralsib was included in the top 3 organizations providing the best conditions for mortgage lending with state subsidies.  The rate is 11.25% per annum, the down payment is 20%, the loan term is 3-30 years. </p><p>  Also, the bank is included in the top 10 organizations whose unsecured loans are most in demand among the population. </p><p>  You can still tell a lot of interesting things about Uralsib Bank.  What place this organization holds in the ranking is extremely clear.  And, based on the above, we can conclude - this is a good and reliable bank, which really can be trusted with your money.  And the monthly increasing number of customers is a direct confirmation of this. </p>
