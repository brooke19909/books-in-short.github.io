Consider it briefly. </p><p>  Public administration in Russia developed back in the days of Kievan Rus.  At the <span>head of the state</span> was a prince who belonged to the Rurik family.  In some cities, tribal princes ruled.  But the power of the prince was limited to veche, i.e.  was not monarchical.  When the prince was dying, the entire ladder of government rose one step up. </p><p>  The prince had to ensure internal security, legislate, administer the highest court, he was the head of the administration.  Also in his duties included the gathering and formation of the squad.  The population paid tribute, sweetheart.  In the cities there were officials who were called numerals.  They did a census to pay tribute.  Each principality had its own characteristics of state organization and management.  Here a new rank took shape, the boyars, who increasingly began to challenge the rights of the princes.  The history of public administration in Russia is very interesting.  In the 12-13 centuries, princes very often changed - 68 times, while the prince was an indispensable element of the social and political system.  After the unification of Russian lands in the 15th century.  a single state was formed, which was called Russia.  In this regard, the socio-economic structure of the state is changing.  The history of public administration in Russia assigned a considerable place to the Duma.  The head of state was the Grand Duke.  The Duma consisted of the spirit of the parts - the boyars and the deceased.  Also in the state structure were the Palace, which dealt with the lands of the prince, and the Treasury, where state money, jewelry, and also important documents were stored.  With the advent of Ivan IV, the system of government in Russia is changing.  As a result of his reforms, the Middle Duma is created, a system of orders ... In the villages, the position of leader was called the Labradors, and the Beloved Heads in the cities.  In 1549  <span>Zemsky Cathedral</span> was created <span>,</span> and in 1551.  a <span>hundred-headed cathedral</span> was assembled <span>,</span> which introduced reforms in church rule.  Ivan IV divided the whole country into <span>zemshchins and oprichnins.</span>  Starting from the 17th century, prerequisites for the transition from monarchy to autocracy were noticed in Russia.  There have also been changes in the military system of Russia.  The armed forces of Russia strengthened.  During the reign of Peter the reforms were implemented in relation to the <span>state apparatus.</span>  Its transformations were mainly directed towards Europeanization, modernization of the socio-economic and state system of Russia.  His reforms also affected the peasants, who were divided into state and serf peasants.  In the middle of the 18th century there were coups, and after the death of Peter, organs were created whose function was to limit the power of the king.  Such bodies were the <span>Supreme Privy Council</span> (1725-1730), the cabinet of ministers (1730-1740), and the conference at the Highest Court (1740-1762).  Civil and criminal courts have also been established.  Such reforms have been carried out continuously for several centuries.  At the beginning of the 20th century the State Duma was created.  The republic was proclaimed on September 1, 1917. The state was ruled by an interim government.  In July 1918, the first constitution was proclaimed on July 10, the constitution of the RSFSR.  According to her, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was the legislative body. On January 31, 1924, the <span>USSR Constitution</span> was proclaimed <span>.</span>  <span>The USSR</span> lasted until 1991.  after its destruction, the Russian Federation was formed, the president of which was Boris Yeltsin. </p><p>  The history of public service in Russia spans several centuries.  In Kievan Rus there was no service duty.  Serious changes in this area occurred after the unification of the northeastern lands of Russia under the rule of the Moscow prince.  Starting from the <span>reign of Ivan III,</span> any serviceman can not go beyond the borders of the Moscow principality - this was considered treason. </p><p>  The history of public service is inextricably linked with the history of public administration in Russia.  We tried to briefly outline the topic "History of Public Administration in Russia". </p>
