The project will be implemented on the site of the Voronezh-Pridacha railway station.  This is due to the fact that the old station is no longer cope with its functions.  According to M. Akulov, who holds the position of vice president of Russian Railways, the Voronezh-Pridacha station will receive not only a new look, but also a new name, Voronezh-Yuzhny. </p><h2>  Concept </h2><p>  The new station will occupy an impressive area, the size of which will exceed one thousand square meters.  The project for updating the Voronezh-Pridacha railway station took into account both technical issues and wishes regarding the development of the passenger infrastructure of the station. </p><p>  The capacity of the waiting room, which will be built together with the new building of the Voronezh-Pridacha station, will be five hundred people.  Next to it, a food court format will be deployed. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The creators of the innovative project also thought about motorists.  For them, the Pridacha-Voronezh railway station will acquire a modern parking designed for several hundred cars.  There will be a viaduct that will connect the station with the areas of Voronezh, VAI and the Left Bank. </p><p>  This year, about fifty million rubles were allocated to the Voronezh-Pridacha station.  Representatives of the Russian Railways company and the city of Voronezh are actively searching for sponsors, as well as sources of additional financing for the project.  In total, three hundred million rubles will be required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The first attempts to build a new railway station in Voronezh on the site of the Prichadka station were made several years ago.  But then, in 2014, they failed because of a banal lack of funds for the implementation of even the first stage of the project. </p>

    <p>  Currently, in view of the construction of a new high-speed railway that will connect the cities of Adler and Moscow, the project has received a second wind.  A high-speed branch will pass through Voronezh.  This means that its maintenance will require additional capacity. </p><h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  It‚Äôs too early to say that the new Voronezh-Yuzhny station is under construction.  But the areas available today are being actively modernized and repaired.  The station has long needed not only cosmetic, but also fundamental repairs. </p>

    <p>  The traffic intensity of the long-distance trains and commuter trains that are served by Voronezh-Glavny is inferior to the volume that Pridacha (Voronezh) took over.  The schedule is another proof of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most passenger trains heading south, such as Anapa, Adler, Sochi, Novorossiysk, Yeysk, Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, pass through the railway station "Pridacha". </p><p>  On the platform of the Voronezh-Glavny city train station, located in the very center of the metropolis, only branded trains make a stop.  High-speed trains also move through the "Bargain". </p><h2>  In search of an alternative </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the possibility of updating the Pridacha railway station is considered annually, the Russian Railways administration has studied a number of alternative solutions that could satisfy the needs of the high-speed Moscow-Adler branch. </p>

    <p>  The railway station in the small settlement Latnoe, which is located several kilometers from Voronezh, was considered as a reference point.  This plan is called "Western". </p><p>  According to him, the railway tracks were to go around Semiluki, another settlement in the Voronezh region.  The project was rejected due to the abundance of natural areas that are protected by the state and lie in the way of the high-speed highway. </p><p>  The second plan suggested building a <span>expressway</span> directly within the city of Voronezh.  On the left bank of the metropolis, in the Zheleznodorozhny district, where there is a traffic intersection behind the Metro hypermarket facing the Don federal highway, a railway line should also have grown. </p><p>  The remoteness of the object from the city center, as well as the presence of dense residential development in this part of the Left Bank, did not make it possible to translate the second alternative plan into reality. </p><p>  The most widely discussed option was recognized as optimal.  The Pridacha station in Voronezh will become the new station that will connect Moscow and Adler.  At the same time, the interchange will be built in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe existing Ostuzhevsky automobile ring. </p><h2>  Forward to the future </h2><p>  As soon as the project is implemented, the travel time from Voronezh to Adler will be only five and a half hours.  Today, passenger trains require at least sixteen hours.  The road from Voronezh to Moscow will take two and a half hours instead of six. </p>

    <p>  The maximum speed that the train will develop on the Moscow-Adler highway will be four hundred kilometers per hour.  High-speed highway is not the only surprise that the leadership of Russian Railways prepared for the residents of Voronezh.  Perhaps very soon in the city the light metro line will start operating. </p><p>  It will connect the airport in Chertovitsky, the new Voronezh-Yuzhny railway station and the center of the metropolis.  Reconstruction and redevelopment of the existing Voronezh-Glavny railway station is another topic for discussion. </p>

    <p>  According to the plan of city architects, the station and the adjacent territory will sooner or later change their appearance beyond recognition.  In fact, the station should be reborn, and the famous facade, symbol and attraction of modern Voronezh will be reminded of the city residents by its past. </p>
