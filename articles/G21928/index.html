    <p>  An interim liquidation balance sheet is provided after assessing the property of the <span>bankrupt company</span> , taking an inventory, and also after identifying the creditors and determining the register of their claims.  The formation of information is carried out on the date of the start of bankruptcy proceedings to reflect the property status of the company before the sale of its assets, as well as any costs incurred by the commission. </p><p>  The interim balance sheet is intended to reflect the results of consideration of creditor claims.  In this regard, its formation is possible not earlier than the register of claims will be closed, that is, after the end of the period that is set for the presentation of claims.  During this time, an assessment is carried out, an <span>inventory of the property</span> that the debtor had at the time of bankruptcy. </p><p>  An interim liquidation balance sheet is drawn up in accordance with the requirements contained in the <span>Accounting Regulations.</span>  This Regulation is approved by relevant order. </p><p>  How to balance  It should be noted that there is mandatory information that must be reflected in the document.  In particular, the interim liquidation balance sheet contains: </p><ol><li>  A list of structures and buildings, indicating the name, inventory number, its location, actual depreciation.  Information is also provided on the year of <span>commissioning</span> and on the residual value. </li><li>  A list of equipment, machinery and other fixed assets with full information about each object. </li><li>  The list of uninstalled equipment, objects of unfinished capital construction.  At the same time, the date of commencement of the construction, the actually executed volume, name, location, <span>book value are</span> indicated <span>.</span> </li><li>  A list of long-term investments and intangible assets with a specified value in accordance with the asset balance. </li><li>  A list of costs, stocks, money and other things with an indication of work in progress, resources, animals for fattening and rearing, VAT on purchased goods.  The same list includes settlements with debtors for products, services or work, with the budget, subsidiaries, personnel on promissory notes, as well as other transactions with other debtors.  In addition, the list contains advances made to contractors and suppliers, cash, investments for a short period, settlement and currency accounts, cash. </li><li>  List of claims made by a bankrupt legal entity by creditors.  In this case, the name of the creditor is indicated (in accordance with the priority), the amount of debt, as well as the decision on satisfaction. </li></ol><p>  As a rule, the interim liquidation balance sheet reflects a large loss of the enterprise.  At the same time, the company has no profit, its account is ‚Äúreset‚Äù, there are practically no cash at the cash desk, and there are no materials and goods <span>(liquid assets).</span>  At the same time, there are non-current assets that the founders seek to divide among themselves. </p><p>  The work of a bankrupt enterprise can be divided into two stages: before the decision to eliminate and after it.  At the first stage, normal production activities are carried out: funds invested, taxes paid, salaries paid. </p><p>  After making the decision on elimination, an inventory is carried out, its results are summed up, and the costs of publishing bankruptcy are incurred.  Along with this, <span>fixed costs are incurred by the</span> enterprise.  Also, funds are being spent on the salaries of members of the liquidation commission, calculations are adjusted after reconciliation with counterparties and the budget. </p><p>  When the document is drafted, it is approved by the founders of the company.  After that, the liquidation balance sheet is agreed with the body that registered this legal entity. </p>
