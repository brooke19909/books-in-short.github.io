    <h2>  Salvation at the cost of life </h2><p>  On September 3, 2004, the advance team launched an assault on the school.  Some of its participants managed to get into the school canteen.  Among them was Major Kuznetsov Mikhail Borisovich.  The terrorists continued to fire, but he did not stop the hero from taking out 20 hostages from the premises.  Terrorists blew up the gym and continued to fire at it from grenade launchers, as well as small arms.  The assault continued.  Kuznetsov Mikhail Borisovich when repelling an enemy attack received multiple wounds, from them he later died in the hospital in Vladikavkaz. </p><h2>  No coincidence </h2><p>  How can one characterize a person who laid down his life for the sake of others?  Strong, courageous, courageous.  It is hardly possible to describe in simple words those qualities that are inherent in such heroes as Kuznetsov Mikhail Borisovich.  But their exploits do not go unnoticed.  The hero of our article participated in other military operations and always showed his best male qualities.  So it was during the storming of Grozny, and also during the liberation of the hostages on Dubrovka and in other hot spots, where he had to visit.  It is not surprising that Mikhail Borisovich Kuznetsov received many awards, including the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, I and II degrees.  He also received the Order of the Red Star, For Military Merit, and For Courage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Beginning of life </h2><p>  Major died at the age of 39.  His short life journey began in the village of Yurovo (Ramensky district).  Kuznetsov Mikhail Borisovich was born on August 21, 1965 in a family of ordinary workers.  Having received a secondary education in 1980, the young man entered the SSPTU, where he studied until he was drafted into the army in 1984.  Even then, he was able to excel.  Kuznetsov took part in the hostilities in Afghanistan, after which he was awarded the medal ‚ÄúFor Courage‚Äù.  After the army, Mikhail becomes an employee of the KGB.  In 1991, he served in Belarus in the city of Vitebsk.  Just at that time, the USSR collapsed, and Kuznetsov returned to his homeland, and then enlisted in the special forces.  In 1997, he became an employee of the Vympel department, which was engaged in the fight against terrorism.  On duty, Kuznetsov Mikhail Borisovich ended up in Beslan, where his life path was tragically cut short. </p><h2>  Injustice </h2><p>  The major left a family: wife, daughter and son.  It would seem that after such a loss, grief should bypass them.  However, everything turned out very differently.  Kuznetsov's daughter was killed at the age of 18.  This happened in the village of Yurovo on the day when a monument in his honor was unveiled in the hero‚Äôs homeland.  By mystical coincidence, this happened on September 4, 2007, just 3 years after her father died.  Oksana Kuznetsova left a little daughter.  The killer has not yet been found, despite the fact that the crime was committed in a small village where everyone knows each other. </p>

It consists of those who, through their own bitter experience, have learned what terrorism is.  At one time, Mikhail Borisovich saved the children of Beslan.  And so now, when his wife and son suffered a new loss, they were not left alone, but received serious moral and material support.
