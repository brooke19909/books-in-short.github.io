Embodying the ideal of female beauty, the slender, tall and delightful goddess was called Venus among the Romans.  They believed that the girl appeared from the sea itself - from the depths of its foam.  The cult of Aphrodite was widespread: beauty and love were the true values ‚Äã‚Äãthat she knew.  Her power extended not only to mere mortals - even the gods could not resist the spell of beautiful Venus.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In his numerous works, Homer claimed that Aphrodite was the wife of Hephaestus <span>(son of Zeus</span> and Hera).  However, the goddess all her life loved only Adonis. </p><p>  Another daughter of Zeus is Athena.  The middle name is Pallas.  Myths say that the supreme <span>god of Olympus</span> was predicted that his son would take away the power of his father from his wife Metis.  Therefore, when his wife was in a position, Zeus swallowed her.  The price paid was an unbearable and excruciating headache.  In order to get rid of the disease Hephaestus, on the orders of his father, cut his head in half.  And the daughter of Zeus was born - Athena, with a helmet on her head, with a spear in one hand and with a shield in the other.  That is how she is depicted in numerous paintings. </p><p>  In mythology, it is believed that it is Athena that represents wisdom and justice.  It was believed that it helps heroes, protects cities and settlements.  The Greeks believe that only thanks to the daughter of Zeus they have the city of Athens and the sacred tree that brings delicious fruits - olive.  Among other things, the goddess did not ignore the attention of ordinary workers.  Artisans, potters, weavers and blacksmiths all worshiped her. </p><p>  Numerous sources claim that it is Athena who is the mother of the most courageous and beautiful god of Olympus - Apollo. </p>

    <p>  In addition, in ancient Greek mythology there are muses, who, as these scriptures claim, were also daughters of Zeus.  Girls were patrons of creativity.  The most important of them was Cleo (Clio).  History and epic poetry were its subjects.  Lyric poetry was ruled by Euterpe.  Thalia - the daughter of Zeus - was the third muse.  She patronized fun and comedies.  It is also believed that she was subject to control of plants and flowers.  The names of the other <span>muses: Erato,</span> Urania, Terpsichore, Melpomene, Calliope, Polygymy. </p>
