  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of threads and their purpose</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the textile industry uses many types of threads.  In the process of home needlework also use all kinds of such materials.  They differ in a lot of characteristics.  There is a huge selection of threads for sewing, knitting, embroidery, etc. In order not to get confused in this variety, you need to consider the characteristics of each variety.  This will make the right choice.  The main types of threads and their features will be discussed later. </p><h2>  General definition </h2><p>  Today there are a huge number of all kinds of threads (photo is presented below).  They are called twisted products in a professional language.  They can be indefinitely long.  Flexible textile products, which are, by definition, yarns, are twisted from individual fibers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.threadsmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo types of threads" class="if uuid-2458561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2458561.jpg"></div><p>  Products for sewing, embroidery and knitting can be created from natural or synthetic materials.  Without threads it would be impossible to sew clothes, create fabrics.  They are used both in industrial production and in needlework.  The threads can be either the final product or be further processed. </p><p>  Depending on the application, several types of threads are distinguished.  If it is necessary to interconnect separate parts of shoes, clothes and other similar products, twisted sewing products are used.  If you want to finish the fabrics, you need looped cords.  For knitting, a separate type of thread is also produced.  Hand and machine embroidery is created from floss. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Considering the types of threads and their purpose, it should be noted that this indicator largely depends on the features of their production.  This is affected by the type of fibers, mass, number of additions and type of weaving.  Also, the properties of the threads are affected by fineness.  This is an indicator of the cross section of the fibers of flax, cotton and other varieties of materials. </p><p>  Threads vary in cross-sectional size.  The thicker the thread and the denser the fibers are folded in it, the stronger the cord will be.  This indicator is also significantly affected by the type of material from which the yarn is made. </p><p>  The threads are dyed in a variety of colors during processing.  Their range is extremely large.  And for embroidery they produce threads of various shades.  This is necessary to create a quality product.  Technical threads that are used, for example, for sewing bags, can be the same color.  In all cases, depending on the application, an indicator of color fastness is important.  The higher it is, the better and more expensive the thread. </p><h2>  Sewing thread </h2><p>  What kinds of threads are there?  There are a great many of them.  The most common variety are sewing threads.  They are made in the vast majority of cases from cotton yarn.  Less commonly, flax fiber is used for these purposes.  Natural silk threads are very much appreciated all over the world.  Their cost is very high.  Products made from synthetics are much cheaper.  It can be kapron, lavsan, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.seamsandscissors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sewing thread" class="if uuid-2458559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2458559.jpg"></div><p>  Sewing threads are used everywhere.  Therefore, this is the most common variety.  For such products put forward certain requirements.  They must have high strength.  Such threads do not break at a certain load.  Also their surface is smooth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sewing threads are made from combed yarn.  It is folded several times.  Further, the material is subjected to double twist (right or left).  Cords made by the presented method from natural fibers lend themselves well to bleaching.  They also absorb paint without losing their color for a long time.  Therefore, the range of colors of these products is large.  During the production process, the surface of the thread is given a matte or glossy texture. </p><p>  There are different types of fabrics and threads of the type presented.  They are produced in accordance with GOST.  Their tone is determined by the color map installed at the factory. </p><p>  Sewing threads can be of the first or second grade.  This indicator is determined in production.  For this, an employee of the company inspects one hundred packages of products 200 m each. Next, assessments of the appearance of the products are made, the presence of defects, as well as the unevenness of the cord, are determined.  White threads of the first grade should not receive more than forty-five negative marks.  White, black and colored threads of the second grade can get a maximum of one hundred and ten comments. </p><p>  If the threads on the spool are characterized by a length of more than 200 m, then a larger number of marks is permissible.  When evaluating the quality of the threads, the specialist takes into account many nuances.  Therefore, such work is carried out only by qualified personnel. </p><h2>  Varieties of sewing type threads </h2><p>  There are different types of threads for sewing.  They differ not only in variety.  Threads of different lengths can be wound on spools.  This indicator can be 200-400 m. </p><p>  There are several varieties of brands of sewing threads.  They differ in the number of additions.  The brands ‚Äúprima‚Äù, ‚Äúextra‚Äù are made of threads in 3 additions.  They are often used when repairing and sewing clothes.  Such threads are of medium strength. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="stitchers-source.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Threads for embroidery" class="if uuid-2458562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2458562.jpg"></div><p>  There are other varieties.  So, the brand ‚Äúspecial‚Äù is created from individual threads in six additions.  They are tear resistant.  Such threads are often used in industry.  For works to which special requirements are put forward, the brand ‚Äúespecially durable‚Äù is made.  They can have nine or twelve additions. </p><p>  The fineness of the threads is indicated by a number.  The higher it is, the thinner the thread.  So, to create products from dense fabrics (for example, tarps), cords No. 10 and 20 are suitable. These are very dense, thick varieties of products.  For sewing outerwear, threads No. 30 or 40 are used, and for light dresses, blouses - No. 50. </p><p>  All types of sewing threads are tested in production.  Their elongation and strength are evaluated.  They depend on the quality and type of feedstock, twist features, as well as roughness indicators.  In sewing varieties of threads, strength characteristics reach 80%.  These indicators are set by the standards for each brand.  The greater the number of additions, the stronger the thread should be.  These indicators are tested in production.  There are tolerances.  However, they should not go beyond established standards. </p><h2>  Darning and embroidery threads </h2><p>  There is such a variety of threads as darn.  They are made of cotton, blended yarn, as well as wool.  Darn threads are made by loosely twisting 4 threads.  For this, carded or cotton yarn is used.  These threads are produced in skeins or balls.  Thickness is also indicated by a number.  The larger the number, the finer the thread. </p><p>  In industrial production and manual needlework, various types of embroidery threads are often used.  They differ from sewing in a special structure.  It can be glossy and matte.  At the same time, there are much more shades and tones for such products than for sewing threads.  They also put forward high demands on thread uniformity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.favequilts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mouline thread" class="if uuid-2458560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2458560.jpg"></div><p>  Products intended for embroidery are of medium strength.  However, deviations and defects in their structure should be minimal.  Such threads should easily pass through a fabric or canvas.  Even if several threads will be used at once, they should not be confused, curl into knots. </p><p>  The surface of the threads can be either glossy or matte.  The first option is more preferable.  These types of embroidery threads are more expensive.  However, the embroidery is elegant, silky.  It has a uniform brilliant structure.  Therefore, glossy threads that undergo special processing are valued higher than matte varieties. </p><p>  The thickness of the threads can be different.  They are sold in skeins or balls.  For manual embroidery, threads with medium strength are used.  In the course of work, the master does not exert significant physical effort to create a drawing.  Therefore, breakage of threads is unlikely.  For machine embroidery, products with a high strength indicator are purchased.  This is due to the features of the process of creating embroidery in this way. </p><h2>  Varieties of embroidery type threads </h2><p>  There are different types of threads.  Mouline thread is one of the most popular materials for embroidery.  It is believed that in this category these are the highest quality products.  They differ in a weak twist.  The threads are soft.  They are made from combed fine yarn.  Mouline thread is made from cotton, which undergoes additional processing.  This operation is called mercerization. </p><p>  Such processing allows you to remove fleece from the surface of the threads.  The result is a smooth product.  Mercerization is a complex process.  It increases the cost of threads.  They cost more than sewing varieties.  However, the picture created with the help of a floss looks exquisite.  Such types of threads resemble silk or synthetics in their appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="store.myenmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of Floss" class="if uuid-2458567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2458567.jpg"></div><p>  Mercerization allows you to create shiny threads.  They become stronger and softer.  It‚Äôs easy to work with such products.  The threads are not confused, they create a smooth structure on the surface.  Depending on the embroidery technique, you can create a surface with a pattern of different filling densities.  The brightness of the color of the threads was appreciated by private and industrial consumers.  Mouline receives many positive reviews.  The thread is not confused and is evenly distributed on the surface when passing through a canvas or fabric.  It does not fade in the sun. </p><p>  Mouline thread is available in skeins of 10 and 20 m. A feature of the material is the fact that it can easily be divided into 6 threads.  Thanks to this feature, you can create different patterns.  If you want to make it thinner, separate 2-3 threads from the general ball.  For stitch embroidery, a whole thread of 6 separate products can be used. </p><p>  The second type of embroidery thread is a single-crocheted cotton thread.  It is twisted into 4 additions.  This variety is called embroidery paper.  Its surface may be glossy or matte.  In the first case, the processing process includes a stage of mercerization. </p><h2>  Embroidery techniques </h2><p>  There are a huge number of types of embroidery with thread floss.  The stitches can be very different.  They can consist of different stitches, loops.  This allows you to create different images and plots on fabric or canvas. </p><p>  One of the most interesting is the technique of cross stitching.  In this case, the pattern consists of small squares.  The more shades present in the picture, the more spectacular it looks.  Mouline threads allow you to combine different colors in separate tones and shades.  Crosses can be small and large.  Most often, embroidery is created on the canvas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespruce.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of embroidery" class="if uuid-2458563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2458563.jpg"></div><p>  The larger the crosses, the more threads will need to be taken for work.  If they are very small, enough stitches of 2-3 threads are enough.  If the cross is medium or large, it is better to take 4-6 threads.  In this case, the surface will be monolithic.  No canvas will be visible under the threads. </p><p>  Considering the types of embroidery with floss, it is also worth paying attention to the technique of creating a stitch pattern.  It is the brilliant texture of the threads that allows you to create bright, interesting images.  The drawings created on the fabric will decorate any clothes, textile products.  In this case, several threads are also selected for one stitch.  They are evenly distributed over the surface. </p><p>  Mouline thread is valued for its ability to mimic the look of natural silk.  Embroidery in this case looks very impressive. </p><h2>  Knitting threads </h2><p>  There are different types of knitting threads.  They are used for machine or manual work.  They can be both very fluffy and smooth.  Threads are made from wool, synthetics and their mixtures.  The last option is the most popular today.  Such threads are relatively low cost.  Moreover, they are soft, durable and beautiful.  The most common combination is acrylic and wool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wisegeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting" class="if uuid-2458558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2458558.jpg"></div><p>  The color of the threads can be different.  Most often, monophonic varieties are on sale.  In the process of knitting, they are combined in accordance with the selected pattern.  However, there are multi-colored threads.  This category includes 2 brands.  The first of these is the mottled variety.  It consists of several different color threads.  The second is the brand of section dyeing.  It consists of gaps of a thread of a certain length, which are painted in different colors. </p><p>  For different types of threads put forward certain requirements.  In the manufacture of grades intended for knitting or crocheting, it is permissible that products from different batches differ slightly in shade.  Take-off should not be big.  However, it is worth considering that it is worthwhile to purchase thread for knitting with a margin.  If they were not enough during the work, a new batch of threads can noticeably differ in shade.  And this is a normal situation in this case.  Therefore, it is recommended to purchase threads with a margin. </p><p>  On sale are threads of different thicknesses.  They can be either very thin or thick.  The choice depends on the type of product, as well as the tool.  If you plan to knit with needles, you need to attach them to the thread.  If the yarn is ordinary, the tool should be 1 or even 1.5 mm thicker.  For a voluminous, downy thread, this figure is 2-3 mm. </p><p>  If you plan to crochet, you need to throw a loop on it.  It should be at the tip of the tool bar.  Often the size of the thread corresponding to one or another type of knitting needles is indicated on the packaging of the material.  However, some manufacturers may neglect this requirement. </p><h2>  Varieties of knitting threads </h2><p>  Knitting threads are made of cotton, silk, synthetic, as well as wool yarn.  It is treated in a special way.  The result is different <span>types of thread for</span> crocheting and knitting. </p><p>  Iris, crochet, garus and other popular varieties of materials are made from <span>cotton yarn</span> .  The first of these options is the most famous material for knitting.  Iris is made by twisting threads in 2 additions.  Yarn is mercerized for this.  It is quite dense, but curls weakly. </p><p>  Crochet is made from both mercerized and plain yarn.  4 additions are made from it and double twisting is used.  The thread has a weave that looks like a cord.  Crochet is released in balls.  They are measured in grams (10 and 20 g). </p><p>  Also, wool is used to create knitting threads.  It can be thick or thin.  From <span>natural fibers</span> use Angora, merino, crossbred wool and other varieties.  To add additional decorativeness, <span>metallized threads</span> are added to them <span>.</span>  The length in the skein is determined by the thickness of the product.  Synthetic fibers can be added to the composition of the yarn.  These include kapron, lavsan, acon, comelan. </p><h2>  Natural fibers </h2><p>  There are various types of <span>woolen threads.</span>  One popular option is alpaca (llama) wool.  It is lightweight, durable.  Often this wool is mixed with other fibers.  Pure alpaca is quite expensive.  The coat is long enough.  It does not roll down; it is distinguished by high thermoregulating qualities.  When storing products from alpaca wool, naphthalene should not be used.  For this, only natural repellents for moths (lavender, cedar) are suitable. </p><p>  <span>Angora wool</span> is very pleasant to the touch <span>.</span>  It is obtained from rabbit fluff.  The coat is very soft and warm.  It is durable and very fluffy.  However, the lack of material is the fact that the fluff is not fixed firmly in the yarn.  Angora is combined with other fibers. </p><p>  Cashmere receives a lot of positive feedback.  This yarn is made from the down of mountain goats.  If it is used in its pure form, the coat may roll.  Therefore, it is used in combination with other fibers.  Cashmere products are very pleasant to the touch.  They are soft (superior to silk in this indicator), warm and very light. </p><p>  <span>Merino wool is</span> collected from a special breed of sheep.  It has a high cost.  The coat is long and has a white color.  It is elastic and warm.  It is often used to create children's things. </p><h2>  Faux yarn </h2><p>  One of the most common types of artificial thread is viscose.  It is made from cellulose fibers.  It is a pleasant to the touch, hygroscopic material.  When washing things with the addition of such fibers can not be twisted.  They require respect. </p><p>  Another popular option is synthetic acrylic fiber.  It has many names.  This, for example, polyamine, PAN fiber.  It is extracted from natural gas.  Fiber is added to other types of yarn.  In this case, they can be used for knitting machines. </p><p>  For greater elasticity, capron or lycra can be added to the yarn.  Synthetic materials are cheaper than natural.  Therefore, they are often combined to improve the quality of the yarn and reduce its cost. </p><p>  Having considered the main types of threads and their characteristics, you can make the right choice for carrying out this or that type of work.          . </p>
