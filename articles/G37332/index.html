    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The screen received an IPS type matrix.  It is 5-inch, its resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels.  The device runs on a platform of 4 cores. </p><p>  The RAM of the Meizu M5c smartphone is 2 GB, and the built-in memory is 16 gigabytes.  Supports MicroSD Card operation.  The main camera has 8 megapixels, the front camera is designed for 5 megapixels.  Supports the operation of modules Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, MicroUSB, GPS, GLONASS.  The battery is designed for 3 thousand mAh.  There is an accelerometer, light sensor, proximity sensor.  The phone weighs 135 g. The device runs on the Android 6.0 operating system. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  <span>Smartphone Meizu</span> M5c is part of a stylish and current budget line.  Its body is streamlined, decorative elements are practically absent, the front part is quite simple, on it there is only a Home button.  The device most closely resembles the previous Meizu 5M model.  Thanks to the plastic case, the back of the phone is made of matte material.  The sound and lock keys are located on the right side.  At the bottom there is MicroUSB.  There are also grilles, under one of which is a microphone, under the second - a speaker.  The headphone port is at the top. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can see massive blocks above and below the screen.  The speaker grill is not in the center, so the phone can be attributed to the low-cost segment at the first glance.  After all, such a solution is the lot of budget devices.  2D glass is missing.  However, due to the flat design of the display, you can see that the device is protected from scratches if you put it with the back up.  This is achieved using a threshold that is located around the glass perimeter.  Reviews about Meizu M5c (16 GB) confirm this property. </p><p>  There are no elaborate elements in the device, the black color looks corny, the assembly is excellent.  The phone can be attributed to smartphones of a strict type.  The design, whose elements are usually used in more expensive models, also plays along with a pleasant perception.  Due to the presence of matte polycarbonate, the device retains a good appearance longer.  It is also more pleasant to the touch than cheaper aluminum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone meizu m5c" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2097697.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The phone works with a 5-inch HD screen.  <span>Meizu M5c (16 GB)</span> received an entry-level display, so the picture will be slightly pale, the contrast is weak.  In a couple of days, you can quickly get used to the features of the screen.  A mediocre conclusion ceases to annoy.  But if you compare directly with higher-quality devices, then all the problems will be quite noticeable.  Brightness has a minimum level that users like, but the maximum is too low to work on a sunny day.  The picture will quickly lose saturation.  In the settings, you can easily adjust the color temperature, but this does not give the owner any particular benefits.  Because when using this option, the colors are greatly distorted.  Reviews of the Meizu M5c (16 GB) confirm this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The warmer the picture is made, the more the black color becomes like a gray-brown.  If you use a cold tint, the screen will have a blue tint range.  It should be noted that the display does not correspond to the level of many budget devices; in most Chinese companies they create better products.  However, when compared with well-known brands that still use TN matrices, this phone is clearly a leader. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 16gb review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2097698.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  With regard to performance, the description of the Meizu M5c (2 GB / 16 GB) makes it clear that the phone runs on a 4-core processor.  There is 2 GB of RAM, which allows you to play slightly resource-intensive projects.  It should be noted that even ‚ÄúAsphalt 8‚Äù will produce only 16 frames per second.  If you use the minimum graphics settings, then this figure rises to 25 frames per second.  However, the screen quality is still not happy.  Moreover, in 5 minutes of playing any application, the phone heats up very much. </p><p>  The smartphone works slowly, and applications can sometimes slow down, but there are no ardent and very noticeable problems.  Easy casual games will go fine, the shell does not lose frames, sometimes jerks can occur during long lists, if the scrolling is too fast.  The overall speed of the phone is high, but not annoying.  Many people like multitasking; up to six programs are stored in the device‚Äôs memory.  It should be noted that the phone is not designed for some overloaded use of gaming applications, but the smartphone will do just fine with simple tasks.  You also need to notice autonomy.  She is at a high level.  We will consider it further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 16gb specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2097699.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Battery capacity is 3000 mAh.  If you take into account the stuffing that is installed on the phone, then with average loads this indicator is quite enough for more than a day of battery life.  If the user is undemanding, then using the phone only in critical situations, he can count on two full days of work.  The device lasts about 28 hours with: 4 hours of the active screen, using the Telegram application, mailboxes, Twitter client, text editor, notes, Google delayed reading, banking utility in the background.  In this case, the user can view up to 20 minutes of video on YouTube, play 30 minutes.  undemanding games, as well as an hour to listen to music.  The manual for Meizu M5c (2GB / 16GB) has more detailed data on the percentage of battery consumption. </p><h2>  Charge time </h2><p>  The kit comes with a charger, which is designed for 1.5 amperes.  The phone is charged in half an hour from 1% to 21%, reaches 42% in 1 hour, and in 2 it reaches the mark of 83%.  In fact, the device charges in 2 hours and 30 minutes.  MicroUSB connector.  Buyers did not upset the time of the smartphone and the charge speed, but this device did not stand out with something extraordinary compared to other competing devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 16gb black" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2097700.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera of the smartphone works with an 8 megapixel sensor.  Users note the only strength of the device: thanks to soft algorithms, a picture with focus gets a good structure as a result.  The device has a small dynamic range.  The focus works with noticeable malfunctions, but this is very noticeable only when shooting an object at a distance of less than 2 m. </p><p>  Creating frames is a rather slow process.  Color rendering is very poor.  If the frame has a large number of warm and light shades, then the picture will be pale.  With saturated colors, they are excessively emphasized in the frame.  The main transitions between the shades are too sharp. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  <span>The characteristics of the Meizu M5c</span> (16 GB) are no worse than any other device that costs up to 6 thousand rubles.  However, you need to understand that this device will hardly be enough to obtain a high-quality photo frame.  Therefore, storage on physical media and making artistic photography should be forgotten.  The external speaker is quite loud.  Even in noisy establishments such as McDonald‚Äôs, words on the video will be perfectly understood.  There are no overloads at maximum ranges, but it should be noted that the sound is flat.  There is no bass, and treble is distorted too much.  Even with disadvantages, the sound of this device is at a good level.  In headphones, playback quality is the most common, but quiet.  In public transport, one can hardly make out the words of even familiar and beloved compositions.  It should be noted that this Meizu M5c tablet will not replace.  However, he copes with the player‚Äôs role not so badly.  If you take into account other advantages, this device is quite good. </p>

    <h2>  Communications, additional features </h2><p>  This phone has the mBack key, which is responsible for returning to the ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù if you touch it, if you press, and if you click and hold, the device will lock.  The camera is called using a double tap.  The functionality is the same as with any device that works with mTouch.  However, the fingerprint scanner is missing.  Unlike many expensive models, this device supports a memory card slot, the capacity is not more than 128 GB. </p><p>  The most attractive for buyers, judging by the reviews of the Meizu M5c (16 GB), was that this device works on a new proprietary shell.  It is called Flyme 6. It does not particularly stand out against the background of additional features, as it is based on the Android 6.0 operating system.  What does the buyer get?  A standard set that has a nice feature: a built-in compass, pedometer.  This is enough to consider this device a quality state employee. </p><p>  The radio module, unfortunately, is only one, if we talk about SIM cards.  The stability of the work pleased.  If we talk about Wi-Fi, then the range is much smaller than in Xiaomi Redmi 4A, which is comparable in cost to the described device.  This is written in the reviews of Meizu M5c (16 GB).  GPS is pretty fast, the compass is great.  However, it shows the correct direction only if you stand still and wait about 5 seconds.  The cell module is satisfactory, the voice is transmitted cleanly and clearly.  The strength of the reception, unfortunately, is poor, but the contact is stable. </p><h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  Phone Meizu M5c (16 GB) for sale in gold, black, red, blue, pink case.  However, there is only one modification.  The phone is offered to users with 2 GB and 16 GB of memory.  The cost of the device is about 5 thousand rubles.  The main rival can be called Xiaomi Redmi 4A.  It has the same size and screen resolution.  However, color reproduction and contrast are much better.  One of the main reasons to pay attention to this device is the Snapdragon chipset, which is great for light games.  At the same time, autonomy is 40% better.  The cost is about the same.  Modifications with 2-3 GB of memory are offered. </p><p>  Another more popular competitor of this device is the <span>Samsung Galaxy J1,</span> released in 2016.  In official retail, the cost of the described device and this one is the same.  For this money, the buyer receives a 4.5-inch screen, its type is Super AMOLED.  The resolution is slightly less than in the described device, RAM - 1 GB, permanent - 8 GB.  The battery has a capacity of 2050 mAh.  Operating System - Android 5.1 Lollipop.  The only reason you should choose this phone is just the brand. </p><p>  Consider another competitor - from Meizu.  The M5 version is considered more advanced, there is a fingerprint scanner, a 2D glass is installed, and the screen is slightly larger.  This smartphone is better in all characteristics, however, unpleasant situations with firmware may occur.  Now all the awkwardness is fixed.  Previously, the firmware had a bad effect on autonomy, but now international software allows you to work at 25 hours of standby time, with the display on for 4-5 hours. The cost is slightly higher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m5c 2gb 16gb instruction" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2097702.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  This <span>Meizu</span> M5c <span>phone</span> (16 GB) with a black case is quite popular.  It has become the simplest of the entire assortment line, which is expressed not only in cost, but also in the implementation itself.  It should be noted the absence of a fingerprint scanner and the type of display matrix.  However, these shortcomings can be noticed only if the user is advanced.  The camera is bad, the filling is weak.  This, of course, does not seem to the buyer good characteristics.  In addition, in more expensive models, these functions are much better.  Also, the processor will be weak for demanding games.  The shell works fine, so you should not find fault with choosing a processor. </p><p>  If you want good autonomy, you can buy a device with the same firmware, but weak in the characteristics of the filling.  Autonomy will be much better.  Given that the price of the described phone is 20-30% less than that of more popular models of the same line, this phone seems interesting.  Especially if you take into account that the device is convenient as a dialer and has good basic functionality.  Perfect for the student, the appearance will attract.  The design is a bit like a Doogee X5 Max phone.  The difference between the two is that the described device will not look awkward. </p><p>  Buyers note that the phone looks great, works at a good speed, you can go online, play games, play music, take pictures, and work with documents.  Pleased with the software.  In the price segment of mobile devices up to 6 thousand rubles, this device can be called one of the best.  The only real competitor should be considered Redmi 4A, which can be purchased at a lower price.  <span>A review of the Meizu M5c</span> (16 GB) will allow you to make a choice. </p>
