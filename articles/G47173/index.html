Vassal dependence on the Golden Horde (the so-called eastern part of the vast <span>Mongol empire)</span> was observed until the 15th century.  Just then, in 1480, an event takes place, which in history is called Standing on the Ugra River.  Vassal dependence gave rise to many myths and legends about the relationship between Russia and the Mongols.  We‚Äôll try to figure it out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vassal dependence" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541331.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is the Mongol yoke? </h2><p>  Igo is the relationship between conquerors and the vanquished.  It manifested itself in the following points: </p><ul><li>  Political dependence of Russian princes.  Without Mongol approval, a label, it was impossible to reign. </li><li>  Economic dependence.  Russia had to pay tribute. </li><li>  Military addiction.  Russia was to send soldiers for the Mongolian troops. </li></ul><p>  From the first lines it seems that there are some disadvantages depending.  But is it? </p><h2>  Attitude to Russia: myths and reality </h2><p>  Today there are many myths that vassal dependence on the Horde is a real tragedy for Russian history.  The Mongols stopped our development, did not allow us to follow the civilizational path, the country was in ruin, people were starving, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vassal dependence on the golden horde" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541328.jpg" width="542"></div>  However, historical sources make us understand the following:

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The Mongols preserved the local dynasties, did not interfere in their lives. </li><li>  They monitored the population.  Censuses were constantly carried out, since the "exit", that is, the tax, depended on it.  This speaks of progressive, poll, fair taxation in the 13th century.  Only Peter the Great through complex reforms was able to repeat this in the 18th century.  Naturally, they did not allow population decline.  The Mongols themselves did not touch anyone and did not allow the local dynasties to do this. </li><li>  Relationships were transparent, stable.  The so-called ‚Äúyoke,‚Äù that is, the vassal dependence of Russia, was not accompanied by mass terror, murder, and robbery. </li><li>  The Mongols did not change the beliefs of the conquered peoples.  Despite the fact that they themselves adopted Islam as the state religion, there is not a single mention of the imposition of this religion on the part of the ‚Äúmasters‚Äù.  On the contrary, the Mongols exempted the church from all taxes, including tithing.  Monasteries grew rich during this period.  After the Mongols, ‚Äútrue Orthodox‚Äù princes robbed them several times, pursuing a policy of secularization. </li></ol><p>  Hence the conclusion: the Mongol yoke was a negative phenomenon for the princely elite.  It was quite suitable for ordinary people, for it protected from attacks, ruin, civil strife. </p><h2>  Was there arbitrariness? </h2><p>  Indeed, the "exit" to the Horde totaled 14 names of tribute.  However, it was built in such a way that a simple person understood everything.  There was no difference to whom to pay - the Mongols or the princes.  But some of the latter could not put up with this.  The greed of local rulers sometimes had no boundaries, they arbitrarily increased tribute, hiding behind the "arbitrariness of the Mongols." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vassal dependence" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541329.jpg" width="247"></div>  But this was not the case everywhere.  A vivid example of this is the Principality of Moscow.  It was here that the local princes from the Nevsky dynasty did everything for their land in order to rise above the rest.  They had the ‚Äúway out‚Äù the same as the rest of the regions, but did not rob their people with additional requisitions.  This allowed to lure almost all the boyars of Ryazan.  Thus, vassal dependence allowed the redistribution of political influence within the Old Russian state.

Everyone believed that it was he who should pay tribute to the conquered peoples.  In 1380, Moscow supported the true khan.  Having gathered all his strength, including the warriors from Lithuania and Genoa, Prince Dmitry went on a campaign against Mamaia.  The battle of Kulikovo ended in favor of the Russians.  After that, Moscow believed that Tokhtamysh now owed it to her.  You can not pay tribute.  However, the latter reminded Dmitry <span>what vassal</span> dependence of Russia on the Horde is.  He requested a tax for all unpaid years.  After the refusal in 1382, the khan walked across Russia with fire and sword.  After these events, after Kulikov Field it is not customary to talk a lot.

    <h2>  The collapse of the Golden Horde: vassal dependence goes down in history </h2><p>  By the end of the 15th century, the following events occur: </p><ul><li>  The Golden Horde breaks up into small principalities: Kazan, Astrakhan, Crimean, <span>Siberian Khanate,</span> Nogai Horde.  Everyone considers himself the successor of the Golden Horde and demands a tribute from Russia. </li><li>  The Principality of Moscow, on the contrary, is consolidating all its forces around itself, including Novgorod.  Ivan III himself also considers himself the successor of the Horde, since the Moscow dynasty has long been related to the Mongol khans. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vassal dependence of Russia on the horde" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541330.jpg" width="590"></div></li></ul><h2>  Was there no yoke? </h2><p>  In historical science, there is an alternative point of view on this issue of two famous academicians in the field of mathematics - Z. Fomenko and V. Nosovsky.  They claim in their theory that Russia was not a vassal of the Mongols, they give many arguments.  There was an allied relationship between her and the Horde.  Russia paid tribute, and in return received protection.  By analogy with businesses that pay peace of mind to private security agencies.  Thus, it is not necessary to erroneously substitute the concepts of ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù and ‚Äúyoke‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vassal dependence" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1541332.jpg" width="507"></div>  In the first case, indeed, Batu ruined many cities.  In the second, the relationship was quite peaceful.  Even anti-Horde performances were suppressed by Russian princes, not khans.  One of them is the suppression of Tver by Alexander Nevsky.
