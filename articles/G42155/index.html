However, there are tasks that conventional multifunction printers cannot handle.  This applies to high quality large format printing.  With a detailed reflection of graphs, charts, drawings and diagrams on paper, a laser plotter is best suited, widely represented in the market of professional printing equipment in various variations. </p><h2>  Purpose of the plotter </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.itinstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Laser Cutting Printer" class="if uuid-2266784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2266784.jpg"></div><p>  The main objective of this equipment is to print structural information.  Depending on the scope and specific requirements, plotters of various types can be used.  For example, tablet models are used to work with the formats A3 and A2.  They allow you to fix the sheets by the electrostatic method with the connection of a recording unit.  If printing on canvases A1 and A0 is required, then roller devices with a drawing head are used.  An important feature of the plotter is the cutting function.  It is implemented by a cutter - a cutting tool that allows you to process small elements with a high degree of accuracy. </p><p>  As a rule, a <span>laser cutting</span> plotter is provided with optical sensors controlling contour <span>cutting</span> .  The difference in cutting approaches is expressed in the degree of automation of the equipment.  Thus, budget models process elements only in manual mode, and high-tech devices can also be adjusted to program parameters, which saves the operator from monitoring the operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment specifications </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.integrit.com.pe" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HP Cutting Plotter" class="if uuid-2266799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2266799.jpg"></div><p>  Operating parameters can vary both in terms of the processing format of the target material, and in functionality.  The average operational characteristics of a laser plotter can be represented as follows: </p><ul><li>  The sheet format is A0-A4. </li><li>  Cutter pressure - 200-350 g. </li><li>  Cutting width - 210-300 mm. </li><li>  Cutting length - 2900-3000 mm. </li><li>  Processing speed - up to 1000 mm / s. </li></ul><p>  As for the functionality, modern models are provided with USB and Wi-Fi interfaces, which allow connecting printing equipment with computers and even mobile devices.  In particular, the HP plotter by Designjet T520 supports USB, Wi-Fi and LAN.  In addition, 1 GB memory makes it possible to store the necessary information without the use of additional media.  Communication capabilities are also extensive.  Using wireless channels, the device is synchronized with a PC, tablet and smartphone. </p><h2>  Teriostar Models </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.newfaxcorp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plotter Teriostar" class="if uuid-2266792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2266792.jpg"></div><p>  The series is represented by the manufacturer Seico, who has formed a number of professional engineering plotters.  One of the most popular models of the family is the Teriostar LP-1030 - a device that provides operational processing of technical documentation at high speeds up to 5 m / min.  In particular, the A1 format is served at a frequency of 7 sheets per minute.  Thanks to the optimized ink supply system, the operator eliminates the need for manual powder loading - the design uses flanged roll feeders, which are distinguished by accuracy and correct operation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is important to emphasize that the Teriostar line includes not just printer-cutters, but LED-plotters, that is, scanning devices.  Third-party information can be downloaded via Ethernet channels and logical ports.  Available and batch printing, managed by network controllers. </p><h2>  HP models </h2><div class="photo" data-original="eboutique.diatraceboutique.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HP Plotter" class="if uuid-2266789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2266789.jpg"></div><p>  This manufacturer is famous for its high-quality and functional MFPs, which are successfully used in the professional field and in everyday life.  The line of plotters is represented by DesignJet devices, the most technologically advanced of which are the HP T1530.  This is an inkjet printer-cutter serving sheets up to 914 mm wide.  But the main advantage of the laser plotter of this modification is its high performance.  The operator can set jobs for the 50-page roll tray.  Moreover, even high loading does not reduce the leveling accuracy and sorting of materials. </p><p>  The equipment also has a high virtual memory capacity of 96 GB.  Even in the conditions of high-speed printing (21 sec / page), stable queue management is realized at the optimum printing cost.  The HP T1530 plotter outperforms its competitors due to its versatility in relation to the type of paper.  It can be used in working with technical, photographic, copy and other popular types of print media. </p><h2>  Models from Roland </h2><p>  If the function of the cutter is important in the operation of the plotter, then you should focus on Roland products.  The GS-24, in particular, is equipped with a high pressure cutting carriage.  The knife efficiently processes thick and hard materials, including film, flock and vinyl.  In addition to the batch cutting function, this model performs punching with a selection of color tasks.  It also offers the option of creating clippings for the established labels.  High-tech Roland Laser Plotter equipment is also provided with an innovative servo motor with increased processing speed.  This is important for large printing companies, where the stake is not so much on accuracy as on productivity. </p><p>  In addition to the advantages of machining, these plotters are distinguished by modern software.  The developers have provided a special CutStudio package, thanks to which the operator can move, enlarge and rotate objects without a computer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.serigraphie-boutique.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plotter Roland" class="if uuid-2266791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2266791.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Plotters marked a new era in the development of the printing industry.  They organically combined the characteristics of industrial apparatus for large format printing and the dignity of home multifunction printers with user-friendly interfaces and the convenience of physical handling.  But technologically advanced laser plotters are not cheap, so you should carefully evaluate their capabilities before buying.  Chinese devices with limited functionality can cost 8-10 thousand rubles, but the devices of the above companies are already available for 15-20 thousand rubles.  Accordingly, this equipment is strictly suitable for commercial tasks.  However, the optimization of the technical "filling" and balanced performance make it possible to bring this segment closer to the household class. </p>
