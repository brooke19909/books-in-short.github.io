    <h2>  Guest reviews about meals </h2><p>  Almost all of our compatriots who visited the Royal Palace Helena Park 5 * (Bulgaria) very well respond to the level of food in this hotel.  So, according to them, guests are offered a large selection of well-prepared dishes.  At the same time, the buffet always had hot dishes from both meat and fish and seafood.  You can also try cold snacks and salads (often they add seafood).  Many guests liked the local cheeses and <span>cold cuts</span> very much <span>.</span>  In addition, there was always plenty of fresh fruits and berries at guests' disposal.  For lunch and dinner in the main restaurant you can get several types of ice cream.  A big plus for family tourists was the fact that the menu always had cereals (semolina, buckwheat, rice), delicious soups and much more.  So there was always something to feed the children.  The only minor drawback was considered by some to be not very tasty coffee from vending machines in the restaurant.  However, for an additional fee, you always have the opportunity to order good coffee. </p><p>  In addition to the main restaurant, you can have lunch and a snack during the day on the platform near the pool.  But the choice of dishes is not so wide.  However, themed dinners (Mediterranean, Bulgarian and barbecue) are held here three times a week.  Experienced travelers recommend visiting them. </p>

    <h2>  The opinion of guests about a beach holiday </h2><p>  Tourists resting in the Royal Palace Helena <span>Park 5 * (Sunny Beach),</span> claim that the hotel's own beach is really only 50 meters away.  Free sunbeds are almost always there.  However, loungers on the first line, as a rule, guests occupy in the morning.  The beach is sandy.  At the entrance to the sea there is a pebble strip one or two meters wide, then there is again a sandy bottom.  There is a beach area with paid sunbeds.  Some tourists preferred to relax on it, since there are fewer people and a completely sandy entry into the water.  As for <span>beach towels,</span> you will find them in your room upon check-in.  You can change them for clean during the day in a special kiosk near the pool. </p>
