Krakow knows a lot about the tandem of these two characteristics.  Poland is a country where tourism has reached a whole new level in recent years. </p><h2>  The birth of an unusual legend </h2><p>  The first mention of the city dates back to 966.  Then the point was described as a successful shopping center under the rule of the Czechs.  Later, these territories passed under the leadership of the Polish princes.  In the course of further events, Casimir the Great moved his capital to Krakow. </p>

    <p>  The village began to actively grow and develop.  During this period, dozens of interesting myths appeared about its origin.  It was then that a famous legend was born about how Krakow was founded.  The city, according to the annals, was terrorized by a terrible dragon who lived in a cave. </p><p>  At that time, the land was owned by Prince Krak (the name of the city came from his name).  The ruler had two sons and a beautiful daughter.  According to one version, the king sent his children to the monster.  For a long time the young men tried to defeat the dragon by force.  And only then they realized that success can only be achieved through wisdom.  Young princes stuffed a stuffed cow with poison.  The terrible serpent went hunting, swallowed the bait and suffocated.  But after the victory, the guys did not know how to share the glory, so the fight began.  Only one survived in the fight.  The son who returned lied that the other died from the clutches of a monster. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Three heroes of the same story </h2><p>  All <span>cities of Poland</span> are shrouded in multiple myths.  No exception and Krakow.  According to another version, young girls were sacrificed to the dragon.  When only the ruler‚Äôs daughter remained in the principality, the king announced that he would marry her to someone who would defeat the ferocious beast.  The trick was overcome by a snake cobbler named Skuba Dratevka.  He put sulfur in a stuffed animal, and when the dragon swallowed the poison, he felt a <span>burning sensation in his stomach.</span>  The serpent flew to the river and drank water until it burst.  Later, the young man sewed boots from the skin of a monster.  And Krak fulfilled his promise. </p><p>  There is a version according to which the king himself defeated the dragon. </p><p>  In any case, no matter who defeats the monster, still these legends continue to live.  Power contributes to the preservation of the culture of its people. </p>

    <h2>  Mounds of Princes </h2><p>  There is another story about the daughter of the prince.  They wanted the girl to be forcibly married to an unloved man.  In order not to be captured, the little lady threw herself into the river. </p><p>  Museums of Krakow do not tell about these legends.  But on the outskirts there are two artificial mounds, named after the king and his daughter Wanda.  The first is located in the New Hut area, the second - in the old city.  The date of construction of both mountains is not known exactly, but scholars suggest that the tomb of the king was built in 500.  The embankment for the young lady was built two or three centuries later at the place where her body was found. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Anyone who visits the Wanda mound on November 4 or February 2 will be able to observe an amazing picture.  The sun will set exactly above the mountain of the prince.  And if you stand on the grave of the ancient ruler on May 2 or August 10, then the star will come down from the embankment, which is the grave of his daughter. </p>

    <h2>  Pride of the country </h2><p>  Wawel Castle Complex is the architectural gem of the city.  It attracts thousands of visitors to Krakow annually.  Poland is still proud of this magnificent building. </p><p>  On this earth, people were built in the XI century.  Until 1300, a fortress was erected on the hill, and later King Casimir III rebuilt the fortifications and designed them in the Gothic style.  The city itself has been developing since the Polish state was proclaimed in the 10th century. </p><p>  Stagnation of progress began when the Commonwealth was created.  Therefore, the item was on the very edge of a large country.  The disadvantageous location led to the fact that the capital was moved to Warsaw.  Although for a long time the castle remained the residence of the rulers, yet numerous fires and barbaric attacks pushed it into the background. </p><p>  But, starting in 1900, the complex began to be restored.  Today, all tours in Krakow offer to visit an amazing architectural landmark. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Land of National Heroes </h2><p>  Wawel can tell a lot of interesting and useful information.  A statue of the national hero Tadeusz Kosciuszko greets visitors.  It is worth noting that the monument is a copy.  The original was destroyed by the Germans during World War II.  Restored the pedestal in 1960.  Many researchers note that the horseman is a copy of the original, but the horse changed color and became stout.  Interestingly, the same monument was installed in Denver, USA.  The fact is that Kosciuszko participated in the War of State Independence. </p>

    <p>  As previously noted, Wawel was known for 500 long years not only as the center of Krakow, but also as the <span>capital of Poland.</span>  That is why in this city there are concentrated a lot of objects worthy of tourist's attention. </p><p>  For many centuries, the castle remained the residence of rulers.  In it, not only the princes lived, but also died.  Famous figures of the country are buried here.  Among them is President <span>Lech Kaczynski</span> with his wife Maria, who tragically died in a plane crash near Smolensk on April 10, 2010.  The resting place was the cathedral of the Cracow Fortress, which is located near the grave of <span>Jozef Pilsudski, a</span> Polish statesman.  Their sarcophagus was covered with a stone slab weighing 400 kilograms, on which the names of the president and his wife are carved, as well as a cross.  A special memorial plaque is installed nearby. </p><h2>  Dragon tradition </h2><p>  Residents of Krakow still keep their legends.  Therefore, bones hang in front of the temple entrance.  Today it is known - this is the skeleton of a mammoth.  But for a long time people believed that these were the remains of a dragon.  In fact, in ancient times on this earth they believed that such a talisman would bring peace and prosperity.  Other cities of Poland have such symbolic talismans. </p><p>  The cycle of legends about the evil serpent continues the cave, which is also located on the territory of the Wawel Castle.  According to legend, it was in her that a terrible monster lived.  For a while, the large hall in the dungeon was known as the inn for the rich.  Later, all the entrances to it were walled up.  But after independence, this corner again began to fulfill its main role - to amaze visitors. </p><p>  Favorite place of pilgrimage for tourists was Chervensky Boulevard, lying under the walls of the fortress.  There is a monument to the dragon.  The monument spews flames every five minutes.  The author of the work is Bronislav Khromy.  Interestingly, you can call fire using an SMS message to a specific number with the text smok. </p>

    <h2>  Marvel of architecture </h2><p>  Many are surprised by the city.  It housed 25 monasteries, 7 synagogues and many chapels.  In a separate row should be placed the churches of Krakow.  There are about 40 of them. Each is worthy of tourist's attention.  But the visiting card has long been the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p><p>  The first stone of this building was laid back in the 1200s.  Several times the temple was engulfed in flames, destroyed by enemy troops and even an earthquake.  But the shrine was rebuilt more and more luxuriously.  The church got its modern look at the end of the 14th century. </p><p>  A characteristic feature of the structure are towers of different sizes.  So far, it has not been possible to establish what this planning is associated with.  This architectural nuance explains the local story.  According to legend, two brothers built towers.  When one noticed that the second is doing the job faster, he killed him.  Subsequently, unable to bear the remorse, the murderer rushed from the roof to the ground and crashed. </p><p>  The appearance of the church is not the only thing that Krakow can offer.  Poland has always cared for spiritual development, so the interior of the temple is also impressive.  The highlight was the Altar of Vita Stvo≈°, which combines Gothic and Renaissance. </p>

    <h2>  Fresh ideas </h2><p>  Museums of the city received special status.  On this territory there are more than twenty.  Each of them is interesting and unique.  Their main advantage is a departure from harsh rules. </p><p>  The Jewish Museum "Galicia" is extraordinary.  There, visitors can not only learn about the culture of this people, but also listen to the concerts that are often held within these walls. </p><p>  The exhibits of the Gallery of Modern Art amaze guests.  Exhibitions of the last twenty years, educational programs, scientific publications, a library and a bookstore are all that Krakow has to offer.  Poland took an active part in the creation and opening of this institution.  Today it presents the best examples of the latest trends. </p><p>  An outstanding place is the <span>home of Japanese</span> art and technology Manggha.  His main task is not just to talk about the life of a distant country, but also to organize master classes, give lectures and organize courses on the study of art. </p><p>  It is in this city that the world-famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci "The Lady with an Ermine" is located.  The Czartoryski Museum has the honor of representing a masterpiece. </p><h2>  City of myths </h2><p>  Guests are attracted by the prices of accommodation, cheap, delicious food and a rich entertainment program.

    <p>  In addition to numerous churches and museums, tourists are offered modern entertainment.  Everyone who comes to the city can visit bars, clubs, restaurants and even a water park.  Krakow is the cultural capital of Europe.  About 2 million foreign tourists come here annually. </p><p>  Almost every monument is shrouded in an interesting and extraordinary legend.  Although many skeptics say that all these myths were invented for children, all the same with them city tours are much more interesting. </p><p>  However, so far Krakow is not so spoiled by tourists as some other European capitals, so it has retained its inherent energy and beauty. </p>
