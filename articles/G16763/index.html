Officially, the time and place of the writer's funeral were announced at the very last moment: the friends of Alexander Sergeyevich recalled that during his lifetime he expressed a desire to be buried in the Pskov province. </p><p>  The body was escorted under strict supervision, but without great honors: the tsarist authorities were afraid of holding public demonstrations.  The coffin of the poet was taken out of St. Petersburg, accompanied by an officer of the gendarmes and secretly.  Only his close friend A. I. Turgenev succeeded in leading Pushkin to the last journey.  In his diaries, they later found an entry dated February 2, which says that he was appointed as an escort for a late friend.  However, he did not know the direction and final point of the "procession" movement.  Turgenev was informed of the destination only a few hours before departure.  He wrote to his sister that he had left the stable monastery on February 2, he had to sit in the wagon with the postman, a little behind the body, while the gendarme captain was sitting in front.  The friend of the murdered man also tells in this letter that Uncle Pushkin with great difficulty accompanied him on his last journey, standing on the drogues and following the coffin to the grave.  The poet‚Äôs friend didn‚Äôt lie, the poet‚Äôs uncle Nikita Kozlov was genuinely shocked by what had happened and did not want to let his nephew go so easily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There were plenty of tears and grief in Mikhailovsky itself, because only a few months ago, in April 1836, the funeral of Pushkin's mother N.O. Pushkina was held here.  Alexander Sergeyevich immediately bought himself a place near the grave of his mother. </p><h2>  In memory of the great poet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-309781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17474/309781.jpg?1563478796"></div><p>  The poet was buried near Mikhailovsky.  It was a frosty February morning, and Pushkin‚Äôs grave was almost bare, with only a wooden cross.  Only a few years later his wife, Natalya Nikolaevna, erected a marble obelisk here.  The monument was erected on the grave in 1840.  Most likely, in the same year a crypt was built, where the remains of Pushkin and his mother are stored.  Pushkin‚Äôs grave remains modest and not too pathos.  A strict monument on three slabs of granite has an arched type of niche, where a marble urn stands.  Crossed torches are visible above the niche; a <span>laurel wreath</span> is located above <span>.</span> </p><p>  A posthumous inscription is carved on the obelisk, where the name, surname, middle name and years of the poet's life are indicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-309789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17474/309789.jpg?1563478796"></div><p>  The place where the grave of Pushkin is located (her photo is presented in the article) is saturated with an atmosphere of solemnity and lyricism.  Admirers of Pushkin‚Äôs immortal talent flock here from all over the world to honor the memory of the famous Russian writer and poet.  But to a particular degree this awe and awe can be felt on the day of the All-Union Pushkin holiday, which is regularly held in the reserve. </p>
