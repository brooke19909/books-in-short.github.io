The archaeological museum is located in the Garden of St. Philip Nerry.  The beauty of the garden is amazing.  This is a combination of natural beauty and that created by the hands of people.  A walk in the garden can also be a kind of excursion that will help to understand Spain.

    <p>  The museum was created back in 1871.  Then it was located in another building, which easily fit the entire small collection.  The visitors were offered ethnographic exhibits, objects found by archaeologists, works of decorative art and collections that could interest numismatists.  But a very small amount of time passed, and the collection began to grow rapidly. </p><p>  Spain was able to buy some of the exhibits, others were found during excavations throughout the country, but a large number of exhibits and collections were donated by philanthropists. </p><p>  As soon as the number of museum exhibits grew, a new building was needed.  And then a beautiful building was proposed on Serrano Street.  This building houses the Cuenca Archaeological Museum to this day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Museum Architecture </h2><p>  First of all, visitors to the museum are admired by two chimeras, who are importantly seated on the sides of a wide staircase.  In addition to them, the museum building attracts Doric columns and chicly decorated balconies.  All this emphasizes the neoclassical style in which the building is made. </p><p>  The Archaeological Museum of Cuenca is a huge quadrangle with an area in front of it.  On this square, tourists love to take photos.  Often here you can see the newlyweds.  The museum has courtyards that amaze with its luxury. </p><p>  The exhibition area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe museum is constantly increasing.  This building houses the Cuenca Archaeological Museum - on three floors.  But due to the constant increase in the number of exhibits that the creators of the museum want to show to tourists and residents of the city, more and more places are needed. </p><h2>  Other sights of Cuenca </h2>

Tourists are invited to look at the <span>Catholic cathedrals,</span> which now have become not only a place of worship of God, but also architectural monuments.  Of great interest are the ‚Äúhanging houses‚Äù.  They are built on the edge of a cliff.  And it seems that they are about to fall.  Previously, Spanish citizens lived in houses with such a dizzying view from the window, but now they are given over to <span>museums, restaurants,</span> cafes, souvenir shops and small galleries.  The view from the balcony of such a house is unforgettable.

    <p>  Many tourists are attracted by the monument to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, from the top of which you can enjoy the view of the city.  This place is considered perhaps the most romantic in the whole city.  It is here that tourists and residents of Cuenca make an offer to their soul mates.  And this is not surprising: such a view gives rise to only the best feelings in the human heart. </p><p>  Admiring the beauties of the city, you can not pass by a beautiful building made in the neoclassical style.  After all, it is in this building that the archaeological museum of Cuenca is located.  This is one of the main prides of not only the whole city, but also the country.  It is impossible to know its history unless you visit a museum that is capable of telling legends from past centuries. </p>
