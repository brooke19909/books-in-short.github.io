    <h2>  Alarm Overview </h2><p>  The system is based on programmable safety sensors, which are controlled through a central controller.  In a way, this is a combination of mechanical compact blockers that activate their function when commands come from the user.  The interaction of the signaling infrastructure with the host is built on a wireless basis.  Developers offer several communication channels, including GSM mobile communication, a radio module, an Internet service, etc. For example, special applications are offered for smartphones through which the Pandora 5000 alarm is monitored.  Reviews note the convenience of this management approach and a high degree of security in terms of unauthorized access to the option.  The processor itself, which acts as a signal processor from the sensors and the user himself, deserves special attention.  The manufacturer integrated a 32-bit ARM processor into the complex, which works with a CAN bus.  Also included is a RF communication module for organizing communication between function blocks, a GPS receiver and, perhaps, the most critical part - a blocking radio relay that prevents third parties from starting the engine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the modification New </h2><p>  The basic version is practically not used today, and the main complex is the modification of New.  The devices of this series are distinguished by the assembly of advanced modern components that were developed specifically for this model.  The anti-theft tags, the central control unit, both remote controls and the RF module underwent updating.  In terms of improving communication capabilities, the Pandora 5000 New alarm system also received the option of synchronizing with a smart watch and a GPS generation sensor NAV-04. </p>

    <p>  In practice, using the differences of the new version can be felt in the range of the key fob, the integrated display and advanced functionality for adjusting the interaction of control tools with the engine lock.  The developers have envisaged several configurations by which the launch of the power unit is implemented.  Thus, the Pandora 5000 New alarm system provides step protection with different levels of program access. </p><h2>  Modification Pro </h2><p>  This series also has several fundamental differences from the standard platform.  One of the improvements implemented in this system was the introduction of a module with a radio channel at 868 MHz.  The sensor provides reliable communication in conditions where it is not possible to broadcast commands over a GSM network.  At the same time, the Pandora 5000 Pro alarm system received more effective devices for filtering interference.  Usually, the weak point of wireless systems is considered to be the risk of exposure to jammers, which can interfere with the interaction between the individual components of the alarm system.  In this case, the filters form an ultra-narrow bandwidth of the signal at a frequency of 2.5 kHz, which minimizes the likelihood of third-party intrusion into the network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also implemented in a complex navigation modules GLONASS and GPS.  Sensors for communication with satellites have long been no wonder in car alarm systems, but in this case they provide increased accuracy in determining the coordinates of an object.  If you need to not only learn about the location of the machine, but also give a command to its electronics, then the Pandora 5000 alarm system will help in this matter.  The reviews indicate that even at long distances, where there is no reception of a GSM network, navigation systems help to get out of the situation without unnecessary efforts. </p>

    <h2>  Installation Requirements </h2><p>  The manufacturer recommends installation work when the device connectors are disconnected, and also after disconnecting the negative battery terminal.  Installation of the CAN bus is also implemented provided that the central <span>control unit of the</span> complex was initially disabled.  The wiring connections of the alarm components can be made both by twisting and by soldering.  But the second method can only be used with solder lead-tin base.  After this, thorough insulation is made with a special tape or heat-shrink tube, if there is a risk of aggressive impact on the contact place.  In order to eliminate the risk of damage to the wiring due to vibrations, the installation of the Pandora 5000 alarm system must allow a small margin margin in length.  But so that the weakened lines do not interfere with the operation of adjacent components. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Installation instructions for the central unit </h2><p>  The main unit is mounted directly to the body with rigid fixation.  In extreme cases, you can provide for mounting on parts that are securely coupled to the basic design of the car.  To ensure that the block case is not damaged, it will not be superfluous to provide shells with a damping effect - these can be refractory and heat-resistant linings and membranes.  Regardless of the selected configuration of placement and fixtures, the installation of the Pandora 5000 alarm system must be performed in compliance with the horizontal position of the controller.  This is important for the correct operation of the integrated accelerometer.  It is impossible to start operation of the unit if the antenna of the GSM module was not connected at this point.  If after installation there are unused conclusions, then they should be shortened, insulated and securely fastened.  The main thing is that during operation with fluctuations they do not come into contact with other wiring lines and the surface of the body. </p>

    <h2>  Installation of additional components </h2><p>  Car alarms work only in conjunction with the aforementioned cellular antenna and a blocking radio relay.  The antenna is a small receiver, which is fixed in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe windshield with the help of special accessories.  At the same time, it is forbidden to shield the device and give signals without preliminary settings.  Next, a radio relay is mounted - this component is directly responsible for the locking mechanics controlled by the Pandora 5000 New alarm system.  The instruction indicates that this unit is installed on a rigid basis, but it must not be hidden in wiring harnesses.  The distance between the relay and the RF communication module must also be observed.  This distance should be at least 3 m. </p><h2>  System Setup Instructions </h2><p>  After installation, you must configure the complex.  This operation can be performed either through a computer when connected to the central unit wirelessly, or through a key fob.  During the configuration, the user must specify the parameters for the interaction of control means with the controller and relay.  In particular, active synchronization key fobs are indicated, light indicators are assigned, parameters for arming and disarming are set, etc. Sensors with which the Pandora 5000 alarm will interact will be separately regulated.  The instruction instructs to initially establish the optimal level of their sensitivity to shock.  By the way, more modern versions of the detectors allow you to separately configure the parameters of perception to external influences specifically for specific coverage areas. </p><h2>  Instructions for use of the complex </h2>

    <p>  The complexity of managing the system in practice depends on how correctly the settings were made.  To facilitate the preparation of the software for operation, it is recommended that the first time use one of the proposed automatic modes.  In the future, the user will be able to control the functions of the complex only with the help of security tags, a key fob or a smartphone synchronized with a relay.  Again, the possibilities of working with the listed means of communication are determined by the set of devices with which the Pandora 5000 alarm was synchronized even at the setup stage.  The operating manual also without fail recommends a responsible approach to the adjustment of emergency operation systems.  For example, this can be the assignment of individual buttons of the key fob to the mode of enhanced protection of the function, which will be activated when they are held for a certain time interval - for example, 3-5 seconds. </p><h2>  Positive Alarm Feedback </h2>

    <p>  The complex has many advantages, which are noted by both experts and ordinary motorists.  Indisputable advantages of this system include wide functionality, reliability of components, modern communication capabilities and rich equipment.  As for the efficiency of the system in practice, there are practically no negative responses in this part.  Even under conditions of experimental exposure to interference, stability is noted with which the Pandora 5000 New alarm system continues to function.  Reviews also include the filtering function of radio noise to the positive side.  It is highly effective in providing a barrier to the wireless data systems that are present in other cars. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are few obvious flaws in the alarm system when compared with alternative offers from competitors.  Nevertheless, inexperienced drivers indicate the complexity of controlling the functions of the complex.  Many note the high cost at which the Pandora 5000 car alarm is implemented.  Reviews note that for a lesser amount than 40-45 thousand rubles, it is quite possible to organize a no less effective, but easy to use anti-theft protection system. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The developers of the complex tried to offer the consumer a modern, ergonomic and multi-functional tool to ensure vehicle safety.  Moreover, the main emphasis was placed on the implementation of wireless interaction between the owner and the electronics.  Perhaps this part demonstrates the new stage of development at which the Pandora 5000 alarm appeared.  Reviews differently evaluate the abundance of new communication capabilities, but lovers of innovative solutions are quite happy with such innovations.  Here it can be noted that the same bundle of the central unit with a smartphone in itself is not so necessary taking into account the already considerable cost of signaling.  But it is possible that in 2-3 generations the same platform will open up fundamentally new and more useful features on this basis of wireless interaction. </p>
