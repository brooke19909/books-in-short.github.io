Thanks to the ability to stain the canvas, you can even embroider on dark fabrics.  Embroidery patterns on a black canvas are made with light threads, so that contrast is created and the elements are clearly visible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monochrome scheme" class="if uuid-3108290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3108290.jpg"></div><h2>  Popular Stories </h2><p>  On a black background, you can embroider not only monochrome light elements, but also create full-fledged paintings.  Craftswomen combine reflective with ordinary threads, so you can enjoy the story at night.  Popular on a dark background are floral motifs or landscape elements.  Tree branches, flowers, plant frames are combined with embroidered inscriptions. </p><p>  Monochrome works are popular for a long time.  Embroidery patterns on a black canvas can be of different sizes, starting with small elements and ending with a full-fledged picture.  Male and female images are also applied.  With the help of several light shades on a dark canvas, you can transfer a full-fledged image, focusing on the facial features. </p><p>  Due to the contrast and clarity, cross stitch patterns on a black canvas are popular among both domestic and foreign consumers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dmc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fruit pattern of initial complexity" class="if uuid-3108323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3108323.jpg"></div><h2>  Create metrics </h2><p>  Embroidery of plots with babies is popular and in demand, because together with a beautiful plot you can combine inscriptions and date of birth.  Metrics are performed on the canvas of the author's color, dark tones are also popular because they add a small picture of clarity and enhance the brightness of the threads. </p><p>  The baby's embroidery patterns on a black canvas can be of different sizes and complexity.  For a dark foundation, it is better to select simple plots so as not to be mistaken in the process.  On black material, details are better visible than on a light background, so some contours can not be outlined.  Metrics allow you to combine important information with a beautiful picture or create your own story using copyright schemes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imagui.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="child metric" class="if uuid-3110608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3110608.jpg"></div><h2>  Character Image </h2><p>  In addition to various plots and small paintings, charms and symbols of a geometric type can also be applied to a dark base.  Each nation has its own attributes in embroidery and distinctive features. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Slavs like to carry out protective elements together with ordinary plots, thus conveying magical overtones and energetic message.  For women, amulets are embroidered with red bright threads, you can add yellow shades or dark green crosses.  These colors imply vital energy and strength, a desire to develop and give a continuation of life. </p><p>  For men, talismans are embroidered with dark threads, but on a black background they may not be visible.  Therefore, the standard white color is used in combination with red, which for a representative of the stronger sex symbolizes power and might.  Cross stitch patterns on a black canvas can combine not only plots, but also symbolic elements, due to which the paintings will be varied and interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="curiosacoruja.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns of embroidery of flowers on a black canvas" class="if uuid-3110624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3110624.jpg"></div><h2>  Magical overtones </h2><p>  Embroidery is considered not only a kind of needlework, but also has a hidden meaning, therefore, it can attract not only positive emotions, but also new people.  For example, paired stories (man and woman, animals or repeating characters) can attract a soul mate into the life of a lonely embroiderer or give love. </p><p>  Although there is not much difference on which background to perform, light or dark, but the last basis is more popular, since the combination of a black base and light threads is filled with magical power in a certain period.  So, needlework on the growing moon can bring success and fulfillment of desires. </p><p>  For those craftswomen who wanted to get a solution to the issue in housing topics, embroidery of the contour of a house or a lighthouse is considered a way out, which promises a quick solution to the problem and getting what you want.  The embroidery pattern on the black canvas of a male or female amulet, made on the new moon, is considered a powerful defense against evil forces. </p><h2>  Flower symbolism </h2><p>  Embroidery of plants involves the presence of different shades and more often these are colored pictures, but against a dark background they look brighter and juicier, more voluminous and detailed.  To attract love to life, the craftswomen advise performing poppies or peonies, it is desirable that the buds be large and beautiful. </p><p>  If a woman wants to enhance the beauty and harmony with nature, to emphasize her inner world, then embroidery patterns on a black canvas with a picture of roses are used.  For a dark background, a picture of a white flower or several buds in different shades is ideal. </p><p>  To increase confidence and gain opportunities for self-realization, it is advised to embroider lilies of the valley or irises of violet tones.  When making bouquets, you need to pay attention to the combination of different shades of colors, so as not to harm yourself with the wrong selection. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  For a dark base, both cotton threads and thick woolen yarn are suitable.  The latter conveys well volume and adds splendor to details.  Some craftswomen combine cotton and wool threads to get an interesting picture.  But without the need, it is better not to do this, since the alternation of flat and convex crosses is not always beneficial. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple stories" class="if uuid-3108330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3108330.jpg"></div><p>  In <span>patterns of embroidering flowers</span> on a black canvas, it is better to use woolen threads so that the plot does not look flat.  As for the material, such a basis for embroidery is better than linen or homespun cloth of the same color.  It will be difficult for them to examine holes and work in the evening. </p><p>  To make mistakes on a black basis is much easier than on a normal light background, especially if the process is performed in dark shades.  Therefore, the craftswomen, in addition to the standard set of linen and threads, also recommend buying a special marker to draw squares for work and monitor the progress of work. </p>
