This Thai resort among vacationers has earned popularity for both convenient beaches and well-developed infrastructure.  The hotels here are built in fact, just a huge number.  Finding good housing for tourists on the island is not difficult.  For example, many Russian vacationers stay in Phuket in the Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * complex.  About the Anda Hotel, there are mostly only good reviews on the Web. </p><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  This center is located on an island in the town of Karon Beach.  Literally 500 meters from it there is a night market of this resort.  The coastline of the sea is located very close to the hotel.  At least, guests of Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * do not have to go to the beach for too long.  Phuket Airport is 45 km from this property.  Travelers arriving by plane can get to the hotel either by taxi, or simply by city budget transport or by transfer bus provided by the tour operator.  Phuket, the capital of the island, is approximately 25 km from the hotel. </p>

    <p>  According to many guests, in relation to the sea and the infrastructure of the city itself, this complex is located quite conveniently.  The only drawback in this regard, tourists believe that the hotel is located right next to a very busy road.  The noise from the street, of course, can prevent guests from resting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General description of the complex </h2><p>  The Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * (Phuket) was built in 2005.  By hotel standards, this, of course, has been around for quite some time.  However, the decoration in this complex, furniture and equipment are not at all old.  The fact is that in 2012 a large-scale reconstruction was carried out in the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel accepts guests in several multi-storey buildings of a modern building.  Unfortunately, she does not have her own territory.  Even the swimming pool <span>at Anda Beachside Hotel</span> 3 * is not located in the courtyard, but on the roof. </p>

    <h2>  Anda Beachside Hotel 3 *: hotel room reviews </h2><p>  The opinion about the rooms rented at this hotel was very good for its guests.  Especially comfortable rooms in this hotel are rented in the building in which the reception is located.  The maids at the hotel, unfortunately, are not cleaned too often.  However, in general, in terms of cleanliness, the apartments of the hotel look quite decent.  In any case, none of the infectious living creatures in the rooms was noticed by any of the guests.  The only thing in this hotel is sometimes found very biting ants.  However, there are not too many of them, and they do not deliver much concern to tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Showers in the hotel are not too spacious.  When washing, water may spill onto the toilet.  Subsequently, dampness is distributed throughout the number.  This, of course, can be attributed to certain disadvantages of the complex.  However, uncomfortable showers are a common misfortune of all Thai three-star hotels.  Those who want to take water procedures with comfort should consider renting rooms in the hotel a higher and more expensive class. </p><p>  Some rooms at this hotel have ocean views.  But since the buildings of the Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * hotel (Thailand, Karon, Phuket) are not too high, the sea landscapes, unfortunately, usually cover the trees a little. </p>

    <h2>  What do tourists think about the infrastructure at this hotel? </h2><p>  Reviews on the service provided by Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * <span>(Phuket, Thailand)</span> among tourists are both good and not very good.  Most tourists find this hotel still quite comfortable.  The pool in the hotel, for example, many guests find it very convenient.  It is located on the fifth floor of the main building.  Vacationers bathing in it, among other things, can admire the beautiful local surroundings.  The view of the ocean, at least judging by the reviews of tourists, from the pool opens simply magnificent. </p><p>  For some vacationers, it seems that personnel add too much bleach to the water.  But for many guests this does not cause almost any inconvenience.  Unfortunately there is no children's paddling pool in this hotel.  But the adult pool at the hotel is not too deep.  So children can swim here under the supervision of their parents. </p><p>  Mostly Russians live in this center.  Sometimes it even happens that there are no foreign tourists at all in addition to domestic holidaymakers.  The hotel staff praises most of the residents.  There are no traditional Thai smiles at the reception (perhaps the staff simply adapted to Russian traditions).  But any problems arising from the guests, the hotel workers are trying to solve as quickly and efficiently as possible. </p>

    <h2>  Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * (Phuket, Karon): food reviews </h2><p>  About the dining room of this hotel, as well as about its rooms, as well as infrastructure, there are both positive and negative reviews on the Web.  Some travelers believe that the food at this hotel is not bad.  Others hope that the hotel will try to diversify the menu in its restaurant.  Meals are served in the dining room of the center according to the buffet.  Hotel guests can only take eggs, toast, butter, noodles and drinks for breakfast.  There is no fruit in the hotel buffet.  Only sometimes watermelons are offered to residents. </p><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  Guests of the Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * can get to the sea in just a few minutes.  The closest Karon beach is across the road.  Reviews about him, like about most others in Phuket, there are only positive reviews on the Web.  Of course, this beach cannot be called paradise and secluded.  Nevertheless, it is a public part of the coastline belonging to the city.  But at least, since the width of the Karon is significant, there are never too many crowds here.  The length of this beach is also rather big.  In fact, it is the longest on the island of Phuket. </p><p>  Unfortunately, cleaning in this place on the shore is rare.  Therefore, in the sand you can sometimes notice cigarette butts and pieces of paper.  However, the infrastructure on the beach of the hotel is quite well developed.  If desired, hotel guests can rent sun loungers and umbrellas here, visit the shower room, have lunch or dinner in a coastal cafe.  The prices for dishes in public places on this beach are low.  The food here is served most often tasty and, of course, always fresh. </p><p>  Many travelers believe that relaxing on the beach, located opposite the hotel, is convenient including with children.  The sand here is small and soft, and the entrance to the sea is very gentle.  The water in the ocean in this place, like almost everywhere in Thailand, is very warm. </p><h2>  City infrastructure near the hotel </h2><p>  The Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * is located, as already mentioned, almost in the very center of the town.  Within walking distance from the hotel there are many shops, inexpensive cafes, luxury restaurants, clubs, massage parlors, etc. </p><p>  Hotel guests should definitely visit, for example, the Karon night market.  He works two days a week - on Thursday and on Tuesday - from 16:00 to 21:30.  If desired, residents of the center can purchase souvenirs, food, beach items and even traditional medicine.  Also, very cheap and tasty prepared traditional Thai dishes are sold in this market. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the Karon night market, near the Anda Beachside Hotel 3 * there is the famous Dino Park (2 km).  This large amusement park for hotel guests is certainly worth a visit with children.  Here you can, for example, look at life-size dinosaur sculptures, caves with live bats, an artificial volcano, etc. Adult tourists often visit this park in order to play mini-golf. </p><h2>  Available Attractions </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there is no tour desk at Anda Beachside Hotel 3 *.  Therefore, guests of this hotel buy trips to all sorts of interesting places in Phuket in the city.  You can, of course, if you wish to explore the sights of this resort on your own.  Near the hotel there are, for example, such interesting places as the Temple of Truth, the Wat Yan complex, Big Buddha, Pratamnak observation deck, etc. </p>
