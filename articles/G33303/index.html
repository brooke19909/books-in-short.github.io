Of course, most girls in one way or another encountered crochet and knitting in labor lessons in schools.  But to truly appreciate the merits of the most popular hobby is possible only in adulthood, when experience appears and the concept of style develops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles and rules for their use" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1381447.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Interestingly, the multimillion-dollar audience wielding sharp knitting needles, hooks, needles and other sharp-cutting objects rarely thinks that there <span>are safety rules</span> for crocheting. </p><h2>  Rules?  What for? </h2><p>  The main reason for developing safe knitting techniques was just the above-mentioned school lessons.  Especially for the training program, a list of what students should and should not do with the equipment issued to them was compiled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet safety for knitting" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1381444.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Basically, safety when crocheting and knitting is reduced to the fact that all the tools should be used for their intended purpose, do not poke anyone in the eye and do not test your and other people's skin for durability.  All rules correspond to elementary common sense. </p><h2>  Crochet &amp; Knitting Safety </h2><p>  In more detail about the content of safe knitting rules: </p><ol><li>  Knitting needles, hooks and needles should not be brought to the face. </li><li>  These items should be stored in appropriate pencil cases, cases, boxes and drawers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cover for knitting needles and hooks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1381448.jpg" width="375"></div></li><li>  If during the knitting process it will be necessary to work with a large number of needles, pins and knitting needles, they must be counted before and after knitting. </li><li>  Tools should not be sharpened too much, this may result in personal injury. </li><li>  Do not use objects that have rust.  In addition to health hazards (in the case of scratches), they can also ruin yarn or fabric. </li><li>  Safety precautions when working with a crochet hook include a clause on the disposal of broken needles and pins.  They need to be folded into a special container, packed in thick paper and taken out to a garbage container. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rules for handling needles" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1381446.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  If you want to chop the <span>knitted fabric with a</span> pin, it is pierced in three punctures.  Thus, the sharp edge will always be on the visible surface.  However, if they plan to try on a cleaved product, it is better to make sure that the tip of the pin is between two layers of the fabric. </li><li>  When working with scissors, they are always put in rings to themselves, and the blades are left closed.  If necessary, the scissors should be turned in rings to the receiver. </li></ol><h2>  What does “hygiene standards for knitters” mean? </h2><p>  Labor protection involves not only protecting people from damaging factors, but also creating comfortable and convenient conditions for the most productive activities.  In this aspect, safety measures for crocheting and other sharp objects include the following points: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Work should be in a place that is well lit.  In this case, the light source should be on the left side (or on the right, if the craftswoman is left-handed). </li><li>  The knitter’s posture should be straight (when reading this line, many will probably take a deep breath). </li><li>  So that the unfinished fabric does not get dirty, it is advisable to start knitting after the hands are washed.  After knitting, they also need to be washed so as not to transfer small fibers and pieces of yarn to the face or to food. </li></ul><h2>  Knitting and children </h2><p>  It is no secret that many fanatical knitters are “hooked” on this hobby precisely on maternity leave.  So, in order to protect yourself and your child, you need to carefully monitor that he does not have access to sharp tools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet and knitting safety" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1381443.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Safety rules for crocheting and knitting are elementary.  However, how often husbands, relatives, friends, and indeed nothing to be silent, the craftswomen themselves sat in a chair stuffed with knitting needles!  The work left “for a moment" often firmly and permanently occupies part of the sofa, and frightened household members do not dare to touch it with a finger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet safety regulations" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1381442.jpg" width="343"></div>

    <p>  An excellent way out is to divert some deep box to current projects.  It is convenient to put everything you need into it.  And most importantly - she easily moves into the closet, under the bed, behind the curtain, in a word, to the place where she will not be dangerous to anyone. </p><h2>  Especially for crazy knitters </h2><p>  When a truly creative person is engaged in knitting, he is seized by the eternal and unquenchable desire to create and invent.  This thirst makes them sit for days and weeks on their projects, plan, draw, adjust and, of course, knit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit without risk of injury" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1381445.jpg" width="445"></div>

    <p>  For such people, hopelessly and forever in love with design, safety when crocheting is the need to at least briefly tear themselves away from their brainchild. </p><p>  It is not only about scoliosis and salt deposition, but also communication skills with other human beings.  Living in your comfortable world, not for long and miss something important, such as a couple of years of life. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet safety" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1381441.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <h2>  The practical value of the recommendations </h2><p>  So, crochet safety is an important issue.  It should be taken seriously and attention should be paid to compliance with the rules.  Having become accustomed to a careless attitude with sharp and cutting objects and having lost vigilance, one can wait for rather unpleasant consequences. </p><p>  Safety when crocheting is designed not just for the red word, so you should inculcate the habit of fulfilling its basic requirements.  Perhaps this will contribute to the preservation of the physical and mental health of households and pets. </p>
