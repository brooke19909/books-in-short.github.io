    <p>  Work on the creation of our world in miniature started in 2006.  It was then that a multinational team of employees began to carefully recreate ethnic yards of various countries.  Currently, the Ethnomir Center (Borovsk) already has museums and attractions, an aviary for Siberian huskies, a trade and exhibition complex, cafes, hotels and restaurants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This vibrant open-air museum is renowned for its interactivity.  So, here you can lie on a Russian stove, master the ancient craft, try on a national costume. </p><p>  Every week, a new entertainment program starts at the Ethnomir Center (Borovsk) - holidays and festivals in a certain country of the world, exhibitions, concerts, thematic weekends, music shows and fairs.  Three hundred and fifty thousand people annually become visitors to this ethnographic park. </p><h2>  Ethnic Yards </h2><p>  Currently, the construction process is still ongoing on the territory of the cultural and educational center.  The construction of six ethnic yards has already been completed, by visiting which you can get acquainted with the features of life in different parts of the world.

    <p>  Ethnomir employees are involved in organizing and conducting entertainment, cultural and educational events at various levels - both regional and federal, as well as international.  In addition, festivals, business and educational schools are constantly held at the center, national holidays are celebrated and summer camps are formed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A bit about the concept </h2><p>  Ethnomir (Borovsk) is a territory of dialogue and synthesis of cultures.  According to the idea, familiarization with the specific features of the peoples of the world occurs when visiting ethno-yards.  The latter are authentically recreated islets, which harmoniously display museums, hotel houses, souvenir shops, traditional cuisine restaurants and other structures that can convey the flavor of different cultures.  Each such courtyard necessarily has its own guardian of traditions, which most reliably acquaints the guests of the center with the features of its people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ethnomir Borovsk photo" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/463041.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <p>  The structure and functioning of Ethnomir is based on the principles of the equality of cultures without regard to the international status of states or their level of well-being.  It is assumed that in the coming years this unique center will turn into the main ethno-cultural crossroads of Russia. </p><h2>  Big plans </h2><p>  What will be Ethnomir by 2020?  Until this time, it is planned to bring the number of yards to fifty-two.  At the same time, the annual number of visitors will reach three million. </p><p>  As for infrastructure, there will be ten SPA centers, fifty-six restaurants, 1,668 apartments and 530 hotel rooms, 136 exhibition halls and forty-five thousand square meters of office and retail space intended for rent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ethnomir (Borovsk): prices for services </h2><p>  For an entrance ticket to the center you need to pay four hundred rubles on weekdays and five hundred on weekends.  At the same time, the right to attend any events is provided.  Citizens with benefits, tickets are half the price. </p><p>  There is an opportunity to participate in a bus tour to Ethnomir.  A comfortable vehicle will take you to the cultural and educational center from the Molodezhnaya station in Moscow, and in the evening will bring you back to the capital.  For children under five, such a trip costs three hundred rubles, for adults a thousand, for beneficiaries eight hundred. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ethnomir in Borovsk" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/463048.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Information for business people </h2><p>  The cultural and educational center under consideration offers the widest opportunities for diverse cooperation and dialogue.  The cultural interaction environment, which is as close as possible to the natural one, is very promising, including financially.  Thanks to this, Ethnomir is considered an ideal platform for negotiations.  The created infrastructure will allow organizing important events at the highest level.  Conference rooms equipped with the latest technology are an excellent base for holding various seminars, workshops and other business events. </p><h2>  How to get to Ethnomir? </h2>

    <p>  If you move along the Kiev highway, then on the ninety-first kilometer of the highway, in front of the bridge (after the Samsung factory), you need to turn right, according to the sign for Borovsk.  Then you should go straight down to the big fork, and turn right at the sign "Ethnomir".  To the destination you need to overcome another seven kilometers. </p><p>  What other way can I get to the center of "Ethnomir" (Kaluga region)?  How to get to it along the <span>Minsk highway?</span>  You need to get to the village of Khomyaki, and then turn left onto the <span>Big Moscow Ring</span> following the Vereya sign.

    <p>  Thanks to educational programs, the younger generation can get acquainted with the history of the book, crafts and wedding traditions of the peoples of the world, the life of nomads. </p><h2>  Derby - Forest Maze </h2><p>  This network of expertly intricate roads with a viewing tower and bridges at a height of three to seven meters above the ground attracts tourists of all ages.  Well, who refuses to see the forest as it is seen, for example, by squirrels?  The one kilometer long labyrinth is equipped with interchangeable partitions that allow you to change its layout, so remembering the path is useless!  On average, in a tangled path they take a quarter of an hour.  You may be able to do it faster. </p><p>  Puzzle enthusiasts are offered the Forest Label game.  Her goal is to find all the special characters and mark with magnetic cards. </p><p>  The cost of a walk through the maze is three hundred rubles, when ordering a game - four hundred.  In the forest it is not allowed to smoke and drink alcohol, sit on the railing, litter, break trees, jump from bridges in places not equipped for this.  Children under eight years of age are not admitted. </p><h2>  Freerope </h2><p>  This youth sport was invented in Russia.  A well-equipped training place is located on the territory of the Ethnomir complex (Kaluga Region).  Reviews of beginners and experienced athletes note that everything is thought out there to the smallest detail.  Particular attention is paid to safety.  It is provided by height restrictions, stringent requirements for the surface of a potential fall (water, grass, mats, sand, snow, etc.) and equipment.  So, to start the distance without a helmet, clothes, covering the ankles and wrists, as well as without gloves and accompanying insurance is impossible. </p><p>  Freerope is considered a national sport.  People from different social strata and age groups can deal with it.  This direction has taken all the best from sports tourism and the traditions of mass walks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ethnomir Kaluga region how to get" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/463058.jpg" width="500"></div>
