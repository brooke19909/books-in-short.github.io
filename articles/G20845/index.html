    <p>  Of course, everyone now has the opportunity to watch a movie.  Indeed, almost every city has a cinema.  But, unfortunately, the times have passed when we came there and were completely immersed in the plot that was offered to us from the big screen.  Today, most likely, a spectator will sit next to him, crunching popcorn, with a noise opening a bottle of water or beer.  Of course, all these annoying factors distract from the viewing process.  Is there a solution to this problem? </p><h2>  Buying a TV </h2><p>  Everyone knows the fact that modern progress is moving on our planet by leaps and bounds.  Technologies for the production of flat TV panels, which are becoming cheaper and cheaper every year, do not stand aside.  Today's consumer is eager to buy the largest possible <span>TV, the</span> diagonal of which corresponds to 32, 37, and even 40 or 42 inches.  It is hardly possible to surprise anyone with such a technique.  Of course, some believe that having a large TV in the house, a person can plunge into the same atmosphere that was in movie theaters of the last century.  But this is far from the case.  No TV, even its diagonal even a hundred inches, can provide the pacifying effect that should give us watching movies.  In this case, a home projector will come to our aid.  Only this device is able to create the unique atmosphere that a cinema gives us. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Projector Benefits </h2><p>  The technology of modern TVs allows you to get great quality pictures.  Nevertheless, there are a number of good reasons for purchasing a home projector. </p><p>  First of all, this is the screen size.  His projector can do anything, even if it‚Äôs all over the wall.  And this is a great advantage of the device, because modern films can not do without a whole set of special effects, which are especially brightly displayed on the screen of large sizes. </p>

    <p>  The projector screen onto which the image is projected can be easily minimized, freeing up space for other purposes.  This is especially true in cases where the house does not have a free room for a home theater, and watching movies is carried out, for example, in the living room. </p><p>  Another great feature is the <span>home theater projector.</span>  User reviews say that when watching movies with this unit, their vision is practically not strained.  In other words, there is no discomfort for the eyes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the projector for the home fits easily into the interior.  In this matter, the overall LCD and plasma panels are undoubtedly inferior to him. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  In order to choose a projector for your home deliberately, you need to find out its device.  This will allow you to choose a device with the necessary technical characteristics. </p><p>  The device is quite simple.  In its farthest corner, a powerful lamp is installed.  The light from it passes through a whole system of lenses, light filters, etc., and then hits the screen.  This is where reflection and image formation take place. </p><h2>  Projector Types </h2><p>  On the path of the light flux emitted by the lamp of the device, there may be various elements.  Depending on their <span>characteristics, projectors</span> come in two types: </p><p>  1. Liquid crystal (LCD).  A combination of three mirrors was used in their design.  They make it possible to divide the luminous flux into red, green and blue colors.  These spectra pass through a prism and are collected in a full-color finished image.  Such technology contributes to a million different shades with high brightness. </p>

    <p>  Many positive aspects are distinguished by a liquid crystal projector for a home theater.  User reviews, in particular, indicate a low level of noise emitted by the device, and the release of a small amount of heat.  In addition, when using the LCD, a rainbow effect is not created on the screen.  However, this type of projector has some negative aspects.  So, in the picture created by him there are distinguishable pixels, and the black color is at a small level (this reduces the contrast).  In addition, the projector requires constant cleaning of the filter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  2. Micromirror (DLP) projectors.  These devices form a picture on the screen using a large number of microscopic mirrors located on the surface of a special chip.  When choosing an apparatus for watching movies, you should pay attention to the DLP projector for home theater.  User reviews note a clear and very ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù image on the screen where it is impossible to distinguish individual pixels.  All this became possible due to the fact that the mirrors included in the design of the projector are located at a very close distance from each other (less than one micron).  The positive aspects of DLP projectors are their small size, low weight and less demanding maintenance.  But these devices have a number of disadvantages.  This is a relatively high level of noise emitted by them, and the need to work in a well-lit room, and the rainbow effect obtained around projected objects. </p><p>  These are the main technologies that home cinema projectors can have.  How to choose a suitable device?  To do this, ask to show various types of devices in operation.  This is possible if there is a showroom at a store selling household appliances.  Only there you can understand whether the noise from the operation of the device annoys you, whether you see flickering on the screen, etc. </p><h2>  Latest technology </h2><p>  A laser projector is a 3D device that is currently being developed for home and professional use.  These devices are modern and high-tech equipment.  Their main component is the laser beam. </p><p>  The uniqueness of such projectors lies in the fact that the quality of the image displayed on the screen does not depend on the shape of its surface.  In other words, a laser projector produces a picture that does not lose its sharpness and sharpness even on an uneven wall.  Such a device does not need a lens.  This is due to the fact that all image pixels are created by laser pulses that do not require focusing. </p><p>  It is believed that such devices will soon completely replace lamp ones, because the picture on the wall appears due to the LED laser source, which is considered not only economical, but also environmentally friendly. </p>

It is in it that the focusing of the laser beam takes place.  But in order to form an image, the 3D projector has a complex system of micromirrors.  In this case, the deflection angle of the laser beam is set in a special converter.

    <p>  Currently, such projectors are widely used in the projection of various films, elements of figures and 3D-images in discos.  They are used in show programs. </p><p>  <span>A</span> home theater <span>LED projector</span> is currently under development.  However, Panasonic has begun producing tubeless devices for professional viewing.  Similar devices are used in business, in medical and educational institutions. </p><h2>  Brightness criterion </h2><p>  Today, stores selling household appliances offer various projectors for home theater.  How to choose the right model from the whole variety?  To do this, you need to pay attention to such a characteristic of the device as brightness.  Increased values ‚Äã‚Äãof this indicator are necessary for professional use in conference rooms.  To install the device in the house, 900-1300 lumens will be enough.  However, this figure is not worth focusing on.  The fact is that there may be times when the viewing room cannot be darkened well.  Then you need a projector whose brightness is at least 3,000 lumens. </p><h2>  Image format and resolution </h2><p>  This technical characteristic is also important for comfortable watching movies.  For home theaters, the aspect ratio should be 16: 9.  And if the device is connected to a computer, then the recommended ratio should be 4: 3.  Adequate resolution of such a projector is 854 x 480. This value is optimal especially when DVD movies are mainly included.  But in the case of watching HDTV filming, user reviews recommend choosing a model that supports a resolution of 1280 x 720. This value for a laptop computer can be 1024 x 768. </p><h2>  Projector type selection by technology </h2><p>  As mentioned above, devices for home theaters can form the image on the screen in different ways.  Which projector to choose for this characteristic?  For a home theater, the DLP is your choice.  It will project a picture in which individual pixels are least visible. </p><p>  In addition, a small number of mechanical parts have a similar projector for a home theater.  User reviews suggest that such devices are lightweight and have small dimensions.  However, for those who want the projector to better reproduce colors and display a sharper image on the screen, LCD technology will be the best option. </p><h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  Their presence is also worth paying attention to when buying a projector for a home theater.  If the device is purchased for professional purposes, then a standard set of connectors is sufficient for it.  However, the projector for a home theater, in addition to connecting to a D-Sub monitor, as well as DVI video, must also have HDMI.  This connector allows you to watch TV programs or video in HD. </p><p>  If the house has a large room for watching films and the projector will be installed there more than one, then the selected models must necessarily have reverse outputs.  With their help, the incoming signal will be redistributed between different devices.  To obtain a high-quality image, the device must be equipped with a separate RCA connector, through which the signal will come from different BNC cables. </p><p>  When choosing a model, it is worth paying attention to the presence of ports connecting the device to a computer (RS232 and USB).  This will make a difference when using the remote control. </p><h2>  Other characteristics </h2><p>  If you travel often, then pay attention to the mini projector.  It has a small weight. </p><p>  Also, when choosing an apparatus, remember that the lamp for the projector has a certain life.  Its optimal value for home appliances is 2,000 hours when operating in normal mode and 3,000 hours in economy mode.  It is not necessary to purchase projectors in which the lamp operating time is lower than the indicators presented above.  Deviation from this rule is only possible with the purchase of large installations in which there are lamps of high brightness and power.  In this case, their life will be 1000 hours. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that the lamp for the projector is operating normally until its brightness drops to 50% of the original value.  In order to increase the life of this source, it is recommended to clean the filters. </p><p>  When choosing a model, it is worth paying attention to the noise level emitted by the device.  After all, even the best projector will spoil the impression of the film if it annoys the audience. </p><h2>  Cost criterion </h2><p>  Experts recommend that every buyer buy the <span>projector, the price of</span> which will be as affordable as possible for the family budget.  All devices offered today can be divided into three categories.  The first of them includes projectors, the price of which is in the range of 80 thousand rubles.  This is a budget option with separate additional features and functions.  A projector, the price of which ranges from 80 to 130 thousand rubles, upsets the owner with only a few technological compromises.  But it‚Äôs worth turning a blind eye, since these models are equipped with a complete set of the most important and necessary functions. </p><p>  Projectors of higher quality are sold at a price of 130 thousand rubles.  In such equipment there is a complete set of functions, there are no any technological compromises.  There are more expensive projectors.  Their production is carried out using proprietary technologies. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  The projector of the highest class created by the Italian company SIM2.  If the device is configured correctly, then it can be compared with the cinematography standard.  The only design drawback of such a projector is the lack of horizontal shift of the optics.  However, not all moviegoers can afford such a technique, because it costs too much. </p><p>  Good feedback is received by Sony equipment.  The developers of these projectors are constantly improving the quality of their products, while making them more affordable for the buyer. </p>
