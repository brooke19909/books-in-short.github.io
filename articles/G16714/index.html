As a discipline, it relates to areas such as medicine and healthcare, and provides the basis for understanding how the human body adapts to stress, disease, and physical activity. </p><p>  Modern studies in the field of human physiology contribute to the emergence of new ways to ensure and improve the quality of life, the development of new medical treatment methods.  The basic principle, which is the basis for studying human physiology, is the maintenance of homeostasis through the functioning of complex control systems, covering all levels of the hierarchy of the human structure and functions (cells, tissues, organs and organ systems). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Human physiology </h2><p>  <span>Human physiology</span> as a science is engaged in the study of the mechanical, physical and biochemical functions of a person in good health, its organs and cells of which they are composed.  The main level of physiology attention is the functional level of all organs and systems.  Ultimately, science gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex functions of the body as a whole. </p><p>  Anatomy and physiology are closely related areas of research, anatomy studies forms, and physiology studies functions.  What does human physiology study science?  This biological discipline studies how the body functions in a normal state, and also explores possible body dysfunctions and various diseases. </p><p>  What does physiology study?  Physiology provides answers to questions about how the body works, what happens when a person is born and develops, about how the body's systems adapt under stress conditions, such as physical exercise or extreme environmental conditions, and how body functions change with painful conditions.  Physiology affects functions at all levels, from nerves to muscles, from the brain to hormones, from molecules and cells to organs and systems. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Human body systems </h2><p>  Human physiology as a science studies the functions of the organs of the human body.  Build includes several systems that work together for the normal functioning of the whole organism.  Some systems are interconnected, and one or more elements of one system can be part of or serve another. </p><p>  There are 10 main body systems: </p><p>  1) The cardiovascular system is responsible for pumping blood through veins and arteries.  Blood must enter the body, constantly producing fuel and gas for organs, skin and muscles. </p><p>  2) The gastrointestinal tract is responsible for the processing of food, its digestion and its conversion into energy for the body. </p><p>  3) The <span>reproductive system</span> is responsible for reproduction. </p><p>  4) The <span>endocrine system</span> consists of all the key glands responsible for secretion production. </p><p>  5) The <span>integumentary system</span> is the so-called ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù for the body, for the protection of internal organs.  Its main organ, the skin, is covered with a large number of sensors that transmit external sensory signals to the brain. </p><p>  6) Musculoskeletal system: the skeleton and muscles are responsible for the overall structure and shape of the human body. </p><p>  7) The respiratory system is represented by the nose, trachea and lungs and is responsible for breathing. </p><p>  8) <span>The urinary system</span> helps the body get rid of unwanted waste. </p><p>  9) Nervous system: a network of nerves connects the brain to the rest of the body.  This system is responsible for the human senses: sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing. </p><p>  10) The immune system protects or tries to protect the body from illness and disease.  If foreign bodies enter the body, then the system begins to produce antibodies to protect the body and destroy unwanted guests. </p>

    <h2>  Who needs to know human physiology and why? </h2><p>  What science studies human physiology can be a fascinating topic for doctors and surgeons.  In addition to medicine, other areas of knowledge are also affected.  Human physiology data is important for sports professionals such as a trainer and physiotherapist.  In addition, in the framework of the world practice of medicine, various types of therapy are used, for example, massage, where it is also important to know how the body is arranged so that the treatment is as effective as possible and brings only benefit, and not harm. </p><h2>  The role of microorganisms </h2><p>  Microorganisms play a key role in nature.  They make it possible to process materials and energy, they can be used as cell ‚Äúfactories‚Äù for the production of antibiotics, enzymes and food products, they can also cause infectious diseases in humans (for example, foodborne infections), animals and plants.  Their existence directly depends on the ability to adapt in a changing environment, the availability of nutrients and light, the pH factor also plays an important role, such categories as pressure, temperature and many others. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="physiology concept" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/927022.jpg" width="500"></div>  The physiology of microorganisms </h2><p>  The basis of the life of microorganisms and all other living creatures is metabolism with the environment (metabolism).  When studying a discipline such as the physiology of microorganisms, metabolism plays an important role.  This is the process of building chemical compounds in the cell and their destruction in the process of activity to obtain the necessary energy and building elements. </p><p>  Metabolism includes anabolism (assimilation) and catabolism (dissimilation).  The physiology of microorganisms studies the processes of growth, development, nutrition, methods of obtaining energy for the implementation of these processes, as well as their interaction with the environment. </p>
