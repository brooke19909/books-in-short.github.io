  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The construction of a bridge across Sulfur Island (St. Petersburg) will be completed in the first quarter of 2018</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year more and more cars are in the country, and no economic problems are a hindrance to this trend.  According to estimates at the beginning of last year, in Russia there are 288 units of cars per 1,000 citizens.  The highest rates, naturally, in large cities.  In the same St. Petersburg, there are 319 cars per 1,000 people.  Naturally, this is a good indicator of the growth of the solvency of the population, but on the other hand, there are constant traffic jams on roads, especially in the central parts of large cities. </p><h2>  Transport projects of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  St. Petersburg is a large city in Russia, the second capital of the state.  Naturally, there are many problems with roads and a huge amount of transport.  So, at the end of the first quarter of this year, it is planned to complete the construction of a bridge across Sulfur Island on the Malaya Neva.  This project aims to connect the islands in two areas of the city: </p><ul><li>  Vasileostrovsky - the island of the Decembrists, where more than 62 thousand people live. </li><li>  Petrogradsky - Petrovsky Island. </li></ul><p>  The new bridge over Sulfur Island should solve the issue of transport bypassing the central part of the city.  The bridge is also a strategic object in the program of preparation for the World Cup in 2018. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sulfur island" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2227063.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  The design of the bridge over <span>Sulfur Island</span> was started back in 2003.  In the future, due to a lack of financial resources, construction was constantly postponed; against the backdrop of the upcoming championship, work was immediately resumed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As already seen from Uralskaya Street, the bridge originates from Maly Petrovsky Bridge.  Then passes through the river Zhdanovka.  Then it goes through Sulfur Island, through the Malaya Neva in the place where the channel of the river has the smallest width.  It ends on Vasilyevsky Island, on Uralskaya Street. </p><p>  General design characteristics of the structure in the table below. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Bridge crossing, length in meters </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  1 227 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Ramps, length in meters </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  215 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Total length of the left-bank flyover </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  208.5 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Total length of the right-bank flyover </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  314 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Channel length </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  357 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Dimensions for shipping vehicles, in meters </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  100X16 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Metal pylon, height, in meters </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  89.5 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  The largest longitudinal slope, in% </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  4 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The bridge itself will have 6 lanes, a 3.5-meter wide bike path and a three-meter pavement path. </p><h2>  Sulfur island </h2><p>  This is a small piece of land from the many islands in the delta of the Neva River.  There is no building on it.  It is located near the <span>island of the Decembrists</span> (north) and south of the island of Peter.  The name did not appear spontaneously, back in the 19th century, there were warehouses with sulfur and lime. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sulfur islands" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2227099.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Amendments to the project and problems in the construction process </h2><p>  As with most long-term construction, many problems arose with the construction of a bridge across Serny Island. </p><p>  The project itself was only approved in the period from 2005 to 2007.  In 2008, Mostotryad-19 won the construction tender with an estimated contract value of 10 billion rubles.  But the crisis did not allow to realize the project, and the construction was frozen until 2012.  Then a new governor came in and completely abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a car crossing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2013 and 2014, amendments were made to the bridge construction project.  But work was resumed only in 2015, and it turned out that it would be necessary to reduce the design height of the pylon to 44 meters.  At that time, a new law on the protection of cultural objects of the Northern capital was already adopted. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island sulfur spb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2227097.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Conflict 2015-2017 </h2><p>  In principle, the conflict with the residents of the house on Remeslennaya Street 3 arose almost immediately after the resumption of construction work on the ferry across the Serny Island.  Correspondence of tenants of the house with government officials began.  As a result, it was concluded that the building does not bear any historical value and is in disrepair.  In the future, this conclusion was recognized as false.  The trial has begun.  It also turned out that not all permits were received for the construction of the bridge, in particular, there is no permission from the State Construction Supervision Authority. </p><p>  The residents of the house managed to keep the ‚Äúdefense‚Äù, but in the end everyone was evicted on a voluntary basis.  Many homeowners expected decent compensation, but in fact received even less than the cadastral value.  They paid about 50 thousand rubles per square meter with a market value of 300 thousand. </p><p>  The house was demolished in almost one day, and construction continued, despite the lack of <span>permits.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="construction of a bridge over sulfuric island" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2227076.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Financing </h2><p>  The total estimated cost of building a bridge across Serny Island (St. Petersburg) is 8.9 billion rubles.  The company "Pilon" is engaged in construction.  In 2015, 23.4% was funded, that is, 2.4 billion were paid to the contractor, in 2016 - 2.1 billion.  The construction completion date is the end of April 2018. </p>
