  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anti-Hitler coalition</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The anti-Hitler coalition can be safely called a union that arose overnight.  Frictions and contradictions between the participants shook it throughout its existence.  What is the reason for the fragility of this union? </p><p>  How it all began </p><p>  The origins of the association, which went down in history as the ‚Äúanti-Hitler coalition‚Äù, lie in the contractual relations that existed between Great Britain, France, Poland and other European states.  In September 1939, after Germany attacked Poland, these states entered the war.  So the coalition of the ‚ÄúWestern Allies‚Äù arose, with which the creation of the anti-Hitler coalition began. </p><p>  Until 1941, the USSR was not a member of <span>this coalition</span> .  The non-aggression pact signed with Germany made such alliances not only unnecessary, but also unprofitable, because during 1939-1940.  The Soviet Union without much loss acquired new territories: Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, the Baltic States, Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.  But on June 22, 1941 the situation radically changed </p><p>  Now the interests of the USSR and Western states coincided.  Already on June 22, the head of the British government, <span>Winston Churchill,</span> announced his readiness to assist the Soviet Union in the war.  A couple of days later, the same statement was made by US President Franklin Roosevelt.  After the surrender of France in 1940, the British, in fact, remained face to face with the Nazis and their allies.  The Wehrmacht was about to make landing on the <span>British Isles,</span> and in the Pacific Basin, the British colonies were threatened by Japan, speaking in the war on the side of Germany.  Fearing conflicts with Japan and the United States, which had their interests in the Pacific Ocean.  Therefore, the anti-Hitler coalition needed a new ally.  Already in July 1941 in Moscow, a meeting of the Soviet leadership with the English representatives took place.  In September 1941, the USSR announced its accession to the Atlantic Charter - a declaration of cooperation between Great Britain and the United States in the fight against Germany.  So the formation of the anti-Hitler coalition received a serious push forward. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Challenges and Successes </p><p>  But soon after this event, the first friction arose between the coalition members.  Both Britain and the United States were quite happy with the restoration of pre-war borders in Europe.  The Soviet leadership did not want to agree to such proposals.  After all, then you would have to give up the territories already attached before 1941.  Because of this, the signing of the Anglo-Soviet Union Treaty was disrupted. </p><p>  Another problem faced by the anti-Hitler coalition was the question of <span>opening a second front</span> in Europe.  Most of the connections of the Wehrmacht and the allies of Germany were concentrated on the territory of the USSR, so it would be logical to strike from the territory of <span>Western Europe.</span>  But the British side reacted to this proposal of the Soviet leadership without enthusiasm, citing a lack of strength.  The Americans first came out on the side of the USSR, but then they went on Churchill‚Äôs offer to drop troops not in Europe, but in North Africa.  Because of these disagreements, the second front opened soon. </p><p>  And yet, despite these differences, the anti-Hitler coalition was able to achieve its goal.  American supplies of equipment and food were essential assistance to the allies.  This was especially important in 1941-1942, when many industrial centers of the USSR found themselves in German-occupied territory.  This was also important for Britain, cut off from its colonies due to the adverse situation on the seas. </p><p>  The victory of the Soviet troops in the Battle of Stalingrad prompted the Allies to more decisive action.  It became clear that a turning point had come in the war, and the Western states began active preparations for the opening of the Second Front, so as to soon end the war in Europe and prevent the Red Army from moving too far to the West.  In 1944, Allied forces <span>landed in Normandy,</span> which accelerated the defeat of Germany in the war. </p><p>  As we approach victory, relations between the Allies deteriorate more and more.  In April 1945, F. Roosevelt died, who was succeeded as president by Harry Truman, who was more negative about the USSR.  The presence of Soviet troops in <span>Eastern Europe</span> also did not help strengthen relations between coalition members.  When the main goal of the Allies - the defeat of Germany - was achieved, relations between the USSR and the West completely deteriorated.  A hidden confrontation began between yesterday‚Äôs allies, which went down in history as the Cold War and for a long time created a tense situation throughout the world. </p>
