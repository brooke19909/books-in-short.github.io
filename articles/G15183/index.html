    <h2>  From a like-minded community to a beautiful resort </h2><p>  The history of the village is very unusual.  Its name can be translated as "source" or "spring".  In 1886, in a delightful place, on the shore of the Gelendzhik Bay, a community of intelligentsia appeared.  Collected by her nobleman V.V. Eropkin.  The idea that fascinated this aristocrat was populism.  The first residents of Krinitsa coexisted together under the roof of a four-room house.  Fourteen years later, the population increased to fifty.  People were engaged not only in social transformation projects, but also in viticulture. </p><p>  Even during the active actions of the Soviet government, the village with a poetic name continued to develop, while at the same time providing assistance to other similar-like settlements.  The community, distinguished by its identity, operated for thirty whole years, right up to 1920. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Near the village was the Sheerman Artel, which also engaged in the cultivation of grapes.  In the late twenties, the two communities merged, choosing the name Krinitsa for themselves. </p><h2>  Resort import substitution </h2>

    <p>  Today Krinitsa of the Krasnodar Territory is not a comparable place to relax.  The resort village is located in a picturesque river valley called Pshada, only 40 kilometers from Gelendzhik.  Even from the farthest corner of the village, you can reach the sea in 20 minutes on foot.  The way, by the way, will be very pleasant - fruit trees adorn the streets, fences are twined with vines. </p><p>  Krinitsa will be enjoyed by couples, representatives of the older generation and children.  An unforgettable vacation in the village will also be for scuba diving enthusiasts: the Black Sea here is characterized by impeccably clean water and allows you to see plants and animals.  For this, scuba divers will need the simplest fins and mask. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The climate of Krinitsa can be attributed to the zone of dry and semi-dry subtropics.  In summer it is slightly cooler here than in neighboring Gelendzhik.  The reason for this is the cold water of the Pshada River.  By the way, for the same reason, the sea in Krinitsa is slightly cooler than in other resort villages.  But there are no cold winds here: Krinitsa is protected from them by Mount Shahan, 370 meters high. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Krinitsa beaches (Krasnodar Territory) </h2>
