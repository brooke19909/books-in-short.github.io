The Rostelecom company offers all its customers quite a few options for solving this problem.  Which ones? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable subscriptions on Rostelecom" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143225.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What you can refuse </h2><p>  First, we‚Äôll try to understand what in practice you can refuse.  What services can each subscriber be able to remove without unnecessary problems?  Only then should you think about how to disable subscriptions on Rostelecom.  Mobile, Internet, home telephone, television - all this company offers.  Of course, you can easily connect to yourself everything related to the listed features. </p><p>  And of course, all this can be abandoned at any time.  In addition, it also includes some additional options like additional Internet traffic, roaming, some channels for television.  All that Rostelecom offers is paid services that have the ability to be disabled. </p><h2>  Your actions </h2><p>  This is done in several ways.  The first, not the most successful and popular, is a call to the operator.  Have you thought about how to turn off subscriptions to Rostelecom or some services?  Then you need to know exactly what you want to refuse.  After that, you need to fill out an application by phone in your name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  We call the operator at 8-800-100-25-25 and wait for an answer.  Next, you will need to tell which city you are from.  By the way, the call is completely free.  After that, you will be redirected to the operator who is involved in connecting and disconnecting certain options.  Tell me what exactly you want to unsubscribe from.  In some cases, you may be asked the reason for the refusal.  Speaking her is not necessary.  This information is needed by the company in order to improve its subscriptions. </p><p>  How to disable subscriptions to Rostelecom on the phone or any other device?  You specify which "platform" needs to get rid of services, after you provide your address and first / last name.  Specify the package that you will disconnect and wait a bit.  The operator will fill out an application in your name and inform you of further actions.  If this is just some kind of third-party subscription or service (such as additional channels or traffic), then you will only be told about the periods after which your request will be satisfied.  Otherwise, you have to negotiate with the manager about the visit and seizure of certain gadgets (for example, a modem from Rostelecom). </p><h2>  A personal meeting </h2><p>  Move on.  In addition to calling the operator, a slightly different technique is often used.  As soon as the subscriber begins to think about how to turn off subscriptions to Rostelecom, he simply contacts the nearest company office in the city of residence.  And there, without problems, he refuses, of which he only wishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable subscriptions on Rostelecom on the phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143224.jpg"></div>

Even when it comes to additional subscriptions.  Try not to forget the passport and the contract itself.  Without them, the office will not be able to fill out an application. </p><p>  Further, when talking with an employee, you will have to say what you need to specifically disable.  If you do not know what subscriptions and services you have connected, ask them to see information about this.  You will need to provide your home address.  We select and name the service to be disconnected, transfer the contract and passport.  It remains to wait until the office employee completes the appropriate application.  Check the correctness of filling in the data, and then sign the rejection of a particular service.  If we are talking about a simple subscription that does not provide for the signing of a connection agreement, you will immediately be removed from the named service.  Otherwise, you will have to complete all the actions that the employee will name. </p><h2>  After contract </h2><p>  And then what?  How to disable subscriptions to Rostelecom (Perm Territory or any other region)?  If you personally terminated the contract, then you should have been informed of further actions.  As a rule, nothing special is required from you.  You will just wait for a notification about the disconnection of a particular service, or you will have a meeting with a manager.  He will pick up all the equipment provided by the company and will notify you of the result of your request. </p><p>  Very often, even before the termination of the contract, subscribers bring the proposed equipment directly to the Rostelecom office.  Usually this is either a TV set-top box, or a modem.  This option also has a place to be.  Then you won‚Äôt have to think about how to disable Rostelecom subscriptions again.  One visit to the office with all the equipment, a passport and an agreement on the provision of certain services is enough.  After this reception, just wait for the message about the successful termination of subscriptions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable subscriptions on Rostelecom in Khmao" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143227.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Bans </h2><p>  How to disable subscriptions to Rostelecom in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug (and not only)?  There is another rather interesting option.  But rarely does anyone agree to it.  The thing is that paid services and subscriptions can be banned.  That is, you can connect some basic functions from the company, but not third-party (optional) ones. </p><p>  To do this, you will have to call a specific reference number.  By the way, it is the same for all regions.  We dial 11802 on the phone and wait for an answer.  Next, we inform the telecom operator that we would like to put a ban on subscriptions and third-party services.  An application will be drawn up for you, and in return you will receive the result of processing the operation.  In principle, a rather interesting trick.  Only few use it.  After all, in order to reconnect yourself with some kind of package, you have to call the Rostelecom help desk again and remove all the bans.  This is not very convenient. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Now a little about more modern solutions.  Yes, few people agree to them, but subscribers already find such tricks extremely useful.  It is about using the Internet to implement ideas. </p><p>  For example, you can electronically fill out an application to refuse a particular service and send it to Rostelecom‚Äôs mail.  Further, the whole process will take place in a virtual environment, only at the very end the manager will call you and inform you about the results of the operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable subscriptions on Rostelecom Perm Territory" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143228.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The disadvantage of this technique is its implementation is too long.  Sometimes a virtual application may take weeks to process.  And if we are talking about some kind of paid subscription, then there is no point in waiting for so long. </p><h2>  Through the site </h2><p>  There is a more successful solution.  This is the official website of the operator.  How to disable subscriptions to Rostelecom?  In the "My Account" on the provider's web page.  It is here that you can easily and simply manage all the services you have connected. </p><p>  Go to Rostelecom, then go through authorization there.  Take a look at the Services section.  Here you can pay attention to several categories of "Paid subscriptions" and simply "Services."  Select the appropriate inscription and look at the result.  The entire list of services that you have connected and generally have in the arsenal of the company will appear on the screen.  Opposite each line there is a function - "Disconnect" or "Connect".  Click on the desired inscription and confirm the action.  You will receive a transaction confirmation code.  It must be entered in the appropriate field on the monitor screen.  Upon completion of the work, the state of a service will change.  That's all, no problem. </p><h2>  When there is no "Cabinet" </h2><p>  What to do if you are a subscriber of Rostelecom, but you do not have a Personal Account?  Of course, register on the operator‚Äôs official website.  It consists of 4 simple steps.  As soon as they are completed, you will automatically begin to see information about connected and available service packages at the specified address in the profile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable subscriptions on Rostelecom in your account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1143229.jpg"></div>
