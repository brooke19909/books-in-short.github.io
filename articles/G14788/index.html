At the end of the 18th century, when the country became a colony of France, Nha Trang began to turn into a resort, here began to build residences for the rest of senior French officials and the aristocracy.  The city is becoming a fashionable place where the French are actively coming.  The Vietnamese nobility also reached for the colonialists. </p><p>  In the 19th century, the emperor of Vietnam, Bao Dai, builds a palace here for his vacation.  During the capture of part of the country by American troops in the 20th century, representatives of the highest authorities of <span>South Vietnam</span> and the US Army come to local beaches.  After the war, Nha Trang fell into decay for some time.  The new life of the city begins in the 21st century, when the tourism industry begins to develop here.

    <h2>  Nha Trang beaches </h2><p>  The main reason tourists come to Vietnam is beach vacations.  Nha Trang is a recognized leader in the tourist area thanks to its beautiful coastline.  There are 6 beaches in the city, each of which has its own characteristics.  The main one is the central city beach, whose length is 6 km, it stretches along the entire coastline of the settlement.  The beach is sandy, it is quite clean, although it is very crowded during the season.  In August, Vietnamese travelers fill Nha Trang, and they prefer to spend time on the city beach.  Therefore, it is noisy here.  But the beach is well equipped, there are many cafes, travel agencies and equipment rental shops nearby. </p><p>  The second most popular beach is called Long (Wai Dai), it is spread over 15 km.  It is located a bit far from the city, driving to it for about 15 minutes. It is also quite crowded in the high season, but there are fewer cafes and other service facilities.  The descent to the water is even, the sandbank is quite long. </p><p>  Paragon Beach is located next to the cable car, it is considered an elite place.  It is very comfortable to swim here, as two breakwaters have been erected to eliminate the waves. </p><p>  The farthest Monkey beach is on the island of the same name.  There is nothing exceptional in it, but getting here is not very convenient, which contributes to a small number of vacationers.  The island is not in vain bears such a name, there are many monkeys that can significantly complicate the rest.  You can not leave things unattended, as these animals can easily drag them away. </p><p>  The two beaches farthest from the city - Dock Let and Jungle Beach are distinguished by cleaner water and very beautiful nature.  Tourists usually come here for the whole day because of remoteness, the infrastructure here is not very developed, but there is everything necessary for relaxation.  In August, there are fewer people on these beaches than on urban beaches, so you can spend time here with great comfort. </p>
