Since the island is considered exclusively as a holiday destination, it is difficult to find hostels and hotels with one star.  All hotels in seaside resorts start from a "two stars".  And what is above five?  There are also boutique and apart hotels.  Of course, the "stardom" of a hotel depends not only and not so much on the level of service.  Here, factors such as location, distance from the sea, the presence and quality of the beach play a role.  In this article we will look at the best 4-star hotels in Cyprus.  We made a selection using reviews from Russian tourists.  They rated hotels by such parameters as territory and location, distance from the beach, service, food and animation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 star hotels cyprus" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/665985.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <h2>  General remarks </h2><p>  It may seem strange to those tourists who are used to vacationing in <span>Egypt or Turkey</span> that almost all 4-star hotels in Cyprus do not practice the all-inclusive system.  Most hotels include breakfast only.  But when ordering a hotel or during check-in, you can agree on the provision of a half board or three meals a day for a fee.  ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù cannot be called, but still ... Also, Russian tourists noted that Cypriots do not feel respectful trepidation in front of customers.  In shorts they can easily not be allowed in for dinner, and friendly gatherings in the room can end with a call from the administrator, or even the arrival of the police.  Room facilities in four-star hotels can vary dramatically.  Reviews speak of both luxury apartments and old furniture.  But the level of service in all hotels of the island remains at its best and meets European standards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best 4 star hotels in cyprus" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/665988.jpg" width="442"></div>

Many resorts of the island have their own "specialization."  Golden youths usually choose Ayia Napa and Limassol.  Local 4-star Cyprus hotels invariably collect the most enthusiastic reviews of animation, entertainment and excellent service.  But along with this, some tourists complain of noise and din in the evenings.  Lovers of languid bliss settle in the vicinity of Limassol and in Paphos.  Reviews mention a high level of comfort.  The most budget hotels of the island are concentrated in Larnaca.  And families with young children praise hotels in Protaras.  The infrastructure for children is most developed there: there are special menus, animation, water parks and more. </p><h2>  Coast selection </h2><p>  A characteristic feature of Cyprus is that the beaches here are municipal.  This means that access to them is absolutely free for everyone.  This circumstance can be regarded as a minus (for sunbeds and umbrellas you may be required to pay), and a plus (the ability to choose a beach to your liking).  But some 4-star Cyprus hotels conclude agreements with the municipality on the provision of beach ammunition to their customers.  At the same time, sun loungers and umbrellas by the pools at the hotels are always free for guests.  The best beaches in Cyprus are in Protoras and Ayia Napa.  Here is a little white and soft sand, with insignificant interspersed pebbles.  This fact makes resorts very popular.  Hotels are advised to book rooms in advance.  In Larnaca, the sand is dark in color.  Pebbles are increasingly found in Limassol.  But in Paphos, bulk sand, and in the sea at sunset there are stones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus Protaras 4 star hotels" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/665990.jpg" width="600"></div>

An excellent infrastructure for the youngest tourists is accompanied by a free bonus in the form of the best Cypriot beaches and a gentle entry into the calm sea.  Some hotels offer budget accommodation for an average of five thousand rubles for a double room with breakfast.  And this is at the height of the season, when crowds of tourists fill Cyprus.  Protaras, whose 4-star hotels are not very numerous, presents a rich animation program for children and their parents.  Some hotels, such as Capo Bay, have a diving school and spa.  Negative reviews include paid Wi-Fi in rooms, although they can be used freely in public areas.  Tourists especially praise the local Quartet such as Anastasia Beach, Golden Coast and Sunrise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Cyprus Paphos 4 stars" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/665991.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <h2>  Cyprus Hotels: Paphos </h2><p>  ‚Äú4 stars‚Äù in this resort occupy almost half of the hotel fund.  These hotels are located in different areas.  The tourist has a wide choice: the city center or green surroundings, the front page with less amenities or the more distant area from the beach, but with the service, like in a five-star hotel.  For a relaxing holiday, reviews are advised to choose the St. George SPA and Golf Beach Resort.  This hotel is six kilometers from the center.  As the name implies, the hotel has its own spa.  Capital Coast Resort Hotel is suitable for lovers of excursions, because it is located in the very center of the city, close to the Archaeological Complex and the Necropolis.  This hotel, according to reviews, also has a spa center with a hammam and massage service.  <span>Sofianna Hotel Apartments 4 *</span> is good for family holidays.  <span>The apartments of this</span> hotel complex are twenty minutes walk from the center.  Many 4-star Cyprus hotels in Paphos offer their guests free internet access.  Those tourists who like to live in secluded bungalows, and not in noisy high-rise buildings, are advised to choose the hotel ‚ÄúAquamar Beach‚Äù.  It also has a spa center with a hammam, sauna, fitness room.  This is a first line hotel, only a couple of minutes to the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4 star hotels larnaca cyprus" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/665994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The Fours of Larnaca </h2><p>  This resort is considered budgetary in Cyprus, but this does not mean at all that the local hotels are inferior to others in terms of service.  What are the remarkable 4-star hotels of Cyprus (Larnaca)?  Firstly, developed children's infrastructure.  In almost all hotels of this level, along with an adult pool there is a "paddling pool" with small slides.  Enough in Larnaca and hotels with their own spa complexes.  Many of them stand directly on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  Hotels such as Palm Beach, Sandy, Lordos and Princess Beach have gathered a lot of praise. </p>
