  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Baryshnikov Manor: history, address, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are so many buildings and structures in the capital of our country that it is easy to get lost in a huge metropolis.  But there are places in Moscow that remain recognizable for many decades.  First of all, these are ancient manors unique in their significance.  For centuries they keep the memory of their eminent owners and belong to the most famous museums of the capital.  Many of them were attended by eminent Russian architects.  Today, Muscovites and guests of the capital have the opportunity to visit these historical monuments and touch history. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Many interesting buildings were built on Myasnitskaya Street, which at one time served as a road between the German settlement and the Kremlin.  The king very often traveled along it.  This circumstance gave the street a special status.  Many <span>noble people</span> began to hastily move to Myasnitskaya. </p><p>  It is here that the famous Baryshnikov estate is located, a photo of which is presented later in the article.  Today <span>it is the press mansion of the</span> print edition of AiF.  The estate often hosts meetings of journalists with the most famous Russian politicians, ministers, governors, businessmen, representatives of show business and creative intelligentsia.  Many are impressed by the magnificent interiors of Baryshnikov's estate. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This magnificent mansion, made in the classical style, with a wrought iron fence and a Corinthian portico, is perhaps the most memorable building on Butcher Street.  The architect of this work is Matvey Kazakov.  The mansion was built in 1802.  The customer was a retired major, a wealthy landowner, the owner of horse and bakery Ivan Ivanovich Baryshnikov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The U-shaped building is designed in a classic style.  At one time, the courtyard of the Baryshnikov estate was surrounded by galleries with columns, which, unfortunately, have not been preserved to this day.  But the appearance of the house itself over the past centuries has not changed.  True, the graceful balconies on the consoles in front of the windows of the outbuildings that overlook Myasnitskaya Street were lost. </p><p>  But perhaps the most amazing thing is that over the years the metal fence of the Baryshnikov estate has been preserved - unique in its beauty with strict graceful lattices between white-stone columns with spheres made of cast iron.  By the way, almost all such fences in Moscow were destroyed in due time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.welcome2018.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baryshnikov Manor" class="if uuid-2860006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2860006.jpg"></div><p>  The territory on which the famous Baryshnikov's estate on Myasnitskaya was built is quite small.  And this is not surprising, because square meters on this street in the nineteenth century were in incredible demand.  Therefore, the courtyard of the Baryshnikov estate in Moscow was not so large.  To hide this flaw, the architect pushed forward the portico, widely used in the architecture of classicism.  In addition, he raised the columns to a high base, moving them far away from the wall.  The facade turned out to be magnificent and incredibly solemn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Outside, the walls of Baryshnikov's estate were plastered and painted in bright yellow, characteristic of classicism.  At the same time, such individual parts as the socle, horizontal belts and columns crowning the cornice, were made of white limestone. </p><h2>  Address </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.76722299999999" data-lng="37.642742" data-type="hybrid" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/4/8/7/9487.png"></div><p>  Today Baryshnikov‚Äôs estate has become the press mansion of the newspaper AiF.  It is an architectural monument and is under state protection.  Estate address: Myasnitskaya street, building 42. </p><div class="photo" data-original="welcome2018.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="AiF Press Center" class="if uuid-2860038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2860038.jpg"></div><p>  You can get to it by public transport and by metro, getting off at the Sretensky Boulevard station. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The estate of Baryshnikov during the fire of 1812 miraculously survived.  But, unfortunately, it was completely plundered by the French.  The then owners - the Baryshnikov family - then had to restore their clan nest for a long time.  The mansion belonged to this family for several decades.  Then he passed into the hands of the Begichevs nobles, and then to Peter Beketov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After the revolution, Baryshnikov's estate was transferred to the state.  By decision of the Soviet authorities, a hospital for workers was set up in it.  And already in 1922, the building housed the Scientific Research Institute of Sanitary Education of the Ministry of Health.  But in the Soviet years, Baryshnikov‚Äôs estate suffered even more than from the ruin of its rich decoration by the French army.  Much has irretrievably disappeared; it cannot be restored. </p><h2>  Uniqueness </h2><p>  Matvey Kazakov, who built the mansion on Myasnitskaya in the shape of the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù, was able to achieve the original layout.  She allowed to include in the new building the existing old chambers of the seventeenth century.  According to experts, such private houses can be called palaces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.welcome2018.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unique facade" class="if uuid-2860014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2860014.jpg"></div><p>  At the time when the estate belonged to Begichev, she won the fame of one of the most popular cultural centers of the city.  Poets, writers and composers were frequent guests here - V. Kyukhelbeker, D. Davydov, A. Verstovsky, V. Odoevsky.  Begichev also spoke closely with Griboedov.  Moreover, in the winter of 1824, the latter worked on his famous masterpiece in the chambers located on the left side of the estate.  The guests of this mansion were such bright figures of the era as Leo Tolstoy, many representatives of the Decembrist society. </p><h2>  Interior interiors </h2><p>  Strictly elegant portico in the estate is opposed in the left wing of an ordinary residential entrance.  The front door leads into the front lobby, which is divided into two columns by columns.  They are located in a semicircle and smoothly lead to the main staircase.  At the base of the stairs is a three-meter mirror, visually doubling the space. </p><h2>  Halls </h2><p>  The first living room is green.  Its ceremonial portals, framed by marble columns, crowned with antique bas-reliefs, create an additional play of light and shadow. </p><p>  There are two mirror compositions in the green room: a group of nymphs crowning a garland of roses from Eros, and a muse in round medallions. </p><p>  A pink living room overlooks the front yard.  Although it is less green, but thanks to the stucco molding and marble columns, it seems more elegant.  The oval hall of the estate is decorated in elegant elegant gray tones.  On its beautiful ceiling vault recesses are made in the form of rhombuses.  The latter are beautiful paintings, giving the ceiling volume and height. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior decoration" class="if uuid-2860024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2860024.jpg"></div><p>  Behind the door on the east side is a narrow corridor leading to the office building.  In Baryshnikov‚Äôs mansion, the system of moves was carefully thought out so that the staff did not interfere with distinguished guests. </p><p>  But the most luxurious room of the estate on Myasnitskaya is a hall for magnificent balls and celebrations.  This living room was once known throughout Moscow.  The hall is usually called ‚Äúround‚Äù, although in fact its walls outline a square.  The reason for this name is that the round colonnade, built on the principle of the Roman pantheons, completely changes a person‚Äôs perception of this space. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.welcome2018.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mansion on Myasnitskaya" class="if uuid-2860010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2860010.jpg"></div><p>  The round room has a balcony, elegantly designed and designed for musicians.  Its bas-relief depicts Apollo surrounded by muses.  The entrances to the buffet and the dining room are symmetrically located on both sides. </p><p>  The ceiling is decorated with paintings: rosette flowers located throughout the golden ocher arch, gradually decreasing, turning a flat surface into a dome. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the most impressive room in the estate is considered her front bedroom.  According to the customs of that era, it served not only as a sleeping room, but also as an office where the most important visitors were received. </p><div class="photo" data-original="um.mos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stunning interiors" class="if uuid-2860026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2860026.jpg"></div><p>  In the early 90s of the last century, the mansion was leased to the newspaper Argumenty i Fakty for long-term rent.  Reviews of Baryshnikov‚Äôs estate indicate that since the time the new owner appeared at the house, they began to treat the mansion with due respect as an architectural monument, and not just as a state-owned house.  Today it is preserved almost in its original form, delighting the eyes of tourists and Muscovites.  It is said that during his press conference at the estate, the famous Catherine Deneuve was struck by its interiors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arhitekthall.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Round Hall" class="if uuid-2860037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2860037.jpg"></div><p>  Today, everyone can enter the mansion to personally see the beautiful facades, amazing interior and interior decoration of this architectural monument, which has perfectly preserved its appearance to our time. </p>
