Old Europeans and Russian tourists love this place very much.  The beach area, strewn with white sea sand, in this paradise is stretched for as much as 27 kilometers.  Impressed tourists say that walking on this sand is very pleasant, but under your feet you can constantly hear a creak that looks like snow. </p><h2>  Legend of goa </h2>

    <p>  One interesting legend tells about this place, which resembles a Russian fairy tale about a frog princess.  It tells that Parasurama shot into the deeps of the bow, after which she parted and at the place where there was water, this same village arose, which at first served as a refuge for fishermen.  Today it is a famous resort for wealthy Russian citizens and foreign pensioners. </p><p>  This village is located just 7 kilometers from the tourist "heart" of the island - Margao.  Nearby there are two beautiful beach areas - Colva and Varca. </p><h2>  Placements </h2><p>  On the one hand, finding housing in Goa will not be difficult, since there are many offers, and on the other hand, everything here depends entirely on the time of year, because in the summer a huge number of tourists come here to enjoy the gentle sun.  Regarding the choice of time for a trip to Goa, the optimal period is from the beginning of February to the end of March.  A suitable place can be found without problems, there are not very many people, and trade is not so active, respectively, prices are low. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for housing, vacationers with experience recommend renting small houses, the rental of which will cost only 400-500 rupees.  Housing, which is located close to the sea coast, is always valued at least 2 times more expensive, that is, from 800 to 1000 rupees.  A good option for accommodation can be the Failaka Hotel 2 * hotel (India, <span>South Goa,</span> Benaulim). </p><p>  In Benaulim, those people who do freelance work and earn a living like to stay.  The thing is that it is very difficult in other places to find the atmosphere of solitude, which just provides inspiration for engaging in free remote earnings. </p><h2>  Hotel Failaka 2 * (Benaulim).

    <p>  According to reviews, the hotel is pretty clean and comfortable, there is daily cleaning, only you need to leave the room keys. </p><p>  The owners of the hotel are incredibly friendly and open people with a good heart.  The friendly staff is always smiling and ready to help at any moment.  Upon arrival, each guest is presented with gifts in the form of flowers and juice.  A trifle, but pleasantly and immediately plunges into the atmosphere of relaxation. </p><h2>  Room Service </h2><p>  If possible, it is better to choose corner numbers.  They have huge balconies with wonderful views of the flowering garden. </p><p>  Sets for tea parties are not provided, so tea lovers need to bring everything they need with them.  The bedding is clean, all the furniture, although not new, is also clean and in good condition.  The hotel itself and the grounds are very well maintained.  Restless staff is constantly washing and sweeping something.  Of the negative aspects, an abundance of ants is noted, from which you need to hide all the provisions purchased in the city, hanging them on clothespins.  For breakfast, only boiled or fried eggs, butter with bread and tea are offered, which is not always enough to eat properly.  But this does not upset at all, since during breakfast you can be saturated with the surrounding beauty.  Meals are served in the beautiful garden. </p>

    <p>  True, some points to the Russian tourist may seem strange.  For example, jam is served only with fried eggs.  And we used to smear it on toasts.  There are other combinations of products that are not customary to use together in our country.  But sometimes it‚Äôs really delicious.  From desserts there is only a fruit salad made from local fruits. </p><p>  The restaurant is very popular with turtle soup and a <span>shark</span> dish <span>,</span> which is prepared in advance by order.  This is delicious.  The dish is traditionally served with a vegetable side dish and nicely complemented by design.  Another of their "crown" - a delicious soup of lentils and seafood. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  On the beach there are umbrellas and sun loungers, for the rest of which you do not need to pay.  There is also a bar with cool cocktails and soft drinks.  The water in the sea is very warm, but muddy, which upsets. </p><p>  On the beach you can meet not only many tourists, but also dogs who are not at all afraid of people, on the contrary, beg and caress. </p><p>  What else seems very unusual and a bit strange is that a herd of cows is brought to the beach every evening to wash them.  In India, a cow is considered a sacred animal.  The land where it steps is immediately sanctified.  The same can be said about water.  Some reassure themselves by bathing in the holy waters.  Also, many vacationers say that in areas of the local sea very often find sea snakes, stingrays and other unwanted neighbors.  This fact is very scary, sometimes in the sea I do not really want to go at all. </p><p>  Prices in local markets are very reasonable, for 300 rupees you can buy a very beautiful locally made stole made of bright fabric.  Medicines in pharmacies are very high quality and relatively cheap, if we draw an analogy with Russian prices.  The audience is mostly foreign, but everyone speaks English, which facilitates the dialogue process.  The staff also speaks English, all very friendly and polite.  Pleased with the availability of doctor services.  In Goa, this may really be needed. </p><p>  The climate there is very hot and humid, therefore it is hard to go on excursions to the beach during the day.  The only sad thing is that the hotel does not have services for children, as couples with kids also go there.  In the library all the books are very interesting, informative.  Parking near the hotel is really free, and for each car there they are responsible, so to speak, with a "head".  In general, a good hotel that will appeal to many who like a relaxing holiday by the sea. </p><h2>  General impressions.  Positive points </h2>

    <p>  To summarize the above, we can draw the following conclusions about the hotel Failaka Hotel 2 *. </p><ul><li>  Friendly staff. </li><li>  Gifts upon check in. </li><li>  Gorgeous view from the rooms. </li><li>  Purity. </li><li>  Picturesque garden on site. </li><li>  Unusual but tasty food. </li><li>  Doctor's services. </li><li>  Clean, fully equipped beach. </li><li>  Warm sea. </li><li>  Low prices in nearby markets. </li><li>  The presence of the library. </li><li>  The presence of secure parking. </li></ul><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  There are also some negative aspects that can overshadow a stay at the hotel, namely: </p><ul><li>  Periodic invasion of ants. </li><li>  Room amenities are not provided. </li><li>  Modest breakfast. </li><li>  The presence of animals on the beach. </li><li>  At sea, you can meet unwanted neighbors in the form of stingrays and other marine life. </li><li>  Few Russian tourists. </li><li>  There is no rest with children. </li></ul><p>  In general, we can say that all the negative aspects are individual.  For some tourists, many of them may seem even the advantages of this place.  After all, not everyone can relax normally when the hotel is full of noisy children.  Lack of food can be easily compensated by visiting local restaurants and cafes located within walking distance. </p>
