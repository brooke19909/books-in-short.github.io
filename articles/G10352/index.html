What to see in Fiji</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>An island nation that</span> annually attracts tourists from all over the world is often compared to paradise on earth.  Here, the unsteady line between the real world and the tale that all the guests of the state in Oceania fall into is erased.  Eternal summer makes this exotic corner a popular holiday destination. </p><h2>  Where is Fiji located? </h2><p>  Melanesian country, consisting of more than 300 islands, is located in the south-west of the Pacific Ocean, on the archipelago of the same name.  The state located east of Australia owes its appearance on the map to three Europeans. </p><h2>  History of the discovery of the archipelago </h2><p>  In the middle of the XVII century, the Dutch navigator <span>A. Tasman</span> discovered several islands on the archipelago.  Later, an English explorer <span>D. Cook</span> appeared on this territory <span>,</span> who did not dare to step ashore, fearing locals who did not disdain cannibalism.  The military sailor gave the name to the country and put it on the world map, which was already prepared by another British captain, who was with his team off the coast of the future state.  At the end of the 18th century, W. Bly described almost all <span>Fiji islands</span> as part of an expedition and spoke about the indigenous population with dark skin color. </p><p>  In 1970, the republic gained its independence, and from that time begins the countdown in the development of the tourism business. </p><h2>  The main attraction of the state is nature </h2><p>  To this day, an inexhaustible stream of guests of the state provides a unique ecosystem, amazing landscapes, a comfortable tropical climate and amazing hospitality of the inhabitants of Fiji.  Sights of the state, miraculous and created by man, become the subject of admiration for all vacationers away from the noise of megacities.  Tourists freeze with delight when they see the island world in its original form, and a significant distance from civilization positively affected the unique nature of the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sleeping giant gardens" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1356231.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Having visited the pacific Gardens of the sleeping giant, one can see well-groomed ponds with lilies, quietly murmuring fountains, a small house in which the actor lived, a tea house.  But the main decoration of a quiet corner is the collection of orchids and other exotic plants.  A compulsory point of excursions for everyone who arrives on the islands will be visiting the fabulously beautiful garden that works on all days except Sunday. </p><h2>  Main island </h2><p>  The large island of Viti Levu in Fiji is the first thing that tourists come to see.  This is where the international airport is located, hosting more than a million travelers a year.  The largest cities of the country are located on the main island, and in the southeast lies the capital of the state of Suva, famous for its architectural monuments and a variety of shops. </p><p>  A large highway runs along the coast of the island, which you can drive around in a day, however, numerous excursions last several days and include all the most popular places in Fiji.  Sights of the island will surprise even the most demanding tourists. </p><h2>  What to see on Viti Leva? </h2><p>  The Cathedral of the Holy Trinity will delight you with its attractive appearance and well-groomed surrounding area.

    <p>  An important cultural institution is the Fiji Museum, located in the botanical garden.  Ancient artifacts about three thousand years old will tell about the history of the country and introduce with everyday objects of the indigenous population. </p><p>  Koroyanti National Park is located on the island of Viti Levu, and anyone who is interested in the culture and customs of local residents should visit the conservation area.  Six villages located on the territory will introduce the traditions of the natives. </p><h2>  Naihehe Caves </h2><p>  Many tourists who visited the country speak of an excursion into the underworld as the most interesting event.  All travelers who fly to Fiji dream of visiting the caves, which used to be a shelter for ancient tribes who fought in numerous wars.  Sights will attract attention with underground waterfalls, clusters of bizarre stalagmites, and the ritual hearth on which the natives roasted the enemy will cause mixed feelings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiji Attractions" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1356226.jpg" width="600"></div>
