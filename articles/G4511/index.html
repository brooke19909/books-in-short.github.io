    <h2>  The general history of the appearance of the circus in Kiev </h2><p>  Before you talk about how the Kiev Circus arose, which today bears the title of national and is located at 2 <span>Victory Square</span> , it is necessary to mention how such entertainment appeared in the Ukrainian capital.  It all started in 1797, when the famous Contract Fair was transferred from Dubno to Kiev.  Since ancient times, no fair or market square has been complete without performances staged by theatrical vagrant troupes. </p><p>  That is why in Kiev, on Kontraktova Square, in addition to shopping counters, circus tents appeared.  They were erected from the boards: several rows of benches were arranged around the arena.  They were intended for a wealthy public.  The poor audience was located in the so-called corrals - standing places located behind shops.  In the center of the arena stood a pillar that supported a canvas or calico dome. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Both local artists and troupes from abroad performed in these booths. </p><h2>  Circus in Kiev in the 19th century </h2><p>  The stationary Kiev circus, the one that is known to the audience today, appeared only in the 60s of the last century.  And until the middle of the XIX century in the <span>capital of Ukraine</span> there was no permanent circus.  For regularly held performances, the artists used wood decorations, which were characterized by mobility.  From time to time, a temporary circus was installed, covered with a tarp.  One can speak about the stationary circus in Kiev since 1868.  At this time, the Frenchman Auguste Bergonye bought a land plot, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich reached 1059 soot <sup>2</sup> .  The site was located at the crossroads of modern Pushkinskaya and B. Khmelnitsky streets.  Today it houses the National Academic Theater of Russian Drama. </p><p>  On December 28, 1875, the August Circus of Auguste Bergonier opens in Kiev, which was called Alcazar.  Prince V. Obolensky became the director of the new institution.  Among the guests and residents of <span>Kiev, circus</span> performances were extremely successful.  60 leading artists worked here, actors from the San Carlos Theater and popular English clowns constantly toured.  In addition, the staff of such a circus also had 35 musicians, as well as a stable for 40 animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev circus photo" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1535749.jpg" width="550"></div>

The institution building can simultaneously accommodate 2100 people.  The construction is a monumental three-story building with a colonnade near the entrance.  A semicircular wide staircase leads to the building.  The domed cover is completed by a small tower and a spire.  The architectural design of such a pompous structure was developed by Kiev <span>V. Zhukov.</span> </p><p>  The outer cladding is made in light shades: the columns are finished with Inkerman stone, the walls with ceramic tiles, and the plinths with pink granite.  In order to build a domed cover, the craftsmen used innovative technology.  The surface layer of the dome is five cone-like belts, each of which was assembled from 32 identical reinforced concrete panels. </p><p>  In 1998, the Kiev State Circuit was given the status of national, which provided it from a legal point of view the right to be called the main circus of Ukraine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev circus address" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1535746.jpg" width="600"></div>
