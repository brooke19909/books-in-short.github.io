But the tourist is not the only beach alive.  There are also <span>sights of Montenegro,</span> which are worthy of visiting and <span>seeing</span> them.  Moreover, this country is convenient and compact in size.  If you rent a car, you can go around it all in just a day.  There are places here without visiting which, you will not say proudly: "I managed to visit Montenegro!"  Sights, photos and descriptions of which you will see in this article, can be called business cards of this region.  So, let's start our list of "mast si" in Montenegro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touropia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro attractions what to see" class="if uuid-2259828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2259828.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get and when it is better to go </h2><p>  Since Russians do not need a visa to Montenegro, it is easier to enter this country than into the Schengen zone.  There are two international hubs.  One of them is located in Podgorica, the second - in Tivat.  Airplanes regularly fly from Moscow to Montenegro.  Montenegro Airlines will quickly get you to the capital of the country.  And you can get to Tivat by Aeroflot and Ural Airlines.  In the high season, many charters scurry between Russia and Montenegro, but if you want to see the sights of Montenegro, the best time to visit the country is spring and autumn.  Firstly, it‚Äôs not so hot and not cold yet, and secondly, there is no such influx of tourists, and you can rush to enjoy the local beauties without haste.  In addition, at this time, accommodation prices are not so high, and you can save on a hotel or apartment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cosmopolitanme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tivat Montenegro Attractions" class="if uuid-2259843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2259843.jpg"></div><h2>  Tivat, Montenegro </h2><p>  You can explore the sights of the country directly from here if you flew to the airport of this city.  Although most visitors love these places for a huge number of sunny days, beautiful beaches and picturesque bays, the city itself should not be ignored.  In its center stands the ancient Bucha castle.  Once it was a medieval fortress, and then it was rebuilt as a summer residence for the aristocracy.  It was owned by the Buka and Lukovich families.  Now there is not only a museum and an exhibition hall, but also a cultural center.  You can see in this complex a residential building made of white stone, outbuildings, a chapel, fortress walls in several rings.  In the vicinity of Tivat there are also three stunning islands, each of which somehow attracts tourists.  The most picturesque of them - Stradioti (or St. Mark) - love thirsty solitude in nature.  The Island of Flowers is known for the monastery of St.  Michael.  You can swim to them by boat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timetravelturtle.com" data-author=": Michael Turtle, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bar Montenegro Attractions" class="if uuid-2259846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2259846.jpg"></div><h2>  Bar (Montenegro): attractions </h2><p>  This city used to have a different name.  He was called Antibarium.  The fact is that it is located literally opposite the Italian city with a similar name.  Between him and the Apennine Bari goes ferry.  Since the city was under Turkish rule for three hundred years, a lot of architecture of this period has been preserved here.  Firstly, it is an aqueduct of 17 arches, built in the seventeenth century.  This giant water pipe is more like a mountain bridge.  Secondly, it is the old Bar itself, surrounded by walls.  Now almost no one lives among the locals, but old houses and churches have been preserved or recently restored.  The most picturesque of them is the church of St. Jovan of the 15th century.  Tourists love to take pictures of the Omerbashich mosque with the tomb of Dervish-Hassan.  And the main observation deck of the old and new Bar is the so-called "Clock Tower" - a Turkish fortress of the 17th century. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.touropia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Budva Montenegro attractions" class="if uuid-2259835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2259835.jpg"></div><h2>  Budva </h2><p>  But the list of attractions of Montenegro can not do without this city.  Not only is it called the local ‚ÄúRiviera‚Äù, along with the pristine beaches and vibrant nightlife, there are many interesting places here.  The city has a historical center with museums and modern buildings.  Old Budva (Montenegro), the sights of which are collected between its fortress walls, is riddled with winding picturesque streets, and in its center is a ninth-century castle on the territory of which a museum is open.  The city has preserved many Christian churches of early construction.  For example, next to the citadel - two ancient temples - St.  John (7th century) and the Virgin (9th century).  The city is proud of its archaeological museum, in which more than three thousand valuable and interesting exhibits - jewelry, weapons, jewelry ... The very atmosphere of ancient Budva is simply fabulous.  Almost all of the architecture here is Venetian.  Houses are buried in lush, vibrant colors, and authentic zucchini and taverns are even called to drink coffee and taste delicious pastries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touropia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro photo attractions" class="if uuid-2259823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2259823.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>Sveti Stefan</span> and Petrovac </h2><p>  In the vicinity of Budva is one of the most interesting sights of Montenegro, the description of which we present to you.  This is a small rocky island on which red tiled roofs crowded with cypresses crowded.  Everything is unusual here: ancient buildings and ancient churches, streets and picturesque rocks tending upwards.  Even the beaches here are covered with pink sand, and to get to the island, you need to go from the mainland along the spit.  The city is named after the patron saint of Montenegro - St. Stephen.  And a little further south is another pretty place - Petrovac.  It is located in a surprisingly beautiful bay, surrounded by pine forests and olive groves.  There is also a Venetian fortress and many small temples with ancient and rare icons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touropia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro Attractions Description" class="if uuid-2259840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2259840.jpg"></div><h2>  Kotor and the bay </h2><p>  Montenegro's list of attractions would not be complete without this Adriatic resort.  Kotor, which is located at the foot of Lovcen Mountain, is very well preserved, despite the turbulent history of the country and numerous wars.  Its history stretches back to the time of the Roman Empire, when the city was called Acrivius.  He is not only beautiful, but also striking in its atmospheric character.  Walking along it, you should not miss the Cathedral of St. Tryphon with fourteenth-century frescoes and Venetian painting.  There are also other interesting temples: St.  Luke, St. Anne, Our Lady ... And the city is located on the shores of the <span>Bay of Kotor of the</span> same name <span>,</span> which is considered the most picturesque fjord in the Mediterranean.  For this combination of historical and natural beauties, the city was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List back in the late seventies of the last century.  And Mount Lovcen, under which Kotor is located, is one of the symbols of the country.  Having risen on it, you guarantee yourself not only an excellent panoramic view, but you will be able to glance at almost all of Montenegro.  Here is buried the charismatic ruler of Montenegro, Petar Negosh, who managed to overcome the custom of blood feud, from which this country suffered so much in the 18th century.  Its mausoleum is located on the top of the mountain, from where you can see the whole country. </p><h2>  Skadar Lake </h2><p>  And what to see from the sights of Montenegro of a natural nature?  Of course, this is primarily Skadar Lake.  It is the largest in the <span>Balkan mountains.</span>  Part of the lake belongs to Albania, but two-thirds are located in <span>Montenegro.</span>  <span>Its area</span> is almost four hundred square kilometers.  Here, untouched nature is still preserved, numerous species of birds come to nest, and a huge colony of pelicans still lives.  The lake is famous for its stunning scenery, and along its shores and islands are old small towns and villages with ancient temples, interesting monuments, castles and monasteries.  So, having come here, you combine cognitive excursions in the field of history with contemplation of green beaches, forests and rocks.  There are also a lot of fish in the lake.  To see all the interesting places, it is not enough to go around it around the perimeter.  You must definitely go on a boat excursion on a boat.  You can choose a yacht or just rent a boat from the locals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Montenegro" class="if uuid-2259816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2259816.jpg"></div><h2>  Tara and its surroundings </h2><p>  The hit parade of the sights of Montenegro concludes in our article the most beautiful Montenegro river.  It is called somewhat in Indian - Tara.  Its canyon is deep - sometimes more than a kilometer!  - a gorge running through the rocky mountains.  On the way, the river creates rapids and waterfalls, so rafting lovers come here.  By the way, in depth the bed of the Tara River is inferior only to the Great Canyon in the American desert of Colorado.  And in Europe its gorge is the largest.  The canyon is 82 kilometers long.  It is part of the Durmitor National Park, which is located in the mountains of the same name.  The Tara River also has the most famous Djurovich‚Äôs bridge in the whole of the former Yugoslavia, which connects the southern and northern parts of the country.  He is the highest in all of Montenegro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touropia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Montenegro photo and description" class="if uuid-2259830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2259830.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who came to Montenegro not only for the sake of beaches and recreation at sea, wrote that this country is extremely comfortable.  The Russians are happy that there is practically no language barrier, people are friendly.  Photos of the sights of Montenegro often flash in the reports of tourists.  True, some travelers on their own or rented cars are unhappy with the fact that in this country there are constant speed limits.  And since there are many beautiful places, and I constantly want to stop here and there to take a photo, you can go 200 kilometers for all six hours.  In addition, all the beauty is located in the mountains, where you need to get along the narrow and winding serpentines.  Experienced tourists are not advised to travel to natural attractions in the summer - ponds can dry out and become shallow, and you will not see waterfalls.  Nevertheless, in this country there are so many wonderful towns, mountains and forests where you want to get, that there is simply not enough vacation.  We have to come back, and more than once. </p>
