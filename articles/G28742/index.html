  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Useful wisdom for a modern young mother</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The twenty-first century is a time of information, sometimes there is so much that you want to cry and forget, you do not know what to believe. <br><br>  And what to do with all this to a young mother who just picked up a little man?  What is the most important thing, and what should not be forgotten by the mother taking care of the baby? <br><br>  The most important thing in this situation is to remain calm!  Enjoy the minutes spent with the baby.  After all, these moments do not repeat.  That is why allow yourself to relax and enjoy motherhood. </p><p>  With the advent of the child, the usual way of life changes dramatically.  First, the girl lived one life, and now the young mother begins another bright life full of impressions.  And the first wisdom says this: "Count only on your strength."  And be prepared for the fact that not every best friend or girlfriend will give up their business and run to your aid.  Not everyone is ready to change their usual comfort zone and abandon their affairs to the detriment of themselves.  Therefore, determine for yourself what things you can do yourself with the child, and which ones should be passed on to your husband, relatives and friends.  Perhaps at first they will not be happy, but the baby will change their opinion and attitude to the whole world. <br><br>  The second wisdom: ‚ÄúAlways remember that you are a woman who is a mother, a wife, a lover, a mistress, a daughter, and a girlfriend ...‚Äù Not a draft horse!  And if at some point you missed it, pull yourself together.  Only you can understand, support and motivate yourself. <br><br>  From this follows the third wisdom: "Always develop, improve."  Thanks to the information age of technology, development is turning into a pleasant game.  And most importantly, it's all free.  Do not need a lot of money, everything is on the Internet or books.  Great master classes in knitting, embroidery, sewing, <noindex>  <span>scrapbooking</span> </noindex>  fitness, yoga and more. </p><p>  Social networks and search engines are just waiting for you to type the text you want.  And you can do all this without leaving your home.  Your baby is always there, happy that his mother is also close.  And if you have a free minute and you like to read, visit the local library, now employees are trying to replenish the bookshelves with the latest innovations.  Perhaps you can find something useful for the baby and yourself.  For example, surprise with exquisite culinary masterpieces from the cookbook, which was taken in the library. <br><br>  Fourth wisdom: ‚ÄúStop blaming yourself for everything.‚Äù  The baby is crying, you didn‚Äôt have the strength to approach, and you blame yourself for this?  Dirty linen has been lying around for several days, but I don‚Äôt want to wash the dishes at all?  Let it go.  Allow yourself to be not ideal, but a simple weak woman who wants to be herself.  If everyday life has overcome you, find strength in yourself and try to move forward with the music, to sing your favorite song, let it not be a lullaby, but in the evening it will be useful and pleasant to take a warm bath with scented candles. <br><br>  And the fifth tip, watch your figure.  Perform physical exercises daily, this will give more confidence, you can restore the elasticity of your body to the ambassador of childbirth, become more resilient.  A small child requires a lot of attention, this is a motor that never gets tired.  That is why you must become a powerful generator that will supply and fill all your loved ones with its energy <br><br>  And last wisdom, listen to your heart.  Do not go against your desires, sacrifice your own strength, and then wait for someone to appreciate your efforts.  Remember: "No one will appreciate."  Everyone is too busy on their own.  Therefore, take time for yourself.  Happy you, happy your loved ones. </p></div></article>
