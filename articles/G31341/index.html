It seems strange that even 20 years ago, a cell phone was a luxury. </p><p>  However, not everyone knows how to use it.  For example, older people can not always master this miracle of modern technology.  Grandparents and with a stationary device live well.  Here are just children and grandchildren for them exciting.  Therefore, they came to a compromise: let the loved one make calls from his landline phone to his relatives on mobile phones. </p><p>  What if my grandmother does not understand how to call from home to mobile?  Let's teach her using this tutorial article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.socket.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="calls from home to mobile" class="if uuid-2862864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/2862864.jpg"></div><h2>  Where does it all begin </h2><p>  How to dial a mobile number to call in Russia? </p><p>  First of all, we need to know the phone number we want to call.  No need to laugh at this reminder.  When it comes to an elderly person, there is very little chance that he will remember a few long phone numbers. </p><p>  A little tip: write in large numbers the numbers that an elderly parent will have to call.  And hang near the place where the phone is installed.  Or put the list next to the unit. </p><p>  And now we will find out how to call from home to mobile in Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="de.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="call from home to mobile" class="if uuid-2862877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/2862877.jpg"></div><h2>  Calls in Russia </h2><p>  So, we learn to dial the number correctly: </p><ul><li><p>  First dial the number 8. And be sure to wait for the beep.  The fact is that if you start dialing immediately after you dialed eight, the call will not reach the subscriber.  And the caller will hear short beeps, which indicate that the number of the person being called is busy. </p></li><li><p>  Have you heard the long beep after the eight?  Dial the operator code.  What is this code?  The first three digits of the mobile number, coming after the eight.  For example, 916, 906, 926. </p></li><li><p>  And only after the above numbers are dialed, does it come to a seven-digit mobile number. </p></li></ul><p>  Calling from home to mobile, as we see, is not so difficult.  The main thing is to do everything correctly when dialing a number.  We emphasize the need to wait for the beep after the eight. </p><h2>  Calls abroad </h2><p>  The family moved to live abroad, and my grandmother remained in Russia.  We agreed that she would call them every day.  Just did not warn how to dial a number.  Let's figure out how to make a right call from a home to a mobile person who is abroad. </p><p>  The scheme of action is not much different from the above: </p><ul><li><p>  First dial the number 8. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></li><li><p>  Then immediately dial the number 10. </p></li><li><p>  Wait for a long beep, as in the previous version. </p></li><li><p>  As soon as they hear a beep, they dial the country code. </p></li><li><p>  Next, dial the area code. </p></li><li><p>  And only after all the manipulations performed, the subscriber dials. </p></li></ul><p>  Not very clear, I guess.  Let‚Äôs take a look at a specific example. </p><p>  It is necessary to make a call to a mobile person living in Israel.  How to call from home to mobile in this country?  It will look like this: </p><ul><li>  8-10-972-2-subscriber number. </li></ul><p>  Here 972 is the country code, 2 is the city code of Jerusalem.  If the person you need to call lives in Jerusalem, the pattern of action will be just that. </p><p>  Therefore, to make calls abroad you need to know the country code and the city code in which the subscriber is located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phones.vtechcanada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to call from home to mobile" class="if uuid-2862884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78846/2862884.jpg"></div><h2>  If the call does not go away </h2><p>  It happens that you dial someone‚Äôs mobile number from your home phone, and the phone is silent.  No beeps, no mechanical female voice informing that the subscriber is out of network coverage. </p><p>  What to do in this case?  Call again by dialing the number more carefully. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We talked about how to make calls from home to mobile.  There are no special difficulties in this manipulation.  If a person calls in Russia, he needs to dial only the code of the mobile operator. </p><p>  The technique of calls to foreign countries is somewhat more complicated.  How to make a call from home to mobile to someone who lives abroad is described above. </p>
