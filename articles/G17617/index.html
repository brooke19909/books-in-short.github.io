  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do headbands fit in?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Headbands can be safely attributed to the category of accessories that allow any woman to show her personality.  Now on sale you can find a large number of these products, in the manufacture of which manufacturers, as a rule, use various elastic materials.  They can be made in the form of very thin ribbons, and can be quite wide, completely covering the forehead.  Both those and others are in constant demand among the fair sex, as they can simultaneously perform several different functions.  On the one hand, they allow you to fix your hair during sports, on the other hand, these are designer jewelry that brings the finishing touch to the image of a woman.  They can protect against cold in the winter and save from heat in the summer. </p><p>  But no matter what the original shape or color of a given product sold on the market, in a boutique or in a store has, in any case you run the risk of meeting another woman in exactly the same armband as you have.  Therefore, if you want to be the sole owner of this accessory, then it is worth making it yourself.  Headbands can be sewn, choosing a sufficiently elastic material for this purpose, braided with macram√©, or can be knitted.  The latter method opens up great opportunities for your imagination.  Firstly, almost any woman can tie a bandage on her head, since the basics of knitting are taught at school.  Secondly, knitted products can be worn all year round, the main thing is to choose the composition of the threads for the season.  If you knit it from wool, then this product from a <span>fashion accessory</span> will turn into a headpiece that can warm its owner even at very low temperatures.  If you choose threads whose composition is identical in properties or fully corresponds to cotton stretch, then in such a bandage it will not be hot in the hottest summer, and it will be a wonderful addition to a <span>knitted swimsuit</span> or top from the same threads.  Thirdly, knitted products can be very easily decorated not only due to the pattern, but also due to various decorative elements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about how to tie a headband, then there are two ways: </p><ul><li>  crochet; </li><li>  knitting needles. </li></ul><p>  At the very first stage, in both cases it is necessary to connect the base in the form of a rectangle, the length of which will be 3-4 cm less than the circumference of the head, and the width is equal to the desired width of the finished product.  By connecting the ends of the rectangle, you get a blank of the future dressing, which can then be decorated in your own way, for example, with a knitted flower or beads. </p><p>  When making this <span>jewelry with a crochet,</span> it will turn out to be quite dense (with the appropriate selection of density and knitting pattern).  If you choose single crochet as the main pattern, the finished product will perfectly retain its shape, but if the yarn is selected incorrectly, it will be tough.  To avoid this, the composition of the threads should be such that the finished product can stretch, easily returning to its original size.  You can choose the density of knitting due <span>to the number of the</span> hook and the thickness of the thread.  Very often, headbands are knitted in the form of a garland of flowers.  For this, individual elements are knotted, which are then joined together by a hook or sewn together with threads.  Such products are best suited for the summer or in the case of a trip to hot countries. </p><p>  The headbands associated with knitting needles are thinner, easily lose their shape, and therefore they are best worn in the hot season.  If you want to make this accessory for the off-season or winter, you must either choose yarn with the maximum amount of wool (knitting needles in this case must be made thinner), or initially envisage that the product you make is two-layer.  The width of the base in the latter case will be twice as large. </p><p>  As you can see, you can make such a fashion accessory yourself, spending a minimum of time, effort and materials. </p>
