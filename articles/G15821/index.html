However, at another time in Sochi there is something to see.  Since the city underwent significant modernization and reconstruction before the Olympics, it has now reached the level of a modern resort. </p><p>  You can rent a car at the hotel if you wish.  The property allows guests with pets.  However, for this you should first contact the hotel representatives and agree on this issue. </p><p>  The Radisson Blu Paradise Resort SPA (Sochi) has a good infrastructure.  On its territory there is everything you need for a comfortable stay: mini market, gift shops, tennis court.  In their free time, active tourists can enjoy playing basketball and volleyball.

Here you can visit the Roman, Finnish, Turkish and Russian baths.  The hotel also has two pools.  One of them is indoor and is open all year.  The other is open, it has a children's area.  The spa complex has a gym and massage rooms. </p><h2>  Hotel beach <strong></strong></h2><p>  Radisson Blu Paradise Resort SPA (Sochi) has its own beach equipped with umbrellas, sunbeds, sun loungers and changing cabins, and towels are also provided.  Some hotel guests are perplexedly angry at the pebble shore, saying that it‚Äôs uncomfortable to go into the water ... However, I want to note that there are large pebbles on the entire coast of Sochi, so it‚Äôs illogical to expect something else on the hotel‚Äôs beach. </p><h2>  Excursions for vacationers </h2><p>  If you chose Sochi when choosing a place to stay, Radisson Blu Paradise Resort SPA (Sochi) can be a good place to stay.  The excellent location makes the complex very popular with tourists.

    <p>  The complex has its own guarded parking in the open.  Guests can use it for free. </p><p>  At the hotel you can order tickets for the return trip, transfer, taxi.  To store valuables at the reception there are special safe boxes. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel and the beach, you can rent any tourist and beach equipment for hire. </p><p>  The complex has a 24 hour room service.  Hotel guests can use the laundry service if necessary. </p><h2>  Radisson Blu Paradise Resort SPA (Sochi): reviews <strong></strong></h2><p>  It should be noted that the hotel has a category of five stars.  Is Radisson Blu Paradise Resort SPA good?  Reviews about the complex, oddly contradictory.  From the most enthusiastic to the negative. </p><p>  Understanding that any opinion is subjective, we want to dwell on the most basic points. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very friendly and polite.  Registration at the reception, in principle, is fast.  But sometimes at rush hour, queues also happen. </p><p>  According to vacationers, sometimes there are incidents with elevators.  On weekdays, for some reason, only one of the four lifts can work.  But on the weekend all lifts are included.  Naturally, vacationers are not attracted by the prospect of standing in line to get into the room.  Perhaps these are isolated cases related to technical problems. </p><p>  As for food, here the opinions of vacationers differ.  One really liked the dishes, others were not thrilled.  But this can not be a problem, since there is no need to eat only at the hotel.  Near the complex there are enough cafes and restaurants where you can always have breakfast. </p>

    <p>  What can not leave anyone indifferent is the interiors of the hotel and rooms.  Whatever you say, the building was built recently and inside is decorated in a modern way.  The pools of the complex deserve special attention.  Judging by the reviews, the water in them does not smell like bleach.  However, some vacationers complain that the outdoor pool is not heated, which is inconvenient, because during those periods when the sea is dirty, everyone tries to swim in the hotel.  And the water in the pool, unfortunately, is not always warm, especially for children. </p><p>  Guests of the complex note the good location of the hotel.  Proximity to the beach is a very important point, especially in the summer. </p><p>  In the evenings there is animation for adults, so you won‚Äôt be bored. </p><p>  In general, the hotel has established itself on the good side.  Many of his guests note the fact that he fully meets his five-star status, although there are still minor flaws in the service. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the hotel is quite expensive, and therefore relevant requirements are also imposed on it.  Buying a ticket to such a complex, people expect to get the maximum comfort and enjoy your vacation. </p><p>  A pleasant moment is the opportunity to visit the spa complex.  But tourists advise doing this on weekdays, because at the weekend employees of large organizations have a rest in it (apparently, this is a kind of corporate events to encourage people).  At such times, the spa is very noisy and does not relax.  Apparently, the hotel administration practices the reception of groups on the weekend. </p><p>  Not bad in the complex are things with children's animation.  For the youngest guests, entertainment programs are organized that make the vacation unforgettable.  Still, the hotel is focused on couples.  According to vacationers, the complex has a very decent contingent, and there are no noisy, violent companies that violate the measured quiet stay. </p>

    <p>  All minor flaws more than offset by the convenient location of the hotel.  The proximity of the sea is especially pleasing to guests.  For a seaside resort, this is the most important indicator.  Well, in the cold season from the complex it will not be difficult to reach the most important attractions of Sochi, which are worthy of special attention. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Radisson Blu Paradise Resort SPA (Sochi) 5 * - a wonderful modern hotel.  To have your own true impression of this complex, perhaps you should relax in it.  Then you will certainly be able to assess the level of service of a domestic resort. </p>
