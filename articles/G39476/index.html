Street Bolshaya Ordynka</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of Moscow cannot exist without the history of the streets that make up its past, present and future.  Bolshaya Ordynka is a reflection of the human destinies of rulers and priests, poets and artists, merchants and architects, revolutionaries and simple hard workers, who ultimately determined the current look of the street.  It is similar to the chronicle, according to which one can trace the historical events taking place not only in Zamoskvorechye, but throughout Moscow. </p><h2>  Name origin </h2><p>  Bolshaya Ordynka appeared in the XIV century and is one of the most ancient streets of the capital.  There are two main versions of the origin of its name.  The first - along it once ran the path along which the tribute of the Golden Horde, collected in Russia, was carried.  The second and, according to historians, a more reliable version - the Horde lived here, whose duty was charged with delivering tribute, drawn from the Russian principalities, to the Horde. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Even in Moscow it‚Äôs quite difficult to find a place that has survived as many historical events as Bolshaya Ordynka Street saw in its long history.  The Crimean <span>Khan Davlet-Girey</span> once rode on it <span>;</span> she still remembers the Time of Troubles and the Napoleonic Fire of 1812, as well as the revolutionary events of 1917. </p><p>  Its first inhabitants were ‚Äúheavy people‚Äù who forwarded the tribute collected on the territory of Russia to the Golden Horde, and even the interpreters were translators from the Tatar language.  After the settlement was abolished, the small nobility, the middle clergy, merchants and artisans began to settle here.  In the very <span>center of Moscow</span> , land prices were high, and therefore inaccessible to these people, and beyond the Moscow River plots were cheaper.  Some buildings of those times still stand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  At the end of the 19th century, several tenement houses appeared, working until the October Revolution itself, and later Ul.  Bolshaya Ordynka has become one of the most criminal <span>areas in Moscow,</span> where all the zamoskvoretsky shit was going to. </p><p>  During World War II, the street was partially destroyed by bombing.  On the site of the completely destroyed buildings, new ones were built, but the old ones were not touched. </p><p>  I must say that it has not changed much, despite the fact that during the existence of the Soviet Union the capital itself as a whole has changed greatly. </p><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  Bolshaya Ordynka is located in the Central Administrative District of Moscow, which stretches from Serpukhov Square to the Small <span>Moskvoretsky Bridge.</span>  This is the central street of Zamoskvorechye.  Its length is relatively small and amounts to only 1.73 km, but it has a large number of historical monuments - five temples, several estates, mansions and apartment buildings.  It is believed that this is the only one of the streets that managed to preserve all the churches built on its territory. </p>

    <h2>  Catherine's Church in Vspolye </h2><p>  It is located in house number 60/2, Bolshaya Ordynka, <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>The first mention of a</span> wooden temple dates back to 1612.  In those days, we called arable land that was outside the city limits, so the Catherine Church was an eyewitness to the battle of Dmitry Pozharsky and Hetman Khodkevich.  Some historians believe that the main battle of the Time of Troubles took place here, which was the beginning of the liberation of Russia from Polish interventionists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The surviving baroque church was erected in 1766-1775 according to the project of C.

    <p>  The temple of the great martyr Catherine survived not only the Time of Troubles, but also the invasion of Napoleon, but during the Soviet era it was closed and the bell tower was demolished.  For a while his premises were used as workshops. </p><p>  Now the Catherine‚Äôs Church is under the control of the Orthodox Church in America.  Here are placed next to the icons of Russian and American saints, and services are sometimes carried out in English. </p><h2>  Temple of the Icon of the Mother of God "All Who Sorrow Joy" </h2><p>  The stone church was built in 1683-85 on the site where the church of St. Varlaam of Khutynsky was once located.  By 1791, several extensions were made, including a three-tier bell tower, designed by architect V.I.  Bazhenova in the style of classicism.  In 1836, the <span>architect Beauva</span> O.I.  rebuilt the temple again, but in the Empire style.  Later, during the fire of 1812, it was damaged, and then renewed two more times - in 1814 and 1904. </p>

    <p>  Under Soviet rule - in 1933 - the temple was closed, and all the bells were removed.  During the Great Patriotic War, the storerooms of the Tretyakov Gallery were stored in its building.  In the late 40s, the temple was reopened for worship.  Now he has a spiritual and educational center called ‚ÄúAscension‚Äù. </p><p>  At the moment, Bolshaya Ordynka is not being rebuilt.  They decided to restore it in order to preserve a centuries-old history in this reserved corner of Moscow.  According to the plan, after restoration, a reserved historical quarter of the pre-Petrine era will be created here - a kind of open-air museum. </p>
