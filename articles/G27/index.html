To this end, orders and medals were instituted, which were awarded to the most distinguished military personnel, as well as civilians who showed courage and courage in the fight against Nazi invaders.  One of these awards was the medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Caucasus‚Äù (1944).  Today it is kept in many families as a reminder of the feat of fathers and grandfathers. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  Before telling about the medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Caucasus‚Äù, it is worth saying a few words about how the battle for this important geopolitical region took place and what significance the victory of the Russian army in this direction had for the outcome of the Second World War. </p><p>  The beginning of hostilities for control of the Caucasus is considered July 25, 1942.  However, the German General Staff decided to take possession of the territories adjacent to the Don a month earlier.  For this, the fourth tank army of the Wehrmacht had to break through the front on the section between Kharkov and Kursk, and then the city of Rostov-on-Don, which was an important strategic point, was taken. </p>

    <h2>  Battle for the Caucasus </h2><p>  In August 1942, Nazi German forces captured the Shelter of Eleven, the highest mountain climbing hotel in the USSR, located at an altitude of 4130 meters, which the NKVD heroically defended (many of the surviving participants in these battles were subsequently awarded the medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Caucasus‚Äù).  They set the flag of the Third Reich there.  This event was covered in the world press as the completion of the capture of the Caucasus, and Hauptmann Heinz Grot, who carried out this operation, was awarded Hitler the <span>Knight's Cross.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A month after the described dramatic events, German troops captured most of the city of Novorossiysk, and after some time the Sancharsky and Marukhsky passes of the Caucasian ridge.  However, from this moment their progress slowed down, and then it was completely stopped by parts of the Soviet army.  Until the end of 1942, a balance of power remained at the front, which was disrupted as a result of the successes of the Soviet troops at Stalingrad.  As a result, a threat arose around the Wehrmacht forces in the Caucasus, which caused concern of the German General Staff. </p>

    <h2>  Soviet counteroffensive </h2><p>  Large-scale hostilities in the Caucasus have been initiated since the beginning of January 1943.  As a result, the Wehrmacht troops were forced to retreat, so as not to get into the environment.  A few weeks later, Soviet soldiers managed to push the Wehrmacht troops west of Rostov-on-Don, and the first half of February was marked by a landing in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNovorossiysk.  Thus, the "Small Land" bridgehead arose, which played a large role in the liberation of Novorossiysk, the battles for which lasted until mid-September.  By the way, it was there that L. I. Brezhnev distinguished himself, who also subsequently received the medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Caucasus‚Äù, the value of which can now be obtained from the Falerist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In parallel with this, since April one of the largest air battles in the history of wars took place in the sky over the Kuban, as a result of which the Soviet pilots turned the tide in their favor and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Luftwaffe troops. </p>

    <p>  On September 3, Hitler was forced to order the immediate retreat of German troops to the Crimean peninsula.  Thus, by October 9, 1943, RKK units completely took control of Taman, i.e., an event occurred that most military historians consider the actual end of the bloody and fierce battle for the Caucasus.  A similar outcome of the battle played a big role in the fate of the Transcaucasian republics of the USSR.  In particular, they escaped occupation.  In addition, the successes of the Soviet army prevented Turkey from entering the war, who had long cherished the dream of expanding its borders at the expense of the territory of the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Awards: Medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Caucasus‚Äù (general information) </h2><p>  The author of the sketch is artist N.I. Moskalev.  The award was established in May 1944.  The medal should be worn on the left side of the chest and, if the recipient has other USSR awards, they should be placed after the medal given to the participants of the <span>defense of Kiev.</span>  According to the data that were available at the time of the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great Victory, a total of 870 thousand Soviet citizens received it. </p><h2>  Regulation on the medal </h2><p>  This award was presented to all military personnel of the Red Army, the NKVD and the Navy of the USSR, as well as representatives of the civilian population who took a direct part in the defense of the Caucasus.  According to the regulations on its establishment, the basis for this was data that attested to the actual participation in hostilities in this region.  Awards were presented on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Council. </p>

    <p>  Medals ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Caucasus‚Äù were intended for military personnel who actually participated in the defense of the Caucasus for at least three months, as well as from July 1942 to October 1943.  As for civilians, the award was given to people who took part in the hostilities, as well as those who built defensive lines and fortifications, starting in the fall of 1941.  Like other WWII awards, the ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Caucasus‚Äù medal is no longer manufactured.  The fact is that almost all those to whom it should be handed received it, including posthumously. </p><h2>  Medals for the defense of the Caucasus: description </h2><p>  This award in shape and size (a circle with a diameter of 3.2 cm) is identical to most others created during the Second World War, and made of brass. </p>
