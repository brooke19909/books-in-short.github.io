However, such a dilemma often occupies the minds of owners of private buildings.  Indeed, not only the convenience of operating the heating system, but also the amount of monthly cash costs depends on the choice of one of the options.  If you choose at random, without considering the advantages, disadvantages and cost of both heating options, it is likely to make a mistake, the elimination of which will bring great costs in the future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="heizung.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heating with electricity is cheaper than gas" class="if uuid-3150419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3150419.jpg"></div><h2>  Electric heating </h2><p>  This method involves the use of boilers, which are divided into two types, namely floor and wall. </p><p>  The principle of operation is quite simple.  In the steel tank are tubular electric heaters that convert electricity to heat.  These elements heat the coolant, and then, thanks to the circulation of water, the building is heated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.heimhelden.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is cheaper to heat with gas or electricity" class="if uuid-3150423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3150423.jpg"></div><h2>  The advantages of electric heating </h2><p>  Any method of heating a room carries certain advantages: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Availability and ease of installation.  These are perhaps the most important benefits.  In addition, it is not required to coordinate the project, which further reduces the financial costs of implementing the idea. </li><li>  Ease of maintenance.  You must admit that during operation it becomes important not only what is cheaper: gas or electricity.  Equally important is the time savings associated with the fact that this type of boiler is easy to maintain.  In particular, it is not required to carry out preventive maintenance, as well as periodic cleaning of equipment items. </li><li>  Environmental friendliness.  Electricity is an environmentally friendly fuel that allows you not to worry about the environment.  However, it is worth noting that not all homeowners give sufficient attention to this issue. </li></ul><h2>  Cons of heating with electricity </h2><p>  Do not ignore the shortcomings of this type of heating in search of an answer to the question of which is cheaper: gas or electricity.  Let's list them briefly. </p><ul><li>  First of all, the high cost.  In Russia, electricity is considered the most expensive form of energy. </li><li>  It is necessary to maintain constant power to ensure the operation of the boiler. </li><li>  Power outages, which entail the inability to heat the living room. </li><li>  Inconvenience in operation.  Experts say that the use of electric heating is an irrational idea for home owners whose area exceeds one hundred square meters. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="heizung.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the cheaper it is to heat the house with gas or electricity" class="if uuid-3150425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3150425.jpg"></div><h2>  Gas heating </h2><p>  Gas is considered energy-intensive fuel, during the combustion of which a considerable amount of heat is released.  Modern heating boilers are characterized by high efficiency, compact size, the presence of battery life and ease of maintenance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, you need to understand that the boiler itself will not be able to cope with the function of heating the room.  This will require the creation of a heating system that, in addition to the boiler, will include aluminum or cast iron batteries connected by pipes through which water circulates. </p><h2>  The advantages of gas heating </h2><p>  This method of heating a room certainly brings with it certain advantages.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  Cheapness.  The use of this type of fuel is economically advantageous.  <span>Gas heating is</span> cheaper than electricity.  That is why the initial cost pays off as the equipment is operated. </li><li>  Environmental friendliness.  Experts assure that the combustion of gas does not produce harmful substances that can pollute the environment. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.dein-ennigerloh.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heating the house with electricity or gas which is cheaper" class="if uuid-3150426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3150426.jpg"></div><h2>  Cons of gas heating </h2><p>  Despite the advantages, gas heating has some disadvantages.  It: </p><ul><li>  High cost.  Moreover, this does not concern monthly utilities, but initial costs.  To install a gas boiler, you must first conduct gas.  It is worth noting that this is not cheap. </li><li>  The difficulty of installation.  Gas equipment is more difficult to mount than electric equipment.  For this reason, most likely, you will have to contact specialists. </li></ul><h2>  Which is cheaper: gas or electricity? </h2><p>  The answer to this question is obvious.  Many people know that gas heating is cheaper.  This justifies the high popularity of this type of fuel in Russia. </p><p>  If we make a comparison, it turns out that electricity costs about two times more expensive than the energy that can be obtained by burning liquefied gas. </p><p>  Now you know how to heat cheaper: gas or electricity. </p><p>  If your choice is the second option, be prepared for the fact that the amount in the receipt for utilities will be impressive.  Especially in the cold periods of the year when you have to heat the room to a more or less comfortable temperature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wilhelm-meier.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the cheaper it is to heat gas or electricity" class="if uuid-3150427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3150427.jpg"></div><h2>  What is better to heat? </h2><p>  With the answer to the question of which is cheaper: gas or electricity, everything is relatively simple.  However, no one can say for sure what is better to heat. </p><p>  Given all of the above, it is not difficult to conclude that each type of fuel has certain advantages.  Despite the fact that gas boilers are more difficult to install and maintain, modern equipment somewhat eliminates these shortcomings. </p><p>  You already know what is <span>cheaper: heating the house with electricity</span> or gas.  However, this is not the only issue that the potential owner of real estate should take care of.  In addition, you need to pay attention to the convenience of operation, installation, etc. </p><p>  For example, experts do not recommend the use of electric boilers when heating rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãover one hundred square meters.  In addition, improper installation may cause extraneous noise, causing some discomfort when indoors. </p><p>  Gas heating has the advantage of uninterrupted power supply.  Power outages tend to happen more often, causing some discomfort.  Especially in the cold periods of the year, when even a few hours of lack of heating negatively affect one's well-being. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kohl-online.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is cheaper gas or electricity" class="if uuid-3150428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3150428.jpg"></div><p>  If we compare electricity and gas at monthly costs, then leadership remains with the second option.  This type of fuel is the most affordable, and therefore it is precisely it that remains preferred for most residents of Russia.  It is also worth saying that not everyone has a choice.  Some live in non-gasified regions, for this reason they are forced to use electric heating or other alternatives.  However, using gas as a source of heat energy would be cheaper.  That is why some owners of private buildings are not even stopped by the need for upfront costs. </p><p>  What is cheaper to heat: gas or electricity?  After reading the article, you can answer this question without hesitation. </p>
