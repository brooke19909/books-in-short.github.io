What are their features and what to look for? </p><h2>  Choosing an external battery </h2><p>  Cordless batteries for the phone (prices can be seen below) are divided among themselves into three criteria: by capacity, by type of battery and outgoing current. </p><p>  Most of the devices are made of plastic.  If the options are expensive, then they are created from metal and with a waterproof surface.  But such a device is more suitable for those who often go camping and so on.  For everyday use, completely different options are used.  For an ordinary person who needs to recharge his device, Power Bank made of plastic is quite suitable. </p><p>  External wireless batteries for the phone are made for both all models and for individual devices.  They have such a design that they can be attached to the body of the device.  However, you need to understand that such devices are much more expensive than conventional universal batteries.  The latter are noticeably better: they can be used with almost all devices that have a standard port for connecting a USB cable. </p><p>  A good external battery should be at least 2500 mAh.  This figure is suitable for phones.  But what to do with tablets?  For them, it is better to purchase a model with a capacity of 5 thousand mAh.  These minimum requirements will allow you to charge most of the smartphones to 100% at least once. </p><p>  The selection of the battery is also affected by the current strength supplied by the phone.  As a rule, this indicator varies from 1 to 2 Amperes.  Each charger has a special sticker on which all the characteristics of the device are painted.  The necessary voltage is also indicated there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How is the charging process carried out?  It is enough to connect your phone with a cord and the charging process will immediately begin.  Some battery models must first be turned on using a special button.  The battery itself is charged automatically.  It must be "fed" with the same cord from the outlet.  The most popular and best models will be considered later in the article. </p><h2>  <span>Xiaomi Mi</span> Power Bank 16000 </h2><p>  Xiaomi is considered one of the most popular on the market.  It produces a large number of equipment, including <span>wireless chargers</span> (batteries) for phones.  These devices come with two adapters that are of the USB type.  Other cords should be purchased independently. </p><p>  The capacity of the described model is 16 thousand mAh.  Thanks to this battery, you can charge smartphones with average technical specifications, as well as tablets.  It has two connectors - one delivers 1A of current, the second - 2A.  You can find on sale other models from this manufacturer, designed for a different capacity. </p><p>  The average cost for this option is only 2500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cordless phone battery" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1960451.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Canyon CNE-CSPB26 </h2><p>  This battery is quite simple and modest.  Its capacity is only 2600 mAh.  The coloring attracts many: it combines black, white and red.  The device weighs only 75 grams.  It has one port for charging - 1A. </p><p>  Due to the modest characteristics, the device can be purchased for 650 rubles in any store. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  As already clear, there are a lot of external batteries on the market.  They are in great demand.  Unfortunately, the review does not provide batteries for a cordless phone from Panasonic.  This is due to the fact that this manufacturer only supplies batteries to the market and the batteries themselves for smartphones themselves. </p><p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to choose a battery option that fits the store, but you need to consider all the characteristics of your phone and compare it with the proposed batteries.  It is best to choose the first model described, which is notable for its low price, excellent design, small size and excellent power.  This option on the Internet is represented by excellent reviews from consumers who use it to charge many devices: smartphones, tablets, players, and so on. </p><p>  A good option would be Samsung.  This South Korean company has long established itself as a good manufacturer of high-quality devices.  You should take a closer look at this model.  Successful use and a long period of operation. </p>
