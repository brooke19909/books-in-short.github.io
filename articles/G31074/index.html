A complex system of international treaties made this peninsula practically independent of both countries, and liberal tax laws allowed this state to become one of the fastest growing regions in the world. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The history of Hong Kong begins about 30,000 years ago.  According to archaeologists, this is one of the most famous corners of the earth where traces of the activity of ancient people were discovered.  For a long time, this territory completely belonged to China.  During the reign of <span>the Tang Dynasty, the</span> region was known as an international center of commerce.  Hong Kong was known as a major producer of salt, a naval port, and a smuggling center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong country" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1319460.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  The beginning of the Opium War </h2><p>  In 1836, the Chinese government conducted a major review of opium sales policies.  Lin agreed to take on the task of blocking the spread of opium.  In March 1839, he became special imperial commissioner in Canton, where he ordered foreign traders to abandon their opium reserves.  He limited British merchants access to Canton plants and was able to cut them off from supplies.  Charles Elliot, chief trade inspector, agreed to fulfill Lin's ultimatum in order to ensure a safe exit from the opium market for British merchants, and the costs involved should be decided by agreement between the two governments.  Elliot promised that the British government would pay for the opium reserves of local merchants.  Therefore, the merchants surrendered their chests, in which there were 20.283 kg of opium.  Subsequently, these reserves were liquidated with a large crowd. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="british hong kong" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1319490.jpg" width="562"></div>

The eastern people had to pay for the destruction of British property.  The expeditionary force was led by Charles Elliot and his brother in 1840.  Supervised the corps Lord Palmerston.  It was in his petition to the <span>Chinese imperial</span> government that the British authorities did not dispute the right of China to conduct its own opium trade, but opposed the ways in which this trade was conducted.  The Lord considered the sudden tightening of control over opium a hundredfold as a trap for foreign (primarily for the British) merchants, and blocking the supply of opium raw materials presented as an unfriendly and incorrect step.  To reinforce this petition with action, the lord instructed the expeditionary force to occupy one of the nearby islands, and if the Chinese do not properly consider the British requirements, the Chinese ports of Yangtze and Yellow River will block the British ships.  The petition emphasized that British merchants should not be subject to the unauthorized, unfriendly demands of the local administration in any of the seaports of the Chinese empire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="overseas territories of the british empire" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1319458.jpg" width="448"></div>

Thus was born British Hong Kong.  The flag of Great Britain fluttered over the old fortifications of the island, and commander James Bremen took control of the island on behalf of the British crown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="british hong kong flag" class="if" height="211" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1319488.jpg" width="437"></div>  Hong Kong promised to be a valuable base for the British trading community in Canton.  In 1842, the transfer of the island was officially ratified, and Hong Kong "forever" became a British colony.

    <h2>  Colony expansion </h2><p>  The agreement, signed by Great Britain and the Chinese government, could not satisfy either side.  In the fall of 1856, the Chinese authorities detained a ship belonging to China, the registration address of which was indicated by British Hong Kong.  The consul in Canton approached the Chinese authorities with the statement that such detention is an insult of a very serious nature.  The Hong Kong administration picked up the incident to advance its own policies.  In the spring of 1857, Palmerston appointed Lord Eldzhvin as the representative of the British side in resolving the issue of trade and defense, and authorized him to sign a new, more advantageous agreement with China.  At the same time, the British decided to strengthen their positions in the upcoming negotiations, and supplemented their own corps with a French expeditionary force.  In 1860, Dagu Fortress was captured and Beijing was occupied by joint actions, which forced the Chinese authorities to accept British demands.  In history, these confrontations have been called opium trade wars, each of which expanded the <span>overseas territories of the British</span> Empire and ended in the defeat of China.  According to the signed agreements, the British were able to open their own ports, freely move up <span>the Yangtze River,</span> they were returned the right to legally trade opium and have their own diplomatic missions in Beijing.  In addition, during the conflict, the English corps was able to occupy the Kowloon Peninsula.  This plateau was of significant potential value - it was possible to build a city and a new defensive line on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="british crown colony" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1319461.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Expansion and Strengthening </h2><p>  By the end of the 19th century, the colonists sought to expand British Hong Kong for defense.  On this occasion, negotiations began with the Chinese side, which led to the signing of the second Beijing Convention on June 9, 1989.  Since foreign states had already reached an agreement by that time that China‚Äôs sovereignty should not be undermined and territories torn off piece by piece, British Hong Kong received a different state registration.  This allowed China to "save face" in the form of nominal jurisdiction over alienated lands, and the British - in fact, rule Hong Kong on a rental basis.  Hong kong lands have been leased to the English government for 99 years.  In addition, under the jurisdiction of Britain were given 230 islands, which became known as the new British territories.  Officially, Britain entered into temporary ownership of the city of Hong Kong and the rest of the land in 1899.  It had its own rules that were different from the mainland, the courts, the police and customs worked - all that British Hong Kong could emphasize its independence with.  The coin of this region was in circulation throughout Southeast Asia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="british hong kong coin" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1319462.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <h2>  Years of war </h2><p>  Before the outbreak of World War II, Hong Kong led the quiet existence of one of the many British colonies that were scattered across the globe.  With the outbreak of hostilities, it was decided to consolidate the military operation to protect the new British territories with the Chinese authorities.  In 1941, the British signed a military agreement, according to which, when attacking British Hong Kong, the Chinese national army will attack the Japanese from the rear.  This should have been done to ease the pressure of the enemy on the British garrison.  <span>The</span> battle of Hong Kong began <span>on December 8,</span> during which Japanese air bombers virtually destroyed the British air force in one attack.  Two days later, the Japanese broke through the line of defense in the new territories.  The British commander, Major General Christopher Maltby, concluded that the island would not be able to survive for long without reinforcements, so the commander removed his brigade from the mainland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hong kong history" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1319463.jpg" width="600"></div>  On December 18, the Japanese captured Victoria Harbor.  As of December 25, only small centers of resistance remained from organized defense.  Maltby recommended surrendering to the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Young, who took his advice in order to reduce the possible destruction of the city and port.

    <h2>  Japanese invasion </h2><p>  The day after the invasion, Generalissimo Chan ordered the three Chinese corps, under the command of General Yu. Hanmou, to turn in the direction of Hong Kong.  The plan was to start New Year's Day by attacking the Japanese occupation forces in the Canton region.  But even before the Chinese infantry could build their own line of attack, the Japanese broke the defense of Hong Kong.  The British losses were significant: 2,232 soldiers were killed and 2,300 were injured.  The Japanese reported that they lost 1996 killed and 6,000 wounded.  The heavy Japanese occupation brought a lot of suffering.  The city was destroyed, the population left Hong Kong.  The country was experiencing economic and social decline, the population of the British colonies decreased by half.  The Japanese sent the ruling British colonial elite to prison and sought to defeat local merchants by appointing advisory councils and observing their own proteges.  This policy has led to widespread cooperation both on the part of the elite and the middle class, with much less terror than other cities in China. </p><h2>  Japanese occupation </h2><p>  Hong Kong was transformed into a Japanese colony, with the prevalence of Japanese business structures that replaced the British.  However, the Japanese empire had serious logistical difficulties, and by 1943 the food supply in Hong Kong was problematic.  The government became more violent and corrupt, and the Chinese elite was disappointed.  After the surrender of Japan, the transition back to British patronage was painless, since on the mainland nationalist and communist forces were preparing for a civil war and ignored the demands and problems of Hong Kong.  In the long term, the occupation strengthened the pre-war social and economic order among the Chinese business community, eliminating some conflicts of interest, which led to a slight decrease in the prestige and power of the British. </p><h2>  Restoration of Chinese sovereignty </h2><p>  An infusion of American and British money quickly put the colony on its feet.  The post-war development of Hong Kong shows a gradual and then rapid economic growth.  At the end of the 80s, Hong Kong became one of the four "eastern dragons" and successfully holds its position in the present tense.  In 1997, a ceremonial transfer of rights to Hong Kong to the government of the <span>People's Republic of China</span> took place <span>.</span>  The British crown colony ceased to exist, and Hong Kong nominally became part of China.  But the city managed to maintain its own independence and isolation from the rest of the Chinese provinces.  It has its own courts, developed its own rules, has its own administration and customs.  Hong Kong is only partly China, and it is unlikely that it will become part of the overall administrative system in the near future. </p>

    <h2>  Capital of hong kong </h2><p>  Hong Kong is a country with almost no territory.  It does not have a capital in the generally accepted sense of the word.  It can be said that Hong Kong itself is the capital of Hong Kong.  At the same time, various sources indicate that the capital of Hong Kong is Victoria City.  This is a prestigious metropolitan area in which during the period of British rule all administrative and political buildings were concentrated.  After the lease ended, Victoria City became just one of the districts of Hong Kong, so the view that this place is the capital of Hong Kong is outdated and not entirely true. </p><h2>  Modern hong kong </h2><p>  The post-war rapid development of the Far Eastern region led to the fact that modern British Hong Kong has become one of the most dynamic and developed cities in the world.  The almost complete lack of natural resources did not prevent this disputed territory from achieving the highest possible standard of living.  This happened due to the developed legislation, perfect infrastructure and favorable geographical position. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modern hong kong" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1319457.jpg" width="600"></div>
