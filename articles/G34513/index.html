    <h2>  From hoary antiquity to the present day </h2><p>  Pereslavl-Zalessky has a very long history.  The city was founded in 1152.  It was built by Prince <span>Yu. Dolgoruky.</span>  Then the name contained only the first part of the current name as an example of another, even older Pereyaslav-Russian, which today is called Pereyaslov-Khmelnitsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can get there if you go to Ukraine.  This place was founded by Vladimir Svyatoslavovich.  Many archaeologists and historians have worked hard to find out more data about this place.  The starting year was taken as the starting point.  Pereslavl-Zalessky fully justifies the second part of its name, since it was obscured by dense forests. </p><p>  Also nearby were fields that were successfully cultivated.  In a word, in the bosom of the local nature, man had everything that he could need.  It is thanks to the environment that the final version of the name used today was formed, which was fixed in the 15th century. </p>

    <h2>  Development </h2><p>  Many scientists have tried to perfectly study Pereslavl-Zalessky.  The year of foundation is by no means the starting point in the story of it.  Much more important is the period that began with the birth of A. Nevsky in 1220 in Pereyaslavl. </p><p>  His son, Dmitry Pereyaslavsky, the Prince of Vladimir, founded the capital of the northern and eastern territories of Russia on this territory.  In the 14th century, the city became part of the Principality of Moscow.  At this moment, more active changes begin, although almost two centuries have passed since the year of foundation and mention was dated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pereslavl-Zalessky could be attached to the lands of Andrei Alexandrovich, but this was hindered by the letter of the Khan of the Golden Horde, published in 1303.  In accordance with it, the rights of the princes of Moscow were confirmed.  The year of foundation and the first mention of the city of Pereslavl-Zalessky was the beginning of the great history of this settlement.  Local residents showed themselves well in 1304, when a raid was carried out by the Tver detachment, commanded by Akinf, a noble nobleman at that time.  The Moscow army with honor defeated the enemy, not letting him into his house. </p>

    <h2>  Raids </h2><p>  The year of foundation is taken as the point of historical reference.  The Pereslavl-Zalessky year of the first mention is as early as the appearance.  Since then, many significant events have happened here. </p><p>  For example, in 1238, the walls were besieged for five days.  Similar raids were repeated in 1251 and 1281, then in 1282 and 1294.  The city was burned by a prince named Black Fedor.  Then this point attracted the Horde, who took it in 1382 and 1408, as well as 1419. </p><p>  However, in spite of everything, the fortress walls withstood.  Thanks to this persistence, now we can trace what the foundation year of Pereslavl-Zalessky has.  The year of the first mentioning became the starting point of the numerous annalistic information data that scientists found and provided for study to everyone who was not indifferent to the fate of this place. </p>

    <h2>  Historical events </h2><p>  This point, like many during the Middle Ages, had to go through difficult times.  For example, in 1372 there was a raid by Keistut, the prince, who set off another fire. </p><p>  If you trace the life of the village from 1302, governors from Moscow ruled here.  Sometimes he was subordinated to the princes who were newcomers.  In the 15th and 16th centuries there was the patrimony of the Moscow rulers.  From here, fish came as a tribute to the capital. </p><p>  The year of foundation of the city of Pereslavl-Zalessky is just as interesting as its coat of arms, on which you can see the vendace - the fruit of the handicraft, which played the role of a tribute.  It was considered extremely tasty and even gourmet breed, it was not found anywhere except Lake Plescheeva.  Now it can be seen on the pages of the Red Books of the Yaroslavl Region.  and Russia as a whole. </p>

    <h2>  Great importance </h2><p>  In the autumn of 1374, Prince Dmitry Ivanovich from Moscow organized a meeting of the most important boyars and princes.  Statesmen spoke about the problem of the yoke of the Tatars and the Mongols, from which it was urgently necessary to get rid of. </p><p>  In 1608, the fortress suffered from a new enemy.  Then the Lithuanian-Polish invaders invaded here.  Also, the Time of Troubles left its unfavorable imprint.  Beginning in 1688, by order of Peter I, a funny fleet was created here.  Actually, from this moment the shipbuilding industry in the state also developed. </p><p>  In 1692, these works were completed, a celebration was held in honor of the show.  Since 1708, this district has included the Moscow province.  In 1719, the central point of the Pereyaslav province was founded here.  Since 1778, there was a county territory of the governorship of Vladimir, as well as the province with the same name.  In 1929, this place was the industrial region of Ivanovo, and from 1936 - Yaroslavl.  If you go back a little in time, you can trace the creation of a water supply system in 1884.  From 1872 to 1917, the city was under the leadership of the City Council.  Its recreation took place in 1994. </p>

    <h2>  Symbolism </h2><p>  As for the coat of arms, the first option was created in 1781.  He portrayed two golden fish - those very delicious vendace against a black field.  There was also a lion leopard, which symbolized the governorship of Vladimir, a part of which the city was a part of at that time. </p><p>  The modern version of heraldry was adopted in 2002.  If compared with the previous image, now the upper part of the composition is missing, since this territory was no longer part of the previous administrative unit.  Fish depicted schematically.  The flag is very much like a coat of arms, it was approved in February 2002.  The difference is that the background is yellow and the images, on the contrary, are black. </p><p>  Once here, you can encounter a temperate continental climate.  In winter it is cold and cloudy, thaws occur periodically.  This is a great place for a tourist trip and a pleasant stay.  Having been here, you can satisfy not only your imagination and imagination, but also gain a lot of interesting knowledge. </p>
