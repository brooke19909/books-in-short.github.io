Why is it needed, where and how to get it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the innovations in the work of owners of commercial vehicles is a driver card.  What is it and what is its need - it is useful to know for all drivers, because without it availability of work on freight and passenger transport is impossible.  A driver‚Äôs card is an attribute of another car equipment that is currently required - a tachograph. </p><h2>  What is a tachograph </h2><p>  The tachograph is a device that records the speed mode, average driver speed and period of operation.  This allows you to prevent violations of the <span>rules of the road,</span> as well as normalize working hours and rest.  The tachograph is subject to <span>mandatory certification,</span> which will bring tangible benefits when working with law enforcement agencies, providing irrefutable evidence. </p>

The security level of analog devices is lower, which leads to their gradual disappearance from the market.  Cryptographic encryption on digital tachographs guarantees the preservation of accumulated data, preventing their change for personal gain.  Protection is provided by using various types of plastic cards to work on it, including a driver card.  What it is will become clear from a detailed review of this product in this article.  Other types of cards (depending on the category of employee) are:

    <h2>  Driver card: what is it? </h2><p>  A driver card is needed in order to identify the driver.  This is a plastic chip card that is personalized and cannot be issued in more than one instance.  It contains the data necessary to authenticate the driver of the vehicle.  These include information about the work schedule, time for rest and being on the road.  A driver card for a tachograph is issued for a period of three years, after which it must be replaced.  To become the owner of this plastic personal identifier, an individual must meet the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  availability of a license to drive a vehicle of category "C", "D", "E"; </li><li>  lack of a specific person‚Äôs card at the time of application; </li><li>  residence on the territory of the Russian Federation more than 185 days a year; </li><li>  age not less than eighteen years (for vehicles weighing less than 7.5 tons) and twenty-one years (for passenger vehicles). </li></ul><p>  In the latter case, work experience of one year or more is required. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of driver cards </h2>

    <p>  Currently, there are three types of cards in the Russian Federation, depending on the tachograph with which the driver of the vehicle works. </p><p>  1. Card for Russian tachographs with cryptographic protection (card with cryptographic information protection card). </p><p>  2. Card for Russian tachographs without cryptographic protection. </p><p>  3. Map of the international standard when working with the European tachograph (AETR card). </p><p>  The main difference is in the Russian version and such a model as an international driver card.  It is in accordance with the requirements of the European Agreement and Russian technical regulations.  Accordingly, the language of filling data on the cards is different. </p>

    <h2>  The process of obtaining a driver card </h2><p>  A driver card can be obtained by contacting the organization for their issuance.  In this case, it is necessary to provide copies of the passport, SNILS and driver's license, as well as 1 black and white photo on a white background measuring 3.5 * 4.5.  You should also write a statement established by the organization of the sample.  The provision of this information implies consent to the storage and processing of <span>personal data.</span>  Documents can be sent both in writing and in electronic form with contact information.  After the <span>driver card for the tachograph</span> is ready, it must be collected personally.  Sending by mail is impossible, as well as issuance to another person without a power of attorney. </p><p>  Getting the finished card in hand implies responsibility for observing the terms of its operation, preventing contact with other people and using the product only for its intended purpose.  If factors arise that make further use of the card impossible, it must be returned to the organization that made it. </p><h2>  Where can I get a driver card </h2>

Where to get it - you can find out on the official website of Rosavtotrans, which contains a list of all companies that have the right to issue these cards.  It is important that only specialized organizations that have the appropriate license have the right to produce a driver card.  As a rule, they also have the right of admission to the installation of a tachograph.  At the same time, there is a risk of contacting an organization engaged in the manufacture of cards for drivers illegally, which entails both material and moral damage.  In order to avoid such situations, it is necessary to check the organization in doubt on the list of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation.

    <h2>  Card Suspension </h2><p>  The organization that issued the driver‚Äôs card has the right to suspend its operation for the entire period of use in certain cases: forgery, transferring it to other people for use and identifying the fact of receipt using fake documents.  If the driver‚Äôs chip card is used by another person, this is also grounds for suspension.  In addition to factors of improper use, the identifier of the person may be blocked upon personal appeal of the owner due to damage or loss. </p><p>  Repeated renewal of the card is not possible.  When you suspend its work, you must re-apply for a new driver card. </p><h2>  Driver card options </h2><p>  Equally important is the proper operation of a product such as a driver card.  What is it and what is the cycle of work will be discussed below. </p><p>  Before you start the car, you must turn on the tachograph and make identification.  To do this, insert your card into the slot on the left side.  With the right action, a characteristic click is heard and information about the owner is displayed.  Next, enter your location by selecting it from the list or manually entering it.  The movement of transport can only begin after carrying out the specified manipulations. </p>

It is recommended that the data that accumulate in the tachograph be output at least once every 28 days.  They should be stored on another digital device or printed out for archiving for up to 2 years.  This is necessary to verify the correct operation of the tachograph by regulatory authorities.  A 28-day regimen is mandatory, but the more often the data is displayed, the better.

    <h2>  Driver Card Cost </h2><p>  The price of creating a driver card on average varies between 2000-3000 rubles.  In case of loss or damage, the cost of replacement will cost 2500 rubles.  The order is accepted for work at 100% payment.  If there is no possibility of personal registration, almost all organizations offer to make an order on their official website via the Internet.  It is necessary to provide all the required documents and your contact information in order to get such an identity identifier for work as a driver card.  A sample fill is usually attached. </p>
