    <h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  <span>This time, the concept of free layout was the basis of the project and architectural thought.</span>  <span>The authors of the project decided to get away from single multi-section buildings, which today are unlikely to surprise anyone.</span>  <span>As a result, there were freestanding single- and two-entrance houses of varying number of storeys.</span>  <span>The rejection of the long multi-driveways and closed courtyards-wells, so popular several decades ago, allows you to give the project personality and distinguish new buildings from the background of others - this is exactly what all buyers came to.</span> </p><p>  <span>Indeed, in order to get tired of monotonous and outwardly similar projects, one wants something exceptional.</span>  <span>And it is here that you pay attention to the “Basil” (residential complex, Yekaterinburg).</span>  <span>Reviews of the project are mostly positive, residents of the first-stage buildings commissioned underline how comfortable it is to live in a modern multi-story building.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Bright color accents allow you to highlight the case against the background of gray monochrome buildings.</span>  <span>Just looking at the housing estate instantly raises the mood.</span> </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  <span>If you are not ready to put up with the remoteness from the central part of the city, lose access to all objects of the city infrastructure and its attractions, a good option for you will be “Basilik” (residential complex, Yekaterinburg).</span>  <span>The photos clearly demonstrate how a great place for the construction of a new residential neighborhood was chosen by the developer.</span>  <span>For the construction of a new microdistrict, the Kirovsky <span>district of Yekaterinburg</span> was chosen <span>,</span> the pedagogical quarter of Gagarin-Vishnevaya-Mira streets.</span> </p><p>  <span>Residents of the first stage house confirm that the nearest metro station "University" is only 15 minutes.</span>  <span>Transport accessibility did not interfere with the region’s impeccable ecology - the air here is clean and fresh - an excellent option for families with small children who appreciate the opportunity to spend free time in the fresh air.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  <span>The developer paid great attention to the improvement of the adjacent territory to the Basilik residential complex in Yekaterinburg.</span>  <span>The responses of residents who moved to the apartment after receiving the keys, focus on how competently the builder approached the design of the courtyards: lawns and flowerbeds, walking paths were broken here.</span>  <span>In addition, in a small area we managed to place modern sports and playgrounds that meet all the requirements.</span> </p><p>  <span>The problem of the lack of parking spaces with the help of underground parking for 186 cars was correctly solved - at the moment its area is quite enough for the residents of the microdistrict and their guests.</span>  <span>And the ability to isolate courtyards from through traffic provided comfort and peace to all parents, because now children can frolic on the playground even without supervision.</span> </p>
