In addition, the external appearance of the smartphone, its high technical capabilities, can be a confirmation of this.  Given all this, the phones of this brand can really be considered by customers as “cheap iPhone counterparts”.  It is not surprising that developers actively use this “status” for their own purposes. </p>

    <p>  In this article, we will talk about one of the devices that are quite popular on the market, released by the company.  It's about the Meizu M2 Note smartphone.  The phone features are really amazing.  At its low cost, the model also has a very attractive design.  The build quality of the device and its stability are not far behind.  In general, we will not run ahead of ourselves, but simply conduct a more detailed review of the device so that you understand what is at stake. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  Surprisingly, Meizu does not hide its imitation of the main “apple” concern, which sets the fashion in the world of smartphones.  This is reported not only by advertising slogans, but also by the features of the model’s case, its external design.  What’s the Home button, made in the likeness of <span>a fingerprint scanner</span> on the iPhone 5S. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to this “image” a double situation arises.  On the one hand, the device is just a copy, similar to the original Apple, which does not seem at all unusual: in recent years, many companies have produced analogues of “top-end” smartphones.  On the other hand, the situation is also observed in the second, positive aspect.  It's about attractiveness. </p><p>  The customer reviews attributed to the Meizu M2 Note device are called only one of the factors that made them purchase this model.  In addition, this also includes price, as well as appearance.  Despite the fact that everyone perfectly understands where it came from originally and what the Chinese are trying to copy, this kind of design is always successful, which Meizu did not fail to take advantage of in its activities. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The Meizu M2 Note case (we will present the characteristics of the device a little further) is made of polycarbonate, which lies nicely in the hand.  The texture (depending on the model) is matte or glossy - this is up to the user.  The common features, as already noted, strongly resemble the iPhone - these are the rounded corners on the back of the case and the direct transition between the glass and the cover on the front.  To give the model rigidity, a metal base is installed inside, so to speak, a frame. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The back cover of the model should not be removed at all, all functional holes are provided here in the side of the case.  Therefore, it is easy to guess that the SIM card and the memory card get into the phone with the help of special “sliders”, and the slots here open, as in the “apple friend” - with the help of a needle. </p><p>  The general view of the device (the way it lies in the hand and behaves when squeezed) allows us to make a positive conclusion about the smartphone (and its assembly) as a whole.  We were not able to make the Meizu M2 Note (we give the characteristics a bit further) to creak, it did not work to cause a backlash and the course of individual elements of the case.  Therefore, with confidence we praise the Chinese, who so well assembled the phone. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  And now we will pass directly to the filling of the model.  And first of all, let's start with the “heart” of any gadget.  The characteristics of the Meizu M2 Note smartphone show us that the model is equipped with a <span>MediaTek MT6753 processor,</span> which includes 8 cores.  The clock frequency of each (in normal operation) is 1.3 GHz - this is a good indicator.  Due to its high performance, the gadget behaves perfectly when interacting with “heavy” games in the graphical sense, playing them without hitches and any unpleasant “freezes”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  2 GB RAM also has a similar effect - it significantly raises the reaction speed and “liveliness” of the device, its capabilities.  What do users say about Meizu M2 Note?  Characteristics suit them?  The phone is really smart enough, and all this thanks to the “heart”. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The smartphone has a recent classic display, the diagonal of which is 5.5 inches.  With such an indicator, the screen resolution of 1920x1080 pixels seems simply fantastic, which is why the actual image density on the Meizu M2 Note 16Gb (characteristics will not lie) reaches 401 dots per square inch. </p><p>  The quality of the picture can be called very high.  You can verify this both in your own practice, simply taking the phone in your hands, and through an analysis of the technical indicators that are mentioned in the specifications.  So, such a high density can give a very accurate, clear and sharp image, and IPS technology allows you to provide your smartphone with the proper brightness and color saturation, which is also important. </p><p>  On another positive side, I would like to mention the design of the screen.  In this case, the developer applied a method of painting the panel (upper and lower faces).  Due to this, the visual scope can seem much smaller than it actually is.  True, the practical effect of this approach is minimal - this is done purely “for beauty”. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  If we talk about the software that controls the smartphone, it should be noted shell Google Android, which is unchanged on this kind of device.  True, the feature of Meizu M2 Note 16Gb (the characteristics also confirm this information) is that on top of the “native” Android interface, the Flyme graphic add-on is installed here.  It gives the smartphone an interface design (the icons that you see here may be unusual for you if you have not previously worked with Meizu);  some options (for example, SmartTouch function);  and even ways to enter information (by perceiving user gestures). </p><p>  Thanks to this, it can be said that the basis of the device’s work is the familiar Google platform, while the manufacturer nevertheless developed its own set of programs that make interaction with the smartphone more convenient and comfortable.  It is also worth saying that Meizu continues to support its “shell” by releasing all new updates.  You can download them directly through a Wi-Fi connection (without installing additional programs). </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Of course, describing the <span>Meizu M2 Note phone, the</span> characteristics of the device, you must also indicate the capabilities of its camera.  After all, the function of photography and video are key to any smartphone. </p>

    <p>  As indicated in the documentation, the device has a camera whose matrix has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  This is enough to create colorful, clear and color-rich photos.  Such they come out, at least when a picture is taken in good light.  In other conditions, slight changes to the picture may occur.  User reviews note that it is best to use the Meizu M2 Note camera (whose technical characteristics you already know) to use for private shooting - create an avatar on a social network, photograph a text and so on. </p>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Another important point is the autonomy of the device.  It directly depends on how much battery the battery has.  In the case of the M2 Note, the developers used a battery with a capacity of 3100 mAh.  Given, however, a bright screen and a powerful processor, the charge will last only for 10-12 hours of active use or 1-1.5 days of moderate load. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Not for nothing that the mobile phone that we described above is so popular.  As the characteristics describing the Meizu M2 Note Mini show, the device is really good in all plans.  It looks great, has an adequate price, has the broadest functionality and, in addition, it boasts stable operation. </p><p>  Buyers clearly praise the device, positively note its qualities and make reviews in which they clearly recommend purchasing such a model.  All this, as you know, is favorably displayed on the image of the entire company.  Over the past years, the smartphones of this brand have become quite expected in world markets. </p><p>  The question is, what else is needed from a smartphone of this class?  Apparently, the developers at Meizu asked this question when designing this model.  And, it should be noted, they were able to find a solution that can satisfy user requests. </p>
