  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Convening of the first Zemsky Sobor, its role in the political life of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From ancient times in Russia there was a custom to solve the problems that have arisen and to settle the affairs of the whole community, ‚Äúin a collegiate manner‚Äù, despite the fact that the convocation of the first Zemsky Sobor took place only in the middle of the sixteenth century, during the reign of the country by Ivan the Terrible.  The existence of such institutions is characteristic of many European countries that have passed through the stage of estate-representative monarchy in their development.  The first Zemsky cathedrals arose on the territory of England, Catalonia, Portugal.  In Spain, such deliberative institutions were called Cortes, in Poland - Sejm, in Germany - Landtags. </p><p>  So, the Zemsky Sobor is the highest institution of estate-representative power, endowed with legislative functions.  He convened to resolve political and administrative affairs.  In other words, this is a convocation of representatives of different classes to resolve any case of national importance.  The emergence of such an institution was the result of the end of the unification of Russian lands into a single state, the strengthening of the nobility in the field.  In terms of the composition of its members, the Russian Zemsky Sobor was close to the Western European estate representations, but differed from them by the presence of only an advisory function.  European Zemsky Sobor possessed the law.  In Russia, the decisions of this institution entered into force only after their approval by the tsar and the Boyar Duma. </p><p>  The convocation of the first Zemsky Cathedral in Russia was timed to the beginning of the reforms of Ivan IV the Terrible.  Its structure included the higher clergy, boyars, princes, wealthy citizens, representatives of the nobility from different provinces of the country.  Zemsky Cathedral conditionally consisted of two chambers.  One of them included the boyars, treasurers, butlers, the other - nobles, <span>boyar children,</span> military leaders.  Each convocation of the Zemsky Cathedral lasted, as a rule, no more than two days.  Three times the tsar spoke at it, after which the boyars could express their opinion on the issue to be solved, in conclusion, a meeting of the Boyar Duma was held.  All meetings were held strictly by order, decisions were made unanimously. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of great importance for the political and cultural life of the country was the convocation of the first Zemsky Sobor in February 1549, proclaiming the transition of the Russian state to an estate-representative monarchy.  Since that time, the role of the nobility in governing the country has grown.  In the course of the convocation, a new code of laws is established and a decision is made on the creation of the Lamentations.  From now on, every people could apply with a petition (petition) in the name of the Tsar and almost immediately receive an answer to it.  Similarly, the petition hut regulated the activities of other government agencies. </p><p>  The first Zemsky Sobor, convened in Russia, was called the ‚ÄúCathedral of Reconciliation‚Äù, and at the same time a meeting of the Church Council was held, which examined the biography of sixteen Orthodox saints and established a church celebration named after their holidays. </p><p>  The convocation of the first Zemsky Sobor, and all those following it, was carried out by a special diploma stating the reason for the convocation and the number of elected representatives.  Often, the population itself decided how many people should sit at the Zemsky Sobor.  Representatives were selected in elections held in various cities of the country in the form of assemblies.  In these elections, people who serve and regularly pay taxes to the state treasury could take part.  Elected representatives did not receive a salary for their participation in the convocation of the Zemsky Cathedral.  Moreover, they had to independently provide themselves with everything necessary, going to such a meeting. </p><p>  All convocations of the Zemsky Cathedral took place, as a rule, in a solemn atmosphere in the Kremlin.  In their honor, a service was organized in the Assumption Cathedral.  In total, over the two centuries of the existence of this institution, a meeting of 57 Zemsky Cathedrals was held. </p>
