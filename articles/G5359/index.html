It all starts with banal things like an alarm clock, business correspondence or a means of communication and ends with a pocket gate to the Internet and an entertainment factory. </p><p>  Nothing can be done with progress, users can only adapt to it by acquiring suitable models.  True, difficulties arise with the acquisition as such.  It‚Äôs easy to explain them - the price of smart devices, including smartphones, is quite high. </p>

    <p>  And given the price in dollars and the rate of the latter, not everyone can afford to buy a flagship device from a well-known company.  Therefore, there will be discussions on the topic of how <span>to choose</span> an inexpensive, but good <span>phone</span> . </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  First of all, you need to determine not with the model and not even with the company that produces mobile devices, but with the operating system.  It is on this issue that a lot of discussion arises, they say which are better and why to choose at all. </p><p>  Such issues should not be addressed, at least in such an article.  It is only necessary to state the fact that today the three most common mobile platforms are iOS, Android, Windows Phone. </p>

    <p>  And it is precisely this choice that you have to make.  Only then questions will begin, like which phones are good and inexpensive touch, etc.  So far, decide on the OS. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's say you have chosen Android as the most balanced option in many respects.  This is reasonable, since there are many companies that produce such products, which means that they will choose from what.  This is a definite plus. </p><h2>  Manufacturer's choice </h2><p>  The problem, how to choose a <span>good inexpensive phone,</span> is that manufacturers to reduce the cost of production refuse some of the things that users need.  Instead, they leave something that can be dispensed with. </p><p>  Phones for the <span>Android operating system</span> are made by many companies.  You can find quite good options from manufacturers such as HTC, Sony, Nexus, Samsung and dozens of other world companies. </p>

    <p>  They differ mainly in design.  Iron, if we talk about a topic such as good low-cost Android phones, is not a determining factor at all.  It will in fact not be the best - hence the low price.  Therefore, you need to focus on something else.  About this a little lower. </p><h2>  Underwater rocks </h2><p>  One of the most serious drawbacks that are good inexpensive phones on this OS is the lack of updates.  The fact is that the next version of Android is being developed today, Marshmallow.  In the meantime, Lollipop has long been launched into production.  You still do not understand what it is about, but wait a second. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite this, good inexpensive phones are equipped at best with KitKat, and this is the last generation.  In most cases, these are even older versions, such as 4.0 and 4.1.  Of course, there is nothing wrong with them, but this is an outdated operating system. </p><p>  This state of affairs does not apply to the largest manufacturing companies.  Those have rights to use the latest versions of the OS.  But the paradox is that phones are inexpensive, but good touch-sensitive phones are simply not produced by such companies.  There is no point in spending money on budget models.  Better to do with a dozen flagships, and they will still be bought.  Just the name of the company is doing its job.  So you have to choose from other options. </p><h2>  Aspects of Choice </h2><p>  Like any other complex devices, the pocket devices discussed now have many characteristics, only by studying which you can make an informed and competent choice.  Regardless of whether the phones are inexpensive, but good, touch phones or not, the technical component remains decisive in this matter. </p><p>  So, you have to deal with many things, but special attention should be focused on the display settings.  Equally important things are the battery and the camera.  Having a little understanding of the hardware, pay attention to the processor and RAM. </p>

    <p>  Enough has been said about operating systems.  Another important aspect is the design of the device.  It is foolish to deny the importance of appearance, but each person has his own definition of beauty, so it‚Äôs not worth generalizing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And only taking into account all these factors, you can understand <span>which phone is good</span> and inexpensive at the same time.  So, you can make an informed choice, and not just point your finger at the first smartphone that comes across. </p><h2>  Display Features </h2><p>  A lot depends on this parameter.  Screen size affects your capabilities during use.  So, determining the range in which you will choose a good inexpensive phone, pay attention to this. </p><p>  The most common diagonal is four and a half inches.  This, you can say, is the golden mean for such devices.  On a display of this size, it is already quite convenient to watch movies, read books and play games, and at the same time it fits in your pocket.  Gadgets with a larger diagonal have a wider range of capabilities, but pants will have to be redone. </p><p>  In addition, devices with a diagonal of five inches and above no longer fall under the definition of low-cost, since they do not make budget devices in this size. </p><p>  In this matter, in addition to size, also look at the resolution.  This is a determining factor for image quality.  If you take a diagonal of four and a half inches, then a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels will be quite enough.  Less - the quality will be quite low, and if higher, then the price of a good inexpensive phone will increase.  However, if you find a <span>budget mobile phone</span> with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, share it with everyone - it will be very interesting for people. </p>

    <h2>  CPU and memory </h2><p>  Good mobile phones are inexpensive because the manufacturer managed to find a balance between the price of components and their capacity. </p><p>  With the processor you need to pay attention to several key indicators.  First of all, this is a model and generation - they can be recognized by copying the name from the description into the search engine.  Then just read what knocked out in the first few links.  Find out whether to take such a thing.  The second parameter is the clock frequency.  You should know one thing: the bigger it is, the better the result. </p><p>  Memory can be operational and built-in - both are always present.  The operative determines the number of possible operations that are carried out simultaneously.  A good inexpensive phone usually has a parameter of one GB, although you can find both 512 MB and 2 GB.  It is preferable, of course, the last option.  But one ‚Äúgig‚Äù is quite enough for your daily work.  If the memory is less, then it‚Äôs impossible to say what speed will be. </p><p>  The internal memory determines how much information can be recorded without external devices.  In general, this indicator is not critical, the main thing is that the phone has a slot for a memory card. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Which phones are good and inexpensive, touch-sensitive at the same time with these parameters? Here, the run time plays a big role.  Power may not be very large, the main thing is that you have enough for everyday tasks.  But charging the device every couple of hours is not very pleasant.  And it does not depend on its price. </p>

    <p>  So choose the largest indicator you can find.  For budget options, a characteristic of two thousand mAh, plus or minus two hundred, is characteristic.  If you find something more, and even suitable for other parameters - take it without hesitation. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  If you can not imagine life without photos, then pay attention to the camera built into the phone.  In fact, in modern mobile gadgets there are usually even two of them - on the rear panel and the front one, designed for selfies.  The first is better than the second by definition. </p><p>  Pay attention to such parameters as the number of pixels, the flash or its absence, as well as additional features like autofocus, face recognition, etc. </p><p>  For most low-cost models, a characteristic from 8 to 13 megapixels is characteristic.  This is quite enough for high-quality amateur photography in a friendly environment (without rain, fog and in normal lighting). </p>

    <h2>  How to find out what you need? </h2><p>  In fact, the determining factor when buying a smartphone is the requirements for it.  That is, not to its technical characteristics, but to what you are going to do with it.  This side of the issue is not always thought of, but it is very important. </p><p>  Ask yourself what exactly do you need from a new phone?  Then you can set the necessary search parameters in the online store.  By the way, the requirements can be very different, up to ‚Äúimpress with their steepness‚Äù - of course, this option is not in the menu, but you can rely on the brand, design and size of the display. </p><p>  On the whole, it cannot be said that, they say, the best and cheapest phone is this one.  And do not pay attention to others.  This is not how it works.  A low price means a decrease in the quality of work for one of the functions that were mentioned earlier.  So you still have to choose between speed, a large screen, a high-quality picture, a good camera, expensive glass, a company name, etc. The list is quite long.  And with this you have to work. </p><p>  So, we figured out how to choose a cheap, but good phone. </p>
