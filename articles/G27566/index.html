It is located in a quiet bay, right next to a gorgeous mountain range.  It has a very beautiful architecture, typical of many cities in Dalmatia.  Around the town there are two peninsulas - St. Peter and Oseyava. </p><h2>  Description of the city </h2><p>  Makarska (Croatia) is a calm place that pleases with good weather and pebbly clean beaches.  The architecture of the Middle Ages, baroque palaces, as well as modern hotels contrast in harmony here.  It is from this settlement that the Makarska Riviera originates.  Croatia has been famous for tourism for many years, and this city is considered one of the best places in the country. </p>

    <p>  Here is a chic fountain in the old Venetian style.  The famous cape of St. Peter divided the city coast into two parts.  In the eastern bay there is a port with a marina.  The western bay is a recreation area for tourists with a large number of beaches.  There is a long promenade of Marinet, many cozy cafes, restaurants, clubs and a spacious pine alley. </p><h2>  What good is there at this resort? </h2><p>  On one side of the resort are the majestic Biokovo mountains, on the other - the endless expanse of the sea and islands.  Unfortunately, there are no sandy beaches, but there are quite a few pebble beaches.  In width they do not exceed 6 meters.  At a distance, around the peninsula, there are several rocky <span>wild beaches.</span>  If you wish, you can sunbathe here as much as you like. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If tourists go to rest with their children, that is, individual beaches in a small forest.  Some places are equipped with showers, toilets and changing rooms.  Since it‚Äôs not very convenient to sunbathe on the stones, it‚Äôs better to rent a deck chair and purchase special shoes. </p><p>  For young tourists there is plenty of entertainment here: a playground, attractions, tennis courts, places for playing volleyball and basketball, trampolines, water slides, pedal boats and scooters for rent. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to this city </h2><p>  In order to visit the wonderful city of Makarska (Croatia), you must first make an air flight to the airport of the neighboring city of Split.  It is located at a distance of 70 km from the desired resort. </p><p>  Transfer from the airport can be booked in advance at the hotel or at the lessor's villa, so that tourists will be met at the airport and delivered to the place.  If you failed to take care of this in advance, then there is the opportunity to take a taxi.  Service prices here rarely deviate from a fixed figure of 100 euros.  As for public transport, this is a very inconvenient option (many transfers). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel selection </h2><p>  Hotels (Makarska, Croatia) are not inferior in terms of stardom and comfort to the best in the world.  This is because it is the most popular resort in the country and the infrastructure here is well developed.  There are several available accommodation options in the resort of Makarska (Croatia): rent an individual apartment or hotel room.  This is not to say that this country offers cheap vacations, but by European standards there are reasonable prices - people with different incomes can relax. </p><p>  For example, Apartments Petrovic is located in the very center of the city, which facilitates the search for tourists who come to the resort by public transport.  The bus station is not far from the place, just like the sea coast. </p><p>  The hotel is suitable for families and those who come separately.  It is worth noting that there are few tourists (compared to other beaches in this city), which means that vacationers will not have problems finding a free place on the shore.  Each room has a balcony, leaving on which you can see panoramic views of the mountains or the sea.  There is also a separate kitchenette, an equipped dining area, and free internet. </p><p>  In addition, there are more than a dozen other options here, where you can settle down for those who are attracted to Croatia (Makarska Riviera).  Hotels can be rented at different prices, but it is better to choose a room in advance. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment, excursions and attractions </h2><p>  The city of Makarska is very well located - on the very side of the mountain, which attracts attention.  It is not surprising that there are a lot of tourists during the holiday season.  The place is beautiful, located near a picturesque forest and mountains, the infrastructure here is well developed and there are many attractions. </p><p>  For example, tombstones of the era of Ancient Rome (on the territory of St. Philip's Church) are exhibited on the promenade.  No less interesting are the churches of St. Mark and St. Peter, as well as the Franciscan monastery, which was founded in the early 13th century. </p><p>  You can go on a boat trip to nearby islands.  For young people there are many nightclubs and restaurants.  In addition, tours to interesting places are constantly organized. </p>

    <h2>  Makarska (Croatia): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have been here note that this is a great place to relax.  However, the price of seafood here is too high, given the fact that the city is washed by the sea.  Dinner for two at the restaurant will cost at least 60 euros.  Although the food is excellent, the portions are rich.  You can go on an excursion to Plitvice Lakes, they are very picturesque and you should definitely visit them.  On some beaches you can find conifers, which is a lot of surprise for those who came here for the first time. </p><p>  Makarska (Croatia) has the most positive reviews, because it has a good climate, affordable prices and friendly locals.  The city gives the impression of spiritual harmony of man with nature, which allows you to relax spiritually and physically. </p>
