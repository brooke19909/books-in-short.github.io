Moving in space and time</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As early as the first century BC, paranormal events occurred with various people and objects.  Many scientists have devoted their lives to the study of these phenomena.  The famous American researcher Charles Fort first coined the term "teleportation" in 1931 to describe certain paranormal events and phenomena.  By this definition, he understood the movement of objects and people in time and space.  Is this really possible?  Is human teleportation proven?  How to learn to move in time?  Consider these issues in more detail. </p><h2>  First teleportation </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, as early as the first century BC, paranormal phenomena called teleportation were noticed.  This happened, for example, with the famous scientific philosopher - Apollonius (I century BC).  Flavius ‚Äã‚ÄãDomitian - the Roman emperor - tried him for sorcery and magic, when he suddenly evaporated from the courtroom and found himself on the other side of the world.  And such disappearances were not uncommon.  Prisoners disappeared in many prisons, with no sign of escape. </p>

    <h2>  The experiences of Nikola Tesla </h2><p>  N. Tesla is a Serbian scientist and inventor in the field of radio and electrical engineering.  Some of his discoveries were associated with the movement of objects at a distance.  He believed that teleportation was possible, and conducted secret experiments with magnetic fields, proving this.  In his honor, even called the unit of measurement of magnetic induction - Tesla (T).  He devoted his whole life to devices operating on alternating current.  In his circles, he was often called a genius of all times and peoples and a superman.  Indeed, many claimed that he possessed the gift of foresight, could read thoughts, and even draw information from space.  There is a legend that N. Tesla conducted experiments on a military destroyer called ‚ÄúEldridge‚Äù, and he managed to move this warship in fractions of seconds by 320 kilometers.  At the same time, along with the vessel, there was a movement in space of the entire crew located in it.  Rumor has it that almost all the people on the ship died due to exposure to strong radio-magnetic waves.  Those who survived became mad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  There is another legend associated with the great scientist N. Tesla.  Rumor has it that he created a time machine and could carry out the movement in space of any person or object.  Based on these assumptions, in 2006 the film "Prestige" was shot.  Opponents of teleportation stories believe that this is impossible from the point of view of physics, because in order to move from one place to another, it is necessary to move at super-speed, and with such movement the object is destroyed.  Accordingly, the question arises: how, then, is everything going together again? </p><h2>  Quantum human teleportation </h2><p>  Quantum is a very small indivisible particle in physics.  Recently, many scientists have been experimenting precisely with the movement of these particles in time and space.  If you manage to move a small particle, then everything else will turn out as well.  More recently, Chinese and Canadian scientists have managed to teleport encoded information in particles of light.  Of course, quantum channels were used to transmit data, but in the future, such experiments can lead to the transfer of information without the use of any transmitters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sufi Miracles </h2><p>  The followers of the esoteric trend in Islam - the Sufi - also pay a lot of attention to such a concept as "teleporting a person."  Almost every famous Sufi teacher knew how to learn how to move in space and time.  They used this knowledge, as a rule, for the purpose of self-improvement, self-knowledge.  Returning to the past allowed them to ‚Äúdraw a lesson‚Äù from certain situations, but they went to the future to see what events needed to be changed in the present.  There are a huge number of records about how experienced Sufis traveled hundreds of kilometers in order to convey certain knowledge to people. </p><h2>  Rev. Mary and Teleportation </h2><p>  This sounds incredible, but the Soviet writer and historian A. Gorbovsky in his works describes that in the 17th century, the Monk Mary, who never left the monastery in which she lived, at certain points in time found herself close to the Indian settlements in America and told them about Christianity .  Later, one of the priests, who went to these tribes for the same purpose, found out that someone was ahead of him.  In addition, it became known that the Monk Mary not only told the Indians about her faith, but also presented them with a rosary, crosses and a cup for communion.  The inhabitants of these lands themselves later clearly described a woman from Europe as two drops similar to the Monk Mary.  Can there be so many coincidences, one can only guess. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Spontaneous teleportation </h2><p>  If you believe everything that is written above, it actually turns out that cases of teleportation of a person occurred with different people, in different countries and at completely different times.  Of course, there are a lot of opponents of this phenomenon, they are trying to explain this phenomenon from a scientific point of view, refute certain events and, of course, have every right to do so. </p>

    <p>  Supporters, on the contrary, are looking for evidence and trying to learn how to move in time.  There is an opinion that the first practice of teleporting a person, as a rule, occurs absolutely unexpectedly and spontaneously.  Of course, before this it is necessary to study a lot of literature, learn to enter a certain state.  It happens, and vice versa, when a person teleports completely consciously and accurately understands what is happening to him.  For the first time, this phenomenon is accompanied by dizziness and nausea.  In any case, an unprepared person is unlikely to be able to learn movements. </p><h2>  What you need to teleport </h2><p>  Most likely, many who want to learn this, wondering where to start all the same.  On the Internet, there is a huge amount of various information, something is presented for a fee, something is free.  Let's try to structure it and choose the most important points for such an event as teleportation.  Learning these techniques is very important to achieve the best result. </p><p>  First of all, in order to learn how to teleport, you need to be able to concentrate on a specific thought. </p>

    <p>  It sounds very simple, but in fact, when a person closes his eyes and tries to think only about one thing, a variety of stories and problems slip through his head every now and then.  Therefore, to begin with, it is necessary to master the technique of complete relaxation and turning off absolutely all thoughts.  When a ‚Äúclean sheet before my eyes‚Äù (which means no thoughts) can be held for at least 10 minutes, then the first step is already behind. </p><h2>  We transport the astral body </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, you need to start small, which means that you do not need to travel in time yet.  It is necessary to focus your thoughts on the <span>astral body.</span>  With complete relaxation, you must figuratively try to move ‚Äúyour double‚Äù to a very close distance.  If, for example, you are meditating on the couch, then imagine that the astral body rises from the couch and becomes nearby.  You should see the room with ‚Äúdifferent eyes‚Äù, look around: here is a chair, a closet, here you are lying on a sofa, etc. When such an exercise is fully obtained, and you will clearly see all the objects in the room, you can begin to change the distance - first to kitchen, then to your street and so on. </p>

    <h2>  Aware teleportation of a person </h2><p>  Only a few know how to learn this technique, but if a person believes in his abilities, he can succeed.  If the teleportation of the physical body is insurmountable, it is necessary to continue to train and not retreat.  Even the time travel of the astral body is already a great success.  When a person fully masters this skill, he can find himself in thoughts anywhere in the world and ‚Äúsee through‚Äù any situation.  Teleportation in time, of course, is more difficult than moving in space, but a huge number of stories on the Internet on this subject nevertheless indicate that this is possible.  Many practitioners - magicians, Sufis, shamans - argue that the first experience, as a rule, occurs in a dream.  On the one hand, a person is already quite trained, but with a high concentration of attention, his body is so tense that he cannot teleport.  The dream situation is fundamentally changing things.  A person with sufficient knowledge is in complete relaxation, which means that his body is ready to move for a split second to another place. </p><p>  Many scientists and esotericists dealt in detail with such a question as teleporting a person.  How to learn this technique has always been kept in the strictest confidence, and there are reasons for this.  Of course, everyone would like to be able to move, but does each of us really need it?  How, for example, to be with criminals in prisons who could teleport from there at any moment.  In addition, if everyone could be transported to wherever he wishes at any moment, how much thefts would increase in the world, and how would the murders be investigated?  There are no answers to these and many other questions yet.  Of course, teleportation is very interesting and exciting, but we should not forget about real life. </p>
