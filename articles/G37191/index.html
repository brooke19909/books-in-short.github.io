Let's get started! </p><h2>  Relevance of the topic </h2><p>  In terms of gifts, women are much simpler than men, which is displayed in many points.  Firstly, they are easy to surprise and make them nice, whether it be flowers or a cute soft toy.  Secondly, most often a woman always knows what she needs at the moment, even if this list can wrap her from head to toe three times. </p>

    <p>  These are cosmetics, clothes, bags, shoes and more.  Thirdly, in stores and beauty salons during the holiday seasons there are always many interesting offers such as certificates or <span>discount cards,</span> which at any time of the year will be a great gift for your chosen one, because women like to spend their favorite money on themselves and become more beautiful for the joy of their partners and jealousy of friends.  But with men the situation is more complicated.  They are often extremely picky, petty, stingy with regard to spending on themselves, and they either do not say what they want, or their desires are too expensive for a woman to master.  Therefore, the most profitable option is a combination of material and creative.  After all, such a move is always original, and most importantly, it shows your attitude to your man.  One of these gifts is the checkbook of desires.  How to make her?  We will learn this now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The basics </h2>

Of extreme importance is the fact to whom the future gift is intended, because depending on this we will procure all the materials.  So, if this is a checkbook of desires for a husband, then you should find to make it more serious using joint photos or pictures with somewhat comical or, conversely, very important everyday situations.  You also probably know most of his preferences, for example, fishing or a passion for firearms from different times, sports or chess, whatever.  This will help us in the preparation, because the checkbook of desires, made with our own hands, should be individual. 
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <p>  It is very important that the husband understands how much work and attention you put into it.  If the gift is intended for your young man, then here you can already show imagination from many different angles.  For example, it should be made more romantic and passionate, since at this age the relationship is the freshest and brightest.  And therefore, you can include spicy desires in it, backed up by your photos. </p><h2>  Procurement of necessary materials </h2><p>  So, first of all, you need to understand that the checkbook of desires looks much more advantageous if its pages are full of images, inscriptions, different fonts and so on.  For the basics, we need thick cardboard cut into 10x15 cm pages, and then we collect a lot of magazines, bus tickets, stamps, badges.  We print out selected photos, sheets with ready-made text.  We take glue, scissors, writing objects: pens, felt-tip pens, paints, signets and more.  Next, to fasten the pages, we need a reliable hole punch and two expandable and collapsible rings from an old unnecessary notebook with such fasteners.  You can, of course, make it easier by gluing the pages together along one edge, and hide such a seam with the decor, but it will be less practical and dirty, so you should not skimp. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Making up wishes </h2>

    <p>  Of course, before choosing photos, fonts and images, you need to figure out what to write on the pages of our checkbook.  And the main part in it is occupied precisely by desires, and here are examples of a possible set.  From the series ‚ÄúFreedom to Parrots‚Äù: beer in the company of male friends and / or a bath with them, a subscription for personal use of the TV during the day, a break from all household chores or even a day of ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù. </p><p>  The next section, which may include our do-it-yourself checkbook of desires, is emotional relaxation.  This concept includes the following points: all day to hear from the wife only ‚Äúyes‚Äù, her absolute submission during the day, forgiveness for any mistake (and for this she will have to be voiced), an order for a personal menu all day with <span>breakfast in bed.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="checkbook desires photos" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12408/373084.jpg?1397507149992" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Special Gift Charms </h2><p>  Further, there must be desires from a piquant series: massage, a romantic dinner for two, striptease, a joint shower or a trip to the sauna, playing cards for stripping, the embodiment of any erotic fantasy.  As you should have already understood, this is only a basic list, and then this is a general one.  But the checkbook of desires you created, the sample of which you will come up with yourself, should be strictly individual and focused on your partner.  Therefore, before making it, you can by hints and tricks to find out the secret desires of your partner. </p><h2>  We put everything on the pages </h2>

Although you were warned in advance that the checkbook of desires should literally be full of information, you should not forget that you should not go too far in this matter.  Therefore, we act correctly: first, on all pages, we do the edging.  To do this, you can glue tape or paper around the perimeter in the form of a frame, draw it by hand or using special prints for scrapbooking, and you can also wrap the edge with a cloth.  Next, we tentatively place the text of the desire on the pages, write it or glue the already prepared one, so our checkbook of desires will be more accurate.  It is better to use the photo as the main image, there should be no more than three on each side of the sheet.  We outline the contours with a light touch of a pencil.

For this, we need newspaper clippings and magazines, stickers, as well as other small details.  We cut out the ones that are suitable for the color scheme and also distribute them on the sheet around the main image.  Do not forget that they should be placed even on top of each other, so as not to create the effect of empty space or lack of imagination in the master of the book.  If you don‚Äôt know what to fill out, then use unusual characters, funny phrases, posters of your favorite miniature films, pieces of cloth, clothing labels, business cards with announcements, and even dogs from castles.  A little tip: since the checkbook of desires is usually made from about 10-15 pages and in a small format, it is better to tinker all at once to see the big picture.  Thus, you do not overdo it, evenly distribute information and create a single style.

However, if you make a checkbook in the vintage style so popular now, then you can thread coarse twine through them, for color and strength, drop paraffin from a colored candle into the place where the title piece and the thread come into contact.  And if your gift carries a more romantic aura, then you can use ribbons or cord with beads fixed on the free ends instead of twine.  If you do not want the connected edges of the sheets to be visible, you can close them with a general binding of fabric or paper.

    <h2>  Instruction manual </h2><p>  Since the surprise should be very pleasant for your partner, it should be presented accordingly.  So, for example, you can put it along with the main gift or place it in a small box.  And so that you do not have to explain what it is and why you need a checkbook of desires, the instruction should be posted on the first page.  It should include the column "belongs to ____ (enter to whom)", "does not lie in the sale / exchange / transfer / donation to third parties", as well as a list of rules like the following: choose the check you like, present it to the talented and handmade donor, enjoy fulfilling the wish write down your impressions on the back.  Plus, it is worth using a day no more than two of these coupons, as pleasure, as they say, should be stretched. </p><p>  And the last moment: since a woman charged with enthusiasm is incredibly vulnerable in relation to her impulses, it is better to give a checkbook at the right time, otherwise insult will smear all work and spoil the holiday.  And you should share the joy of this gift, so have a good time! </p>
