Among the increasingly popular destinations are Seychelles.  On the world map, many of our citizens can already find them.  You do not need a visa to visit this country, and the journey itself promises to be very exciting.  Here are the basic facts about this wonderful place. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  So <span>Seychelles ...</span> Where are they?  Their location is in the Indian Ocean, near the equator.  In relative proximity are such well-known objects as Mauritius, Reunion (to the south), as well as the Comoros (to the south-west) and the Maldives (to the north-east).  However, if a person is not particularly friendly with geography, a verbal description will not tell him anything.  In this case, you need a visual aid that will help you navigate the question "where are the Seychelles islands".  Map is the best assistant in this matter. </p>

    <h2>  About the population </h2><p>  Most residents speak a special <span>Creole language,</span> which appeared as a synthesis of local dialects and French.  The official language of the country is English, but not many people speak it - about 4.9%. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  So, we are going to Seychelles.  Weather is an important issue, but in the case of this corner of the globe, you can not worry about weather conditions.  Most of the islands have a subequatorial climate typical of the sea, mild and warm all year round.  Due to the fact that there is an ocean around, it is not too hot.  The best months to stay here are May, as well as October and December. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Many tourists recognize local hotels as one of the best in terms of comfort and level of service.

    <h2>  Currency </h2><p>  The official currency of the state is the rupee.  You can buy it at local banks, exchangers and many hotels.  Some tourism experts believe that it is more profitable to exchange not for cash, but for <span>traveler‚Äôs checks.</span> </p><h2>  Visa regime for Russia </h2><p>  For Russians visiting Seychelles does not require a visa (for up to 30 days).  To enter the country, you need a passport, a valid minimum of 3 months from the date of the proposed departure, an air ticket back, as well as confirmation of solvency at the rate of 50 US dollars per day. </p><p>  Upon arrival at the airport you will need to pay a tourist fee of $ 40.  Children may only enter Seychelles with their parents.  If one of them is traveling, then a power of attorney is needed from the second. </p><h2>  Customs </h2><p>  The customs legislation of the state does not limit the import and export of currency.  You can not enter the country with weapons (including pneumatic), fruit and vegetable products, meat products.  Particularly strict government policy regarding drug trafficking.  Warnings are posted in the arrival halls of airports for tourists - if someone tries to import drugs, he faces a prison term of up to 30 years. </p><p>  It is impossible to export (if there are no official certificates) some types of marine flora and fauna. </p><h2>  Geology </h2><p>  The geology of the country is represented by two types of landscape - granite (these include, in particular, the largest island of Mahe) and coral.  The bulk of the population lives on the granite islands.  In the central areas of some of them there are forests where palm trees, ferns, pandanuses grow.  In the coastal zone, there are mainly coconut palms and artificial plantings.  <span>Hotels in the Seychelles, by the</span> way, are also located mainly on the granite part of the archipelago. </p>

    <p>  Coral islands are atolls, their height above the ocean waters is 4-8 meters.  They are arid, because coral limestones hardly retain air moisture.  Of the flora, there are mainly only coconut palms. </p><h2>  Unique fauna </h2><p>  A large number of endemic bird species live in the Seychelles.  The reason for this is their rather long habitation in isolation relative to other world ecosystems.  Among the most recognizable birds of the Seychelles is a frigate.  Its wingspan is up to 3 meters, can be in the air without a break for up to 7 days in a row! </p><p>  On the island of Birds, various species of birds gather for nesting, arriving in winter from other parts of the world.  Another attraction of the island is giant turtles.  Some individuals weigh up to 250 kg. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  And how did the world learn about the existence of paradise on earth called the Seychelles?  Where they are and what they are, told sailors from Portugal at the beginning of the 16th century.  Then the archipelago was almost uninhabited.  Over the course of the following centuries, sea pirates sometimes dropped into the islands. </p>

    <p>  The first settlements appeared there in the middle of the 18th century - on the islands of Mahe and Praslin.  They were founded by immigrants from France, who began to grow some types of crops here.  These lands received their name in honor of Moreau de Seschelle, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the country.  Colonists brought in slaves from Africa.  At the end of the 18th century, Britain captured the archipelago, which some time later began to stimulate the settlement of immigrants from India.  At the end of the 19th century, Chinese from the British colony of Mauritius began to settle in the Seychelles, and at the beginning of the 20th century, immigrants from Arabia.  In 1976, the Seychelles gained independence from Great Britain, and in 1977 the party of France-Albert Rene came to power, following the ideology of Marxism.  In 1993, the country underwent democratic transformations. </p><h2>  Government structure </h2><p>  Seychelles is a country with a republican form of government.  The President and the Prime Minister are elected by the people for a term of 5 years.  Each of the representatives of the executive branch can hold up to three consecutive terms.  The main legislative body is the Parliament, where 34 deputies sit (25 are elected directly by citizens, 9 from parties). </p><p>  The largest political associations are the Progressive Front, the National Party. </p><p>  The army of the Seychelles is represented by land forces, naval patrols, as well as the national guard.  Service - on a contract basis.  The state budget spends about 3% on the needs of the army. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  The basis of the Seychelles economy is tourism (70% of foreign exchange earnings, 30% of employed), fisheries (the main export is frozen and canned fish).  Agriculture is slightly developed (the main crops are coconuts, cinnamon, sweet potatoes, bananas. Poultry is raised in households. </p><h2>  Culture </h2><p>  The place of interweaving of cultures around the world is Seychelles, where there are samples of the heritage of the national color of Europeans (French, British), Africans, Indians, residents of Madagascar.  Women are especially revered on the islands - many play a leading role in household management, family bookkeeping, and parenting.  The role of men in family life is sometimes secondary.  In some families, the rule is practiced: the more a man earns, the more he has rights. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations for the tourist </h2><p>  A number of tourism experts do not recommend exchanging currency at unofficial points (this, moreover, is prohibited at the legislative level). </p><p>  In the Seychelles, it is customary to leave tips at a rate of 10%, to give small amounts to maids.  Paying for a taxi is usually over the counter, but tips are also welcome (especially if the trip is long). </p><p>  It is recommended that you drink more water, with caution be in the peak hours of solar activity outdoors. </p><p>  It is illegal to take certain household items from the Seychelles (such as spears for fishing). </p><p>  Strong winds and cyclones pass Seychelles.  Mahe Island, however, is characterized by frequent torrential rains, therefore, planning to visit it, you can grab an umbrella. </p>
