    <p>  The company then participated in the development of the Motorola ROKR phone, which appeared on sale in 2005.  Apple was creating an iTunes player for the device.  In general, ROKR was initially positioned as a music player.  The mobile phone failed to meet the manufacturer's expectations, it was bought very poorly, did not have decent functionality.  Subsequently, he was even recognized as a failure of the year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the failure of the ROKR, the first Apple phone was already in development.  It was conducted in an atmosphere of strict secrecy.  Even the developers could not really communicate with each other. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  Apple phones are commonly known as the iPhone.  By the time the first model appeared, many had no doubt that the device would be named that way.  Earlier iPod players had already earned a good reputation, and the <em>i-</em> prefix became a key one in Apple products.  Apple phones, however, could not bear a similar name. </p><p>  In 1996, the iPhone brand was registered by another company, and in 2000 was transferred to Cisco Systems.  However, Apple did not abandon the sonorous name and released the first brainchild in 2007.  Of course, the owner of the brand sued.  Soon, the parties managed to agree on the use of the trademark together, the terms of the agreement were not disclosed. </p><h2>  First model </h2><p>  Apple phones, or rather the first model, officially announced themselves in January 2007.  In the summer, the first shipments arrived at stores.  The smartphone was not bad, it had an aluminum back cover, and a plastic insert was present at the bottom, which covered the antennas.  Apple - phones, the price of the first models of which was $ 500 or $ 600, came in two versions: 4 and 8 GB, a bit later the version also appeared at 16 GB. </p><p>  However, in the first generation of smartphones, everything was not so good.  The first complaint of users was the lack of 3G, without which it was necessary to work with a very slow Internet.  The second claim was the imperfect defense, which was inferior to BlackBerry.  Therefore, the phone company "Apple" did not become actively used in the corporate segment.  Of course, users immediately after the release of the first model began to wait for the appearance of the second generation, which should fix all the shortcomings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  iPhone 3G </h2><p>  Information about the new brainchild of Apple appeared in 2008.  Soon he went on sale.  As the name implies, the novelty received support for third-generation networks.  In addition, the smartphone has got GPS, which allows you to use maps through access to the Internet.  The design has undergone a revision.  The back panel was now made of plastic in white or black, and its shape has changed.  The operating system device received iOS 2.0.  Along with this, a decrease in the price of the model occurred - the second Apple 16GB received a price of $ 299, and 8 GB - $ 199.  The novelty was sold in 70 countries.  iPhone 3G was the first Apple smartphone to buy in Russia. </p>

    <h2>  iPhone 3GS </h2><p>  The smartphone was introduced in June 2009.  The manufacturer assured that the device has become 2 times faster than its predecessor, as evidenced by the letter S (speed).  There really were a lot of innovations.  A more capacious battery is installed, a 3 megapixel camera, the processor has become more powerful, there is support for voice control.  In addition, it was now possible to buy an Apple iPhone 32GB, which made it possible to forget about the lack of memory.  There was also a 16 GB version on sale.  However, after the release of the iPhone 4, instead of the 32 and 16 GB versions, an 8 GB version began to be released.  For the next four years, Apple supported the iPhone 3GS: iOS 7 was not released on the model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
