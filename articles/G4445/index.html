Of course, in addition to relaxation within their own country, they form a special, reverent attitude towards their native nature.  The camp sites are mainly located in the forest and near the river, in the zone of temperate climate, the most sparing for human health.  As a continuation of this thought, one cannot recall the words of the poet Astafyev: </p><p>  "Homeland - deep rivers, </p><p>  In the mirror of the waters is a reflected temple. ‚Äù </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The camp site serving as the subject of this article is located in the Chuvash Republic, near Cheboksary.  This is a special place.  Its location was chosen very well: the left sandy bank of the Volga, overgrown with virgin pine forest, obstructing the winds.  Right in the middle of the majestic pines, dreamily looking at the expanse of the river, two-story log cabins, as well as brick cottages, are built.  This is the hostel ‚ÄúThe Sun‚Äù (Cheboksary).  Guest reviews indicate their real recovery.  There is a positive effect of climatotherapy: sleep in the air, sun and air baths, the quality of air saturated with volatile products.  As you know, these substances are able to inhibit the "lurking" in the human body and already "active" fungi, bacteria and even viruses. </p>

    <p>  Equally useful for holidaymakers is the improvement of the river.  Not only the sea has a therapeutic effect.  It has long been noticed by people that running water neutralizes negative energy.  (Let us recall at least one popular belief: if a person is in trouble, he should cross the stream or cross the river bridge). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to living in a healing climatic environment, "Sun" (recreation center, Cheboksary) has a developed infrastructure that promotes recovery through physical activity. </p><h2>  Demand for camp site services </h2><p>  Generally speaking, the legal status of the hostel is rather narrow for the Sun.  To be more precise, it can be called a "recreation center."  After all, its service and comfort has long been noted not only by tourists who value extreme hiking and long excursions, as well as long communication with nature, but also other categories of vacationers: </p><ul><li>  families seeking outdoor activities outside the city and in a special atmosphere, not deprived of comfort, to spend their weekends; </li><li>  work colleagues who wish, by touching nature, to strengthen internal informal communication of the labor collective, to relieve fatigue and nervous tension, to strengthen the friendly relations of employees; </li><li>  couples in love looking for diversity in their relationship; </li><li>  older people who value temperate therapy and privacy. </li></ul>

    <p>  They know a lot about the bathhouse.  Spruce and birch brooms, as well as optimal temperature, not only calm the nerves, cleanse and improve the skin, but also optimize the metabolism.  For guests of the "Sun" fishing is available overnight.  In addition, you will find a well-equipped overnight campfire and ear, prepared from fresh, only caught fish.  In its own way, it‚Äôs interesting and even excitement to relax at the base in the season of mushrooms and berries.  The surrounding forest is very rich in blueberries, lingonberries and blackberries, and a silent hunt for mushrooms (honey mushrooms and white) is exciting and productive. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The "Sun" (recreation center, Cheboksary) operates according to this concept: not to provide food for its guests by organizing breakfast, lunch and dinner, but to contribute in every way to the preparation of food by themselves.  Residents of log cabins and cottages are provided with electric stoves, refrigerators, and fresh water. </p><h2>  Included in the price </h2><p>  In addition to accommodation, other paid services are also provided by the hostel ‚ÄúSun‚Äù (Cheboksary).  Prices are set for rental of water equipment, parking and excursions. </p>

The staff periodically holds fun-filled cultural events, contests that facilitate communication of micro-groups who are resting in different cottages.  For example, a very interesting contest for the best cooking potatoes on the grill.  All the action is presented as spectacular as possible, with a fair amount of professional animation.  Also periodically, the base staff organizes leisure nights for their guests.  This contributes to the fact that the "Sun" reigns friendly, pleasant atmosphere. </p>

    <p>  However, as they say, all good things come to an end sooner or later.  The guests of the camp site are not free in only one way: at the end of their stay, until 12 noon on the last day, they should leave the cottage where they previously lived.  However, the resulting healing effect, multiplied by the benevolence of the employees of the ‚ÄúSun‚Äù, arouses their desire to come here again. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the recreation center ‚ÄúSun‚Äù is an attractive vacation spot.  Prices (guest reviews confirm this) for her services are affordable.  Budget decent vacation is always in price.  A significant role is played by the natural potential of Chuvashia, close and constant access to which is provided to tourists by the inventory and trained personnel of the recreation center "Sun". </p>
