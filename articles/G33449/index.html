    <h2>  How to choose a broker </h2><p>  Experts recommend first of all to pay attention to the following indicators: </p><ol><li>  The organization‚Äôs reputation and reliability rating. </li><li>  Convenience of working with her and professional qualities of employees. </li><li>  Prices for service packages (including standard) including commissions. </li><li>  User reviews. </li></ol><h2>  Why Sberbank? </h2><p>  The main indicator is reputation.  In confirmation, you can familiarize yourself with the turnover of the bank's trading operations on the exchange.  These data are freely available on one of the Moscow Exchange portals.  The section is called "Leading Operators": Top-20. </p>

    <p>  Sberbank cooperates with well-known trading platforms, which allows you to make transactions with a variety of financial instruments.  Trading floors available for Sberbank customers include: </p><ul><li>  The Main Market, which belongs to the Moscow Exchange group of stock markets.  Here they trade bonds of sub-federal, municipal and corporate, as well as shares. </li><li>  Derivatives Market (with access to futures and options contracts). </li><li>  OTC market (trade in Eurobonds, shares (shares) of foreign investment funds and depositary receipts). </li></ul><h2>  Choose an account </h2><p>  To work on trading floors, Sberbank brokers offer their customers two categories of accounts: </p><ol><li>  Main.  It includes simple brokerage accounts. </li><li>  Special.  It includes investment accounts and individual ones. </li></ol><p>  A bidder has the right to open two accounts simultaneously.  The accounts of the first category when working on the site reflect all ongoing transactions with securities, show the movement of financial assets in real time and the results of transactions (including for a certain period). </p><p>  In the reviews of brokers of Sberbank of Russia, many indicate that an individual account has some tax benefits.

    <h2>  Open an account </h2><p>  Opening an account allows Sberbank to become an intermediary for a client on a trading exchange.  To do this, you must come in person to the department of the financial institution and write a statement in which it is necessary to indicate the phone number and current electronic mail box.  The bank will send confirmations for transactions and financial reports to it.  In addition, a bank specialist will need a passport, a plastic card of a future broker and his identification number. </p><p>  After opening an account with the help of a bank manager or on your own, you need to get account details in the terminal.  The whole procedure takes no more than half an hour. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, Sberbank brokers do not limit the size of the lower limit of the brokerage account.  It depends on the desire and solvency of the client. </p><p>  Addresses and phone numbers of branches and branches of Sberbank in which they work with broker accounts can be found on the official portal of the credit institution. </p>

    <h2>  The account is open.  Now what? </h2><p>  Upon completion of account registration, the bank is obliged to issue to the client: </p><ul><li>  conditions of tariff plans for <span>depository services</span> ; </li><li>  declaration of possible risks in the securities market; </li><li>  completed investor profile; </li><li>  a list of remuneration to the bank for brokerage; </li><li>  a card with an investor code table and a copy of its acceptance certificate; </li><li>  copy of the application written by the investor for brokerage services. </li></ul><p>  Now, legally, you can attract a bank as a broker and start studying the basics of investing, having previously installed the QUIK system software. </p><h2>  Cost of services </h2><p>  For their help in investing, lending institutions take some remuneration.  Its main rule, judging by the reviews of Sberbank brokers, is that its size decreases with an increase in deposit.  Another case of a decrease in remuneration is an excess of daily turnover of 50 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  To customers </h2><p>  Most of the reviews indicate the convenience of working with the company.  Indeed, there are plenty of pluses: </p><ul><li>  the application process is simple, and its processing takes place as soon as possible; </li><li>  a large number of trading terminals; </li><li>  <span>informational support for</span> beginning investors; </li><li>  competent technical support; </li><li>  the ability to analyze operations at a professional level; </li><li>  the availability of tools to conduct remote workflow; </li><li>  the creation of mechanisms that monitor in real time the status of the ongoing transaction; </li><li>  the presence of a personal account and personal assistant - investor; </li><li>  a sufficient number of services for withdrawing and depositing funds. </li></ul><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  Sberbank of Russia as a broker has an almost perfect personal account.  It was created on the basis of the QUIK system and allows you to follow the jumps in quotes and movement on accounts, as well as use various additional options.  And all this in real time.  In addition, Sberbank posted a large detailed instruction that allows you to correctly install the QUIK system and use it correctly. </p><h2>  A spoon of tar </h2><p>  On many sites, including the official portal of Sberbank, they write that it has good indicators in all positions.  That he has been taking an honorable place among the ten largest brokers for several years.  For two years now, the bank has been conducting training seminars on <span>individual investment accounts</span> (IIS). </p><p>  The management company with which the trust agreements are concluded - Sberbank Asset Management Asset Management Company JSC, offers its customers two lines of IIS development.  With it, contracts for investing in mutual funds are concluded.  And so on and so forth. </p><p>  But‚Ä¶ </p><p>  Among the feedback from traders about Sberbank as a broker, positive ones are not often found.  There is a unanimous opinion that the MICEX tariffs are very high, it is impossible to open an account remotely, there is no single account and currency section. </p><p>  Beginners most often write that there is no strength to endure constant requisitions: a commission for opening and closing a transaction (and not one), plus 149 rubles a month for the first opening or closing of a transaction and, of course, 13%.  As a result, there is no profit at all.  If withdrawn in installments, 13% is withdrawn every other time, at the end the manager calls and asks to pay tax debts.  With a minus transaction, they also charge a tax, and even with the withdrawal of own funds (not profit). </p><p>  Those who bid a little longer talk about managers, whom the words ‚Äúquick‚Äù and ‚Äúfutures‚Äù scare to horror.  They send one to another, and, as usual, information is not possible to obtain either on tariffs or on existing transactions. </p><p>  Both newcomers and watchdogs agree in one opinion: there is an artificial creation of problems for customers.  It happens that the account is mistakenly frozen, and you can find out about this only during the purchase process.  And even when the situation clears up, the account is not opened immediately, but within a few weeks. </p><p>  There are also reviews about the work of Sberbank brokers in which customers complain about the impossibility of quickly withdrawing or creating an application.  At the same time, the server stably hangs, and the money leaves.  In this situation, many urgently change the broker. </p><p>  Regulars of brokerage markets are sure that the server is "hung up" on purpose as soon as volatility rises.  Following the connection is interrupted.  They believe that this broker is not able to provide quick, and most importantly, stable access to the market.  But the strangest thing that does not seem to want ... </p><p>  Many indignant reviews of rudeness.  And the conversation is not about one or two managers, but about a large number of employees in different cities and branches.  Traders and investors interpret the similar position of bank specialists as a desire to get rid of them. </p><p>  What is the result?  And in the end, the competence of managers and traders-advisers is estimated at one and a half points out of ten.  Adequacy of tariffs and additional services - by one point.  And even in the sum of all parameters, Sberbank brokers do not even reach two of the same ten points. </p>
