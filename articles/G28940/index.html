    <p>  <span>World War I</span> contributed to a change in most ideas about how hostilities should take place.  What facts about World War I can be given?  In mortal combat, of course, the infantry continued to play a major role.  However, it was during this period that armored vehicles with military aircraft began to take their first steps.  Cavalrymen collided with each other amid explosions.  And in this difficult time people who became famous throughout the world were forged.  However, not always on the positive side. </p><p>  For Russia, this war was the most difficult, since the conflict was not only with German and Austro-Hungarian troops.  Serious problems were brewing inside the country, in its very heart.  And after three bloody years of the First World War for another five years, the country could not cope with the revolution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, few people know the history of the First World War.

    <p>  Many people know about the feat that the defenders of the Brest Fortress performed.  However, not everyone can boast of the knowledge that about 40 years before that, Russian soldiers survived the same hopeless battle.  <span>The siege of the</span> Osovets <span>fortress</span> , which is not large in size, lasted for 190 days.  She became famous in connection with the fact that the 13th company of the 226th Zemlyansky regiment launched a completely hopeless counterattack.  At the end of July 1915, the Germans launched gas in the direction of the fortress.  The defenders simply did not have a chance to protect themselves, as individual protective equipment at that time had not yet been invented.  Accordingly, all Russian soldiers received severe poisoning.  After some time, German troops launched an attack under the guise of their artillery.  And quite unexpectedly, Russian soldiers came out from the green clubs of the poisonous substance, wrapped in rags, in tattered tunics, constantly coughing.  However, they held the rifles in their hands tightly enough.  The second lieutenant Kotlinsky led the attack.  The Germans, frightened by such an offensive, were driven back to their original positions.  Later, Russian troops left the fortress on the orders of the high command. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The feat of the girl who broke the advance of the enemy </h2><p>  What other terrifying and interesting facts of the First World War can I recall?  Mention should be made of the "Stavropol maiden."  So called the sister of mercy Rimma Ivanova, who died in 1915 near the Carpathian village.  What did she remember?  When during the battle all the officers were killed and the soldiers demoralized, she was not afraid to rally the soldiers around her.  Rimma, leading the attack, managed to knock the enemy out of the trench.  True, she did not see the moment of victory. </p><h2>  The first tank on the battlefield </h2>

    <p>  Speaking about the interesting facts of the First World War, mention should be made of ‚Äúlittle Willy‚Äù.  That was the name of the first tank that was designed in Britain.  The speed of his movement was about 4.8 kilometers per hour.  The vehicle was equipped with a cannon.  Such a model appeared on the battlefield in 1916 during the battle of Fleur-Courselet.  Many years have passed since that moment, and various states continue to be measured by the long barrel and the thickness of the armor.  The word "tank" in translation means "tank".  This is due to the fact that the British tried to disguise a new type of weaponry as fuel barrels.  However, they did not mislead anyone with their cunning. </p><h2>  Tokens that went down in history </h2><p>  What interesting facts about the First World War are known?  "Dead Man's Penny."  Thus, posthumous tokens were nicknamed, on which was an inscription that the soldier died for honor and freedom.  These items were sent to the relatives of the dead soldiers.  Over 6 years, more than one million of these tokens have been sent.  The title on them was not indicated.  This is due to the fact that the British authorities wanted to level all the dead. </p><h2>  Changes affected food </h2><p>  A lot of bad things were done during the time of the First World War.  Interesting facts can fully confirm this.  However, there was a place for not too cruel events.  For example, after the <span>outbreak of war</span> , anti-German sentiments began to spread.  And in order not to lose their money, restaurateurs of England and America renamed "cabbage in German" into "cabbage of freedom." </p><h2>  Fashionable clothing in the trenches </h2><p>  What unknown facts of World War I can be mentioned in this review?  Many modern fashionistas do not know what the name of the clothing, such as ‚Äútrench coat‚Äù, was formed in the trenches.  With this word the soldiers called overcoats, raincoats, which were given to them by the quartermasters.  However, the translation of the word ‚Äútrench coat‚Äù speaks for itself - ‚Äútrench coat‚Äù. </p><h2>  Heroic feats of animals during the fighting </h2>

    <p>  Speaking about the historical facts of the First World War, it is worth mentioning the dove number 888 and "trench cats".  Animals are often used in wartime.  Pigeons mainly played the role of postmen.  With their help, letters and orders were transmitted.  The most famous postman was the dove at number 888. He forwarded more than a hundred important letters for the entire time of the hostilities.  And it should be noted that this is the only bird that received the military rank of colonel.  She was buried with all honors. </p><p>  In the trenches quite often there were simple cats.  They were necessary not only for catching mice.  Cats also warned fighters about the start of gas attacks better than any sensor.  Four-legged fighters were also used in submarines as a "sensor" that controls air purity.  What is not the original facts about the events that took place in those days when the First World War was going on? </p><h2>  Interesting facts about pirate flags </h2><p>  During the war years, one original tradition appeared.  After successful completion of the raid, the British submariners hung out a <span>pirate flag,</span> which today is known as the Jolly Roger.  Admiral Wilson thus showed that the use of submarines for him is a dishonest maneuver that is not worthy of gentlemen. </p>

    <h2>  Temporary truces to achieve common goals </h2><p>  What secrets is still kept by the First World War?  Chronicles, facts claim that during Christmas in 1914 the soldiers of Germany and England announced a temporary truce in order to celebrate the holiday.  During this period, a football match was held, Christian hymns were performed.  Subsequently, such a tradition could not be renewed.  Another truce occurred in Belarus, when German and Russian troops came together to shoot the wolves that attacked them.  The fighting continued at the moment when all the animals were killed. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
