Russians called him once Yuryev.  The Germans are Derpt.  The city is located 185 km from Tallinn and is the second largest settlement in Estonia after the capital.  Over a thousand-year history, it was captured and burned many times.  It's hard to believe, walking along the quiet and neat streets of Tartu.  The sights of the Estonian cultural center will be discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tartu estonia" class="if uuid-2447224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2447224.jpg"></div><h2>  Foundation of the city </h2><p>  The name of the city of Tartu in translation from Estonian means "bison".  Little is known about the origin of the toponym, as well as about the circumstances of the occurrence of the settlement.  In addition, they represent dry, boring information that does not heat up the curiosity of tourists.  Much more interesting is the history of the sights of Tartu.  For example, bridges with fancy names or a fountain depicting lovers.  Nevertheless, we will tell about the main milestones in the history of the Baltic center of culture and education. </p><p>  Around the V century, the first ancient settlements appeared on the territory of modern <span>Estonia.</span>  <span>Tartu</span> is considered the oldest city in the Baltic state.  If you look at the map of Estonia, it will become clear why it was so often captured and ruined.  Nearby is Lake Peipsi, next to which the Battle of the Ice took place in the 13th century.  The city is located on the banks of the Emaj√µgi.  This river flows into the Peipsi-Pskov system of lakes.  Already in the early Middle Ages, trade was developed here.  The city attracted both Russians and Germans by its location.  True, the sights of Tartu testify more to German influence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1030, the city was captured by Yaroslav the Wise.  The Russian prince did not like the overseas name, and he renamed the Estonian city to Yuryev.  Thirty years later, Tartu was burned by representatives of one of several tribes.  Around this time, Novgorod <span>prince Vsevolod</span> Mstislavovich appeared here.  In 1211 the city was burned again, this time by Latgals.  Three years later, a real battle took place, as a result of which the Russian prince died.  Now the small city belonged to the Germans.  The next invaders named it in their own way - Dorpat. </p><p>  For many centuries the city was dominated by the Germans.  That is why the sights of Tartu resemble old German buildings.  Already in the XVII century, this city became a center of culture and education.  It was then that a university was opened here.  The building of this educational institution is today one of the main attractions of Tartu. </p><h2>  New time </h2><p>  At the beginning of the XVIII century, Peter I recaptured the city from the Swedes, after which most of the population resettled in the internal regions of Russia.  Until 1893, the place was called Dorpat.  After Alexander III, he decided to "mark out" the Baltic population.  This was expressed mainly in the change of names.  The city was again renamed Yuryev.  The Russian name remained until 1919. </p><p>  At the end of World War I, the Germans captured the cities of Estonia.  In Tartu, in just a year, power changed three times.  Already in December 1918, the Red Army arrived here.  Having expelled the Germans, they established Soviet power.  In 1919, the Estonian troops knocked out the Red Army from Yuryev.  They were not inferior to their opponents in cruelty - more than three hundred people were executed in a few weeks.  Yuryev was renamed to Tartu. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Soviet troops returned in 1940.  Then, in a short period of time, about two hundred people were shot by the NKVD officers.  In July 1941, the Germans occupied the Estonian city.  In 1944, the Russians again.  During the Second World War, the city suffered, as evidenced by the state of some attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sobigdata.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tartu city estonia" class="if uuid-2447226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2447226.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursion </h2><p>  Tartu has developed a tourism business.  Moreover, the prices here are low.  Architectural monuments to see when visiting Tartu: </p><ul><li>  Town Hall </li><li>  Scientific Center AHHAA. </li><li>  The main building of the university. </li><li>  Church of St. Paul. </li><li>  Tartu Observatory. </li><li>  Peter Church. </li></ul><p>  Historical monuments include the ruins of the Dome Cathedral, the former residential building of the railway workers, the ‚ÄúFalling‚Äù house.  Tourists who have been to Estonia more than once recommend visiting the Tartu Toy Museum. </p><p>  Most of the attractions are concentrated in the Old Town.  It is here that the Town Hall Square and the main building of the University of Tartu are located.  The ruins of the Dome Cathedral are located on Toomem√§gi Hill.  Another attraction of the city is the airfield, which has not been used since 1999, but is one of the largest in Europe.  Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was a base of strategic and military transport aircraft of the USSR.  Today, the airfield is sometimes used as a car market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="isa.ut.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tartu city attractions" class="if uuid-2448909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2448909.jpg"></div><h2>  University of Tartu </h2><p>  The educational institution was founded in those years when part of the territory of modern Estonia belonged to Sweden.  Then the university was called Academia Gustaviana.  Founder - King Gustav II.  He appointed his mentor and teacher Johan Sch√ºtte as rector. </p><p>  In the Russian period, under Paul I, the educational institution was renamed the Imperial University of Dorpat.  In 1892, Russification began.  The name, of course, changed.  The famous educational institution of Tartu for several decades was called Yuryev University. </p><p>  The main building is a vivid example of classical architecture.  The building was built at the beginning of the XIX century according to the project of Johann Krause - a Russian architect of German origin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ut.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tartu University" class="if uuid-2448919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2448919.jpg"></div><h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  On the site of a modern building more than two hundred years ago there was a wooden building.  It was destroyed by a fire in 1775.  The construction of the new building took about five years, finishing work was completed in 1789. This attraction is reflected in the Estonian-Finnish historical drama "Names in Granite", which tells about the events of the First World War. </p><h2>  Town Hall Square </h2><p>  A guided tour usually begins with a visit to the Old Town.  In its very center is Town Hall Square.  Here are the famous attractions of Tartu, namely the Art Museum and the Kissing Students fountain.  The square got its modern name in 1990.  In Soviet times, many streets of the Estonian city were called differently.  For example, the main square of Tartu is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Soviets. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages there was a public well.  The area was laid in the XIII century, but initially it was a shopping arcade.  Today it is one of the favorite places for tourists.  Almost everyone wants to be photographed against the background of an unusual fountain.  This is also a kind of work of art.  The sculptural composition on the Town Hall Square is considered an informal symbol of the city. </p><h2>  "Kissing students" </h2><p>  The main building of Tartu is the university.  This educational institution is considered one of the best in Europe.  There are a lot of students renting housing.  By the way, the average cost of renting an apartment in the city is low, in addition, there are a large number of cafes with affordable prices.  Tartu is a city of students. </p><p>  It is not surprising that in the capital of Estonia, where the main attraction is the university, the most famous sculpture is called ‚ÄúKissing Students‚Äù.  In 1998, the fountain was rebuilt.  But the original version was built back in the late forties of the last century.  However, he had little in common with the fountain, which is so popular with tourists today.  In the late 90s, Mati Carmine created a sculpture depicting a young couple. </p><p>  An interesting legend is associated with the famous Tartu fountain.  Some young man somehow met on his Town Hall Square with his lover.  They merged in a kiss, and at that moment the girl made a wish, which can be stated in Goethe's words: "Stop the moment, you are beautiful!"  Heaven heard her.  Young lovers turned to stone, and their kiss will last forever. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skulptuuridtartus.weebly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kissing students" class="if uuid-2448902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2448902.jpg"></div><h2>  Bridges of Tartu </h2><p>  One of the famous buildings of the city is Inglisild.  Translated into Russian means "angel bridge."  True, there is another version.  Inglisild may have descended from the English Bridge.  One way or another, all tourist routes pass through this attraction. </p><p>  The bridge was built in 1838 by the architect Krause.  The design is decorated with a bas-relief of the University of Tartu, made at the beginning of the XIX century.  The inscription on it reads: Otium reficit vires.  Translated from Latin, this means "rest regains strength." </p><p>  Near the Angel bridge there is a similar structure, but with the opposite name.  Its existence confirms the first version of the origin of the word "inglisilda".  The second famous bridge of the Estonian city is called Devil. </p><h2>  Ruins of the Dome Cathedral </h2><p>  This attraction is located on a mountain by the river Emaj√µgi.  Once upon a time, many centuries ago, Estonian pagans lived here.  Historians believe that this place was inhabited in ancient times.  In the XIII century, a pagan fortress was captured by militant Christians from Livonia.  They immediately started building a new citadel, but it has not survived to this day.  True, the remains of it were discovered during archaeological excavations. </p><p>  In the second half of the 13th century, a Gothic cathedral was built on the north side of the hill.  Nearby was a cemetery.  This cathedral became the center of the Derpt bishopric.  In the 16th century, the city was attacked by Protestants.  The cathedral was closed.  Almost completely, it was destroyed by the Russian army during the Livonian War.  The cemetery functioned until the 18th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Dome Cathedral" class="if uuid-2447946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2447946.jpg"></div><p>  In the XIX century, a library was built on the ruins of the cathedral on the orders of Alexander I.  In 1981, this building was converted into the University Historical Museum.  A few years later, he conducted a large-scale restoration. </p><p>  The museum houses many exhibits that have historical value primarily for the university.  Here are scientific tools, rare books.  The outer walls of the choirs and ruins are preserved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitestonia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tartu Observatory" class="if uuid-2447929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2447929.jpg"></div><h2>  Observatory </h2><p>  The building was erected in 1810.  Like many historical buildings in Tartu, the observatory was designed by Krause.  In 1946, it was separated from the university.  The observatory was included in the Academy of Sciences.  Since 1947, it belonged to the Institute of Physics, Mathematics, and Mechanics at the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR.  The main attraction of the Tartu Observatory is the Struve Arc, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005. </p><p>  Reviews of Tartu attractions are usually positive.  Tourists admire the old buildings, neat little houses in the German style, cozy cafes.  But according to some guests of this Estonian city, there is nothing to do here for more than two days.  Holidays in Tartu are suitable for those who do not like vanity, but prefer peace and quiet.  The disadvantage of this city is not very developed infrastructure. </p>
