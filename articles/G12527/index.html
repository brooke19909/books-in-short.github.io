Even the most comfortable and convenient rented apartment will not be able to fully give you the warmth of the hearth.  That is why, sooner or later, you will think about buying your property.  Quite often, choosing an apartment in the capital, potential buyers give preference to the Moscow region complexes and areas, sometimes because of the affordable cost per square meter.  This time LCD “Bereg” (Khimki) came into our view.  The comfort class project immediately attracted the attention of those who had long thought about acquiring their own living space.  As part of this material, we will make a full review of the complex, highlighting its features, location, layout and price level. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  Residential complex “Bereg” (Khimki) is an elite residential development project being built on the banks of the Moscow Canal, north of the capital.  For the construction of all buildings, ceramic brick with hollow ceilings is used, which gives buildings a number of obvious and undeniable advantages.  Such houses demonstrate amazing heat and sound insulation properties that even the so popular monolithic buildings cannot compare with. </p><div class="photo" data-original="himki-bereg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd shore Khimki" class="if uuid-3165518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3165518.jpg"></div><p>  According to the project, 11 brick houses from 6 to 7 floors will be erected on an area of ​​11 hectares, as well as a multi-level covered parking for 800 cars.  The complex is designed for 1220 apartments, according to preliminary estimates, about 3,000 people can live on its territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  LCD “Bereg”, as well as LCD “Right coast” (Khimki), is being built using advanced technologies, which allows to achieve the highest possible quality of construction, while reducing costs.  All houses are equipped with imported high-speed freight and passenger elevators, which operate in almost silent mode.

In fact, they are fundamentally different, but there is something in common between them - both are being built on the banks of the Moscow Canal.  This is a picturesque place near Moscow, a small oasis in the middle of a cramped, noisy and gray capital.  Today, new buildings in Khimki, just north of Moscow, are prestigious.  A huge part of modern Muscovites want to move from the hustle and bustle and endless congestion to a comfortable corner of the Moscow region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.9506185" data-lng="37.47281620000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/0/8/2/16082.png"></div><p>  The developer managed the impossible - to use the territory with a gorgeous view and untouched nature, only 15 minutes drive from the capital (Khimki, Ivankino village, Beregovaya St.).  Walking along the promenade, forest belt, outdoor activities will definitely appeal to all residents, while they will not feel any discomfort due to the well-thought-out infrastructure of the complex and the entire district as a whole.
