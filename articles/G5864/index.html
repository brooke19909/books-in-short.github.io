    <h2>  Creature </h2><p>  The Pyramid enterprise in St. Petersburg was formed by order of the Minister of Radio Industry of the Soviet Union on February 27, 1980 and was originally a Leningrad branch of the Granit concern.  The tasks of the production and technical enterprise included support for the construction of unique over-the-horizon radar stations of the Darial project. </p><p>  The construction of engineering and laboratory facilities began in 1980 and lasted 6 years.  Their total area was more than 10,600 m <sup>2</sup> .  The production was equipped with the most advanced engineering complexes and technical equipment in the USSR. </p><h2>  Radar "Daryal" </h2><p>  In 1980, the Pyramid PTP was appointed the lead contractor for the creation of the Daryal type radar at two sites: in <span>Gabala (Azerbaijan)</span> and near the city of Pecher (Komi, ASSR).  Until 1986, its employees were engaged in equipping stations, supervised installation, commissioning.  Also, specialists of the enterprise have developed functional software. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the end, these were the only stations of the Daryal project that were completely completed and took up combat duty.  Today the company "Pyramid" from St. Petersburg provides their services. </p>

    <h2>  Radar "Daryal-U" </h2><p>  In 1984, organizations commissioned the installation of construction systems and equipment for modernized Daryal-U class radars at sites in the Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk regions and near the city of Balkhash, Kazakh SSR.  Work was carried out until 1995.  Unfortunately, in the 90s, financing of large-scale expensive projects was nullified.  Projects of varying degrees of readiness were frozen, and later dismantled. </p><p>  The Balkhash radar station had the highest degree of readiness.  In 1990, a computer complex based on a domestic computer, transmitting and receiving equipment, was completely mounted.  In 1991, factory tests began.  The station was 95% ready, but after Kazakhstan gained independence, it deteriorated and collapsed.  The Krasnoyarsk radar station in Yeniseysk-15 was dismantled under the pretext of "detente" in 1989, despite the fact that it was practically ready for operation.  In place of the Irkutsk radar, a more modern complex is now erected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Microelectronics </h2><p>  In 2009, the NPP "Pyramid" (St. Petersburg) organized the assembly of printed circuit boards.  Design capacity is about 25,000 units per month.  Thus, the organization ensured a complete assembly cycle of electronic products: from the manufacture of cases to the production of components.  Installed innovative equipment allows us to produce products that are not inferior in quality and characteristics to such giants of the electrical industry as Boeing, Thales, Norton-Grooman, General Dynamic, Lockhead. </p><p>  Board assembly includes the following steps: </p><ul><li>  Surface mount. </li><li>  Installation of volumetric components. </li><li>  PCB washing. </li><li>  Selective moisture protection. </li><li>  Vacuum thermal packaging. </li><li>  X-ray control. </li><li>  Repair (if necessary) on a semi-automatic BGA station. </li><li>  Optical inspection. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LLC Pyramid St. Petersburg" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/1844601.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Specialization </h2><p>  NPP Pyramid, St. Petersburg, carries out the following types of work: </p><ul><li>  Development of radio technical information multifunctional systems for special purposes. </li><li>  Production, repair, maintenance of functionally-completed devices of radio information systems. </li><li>  Software development for technological and control systems. </li><li>  Installation and assembly of printed circuit boards. </li><li>  Development of projects and budget documentation for engineering support systems. </li><li>  Construction, installation, commissioning and repair work at defense and civilian facilities. </li><li>  <span>Commissioning</span> on engineering systems. </li><li>  Carrying out work to protect information representing state secrets. </li></ul><p>  The company is included in the list of strategic joint stock companies. </p><h2>  Products </h2><p>  In addition to printed circuit boards, Pyramid LLC (St. Petersburg) manufactures: </p><ul><li>  Video screens with a step of 1.7 mm diodes.  Thanks to the "monolithic" design, they do not need ventilation and forced cooling.  They have thermal, moisture, and dust protection.  Very thin, lightweight, energy efficient, there are no analogues in the world.  They can be used separately to build seamless screens of unlimited area.  Designed for dispatch nodes of enterprises, command, situational centers, <span>sports facilities,</span> television companies, entertainment events, etc. </li><li>  Video screens with a diode pitch of 2.08 mm.  They have the same characteristics. </li><li>  Video screens with a step of diodes of 2.54 mm. </li><li>  LED lamps.  According to Russian laws, the production of incandescent lamps will be phased out.  To replace them, NPP Pyramid produces a wide range of various fixtures, which vary in size, design, color gamut and energy consumption.  Thanks to the modern equipment used and high-quality components, the company gives a 5-year product warranty, while the estimated LED life is 15 years. </li><li>  Standard shipping containers. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyramid Club St. Petersburg" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/1844599.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Field of activity </h2><p>  Pyramid OJSC (St. Petersburg) is involved in the maintenance and dismantling of mothballed Daryal-class radars.  In addition, the company carries out work at other sites, however, due to secrecy, they are not advertised.  The company‚Äôs activities extend to the regions of the Komi Republic, Irkutsk Oblast, Murmansk Oblast, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Leningrad Oblast, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The head production and laboratory complex of the enterprise is located at 42 Ordzhonikidze Street, in the southern part of St. Petersburg, near Victory Square.  The placement is very successful, at the intersection of the main highways of the "Northern Palmyra": Moscow and Pulkovsky Highways, Leninsky and Slava Avenues.  Pulkovo Airport is a 10-12 minute drive away.  By the way, it should not be confused with the Pyramid Club (St. Petersburg) - these are completely different organizations. </p>
