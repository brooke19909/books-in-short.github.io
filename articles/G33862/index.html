This is the most common form of folk art.  Thanks to archaeological excavations, it is known that people embroidered in the 9th-10th centuries.  In written sources, references to this type of craft begin several centuries later.  Many patterns of ancient cross-stitch come to our days. </p><p>  Rural residents were engaged in this craft in the winter, when there was no land work, and only in daylight.  The peasants made the fabric mainly from linen and hemp, and most often woolen threads were used for embroidery.  Noble ladies embroidered on silk or velvet with silver and gold threads, pearls and other expensive materials. </p><h2>  Types of embroidery in Russia </h2><p>  It was known several embroidery stitches (surface, in the attachment and others).  But the cross was the most popular.  He was considered a special symbol, protecting from evil eye and damage. </p><p>  From an early age, girls embroidered a dowry.  This process took them about 8-10 years (girls were taught the art of embroidery from 7 years old, and already married at 16-17).  By the quality of the embroidery it was possible to judge how accurate the future bride was.  Before the wedding, a dowry was arranged, where everyone could see the girl's work. </p><p>  Among the patterns of ancient cross-stitch, as well as in other techniques, the preferred patterns were: </p><ul><li>  birds; </li><li>  divine theme; </li><li>  animals; </li><li>  flowers and trees; </li><li>  curls, rhombuses, triangles. </li></ul><p>  In ancient times, the color of embroidery was also of great importance - mainly shades of red prevailed.  This color was considered a symbol of vitality.  Black color in embroidery symbolized the earth, or rather fertility, blue - heaven. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vivesymari.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidered flowers" class="if uuid-3121779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3121779.jpg"></div><h2>  Vintage embroidery on products </h2><p>  Needleworkers embroidered men's shirts, ladies' shirts, dresses, clothes for children.  Most often, embroidered patterns were located on the neck, belt, cuffs.  The clothes of the nobles were embroidered very richly - with the help of expensive materials, because it was used to judge the worthiness of a person. </p><p>  The technique, as well as the patterns of ancient cross-stitch, was handed down from generation to generation, from mother to daughter.  Embroidered not only clothes, but also household items - towels, napkins, tablecloths, bedspreads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidered clothes" class="if uuid-3121782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3121782.jpg"></div><h2>  Sacred meaning of ancient cross-stitch </h2><p>  During embroidery, the craftswomen read out prayers, as it was believed that in this case the thing would have powerful energy and strength.  During work there should not have been bad thoughts. </p><p>  The secret meaning was invested in many patterns - they contained elements considered to be a talisman.  According to legend, they not only protected a person from dark forces, but also brought good luck and wealth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ideally ‚Äúclean‚Äù was a product embroidered in one day - from dawn to dusk.  Sometimes more than one craftswoman worked on it to finish the work on time.  People believed that such a thing could protect against the evil eye, disasters and other troubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="collections.artsmia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vintage cross stitch" class="if uuid-3121778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3121778.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern embroidery </h2><p>  Nowadays, such a variety of materials is used for embroidery that our grandmothers and great-grandmothers could only dream of.  Now in stores you can find a huge variety of basics for embroidery - velvet, organza, mesh, felt and many others.  And from the choice of embroidery materials themselves, the spirit is breathtaking - beads, glass beads, beads, pearls, floss, gimp, sequins, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vintage cross-stitch patterns" class="if uuid-3121824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/3121824.jpg"></div><p>  When embroidering with a cross, as before, the base fabric and threads are used.  In rare cases, the craftswomen supplement their work with some other materials.  Many patterns of ancient cross-stitch come to our days.  They can be seen printed in magazines, on specialized sites, as well as many manufacturers produce whole sets for working with canvas and thread in the kit.  Among these sets, you can find patterns of ancient cross-stitch flowers, charms, landscapes, and plots from the everyday life of Russian people. </p>
