This is not to say that nobody knew about this city before.  Everyone who is interested in Russian history and culture was aware of the existence of this settlement.  In chronicles, Ustyug was mentioned at the very beginning of the thirteenth century, because in the history of Ancient Russia he had his own prominent role.  But a well-thought-out advertising move with the announcement of his residence as Santa Claus made many in December of each year look at the map in search of an answer to the question of where the Great Ustyug is.  And the entire Vologda region clearly did not lose from such attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the great ustyug" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/292849.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  <strong>From Moscow to where Veliky Ustyug is located</strong> </p><p>  For many centuries, the cities of the Russian north were in the very center of trade, craft and economic life.  But by the beginning of the twentieth century, the main trunk trade routes had moved much south.  Merchants and industrialists did not care where the Great Ustyug is located.  Such economic circumstances, hindering the development of the city, contributed significantly to the preservation of the architectural, cultural and historical heritage of the city.  And it impresses with both volume and visual expressiveness.  About thirty Orthodox churches and monasteries of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have survived in the city and its environs.  Most of them are carefully restored and are in excellent condition.  First of all, it is the Mikhailo-Arkhangelsk and Spaso-Preobrazhensky monasteries.  Church of the Ascension and Simeon the Stylite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the great Ustyug map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/292848.jpg" width="500"></div>  A characteristic feature of the architectural heritage of Veliky Ustyug is that stone construction predominates here, and therefore there are almost no monuments of wooden architecture.  In recent years, significant funds have been invested in the development of the tourist infrastructure of the city.  The recreational potential of the region allows you to make such investments with confidence.  The flow of tourists, including from Moscow, is steadily increasing every year.  Apparently, people are very interested in where the Great Ustyug is located.  The map of this city and its immediate surroundings, by the way, contains many historical monuments noteworthy for tourists.  And with places where you can stay on vacation, everything is quite safe here.  And in a few years it will be even better. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trip to the great ustyug" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/292850.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <p>  <strong>How to get there</strong> </p><p>  A trip to Veliky Ustyug involves overcoming significant distances multiplied by the unimportant quality of local roads.  In recent years, work is underway to improve them, but much remains to be done.  The easiest way to get here is through the regional center.  The best option is to transfer in Vologda by regular bus to Veliky Ustyug.  It leaves daily, but more than eight hours are to be spent on the journey.  The city has both a train station and an airport of local lines, but cars are still the most reliable mode of transport. </p>
