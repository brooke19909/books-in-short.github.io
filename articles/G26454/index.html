On the Costa Brava, residents have mastered all places protected from the northern winds by bays and cliffs.  Here you can observe an amazing combination of harsh nature with emerald water of the Mediterranean Sea, framed by coastal cliffs.  The beaches here are beautiful - clean and secluded, they attract vacationers of a wide variety of categories. </p><p>  The most developed is the territory of Lloret de Mar, which is considered the tourist heart of the Costa Brava.  The resort is the center of all entertainment on the coast.  In a relatively limited area there are many nightclubs, bars and discos with laser shows and dance programs, as well as hotels.  One of the most popular guest accommodation options in Lloret de Mar is the Sunshine Park 3 * hotel. </p>

Among them, there are both positive and negative judgments. </p><h2>  About transfer to hotel </h2><p>  Some reviewers pay special attention to this topic, since they have their first impressions of vacation in Sunshine Park 3 *.  Unfortunately, they cannot be called pleasant. </p><p>  After 10 minutes of driving from the airport, it turns out that the air conditioning in the bus does not work, tourists share.  The transfer guide, trying to save the situation, pretends that he just broke.  For young children in such conditions (heat of degrees 37) it is very difficult to overcome the path to the hotel.  Reviewers call this road hell.  In addition, vacationers report that the bus does not drive to the hotel, since the streets in the city are quite narrow and the bus cannot be reached.  Guests have to walk about 5 minutes from the bus to the hotel. </p><h2>  About Check In </h2><p>  If you arrive at the hotel ahead of time, check-in occurs immediately, tourists say.  A room is provided without any problems, which is later used by guests only to spend the night. </p><h2>  About staff </h2><p>  The staff and the service, guests believe that you should put 5 points out of 5. Many agree that the hotel staff is excellent, everyone always smiles and speaks Russian!  At the reception, the authors of reviews say, Russian-speaking girls always work.  If necessary, they will explain how to get there and help in case of any problems. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The authors of the reviews report that the hotel is located far from the beach, walk 10-15 minutes on foot.  About as much - to the street with discos and bars, as well as to the bus station. </p><p>  In the evenings, the neighboring hotel plays live music, entertaining three blocks around - you can forget about silence.  In addition, according to vacationers, the hotel "drunk Moroccans and Germans yell" until the morning.  When contacting the reception, guests receive an answer that the administration can not calm down the raging guests, since they are ‚Äústoned‚Äù.  This fact, tourists say, is not conducive to creating a comfortable atmosphere in the hotel for all residents. </p><p>  Some guests complain that this hotel has no hairdryers.  Ladies have to go wet with all their dinners.  Rather, there is a hairdryer, but in quantity: 2 pieces per hotel.  Every time a hairdryer should be requested at the reception.  It is not always possible to get it. </p><p>  A night guard of Caucasian appearance, vacationers complain, he allows himself vulgar jokes hinting at visiting ladies.  It is not pleasant for women and girls to return after clubs to the hotel at night, because they have to deal with this type. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  Many guests believe that Sunshine Park 3 * is an excellent hotel, with comfortable rooms, where everything you need is there.  They clean the rooms daily, air conditioning works. </p><p>  Others object to them that every room in this hotel is a ‚Äúrare scoop‚Äù: there is no hairdryer, audible terrible, mediocre cleaning, they don‚Äôt change the bed.  It‚Äôs good that the plumbing, although old, is in working condition.  The windows overlook the windows of neighboring hotels.  More radical authors of the reviews call the views opening from the windows of the rooms - ‚Äúan adder with cigarette gobies and other garbage.‚Äù </p><p>  Guests note that the rooms are damp, shower sometimes leaks, so in the room on the floor you can see a puddle.  You can‚Äôt use free Wi-Fi, as the advertisement promises, even at the reception, if necessary you have to go to the neighboring hotel for internet. </p><p>  Reviewers complain about the noise in the rooms: the neighbors are very well heard.  The windows are noisy too.  A lot of cars, motorcycles.  Young people have fun loudly, day and night, </p><p>  Air conditioning, guests share, works so that you have to use blankets.  Mattress covers seem strange to some - oilcloth, rustling.  Guests remove them on their own and put them in the closet. </p><p>  The refrigerator is located in a cabinet under the lock.  The cost of a 10-day rental is 20 euros (1322 rubles), in addition, a deposit is required: 10 euros (approximately 661 rubles) </p><p>  One thing saves, guests say: they didn‚Äôt come to sit in the room. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  According to vacationers who have left 3 * reviews about Sunshine Park, the hotel provides breakfast only.  Standard set of products: cheese, sausage, toast, juice, coffee.  Lunch and dinner are offered at the neighboring Copacabana Hotel.

    <p>  To eat in a cafe in the city, tourists share, a little expensive, but still affordable.  The cost of lunch is from 10 euros (about 680 p.).  Price of a portion of pizza: from 1.5 euros (102, 36 p.). <strong><em> </em></strong>  In supermarkets: the cost of 1.5 liters of sangria: 0.90 euros (61.41 rubles), 240 grams of blue cheese - 1.90 euros (129.65 rubles), 300 grams of ham (sliced) - 1.30 euros (88.71 rubles), 8 liters of water - 0.76 euros (51.86 <strong><em> </em></strong>  R.). <strong><em> </em></strong> </p><h2>  About the pool </h2><p>  Some guests do not understand who the rooftop pool is for, because they have never seen a vacationer there.  Some call it a "parody," complaining that the hotel does not have its own territory. </p><p>  But many reviewers share that they enjoyed visiting the small rooftop pool in the morning after breakfast and always enjoyed a secluded vacation there. </p><h2>  About the sea and the beach </h2><p>  To the sea, tourists say, about 5 minutes of leisurely walking.  Guests relax on the sandy beach, which is public.  The sea here is warm and clean, vacationers share.  On the way to the sea, you can look into the shops where you can buy everything from slippers to outerwear.  The goods here are offered beautiful and inexpensive, and the prices are pleasantly surprising. </p><p>  The sea, according to vacationers, is very clean, transparent.  The authors of the reviews warn that entry into the sea is rather inconvenient for children: a meter from the coast immediately the depth.  Swimming is best with boats.  The entrance to the sea and the beach is not sandy, but pebble (small pebbles).  Rent of sunbeds and umbrellas costs 12 euros (793.20 p.). </p><h2>  About excursions </h2><p>  Reviewers call all excursions very interesting, noting the professionalism of their guides. </p><p>  The hotel guide is present at the hotel every day for two hours a week.  Always helps when needed. </p><p>  Hotel guests are advised to take excursions to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãBesalu Rupit, Montserrat. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  In general, tourists remain good impressions of staying in Sunshine Park 3 *.  Especially picky you can come here, without any doubt, they believe.  The hotel‚Äôs advantages include: convenient location, comfort in the rooms, the friendliness of the staff.  The downside is the significant audibility in the rooms. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews share that Lloret de Mar is a magnificent town with many interesting things for tourists.  Here is a nice, clean beach where you can spend most of the time, and only sleep in the hotel.  The town itself, as vacationers say, is mainly for young people.  Youth is the main contingent of visitors. </p><p>  Reviewers warn that Sunshine Park 3 * should not come with small children. </p><p> The hotel is 3 *, it makes no sense to expect a higher level from it, many vacationers believe.  Some believe that it does not correspond to its category - as a maximum, it pulls at 2 *.  Someone urges to save their nerves and money and not to go to this hotel.  Others assure that if there is no alternative closer to the beach and the center of nightlife, you can stop at this option - provided that tourists are ready to live in ascetic conditions.  Many refrain from recommending the hotel. </p>
