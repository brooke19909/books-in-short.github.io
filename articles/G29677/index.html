    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The idea to build this facility belongs to Bob Stupac, who already owned several casinos throughout Las Vegas.  In "Stratosphere" he saw the perfect replacement for his own Vegas World gambling establishment, which is very popular among wealthy visitors to the city.  In 1995, Grand Casinos joined the creation of the project, seeing a good potential in this idea.  A little later, the creation of Stratosphere Corporation was announced - a public company whose shares could be acquired by anyone.  In general, the case was gaining momentum. </p><p>  The Stratosphere Las Vegas was inaugurated on April 30, 1996, but after a while, the Stratosphere Corporation experienced a series of financial blows, and therefore went bankrupt.  Due to such turmoil, the construction of the second hotel complex was suspended, although work on the construction and facing of a couple of floors has already been completed.  Economic problems affected the owners of the establishment, where Karl Haykan, who bought the bonds issued, became the main figure.  The hotel-casino has come under the complete control of the Icahn Enterprises LP holding owned by the aforementioned Aikan. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, after such powerful shocks for the casino, new horizons have opened.  The Stratosphere Las Vegas expanded significantly in June 2001, when the construction of a hotel with 1000 rooms was finally completed.  65 million dollars were invested in the implementation of this project - a considerable amount by the standards of that time. </p>

    <h2>  Location and reputation </h2><p>  No city in the world can boast such an insane reputation for excitement and vibrant nightlife as Las Vegas.  The Stratosphere, the address of which is given below, has only increased the influx of tourists, as it is considered the highest observation tower in the entire United States.  Casino Address: USA, <span>Nevada,</span> Las Vegas, Strip Boulevard. </p><p>  Soon after the opening of the casino, it attracted too little attention from visitors, as it had an unremarkable location in relation to other large institutions of the city.  However, the dumping policy for numbers and all kinds of bonuses fulfilled their task, which gave Stratosphere success.  Many tourists today do not like the location of our heroine, but the second half regards such a tricky address as an advantage.  And this can be explained by several facts.  First of all, the building stretched its walls in the midst of the most popular casino hotels in Las Vegas, located a little to the south on the Strip, stretching to the suburbs of Paradise, as well as those who found their refuge north of the historic center.  Secondly, there is a 24-hour connection between most gambling establishments, which allows you to better see Las-Vegas and see the main attractions of the city.  This is best done on a panoramic bus that runs throughout the city. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Stratosphere Las Vegas": attractions </h2><p>  It is easy to guess that the main advantage of Las Vegas is its countless entertainment, where a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive and joyful emotions is provided for many years to come.  As for the "Stratosphere", its highlight is the observation tower, which rises 350 meters.  In addition to the high-altitude record in Las Vegas, the building also ranks second among free-standing facilities in the western United States after the Kennecott Pipe in Utah.  At the top you will find a viewing platform, a revolving restaurant and various attractions, more about which later. </p><p>  Insanity the Ride is one of the most popular attractions located at an altitude of 274 meters.  Representing a certain carousel, it has the form of claws, which are located like a star.  Armchairs for passengers are located at the very bottom of those very limbs that are attached to a rotating console.  As a result, travelers are taken outside the tower, where circular rotation begins at a considerable speed - about 70 km / h.  Moreover, the chairs are smoothly tilted to the horizontal so that tourists can look at the ground from the height of an 85-story building. </p>

    <p>  The Big Shot is one of the highest attractions in the world, located at an altitude of 329 meters.  In appearance, it is very banal: comfortable chairs, placed in a circle on a square frame, begin to accelerate sharply and slow down, creating a kind of illusion of a jump.  In fact, the attraction seems to glide along the remarkable spire of the structure. </p><p>  It is these entertainments that are most popular among visitors.  Until 2005, the highest roller coasters also functioned here, which were subsequently replaced by another attraction, which is an open carriage moving in different directions from the tower.  In general, positive is ensured. </p><h2>  Free jumps </h2><p>  If all these attractions are not enough for you, you can experience real extreme and adrenaline by making a free jump from the dome of the building.  This is no longer for the faint of heart, because you "fall" for more than 8 seconds, during which all life seems to be flashing before your eyes.  Of course, for the thrill you'll have to pay a tidy sum, namely - 100 US dollars.  The attraction itself boasts a rather cunning design.  Initially, a person is weighed here, after which the received information is entered into a computer.  After calculating certain factors, you are tied with ropes, sliding along 2 barely noticeable slings that connect the dome of the hotel-casino to the ground.  As a result, after the jump you seem to really fly without feeling insurance on yourself, and only closer to the ground the structure begins to slow down this heartbreaking flight. </p><h2>  Hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Stratosphere (Las Vegas) is a separate pride of the complex, which boasts chic, individually designed rooms.  In the rooms, visitors will be delighted with comfortable furniture, a huge plasma, climate control and other household items necessary for a comfortable stay.  In addition, most rooms have a living area and an office, so the hotel is suitable for both business people and ordinary vacationers who need complete peace and comfort. </p>

    <h2>  Casino </h2><p>  Of course, the main attraction of Las Vegas is the numerous casinos, which are located here with a clear excess.  Billions of dollars rotate in the city every month, which attracts the richest people in the States and abroad to crazy entertainment, shocking weddings and festivities.  As a rule, all those casinos located in unpopular areas of the city attract visitors with much lower rates and a variety of bonuses.  "Stratosphere" was no exception.  For example, in order to play blackjack, you will have to pay $ 5, which is not typical for most casino hotels along the Strip. </p>
