    <h2>  Project history </h2><p>  The temple ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù was built in Saratov in 1906 according to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãarchitect P. Zybin.  As a basis in his project, <span>this architect</span> took one of the most famous structures in Russia - St. Basil's Cathedral in the capital.  As a result, a reduced and no less spectacular copy of this metropolitan cathedral turned out.  The church ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù was built at the Bishop‚Äôs Court of the main priest of Saratov.  Its construction began in 1904 and lasted two years. </p><h2>  Temple description </h2><p>  The architecture of this church is connected with <span>St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral</span> primarily by small, brightly colored twisted cupolas surrounding the main dome.  This church also looks like a Moscow cramped interior, not designed for simultaneous visits to a large number of parishioners at once, with symmetrical entrances and exterior decoration.  In addition to St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral, many compare the architecture of this beautiful church with the Savior on Blood in St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Thus, this church is one of the most spectacular architectural structures of such a city as Saratov.  The Church ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù is in our time a cult tent structure on the rows of kokoshniks (three) with two narthexes located on both sides of the main building.  Arched doors and windows give a special flavor to the ensemble of the church.  The temple building itself is painted in pure white, and some of its parts - in a nice beige.  The symbol of the arch in Christian culture traditionally means a transition to a different, better world.  The courtyard in front of the church is lined with large slabs, and concrete tall flower beds with flowers are installed in front of the main entrance.  The fence of the temple is painted in the same style with its facades. </p><p>  Since the temple ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù was originally conceived as a chapel, it is oriented not to the east, like most Orthodox churches, but to the northeast.  To his left today you can see the remains of the bishop's house.  Once the Saratov Diocese rented its lower floors to shops. </p><p>  The form of crosses installed on the domes of the temple can be considered very interesting.  At the bottom, each of them has a small crescent.  According to a preserved legend, the crosses of the temple ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù (Saratov) received a similar design in honor of one of the victories over the Turks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Main shrine </h2><p>  Only one throne was erected in the church - in honor of the icon of the Virgin Mary "In the sorrows and sorrows of Consolation."  This iconic image is still the main shrine of the church.  Regarding the image ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù there is even a folk tradition.  According to legend, Bishop Hermogenes ordered it specifically for this temple on the holy Mount Athos.  It is believed that this icon is an exact copy of a very ancient Byzantine miraculous and is itself capable of curing many diseases. </p><h2>  The activities of the temple before the revolution </h2><p>  After the construction of divine services in this church took place regularly, every day.  They were led by monks from the Bishop‚Äôs house.  By the beginning of the last century, the brotherhood included only 13 novices and 16 holy fathers.  However, this church has never had a parish.  Baptisms, burials and weddings before the revolution were not carried out in it.  Only liturgies, all-night services and prayers served here. </p><p>  After the revolution, various innovations shook, of course, the city of Saratov.  The ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù church was therefore used for its intended purpose for a very short time. </p><h2>  In the years of the USSR </h2><p>  After the October Revolution, as a cult center, the temple ceased to exist.  In Soviet times, its building was known as the urban planetarium for a longer time.  So called institutions in which you can get a lot of useful information about stars and planets.  Fortunately, the hand did not rise to destroy such a beautiful temple with the new authorities. </p><p>  In the 30s, the House of Mother and Child was opened in the church building.  Subsequently, other secular organizations acted in the church.  The planetarium was the last of them and lasted until the transfer of the temple to believers at the end of the last century. </p><p>  It is very interesting that the crosses from the ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù church were removed only in 1960 at the initiative of the first secretary of the regional party committee of Saratov.  In 1965, Bishop Pimen Khmelevsky asked the city authorities to restore the premises of the church.  The city council, of course, did not give permission, and refused to provide material assistance to the parish.  However, the mood in terms of the Orthodox faith had already begun to change by that time.  And therefore, the authorities carried out the restoration of this historical monument on their own, with the money of the city.  At the same time, crosses were again erected on the church (under the personal responsibility of the secretary of the regional committee of the city of Saratov).  The Church ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù, or rather, its main dome, was decorated with gilding.  At the same time, restorers also restored the top in the left wing of the building.  Since then, the planetarium has been included in the list of the best attractions of the city and has become the object of close attention of tourists. </p>

    <h2>  90s </h2><p>  Like most other churches, the temple ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù (Saratov) was again handed over to believers in the early 90's.  The priests immediately set up a limit in his side extension, consecrated in the name of Sergius of Radonezh.  Antimins from the seminary temple once destroyed by the authorities was entrusted to the throne.  A large bell tower was also erected and the interior was repaired.  The first rector of the newly opened church was the priest Lazarus of the Newly Baptized.  The main throne of the church was consecrated in 1993 by Lord Pimen. </p>

    <h2>  Temple nowadays </h2><p>  In 2004, on the basis of the parish of the ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù church, a photo of which can be seen on this page, the Bishop‚Äôs Compound was restored.  In addition to the ‚ÄúSatisfy My Sorrows‚Äù temple, they attributed to it a chapel located in the center of Saratov on Theater Square, dedicated to the icon ‚ÄúPicturesque Spring‚Äù.  At the same time, large-scale restoration work began on the church.  A beautiful large iconostasis in the old Russian style was installed here.  Also, work was done to change the interior of the temple. </p><p>  In 2005-2006, the reconstruction of the Sergiev chapel of the church began.  Its area was significantly increased due to the elimination of utility rooms.  In addition, a stylish vaulted ceiling was arranged in the aisle and a font was installed for the baptismal rites (with complete immersion).  In 2006, work began on the restoration of the temple outside.  The reconstruction of the building has undergone significant.  For example, the old roof was replaced with a new one - copper. </p>
