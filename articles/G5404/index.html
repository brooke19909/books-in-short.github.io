The development of tourism in this country was due to the huge flow of people coming.  Ancient civilization and historical sights attracted some here, others - the hot sun and the gentle warm sea.  But for those and for others it was necessary to create favorable conditions for staying in the country.  Despite the fact that in Egypt itself the level of the economy is not high enough, the Egyptian resort areas are distinguished by developed infrastructure and excellent quality of service. </p><p>  One of the most interesting places on the Red Sea coast is Hurghada.  Many tourist hotels have been built here.  The SiGal Hurghada Hotel is very popular among Egyptians (‚ÄúSea Gull‚Äù translates as a seagull).  This hotel is located on the first coastline very close to the sea.  The successful location of the SeaHnal hotel in Hurghada opens up additional opportunities for tourists to relax, because it is located only two kilometers from Hurghada. </p><p>  Several buildings of the five-star hotel accommodate 387 rooms (mainly of the ‚Äústandard‚Äù category).  Almost every room has a private balcony or terrace.  For the comfortable stay of tourists in the rooms all conditions are created - bathroom, air conditioning, TV, <span>telephone, mini-bar.</span> </p><p>  The hotel has two adjacent adult outdoor pools and one for children, three restaurants, six bars and its own shopping center.  And also you will have the opportunity to play sports and maintain a great figure, despite the hearty and varied food in restaurants.  Dining at the hotel will delight even the most demanding tourists.  The buffet in the Cleopatra restaurant offers a huge selection of dishes.  All sorts of strong and non-alcoholic drinks in any bar on site are offered to anyone who wishes until midnight.  But the most striking reviews of the CiGnal Hotel in Hurghada from gourmets go to the Chinese restaurant, which is located on a hill with a wonderful view of the sea.  Chefs prepare excellent Chinese dishes that are in special demand. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although the hotel area is not very large, but there is always enough entertainment.  Animations with contests throughout the day and evening shows will fit perfectly into your daily routine.  A Turkish bath, a jacuzzi and a sauna will help you relax. </p>

    <p>  For children, there are also entertainment that will fill with a variety of impressions all day.  A playground, a shallow pool and a mini club will not let the kids get bored and allow their parents to calmly go about their business. </p><p>  The beach is not far away, as the SeGal Hurghada hotel is located on the first coastline.  Like the pool, the beach provides free sun loungers and <span>umbrellas.</span>  <span>Beach</span> towels are also issued absolutely free. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is perfect for those who come actively and have fun.  Young people will be delighted with local entertainment, both on site and outside the hotel.  A night disco and good music will make you have fun from the heart. </p><p>  In historical places you can ride with excursions from your operator.  Visit the famous Luxor Temple, ancient pyramids, museums and mosques. </p><p>  The Cigal Hurghada Hotel has been open for tourists since 2000 and its staff is well trained in the Russian language.  So the language barrier will not be a problem on vacation, and you can solve all problems with the staff without resorting to the services of guides. </p><p>  The season in Hurghada lasts all year round.  But the best months to stay in Egypt are October, November and May. </p>
