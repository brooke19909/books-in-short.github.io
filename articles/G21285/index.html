  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Housing shield: diagram, device, design principles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the time of the Soviets, people did not think about equipping opening electrical panels.  The usual platform on which a packet switch, an electricity meter and a pair of fuses, in common people called plugs, was quite enough was enough for everyone.  Moreover, the vast majority of them installed "bugs" - jumpers made of copper wire.  Now the security requirements have become completely different, traffic jams are a thing of the past, giving way to circuit breakers and other equipment designed to protect people.  Today's article will tell about the schemes of apartment shields assembled in our time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.staniforth.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All work is carried out exclusively with relieved voltage." class="if uuid-3060822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3060822.jpg"></div><h2>  Small introduction </h2><p>  Home craftsmen, even those who have completed the entire electrical installation in the apartment with their own hands, often fail before assembling the electrical cabinet, preferring to pay for the work of professional electricians.  However, it is not a fact that a real specialist will work, and not one that is popularly called "six-volt".  In addition, such a connection scheme for the apartment panel is not as complicated as it might seem at first glance.  The main thing here is to understand the principle.  In addition, if the wiring in the apartment is completed, there is no need to make complex calculations for the nominal values ‚Äã‚Äãof the automation.  This can be done by cross-section of wires suitable for the shield. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to start the assembly of the electrical cabinet </h2><p>  First of all, the home master needs to determine the number of circuit breakers, RCDs and their nominal value.  This is done quite simply, because all the wires are in front of the eyes.  It is best to take a piece of paper and sketch out an approximate layout of the modules on a DIN rail.  This will help determine what will be mounted - residual current <span>circuit breakers</span> (RCD) or <span>residual current circuit breakers (AEDT).</span>  Here the matter is in the free space inside the box.  After all, an RCD with an automatic machine occupies 3 modular places, and an AEDT - only 2. Sometimes this very factor becomes crucial.  <span>The layout of the dashboard</span> with an RCD will be slightly different - it is more difficult to switch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="raduga-sveta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metal cabinets are still the most sought after" class="if uuid-3060813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3060813.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of phases suitable for the introductory cabinet </h2><p>  Most often, the apartments are powered by 220 V, but in private houses it may well be 380 V. When connected to a single-phase circuit, the layout of the apartment panel will be simpler, but not by much.  If you wish, you can deal with a system of 380 V. But if it comes to apartments, then it will be considered exactly the scheme for one phase. </p><p>  When planning the arrangement of modular elements, it is worthwhile to provide a double place at the entrance, in front of the meter.  It is necessary to install an <span>opening circuit breaker.</span>  Many may ask why you need a place on 2 modules.  Despite the fact that a dashboard diagram for a single-phase system is being compiled, the input circuit breaker provides for the breakdown of two conductors - phase and zero. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="electroforum.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="This should look something like this" class="if uuid-3062689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3062689.jpg"></div><h2>  Location of protective automation elements: initial assembly </h2><p>  Having a sketch of the future electrical cabinet on hand, you can begin to prepare it.  It is necessary to place all protective automation in the correct sequence on the DIN rail.  Do not forget about 2 buses for neutral and ground wires. </p><p>  Consider an example of an electric apartment shield circuit, namely the location of protection elements in it in the presence of two DIN rails (from left to right, starting from the top): </p><ol><li>  Introductory <span>bipolar machine.</span> </li><li>  Electricity metering device. </li><li>  Main differential circuit breaker or <span>residual current device.</span> </li><li>  AVDT or RCD, going to separate groups. </li></ol><p>  The lower DIN rail is fully engaged in circuit breakers distributed in groups. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cookelectricalimprovements.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zero and ground bus should not be in contact" class="if uuid-3060826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3060826.jpg"></div><h2>  Switching the electrical panel </h2><p>  The assembly of the apartment shield diagram with difavtomatami or protective shutdown devices should begin from the input, gradually moving towards the outgoing lines.  At the same time, power is not supplied to the cabinet - this is done in the last turn.  An electric metering device is connected from the input, then a common AVDT or RCD, and after that the wiring is made into groups. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Helpful information!  Initially, the automation contacts should not be pulled much - there is a high probability of an error during switching, and it is not worth it to tear down the fixing screws again.  After the assembly is completed, you must again check everything carefully.  If the switching is satisfactory, the fixing screws can be pulled out.  The view below shows a similar assembly. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="UHqyuWSlHw8" data-url="https://youtu.be/UHqyuWSlHw8" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/3/9/9/1/13991.jpg"></div><h2>  Rules for installing residual current circuit breakers </h2><p>  Many home masters are mistaken precisely at this stage.  What can I say, even experienced electricians sometimes incorrectly connect such devices.  It should be remembered that if an RCD is present in the circuit of the apartment panel, the contact of the ground and ground wires cannot be allowed.  If this happens, then during operation, the protective shutdown device will periodically causelessly operate, which does not add to the comfort of living. </p><p>  For correct operation, the zero wire coming from the bus to each of the RCDs is then sent to its own separate group.  If you mix it up and send it to another line, leaving the phase on its own, the residual current device will constantly operate, as in the case of neutral contact with grounding.  This is due to the occurrence of a potential difference on the RCD coils. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.netzings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="It does not make sense to invite a specialist to assemble the electrical panel" class="if uuid-3060799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3060799.jpg"></div><h2>  Main power and cabinet test </h2><p>  Rechecking the circuit once again and extending the contacts, it is necessary to carefully lay all the wires - this will help later in the maintenance of the cabinet, access to equipment will be simplified.  After that, you can start connecting the power cable, but remember that if this is a private house, the owner does not have the right to take food from the pole - this work is performed by a specialist in the energy sales company, who installs a cabinet with feeder switch.  Here it is necessary to be fed from him. </p><p>  At the time of entry of the power cable into the electrical cabinet, there should be no voltage on it.  By connecting it to the machine, it is necessary to tightly stretch the contacts, turn on all the automation and only after that apply voltage.  In this case, according to the disconnected machine, it will become clear on which of the lines there is a malfunction.  There should not be any loads on outlets at this time.  Now it remains only to click on all RCDs in turn the "TEST" button.  Devices should trip by detecting leakage current.  If everything is in order, you can call a specialist at the electricity supplier company or RES housing and communal services to check the connection diagram of the apartment panel with a meter and seal the meter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="revize-elektro.revtechnik.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Testing the electrical panel is easy" class="if uuid-3060821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3060821.jpg"></div><h2>  A few tips for maintaining the electrical panel </h2><p>  If there is free space in the electrical cabinet, it makes sense to install a simple outlet in it.  It can come in handy if you need to connect some equipment nearby or even carry it normally during the repair process.  Power is supplied to it from the main AVDT or RCD.  In no case should you connect it to the introductory machine.  Such actions will be regarded by the energy supervisor as the theft of electricity, which is fraught with a very large fine. </p><p>  After the electrical cabinet has been put into operation (after 1-2 weeks), carefully tighten all the fixing screws of the contacts again.  Such audits should be done 2 times a year.  This eliminates heating as a result of oxidation and weakening of contacts.  All work must be done only with a tool with intact insulation, even if they are carried out with the voltage removed.  Automation may fail, and in this case, a crack in the handle of a screwdriver will quite possibly cost a life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="5736718.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electrician's tool must be in perfect condition" class="if uuid-3060806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3060806.jpg"></div><p>  As for the drawn diagram of the housing shield.  It should not be thrown away.  This sketch can help to significantly reduce future troubleshooting time when it occurs.  The same applies to cabling schemes for an apartment or a private house. </p><p>  Useful advice for those who decide to call for the repair of a professional electrician and are not sure of his qualifications.  In this case, you just need to pay attention to the tool with which it is going to work.  If the handles of pliers or screwdrivers are rewound with electrical tape, you should not trust him.  A good specialist keeps the tool in perfect condition, checking it every morning before work, as prescribed by safety rules and will never use a damaged one. </p><h2>  How to simplify the subsequent maintenance of the shield: recommendations of specialists </h2><p>  In order to make it easier in the future to understand what is going and where (over time this installation will be erased from memory), in addition to the signed machines, it makes sense to transfer the switching circuit of the electric cabinet to its door and glue it with adhesive tape on top.  So it will always be in front of the voices, and it will be easier for the invited specialist to deal with the problem if it arises.  In addition, you can hang a tag with a number on each wire, and decrypt the numbers on a swarm of doors. </p><p>  In the production of switching, it is necessary to observe the color coding.  If this is not done, after some six months the home master himself will not be able to figure out the intricacies of cables.  It‚Äôs also dangerous.  After all, looking at the yellow-green wire, everyone knows that it is not dangerous, this is grounding.  And if he is energized?  The consequences can be very dire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="revize-elektro.revtechnik.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subject to color coding, everything is clear at a glance" class="if uuid-3060815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3060815.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize the information presented </h2><p>  It is not difficult to draw up and assemble a diagram of a housing shield and this does not require special education or experience, although they are welcome.  The main thing in such work is accuracy and attention to detail.  After all, even what seems insignificant can subsequently cause a lot of trouble.  Well, if you take work seriously, it will not be as complicated as it seemed at the beginning.  And satisfaction from what has been done, from the fact that everything turned out as planned, is priceless. </p>
