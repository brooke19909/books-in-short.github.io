    <p>  Dramatic changes in terms of appearance did not occur.  The difference between the previous model consists exclusively in a huge size. </p><p>  Equipped iPad Pro with an incredibly large screen, a diagonal of as much as 12.9 inches.  Due to this, both size and weight increased.  Now the device weighs 700 grams, which is quite a lot, and it will be difficult to constantly hold it in your hands. </p><p>  On the sides of the device sheltered as many as four speakers.  Accordingly, the sound from the device is expected to be just excellent. </p><p>  The tablet is available in three familiar colors: gold, gray, and also black. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The most notable change is the iPad Pro's incredible screen size and quality.  An overview of all the details of this work of art is amazing. </p>

    <p>  First, we note the largest display that was installed by the company on a mobile device.  As much as 12.9 inches of pleasure made using the latest Retina technology, and a resolution of 2732 by 2048 only improves the overall impression.  A similar feature was used before in the iMac and allows you to transfer charge to the pixels faster, and, as a result, illuminate the screen more evenly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another interesting advantage was the dynamic screen frequency of the iPad Pro.  An overview of this function boils down to the fact that the display, if necessary, reduces image updates from 60 to 30. Thus, battery power is saved when viewing not very demanding content. </p><p>  Redesigned and multi-touch.  Now you can use not only your fingers, but also a pencil.  However, using the stylus does not work out everywhere, but only where it will bring maximum efficiency.  In addition, a pencil picks up more points than fingers. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the speakers of the iPad Pro.  The review of the novelty will delight not only fans of the company, but also many music lovers. </p><p>  They equipped the tablet with four speakers, which is quite rare in such devices.  The sound will surprise even a sophisticated listener, but that's not all.  The speakers are in pairs responsible for bass and fundamental frequencies.  Their roles vary depending on the orientation of the device. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The company also took care of the device‚Äôs internal memory.  It is known that the device will be released with 64 and 128 GB.  The price difference between the versions will be approximately a hundred dollars. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The device runs on an Apple A9x processor with two cores.  The performance of each of them will be 2.6 GHz, which is an excellent indicator for such an apparatus. </p><p>  The device has acquired as many as four gigabytes of RAM.  And in conjunction with a powerful processor, the tablet will be able to cope with absolutely all the tasks. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The device will be one of the first to work on iOS 9. At the same time, it is a virtue and a huge drawback for the iPad Pro.  Reviewing apps can lead to some confusion.  Most programs are not yet tailored to the new system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  With games, everything is much simpler, the tablet shows itself only from the best side, and here the claims are simply inappropriate. </p><p>  It is hoped that this minor problem will be quickly resolved and will realize the full potential of the device. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  A little surprised by the camera in the iPad Pro.  A review of the characteristics and data clearly indicates a complete resemblance to the parameters of the previous model.  In fact, no changes have occurred in this area. </p><p>  They equipped the device with 8 megapixels of the main camera, as well as 1.3 megapixels of the front camera.  Without a doubt, the quality of images on the device will be excellent, but the lack of changes is a little upsetting. </p><h2>  Additional equipment </h2>

    <p>  The tablet can be equipped with additional items.  One of these is the already well-known pencil, which allows you to realize the capabilities of the device to the maximum. </p><p>  Certainly, a pencil will be a useful purchase for the incredibly huge screen of the iPad Pro.  This subject will solve many difficulties both in work and in entertainment. </p><p>  Less useful would be the purchase of Smart Keyboard.  And the point is not even the uselessness of the subject, but the keyboard itself.  It is attached to the tablet as a cover; accordingly, not possessing the necessary rigidity, it can cause the device to fall. </p><p>  In addition, I want to work with the tablet with the help of touches, and Keyboard will not bring much convenience. </p><h2>  Release </h2><p>  The company said the product will be released in November 2015.  However, before that there was information about the release in September.  As a result, the iPad Pro (release date, as you can see, was postponed) was nevertheless presented in November. </p><p>  Sales of iPad Pro in Russia began almost simultaneously with the official release.  Although the device has not yet found a great response in the country, most likely, this trend arose because of the rather high price. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The company has released a truly amazing product.  The device is able to completely surpass and replace netbooks or even some laptops.  Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages, but the pluses still fully cover them. </p>
