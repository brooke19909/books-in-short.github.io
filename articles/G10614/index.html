    <h2>  Pages of history </h2><p>  At the Sports Palace, members of the TCK club began to engage.  A school of hockey and figure skating has opened.  Concerts of pop stars were held here, because the capacity of the Sports Palace ‚ÄúYubileiny‚Äù (Tver) is about 2,000 spectators. </p><p>  During the years of perestroika, the building was in disrepair.  Matches with the participation of the local hockey team, several children's sections, a few fairs - events held in the sports complex.  Like the whole country, Yubileiny was in crisis.  There was not enough money to finance and properly maintain the entire territory. </p><p>  But times have changed.  Funds began to be allocated for the development of sports, and the population began to live better financially.  The country began to tidy up existing sports arenas and venues.  In the late nineties, the second part of the "Jubilee" was opened, because people who wanted to play sports became crowded in the former squares. </p>
