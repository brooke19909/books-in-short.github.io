    <h2>  Model Overview </h2><p>  For Neoline, the development of functional combined instruments is not a novelty.  And even before the model entered the market, experts in the segment were looking forward to its success, because this time the creators were faced with the task of offering not a basic hybrid with typical capabilities, but something more developed and technologically advanced.  In many respects, the expectations were justified, and it is not surprising that it was the expansion of the list of functions that became the main feature of the modification.  New inclusions are based on the platform of the radar detector and DVR, the operation of which is supported by a satellite navigator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, there were some flaws, but they are mostly cosmetic in nature and generally do not change the picture.  Therefore, we can say that the main category of target consumers should at least get acquainted with the Neoline X-COP 9100 car DVR. Prices for the device, taking into account working qualities and functionality, are also acceptable - from 14 to 17 thousand rubles.  average.  This is not the top of the segment at all, but rather a solid solution for those who focus on the practicality of the proposed tools, not wanting to save on quality or, on the contrary, overpay for extra "chips" from premium link models. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The basic set of accessories and accessories turned out to be modest, but there is an explanation for this.  By expanding the configuration, developers of budget electronics tend to attract mainly, and in the middle and especially premium classes, such an approach has been less common lately.  One way or another, the primary additions to the kit are: </p><ul><li>  A charger designed to connect to the cigarette lighter. </li><li>  Adapter for memory cards. </li><li>  Clamp for windshield. </li><li>  Cable Mounts - 8 pcs. </li><li>  Instruction and coupon with warranty. </li></ul><p>  If we talk about the missing accessories, then this includes a memory card and a USB cable, through which it would be possible to connect the Neoline X-COP 9100 system to a computer. Owner reviews in this regard indicate inconvenience from transferring firmware only through a memory card.  Also, many people recommend in principle to abandon the products of little-known microSD manufacturers, since frankly cheap and low-quality drives of this type can cause the device to malfunction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Certain operating parameters may even seem outdated, but in combination with the option they just fully meet the modern needs of users.  At a minimum, there is a conformity of the declared characteristics of the actual performance of the Neoline X-COP 9100, and the reviews of the owners confirm this, indicating the accuracy of the device and the quality of the information provided.  Although, again, in these aspects of operation there are some nuances.  So, the main technical parameters can be represented as follows: </p><ul><li>  The number of cameras is 1. </li><li>  The recording format is cyclic with a resolution of 1920x1080. </li><li>  Visibility - 135 ¬∞. </li><li>  The diagonal of the screen is 2 inches. </li><li>  Processor - Ambarella A7. </li><li>  The capacity of the memory card is a maximum of 128 GB. </li><li>  Power supply - from the on-board network or battery pack. </li><li>  Battery capacity - 240 mAh. </li><li>  The dimensions of the device are 73x94x46 mm. </li><li>  Operational temperature range - from -20 to 70 ¬∞ C. </li></ul><h2>  Construction and design </h2><p>  The filling of the recorder and detector is placed in a small case, which is conveniently attached to the windshield by the mentioned complete retainer.  The power cable also communicates with the mount through a special connector on the bracket.  For dismantling or installation of the device, disassembling of the fixing structure is not required - the housing is easily removed from the gripping niche along the slide rails. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  By the way, the 12-24V power supply connector is duplicated, which indicates the detailed thoughtfulness of the physical ergonomics of the Neoline X-COP 9100 case. Owner reviews on the stylistic performance are generally restrained.  The box is compact, nothing stands out.  A display was organically located on it, along the side zones of which 4 buttons were scattered for control.  It is noteworthy that the DVR received a modern IPS-matrix, so there will be no problems with visibility familiar to this type of device.  The main button for launching the device is placed on the right side, as it is rarely used and its concealment is justified.  On the same side is a slot for a memory card. </p><h2>  Instrument Features </h2><p>  Despite the hybrid orientation, the main emphasis in the creation of the device was placed on the functions of the radar detector.  In particular, the developers focused on the accurate detection of speed detectors with minimal distraction of the motorist with false positives.  But to achieve this effect, a third function was introduced - navigational radar positioning.  It is implemented through an integrated receiver of signals about geolocation.  This is also not a new idea for such devices, but this model received a two-system module that works with both GLONASS and GPS.  Therefore, the Neoline X-COP 9100 reviews in terms of protection against false signals and positioning accuracy are better than those of direct competitors of the model.  It cannot be said that against this background, the operation of the DVR looks like an auxiliary toolkit, but it is made according to the established standard and offers nothing fundamentally new. </p><h2>  Additional functional support </h2><p>  The device is equipped with several sensors that allow you to record movement and shock - in particular, a G-sensor is provided.  The time, date, and speed are indicated on the record.  Sound recording options provided by a built-in microphone and speaker are separately presented.  That is, unlike the previous generation models, this version allows you to fully obtain information about the recorded material without the help of third-party monitors and a computer. </p>

    <p>  As for the shooting itself, it provides nighttime operation, WDR function and photography.  Voice prompts also facilitate the operation of the Neoline X-COP 9100. The registrar can act as a parking assistant, giving the car owner sound signals.  We can say that the model comprehensively services the movement process, protecting the user from fixing violations and at the same time making driving safe. </p><h2>  New technologies </h2><p>  The most interesting technological improvement in the series was the Motion Control system, which can be represented as gesture control.  What does this mean for the car owner?  Experienced users of detectors and navigators know how annoying and annoying device alerts can be.  You can‚Äôt just turn them off, because at certain times they help, but in other cases you have to deactivate some functionality.  And so that the driver did not have to delve into each setting, a control function was developed using a hand gesture. </p><p>  To mute the sound, just swipe your hand in front of the Neoline X-COP 9100 panel. Owner reviews are not always enthusiastic about non-standard and innovative solutions of this kind, but in this case the novelty was accepted positively.  The system works clearly and stably, so you can rely on it. </p>

    <h2>  Customization options </h2><p>  Immediately after installation, it is recommended to fully check the operation parameters of the device.  At the basic level, the time zone, time, resolution of the video, the interval for automatically turning off the display, the sensitivity of the detectors, etc. are set. You should also remember to enter the stamp of the license plate number of the machine.  By the way, there is a function to turn off the speed mode in the stamp if it exceeds 100 km / h. </p><p>  In the part of the radar settings, the voice notification mode, auto-muting of the sound and the speed limit at which the device will not respond at all with warnings are indicated.  Many customer reviews on the Neoline X-COP 9100 model have a positive effect on fixed-range settings.  These are the parameters that can be purposefully set for different types of police radars with the designation of frequencies and threshold speed values. </p><h2>  Detector Operation Reviews </h2><p>  Users note the effective work with almost all types of radars, from manual to full-format stationary systems.  For example, the model picks up ‚ÄúArrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúLasers‚Äù and the ‚ÄúAvtodoriya‚Äù system with high accuracy.  Of course, false positives and ‚Äúomissions‚Äù are noted in different conditions, but these are more likely exceptions.  The most positive experience is the work with GPS priority.  It is especially recommended to connect it in risky areas where radars record speed ‚Äúfrom the back‚Äù.  In the standard operating mode, such points are either not fixed at all, or are detected already in the working area with late warnings. </p><p>  They praise the Neoline X-COP 9100 dashcam and visual alert system.  Not even the warning format itself is noted, but informational content - the display shows information about the type of radar, distance to it, speed limit and current speed.  The convenience is that drivers do not have to constantly switch their eyes from the detector to the speedometer, since all the information is displayed on the screen. </p>

    <h2>  DVR function reviews </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in terms of basic characteristics, the DVR will not surprise experts on this type of device.  But users still emphasize the high quality of video shooting with a detailed display of the situation.  This was partly facilitated by the processor and the Sony Exmor matrix, which is equipped with the Neoline X-COP 9100 car recorder. Reviews, for example, note that readable license plates are fixed at a distance of tens of meters.  This also applies to cars in front, and vehicles that are sent in parallel flows.  The WDR option also deserves high praise, due to which the contrast differences in the image during sharp transitions between areas with different illumination are equalized </p><h2>  Reviews on structural quality and reliability </h2><p>  There are no complaints about the corps itself.  It is made of high quality plastic, and it is clear that the manufacturer did not seek to save on material.  The fastening elements also do not cause much criticism, but certain subtleties of using the locking mechanism are still noted.  So, in terms of choosing a location, there is a negative experience attaching the Neoline X-COP 9100 DVR. Owner reviews just point out the unusual gesture control function in the sense that, in addition to the hand, an accessory hanging on the mirror can activate it.  Therefore, it is advisable to leave approximately 10 cm of free space in front of the display. </p><h2>  Ergonomics reviews </h2><p>  Both in physical handling and in working with the menu, the model turned out to be convenient.  Owners testify that the device with careful initial settings does not require a quick revision.  They are stably held and clearly go over the set modes that are supported by the Neoline X-COP 9100 radar detector. Reviews of warnings are also mostly supportive.  Interference triggering and annoying alerts are a matter of criticism for any detector.  But in this case, such problems are really minimized. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In practice of use, development mainly shows itself from the best sides, regardless of the function used.  Both the detector and the DVR have pronounced advantages and minor flaws. </p>

    <p>  Speed, accuracy and new functionality are the main advantages of the Neoline X-COP 9100. Prices in the range from 14 to 17 thousand can only be considered a drawback, but there are not many similar models in terms of performance.  Moreover, devices with enhanced performance and wide functionality often have omissions in the form of structural flaws and weak ergonomics.
