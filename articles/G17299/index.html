Strelkovoye: recreation centers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now many of our compatriots go to Turkey, although there has always been, is and will be a wonderful vacation on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  Strelkovoye, whose recreation centers are buried in greenery and flowers, is ready to provide its tourists with excellent service, and fill your leisure with bright and interesting events.  So, first things first. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Strelkovoye is a rural village located about 30 km from Genichesk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation Shooting camp" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/463265.jpg" width="413"></div>  It is not known as widely as the Arabat Spit - a sand spit that cut deep into the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and has long been a welcome resort.  Recreation Shooting, <span>recreation centers</span> which have been actively operating for more than a decade, provides a classic beach.  And although the village is already almost 200 years old, there are few attractions here.  Everything is subordinated to the tourism business, so the infrastructure is appropriate.  An asphalt road leads from Genichesk to the Arabat Spit, which smoothly turns into a road with concrete pavement, in many places carefully sprinkled with sand, and after that - into the primer with rare spikes, dusty curbs and frequent signs where which camp site is located.  The private sector is separated from the resort area by this very primer.  The road leads past Gengorka, Schastlivtsevo, Strelkovoy to the village of Solyany, where salt was once mined, and turns back.  A regular bus runs from Genichesk, but it is easier to get by taxi or private car.  As an option - transport from neighboring camp sites.  Drivers, as a rule, do not refuse to give a ride.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Of course, gives a great beach vacation Strelkovoye.  Recreation facilities here smoothly pass one into another, almost leaving no room for tents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Village Tavria Strelkovoye" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/463260.jpg" width="435"></div>  But on the outskirts of Genichesk there is a small estuary with healing mud.  Here there are always savage vacationers.  They get to this fertile land, some by cars, some by electric trains, fortunately, in the summer, the <span>Dnieper Railway</span> launches comfortable electric trains coming from Dnepropetrovsk and Krivoy Rog.  There are also local, ordinary, with wooden seats.  They all go through Novoalekseevka - the station where long-distance trains from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus stop.  That is, you can get to Genichesk by rail, but you can also take a regular bus.  Next, you need to transfer to another bus going to the Arbat arrow, or take a taxi.  But if you are traveling on a package tour, on the day of arrival, most bases provide a free shuttle service.

    <h2>  Is it possible to relax in Strelkovoy savage </h2><p>  Can.  And it turns out pretty good rest.  Strelkovoye, <span>a recreation center</span> in which there are various classes, perfectly adapted to provide all kinds of tourist services, such as rental housing, delivery to the local bazaar of vegetables, fruits, milk, shrimps, gobies and other things. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The administration of most bases absolutely does not prohibit the passage of ‚Äústranger‚Äù vacationers to the sea through their territory during the day, and in the evening go to discos and cinema halls.  In any case, until recently, that was exactly so.  In addition, at many bases food is not included in the price of the permit, that is, people feed themselves in canteens, buying whatever they like.  Glad there to everyone - both their own and those of others.  And the sea - the main purpose of arrival - is the same for everyone. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Rest in Strelkovoy is unthinkable without bathing and sunbathing.  The beach on the spit is a single sandy (in some places with a small shell) strip about 50 meters wide, stretching almost from the very entrance to the arrow to its end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Genichesk recreation center Strelkovoye" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/463261.jpg" width="415"></div>  Each boarding house, each children's camp and base formally have their own beach area.  Sunshades, fungi, booths, showers, drinking water fountains and benches are installed in some areas.  But few bases protect your beach.  Pass, as well as located everywhere.  The sea on the Arbat arrow is warm, but shallow.  To a more or less decent depth (along the neck) you need to go 150 meters from the coast.  In the Strelkovoy area, it is already at the very shore somewhat deeper than, for example, in the Schastlivtsevo area.  A small nuance: from August, and sometimes earlier, jellyfish appear in the water.  Of the entertainment here - riding on bananas, pills, slides, jet skis, photographing with donkeys and monkeys, various food and drinks (worn on the beach all the time).  In addition to the sea, you can take baths in Sivash (about 4 km from the village).  There the bottom is lined with healing clay.  And in Strelkovoy there is a hot spring.

    <h2>  Recreation facilities </h2><p>  Their number on the Arbat arrow is huge.  During the Soviet Union, even the most lazy leaders built them for their workers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Strelkovoy" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/463262.jpg" width="378"></div>  At the moment, one of the best is the recreation center "Tavria" (Strelkovoye).  Accommodation here takes place in cottages for 2 or 3 rooms or in the Fir-tree building, where there are rooms with or without amenities.  In the cottages there are rooms of the categories "standard", "luxury" and "junior suite".  Price varies depending on the month.  Meals are served in the dining room, the dishes are delicious, the portions are large.  For leisure activities - cafe, disco, bar, billiards, water slides, cinema.  Guided tours to Askania Nova, Crimea, Genichesk.  The recreation center (Strelkovoye) "Tavria" is open from May to September.  All her staff are friendly and friendly, very trying to please vacationers.  That is why there are so many warm reviews about Tavria.
