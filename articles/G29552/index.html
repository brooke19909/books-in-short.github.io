Feature, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  These three words are short, but very capacious - "paradise", "Oludeniz", "Turkey".  Hotels in this divine corner vividly fit into the fabulous beauty of the landscape, perfectly complementing it with the unobtrusive touches of civilization.  They were built with the expectation of tourists of all categories - from young families with children to older couples.  Those who are accustomed to chic and those who are not particularly picky can choose the right accommodation for their vacation time, because at the resort, the doors of about a hundred hotels and apartments are hospitably open. </p><h2>  A few words about the features of the resort </h2><p>  Many tourists who have traveled all over the world believe that heaven on earth is not the French Riviera, not sunny Italy and not exotic Seychelles, but Oludeniz, Turkey.  Hotels, air, sea, nature of this region allow you to enjoy your vacation as much as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oludeniz Turkey hotels" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/439607.jpg" width="394"></div>  Translated from the local language, the name of the resort means "dead sea", but it has nothing to do with Jordanian.  It is dead because this corner of the earth is protected by fabulously beautiful mountains full of beautiful birds, fragrant flowers growing even on hot sand, and overgrown with centuries-old trees.  Mountains protect from the winds, and the sand spit forms a kind of lagoon called Blue.  It is always quiet, calm, the water is much warmer than in the open sea, the depth is small, so it is ideal for kids.  The village of Oludeniz was created for tourists.  There are practically no locals there, mostly only seasonal attendants.  Hence the whole infrastructure, represented by many small shops, bars and restaurants.  There is only one large supermarket, prices for everything are much higher than in neighboring Fethiye.

There is no public transport in the village, so you have <span>to walk</span> on the beach and for shopping <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oludeniz Turkey Hotel Flamingo" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/439611.jpg" width="349"></div>  Therefore, when choosing a hotel, it is very useful to ask how far it is from the <span>sea</span> .  Recently, in Oludeniz, developers are confidently rising higher and higher in the mountains.  Not every tourist will need a daily cross to the beach and back along a steep slope.  Only one highway leads to the village, via which they get from the airport (about 1 hour).  It winds along the picturesque mountain slopes and ascents, bypassing the small resort town of Fethiye, which is 12 km from Oludeniz, and leads further to the village of Kabak.  This is the final point.  There is no further way, the bus turns around and goes back.

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  It is hot and dry in summer, cool in winter, damp and rainy, in the off-season there is little bit of everything - sunny, rainy, warm, cool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Oludeniz Hotel Dorian" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/439605.jpg" width="368"></div>  This is such a place - Oludeniz (Turkey).  Hotels are sometimes even flooded here if the showers are too strong.  Having decided to relax in this resort not in the summer, take an interest in the weather forecast.  From the end of September until May it is deserted.  People are leaving, almost all hotels and shops, including the only supermarket, are closing.  You can swim in the offseason only in the lagoon, if the days are sunny.  It is shallow there and the water warms up very quickly.  Winter in Oludeniz is good only for those who seek solitude, who are not afraid of inclement cool weather.

In the town you can soak up the day on the beach or go to the water park, and in the evening have fun at the disco or in the bar.  Excursions from Fethiye are also much more diverse.  Oludeniz can offer mainly beach vacations, paragliding and hiking in the mountains.  If there are discos here, then only in individual hotels for their guests.  And all excursion routes, with the exception of two or three, one way or another lie through Fethiye.  But in Oludeniz, the views are more beautiful, the sea is bluer, the air is fresher - the reserve is all the same.  These are the alternatives.

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Mostly people come to Oludeniz to swim in the sea, bask in the white sand and enjoy the beautiful views.  There is really enough beauty here.  Beaches too.  The most important is Belgegiz.  It is sandy, very wide, equipped with numerous sun loungers and umbrellas.  Admission is free, but you will have to fork out for everything else. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Oludeniz Turkey" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/439603.jpg" width="362"></div>  True, to this day and on personal rugs it was allowed to sunbathe.  The clear minus of the beach is the new marina and boat marina right in the center.  Another very nice beach is located in the reserve.  Entrance there is paid even in winter.  Sun loungers and umbrellas must be paid separately (plus entrance fees).  There is also a wild sand and pebble beach in the reserve, where you can safely spread the rug brought with you and put a personal umbrella.  Some upscale hotels in Oludeniz have their own small beach areas.  Turkey is famous for its wonderful beaches, many of which have been awarded the Blue Flag for cleanliness.  This applies not only to the Blue Lagoon, but also to Calis - a five-kilometer municipal beach in Fethiye.

    <h2>  Oludeniz, Turkey, Hotel Flamingo 3 * </h2><p>  Among all the resort hotels, the most three-star.  Prices and service are quite acceptable.  For example, the <span>Flamingo Hotel.</span>  It is located on the second coastline, that is, to the beach about 1000 meters.  This is a flaw.  Another disadvantage for those who are difficult to walk is the location on three levels, that is, with stairs and many steps. </p>

It has 70 modern comfortable rooms of various classes and prices.  Each has a TV, air conditioning, balcony, bathroom, telephone and minibar.  Only in standard rooms it is not.  The suites also have a kitchen.  Rooms are cleaned regularly.  Maids without fail create masterpieces of towels and rose petals on the beds.  Tourists are provided with a free breakfast in the hotel restaurant, currency exchange, children's and adult pools, umbrellas and sun loungers, a parking lot, a bar, a safe and a left-luggage office.  There is a special area for kids.  Leisure of adults helps to diversify the tennis court, billiards, table tennis.

    <h2>  Hotel "Dorian 3 *" </h2><p>  This hotel is about 150 meters from Flamingo.  There are 8 buildings, each of which has some differences.  So, in the buildings located next to the bar, it is very noisy, because every day until midnight there is a disco.  The rest is more or less calm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oludeniz Turkey hotels" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/439647.jpg" width="346"></div>  The rooms are also very different.  There are those (0 and 1 levels) in which it is damp, and the views from the windows are unattractive.  On the second floor, the rooms are usually bright and sunny.  The biggest plus of the hotel, which was repeatedly noted in the reviews of tourists, is an excellent three-time free (BB system) food.  The menu is always varied, a lot of pastries, fish, meat and vegetable dishes.  The diligence and professionalism of the cooks is another touch, due to which Turkey and Oludeniz fell in love with many vacationers.  Despite its many advantages, the Dorian Hotel nevertheless caused complaints (mainly due to problems with the rooms and a somewhat cool attitude of the staff).  But the prices here are much lower than in the neighboring Flamingos of the same class.
