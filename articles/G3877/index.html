    <h2>  From the story of Aushiger </h2><p>  In the XVII century, this village was founded by the Kabardian nobles Doguzhokovs, who continued the ancient family of Idarovs.  They settled at the confluence of the Heu River in the Cherek.  In honor of the founders, the village was first named Doguzhokovo (Dyuzhuykyuyu).  After the complete establishment of Soviet power in Kabarda (1920), Revkom Nalchik decided to rename Doguzhokovo, like many other settlements of the republic, due to the presence of noble and princely names in their names.  So the village began to be called Aushiger, in honor of the mountain that rises above it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aushiger thermal springs" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1155601.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In November 1942, Aushiger was occupied by fascist troops.  The village was completely liberated in 1943.  In memory of the fallen villagers and soldiers of the Soviet Army who defended and liberated the village, a monument was erected in Aushiger.  Local residents look after him, and the older generation instills a respectful attitude towards this modest memorial to young people. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The picturesque village is located on the left bank of the Cherek, 25 kilometers south of Nalchik, and north of the district center Kashhatau (Chereksky district).  The Urvan-Ushtulu highway (of republican significance) passes through the settlement.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village is thirty-seven square kilometers.  It borders on several settlements.  Urvan (in the north), Kashhatau (in the south), Zaragin (in the southeast), Psygansu (in the east). </p><p>  Aushiger is located in the foothills of Kabardino-Balkaria.  The relief consists of hills and foothills.  In the valley of Cherek are flat areas.  The slopes are steep from 0 ¬∞ to 45 ¬∞.  The rains that took place between 2002 and 2011 provoked the formation of many landslides and ravines.  The highest point of the village is the mountain of the same name Aushiger (991 m).  In the most elevated, western part of the village is the burial mound of the Adyghe legendary hero Andermikan. </p><h2>  Rivers </h2><p>  The rural hydrographic network is represented by the Heu and Cherek rivers.  There are spring water outlets, as well as the famous Aushiger thermal springs.  The Cherek River is the right tributary of the Baksan.  Its length is seventy-six kilometers.  Cherek is formed as a result of the confluence of two rivers near the village of Babugent - Cherek Balkarsky (54 km) and Cherek Khulamsky (46 km).  These are rivers with approximately the same catchment area - 688 km2.  and 627 km sq.  respectively. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cherek district" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1155596.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Cherek mainly feeds glacial and snow floods.  The river is rafting.

The average annual temperature is + 9.3 ¬∞ C.  It ranges from July average + 21.0 ¬∞  to average (-2.7 ¬∞ ) in the winter.  The growing season is 220 days.

    <p>  At the very source a "folk" resort spontaneously appeared.  Here for a long time there was no comfortable sanatorium.  In the beginning, parking lots were cleared on this territory and healing pools were carefully fenced.  Today Aushiger hot springs are a popular Spa resort in our country, where thousands of vacationers come every year to enjoy the beauties of the Caucasus and improve their health.  How much is a ticket?  We will answer this question a little later. </p><h2>  Source History </h2><p>  Aushiger thermal springs were discovered during geological exploration in the Cherek river valley when oil deposits were searched.  Geologists and oil workers were very surprised when a hot spring began to beat from drilled wells instead of oil. </p><p>  Having learned about the healing properties of water from the source, local residents began to dig and equip the pools here.  The fame of them quickly spread throughout the Caucasus, and then throughout Russia. </p><h2>  Resort development </h2><p>  Aushiger (Cherek region), or rather the famous resort, every year takes on an increasingly civilized look.  Today, the shores of the lake are lined with slabs, and dressing rooms for guests have been equipped.  Every year, new buildings and structures are built at the resort that delight vacationers, especially those who come here for treatment annually. </p><p>  The source is not the only attraction worthy of attention.  You will be offered an excursion to the Dzhaboev‚Äôs castle, the famous waterfall ‚ÄúGirl‚Äôs Tears‚Äù, to caves and canyons.  It is likely that someone will be interested in horseback riding or hiking through the beautiful valleys and gorges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much is a ticket" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1155604.jpg" width="600"></div>
