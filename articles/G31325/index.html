Great inventors and musicians, economists and artists, creators of financial empires, gangsters, and other respected people have become all over the world what they have become, for several reasons, including through a combination of personal qualities such as caution, courage and intelligence. </p><p>  <span>The richest people in Russia</span> became billionaires in just two decades.  At the same time, none of them managed to create ingenious inventions or works of art.  They did not use the most advanced technologies, like Henry Ford, did not write computer programs like Bill Gates.  There was no need for this, but it is possible that the abilities would not be enough.  The richest people of Russia were at the right time in a suitable place and took advantage of this.  Of course, in order to occupy such an advantageous position in relation to the sources of material wealth, they had to try. </p>

    <p>  The path to success of Roman Abramovich was thorny.  He <span>did not graduate from the</span> institute <span>, having</span> preferred business activity from a young age.  At first, he opened a regular trading and intermediary company, but then the future tycoon turned to oil.  The fact that such a change of activity was, to put it mildly, risky, today many have forgotten for the simple reason that today it‚Äôs impossible to break into the raw materials business today.  Then, in the nineties, the future richest people of Russia quickly realized that oil, gas, coal, metal and other raw material treasures of the country could become a source of financial power.  The battle began, in which life was the stake.  Or death.  Roman Arkadievich was able to get between <span>Scylla and Charybdis,</span> he managed to get the necessary connections.  The risk was justified, and luck was the reward for courage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until recently </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The richest people of Russia 2013" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/215549.jpg" width="502"></div>  The capital of Abramovich occupied the first place in the country, and today the list of the richest people in Russia is headed by <span>Vladimir Lisin.</span>  He has a higher education, he even graduated from graduate school and the Higher Commercial School.  Doctor of Technical Sciences.  He worked his career from an electrician to the deputy head of the workshop.  There are hundreds of thousands.  Then - a rapid career throw to the post of <span>Deputy General Director of the</span> Karaganda Metallurgical Plant, and this is already an important post.  After that, the career of a businessman-financier began.  In order to turn from a manager, albeit at a ‚Äútop‚Äù level, into a master of the metallurgical empire, more than just high competence in financial matters is required.  Obviously, Mr. Lisin possessed the necessary qualities.  His fortune is estimated at 24 billion US dollars.

    <p>  As the famous aria says, people sometimes die for metal.  Moreover, color.  One of such valuable chemical elements is aluminum, and he has his own king - Oleg Deripaska.  The origins of this capital are in the same nineties, when the process of the so-called initial accumulation was booming, as a result of which the richest people of Russia acquired their assets.  Mr. Deripaska met 2013 as a multi-billionaire, and in total he managed to earn $ 19 billion.  He owns the Basic Element group (formerly Siberian Aluminum), and at the same time the Sibneft company. </p><p>  Thanks to the media, the facts of their biography from time to time become known to those they are interested in.  People tend to discuss the weddings, divorces, acquisitions and personal life of the rich.  Sometimes they envy them.  Is it worth it?  After all, their life is not easy ... </p>
