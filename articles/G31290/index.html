Which company banknote detector is not worth buying</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, the probability of meeting a fake bill is very high.  Moreover, the fake can fall into the hands of almost anywhere.  In this regard, most companies and firms decide to buy a banknote detector.  Before making a choice, it is necessary to study the existing types of devices and the principle of their work. </p><h2>  Banknote Remedies </h2><p>  A banknote detector is now a mandatory attribute of any credit institution, financial structure and many retail outlets.  This is easily explained by the fact that no one wants to receive simple pieces of paper instead of money, but at the same time it is simply impossible to distinguish fake without special equipment.  If earlier the authenticity of the bill could only be determined by the watermark, which was easily determined by the clearance, now the degree of protection is very complicated. </p>

    <p>  First of all, to increase the wear resistance, cotton or linen fibers are included in the composition of banknote paper.  In addition to the main fabrics, the money contains fluorescent particles, <span>watermarks,</span> special elements, embossing, fibers, micro-printing, combined pattern, perforation, security threads, cinema grams and holograms, as well as infrared protection zones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A banknote detector is a machine that scans bills and compares the information received with the programmed standard.  In case of mismatch of at least one of the parameters, the device sends a signal to the operator.  It can also reject a fake bill by placing it in a special pocket. </p><h2>  Types of appliances </h2><p>  All banknote detectors existing today are divided into two types.  The first of them includes viewing devices (ultraviolet and infrared, as well as complex).  The second type of detectors is automatic. </p><p>  Viewers allow you to clearly see subtle or hidden signs of the authenticity of the banknote.  However, the final decision must be made by the operator.  As for automatic detectors, they independently select counterfeit bills, excluding the human factor.  This is especially true in cases where employees are low skilled.  When using an automatic detector, the cashier may not be trained to detect fakes.  Fake banknotes will not pass through the device. </p><h2>  UV detectors </h2><p>  Such devices until recently stood in almost every outlet.  The banknote authenticity detector is equipped with a special lamp.  It works in ultraviolet mode.  UV rays hitting a banknote cause its fibers to glow in different colors. </p>

    <p>  Today, such detectors have become virtually useless.  Counterfeiters have already acquired the skills to counterfeit this protection component.  Despite this, ultraviolet detectors continue to be in steady demand.  This is explained by the following: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  1. Very low cost starting from 100 rubles.  Such a detector will not reveal a well-fake fake.  However, it still makes sense to be at a point of sale.  The very fact of the presence of such an apparatus in the hall can scare away beginner distributors of counterfeit bills.  But experienced scammers will go to such a store. </p><p>  2. The presence of this device is necessary for the sale of alcohol at the request of the licensed chamber.  Excise stamps are checked on this machine. </p><p>  3. Ultraviolet devices are often purchased by veterinarians.  They need them to detect lichen in dogs and cats. </p><h2><br>  UV detector selection </h2><p>  <span>Models of these</span> devices differ in power and the number of built-in <span>ultraviolet lamps.</span>  One of such devices is the DoCash 531 banknote detector. The device has two upper UV lamps, each of which has a power of 6 watts.  This strong source of ultraviolet rays allows you to efficiently recognize fake banknotes in a well-lit room.  The lower lamps are used to check watermarks, microperforation, as well as images on both sides of the bill. </p><p>  The DoCash 531 banknote detector has a large and convenient viewing field, which is equipped with a ruler for determining the size of banknotes, the accuracy of the tags located on the banknote, etc.  This device is quite simple to operate. </p><p>  Such a model will help in the case when there is a need to clarify the authenticity of the document.  To do this, use the special slot on the back of the chassis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><br>  Infrared detectors </h2><p>  Today, this type of <span>counterfeit money</span> recognition device is the most demanded.  An infrared banknote detector ensures the detection of counterfeits.  Fraudsters have not yet learned how to make such a defense on their money. </p><p>  The design of this device is very simple.  The cashier has the bill being examined in front of the detector, which is visible through its infrared LEDs.  Rays are reflected from a banknote and pass through a light filter.  Then they are captured by the camera, displaying the image of the bill on a special display.  The cashier sees the bill in the infrared range.  On a genuine banknote, only a small fragment of his drawing is clearly visible.  The fake glows all over.  An experienced cashier is able to very quickly check a whole wad of money by flipping bills in front of the detector. </p>

For convenience, this data may have sound. </p><p>  The second mode of operation is designed to operate the device in a limited space.  The device returns all banknotes to the receiving tray, reporting a detection error with a sound signal and recording on the display. </p><p>  The Dors 220 has the advantage of unhindered access to the path.  This option is available thanks to the hinged lid.  In addition, the device is equipped with a system that allows the user to configure the power saving mode through auto power off after a certain period of time.

    <p>  When buying this device, it should be borne in mind that it will certainly require periodic monitoring of its technical condition.  Complex repair of banknote detectors is required, as a rule, in those cases when the user did not carry out preventive cleaning and maintenance of equipment. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the detectors have a large margin of safety in their design, they suffer from paper dust and dirt, which invariably appear during operation.  The garbage accumulated inside the device leads to the fact that in its work there are failures, as well as mechanisms and sensors break down. </p><p>  The internal device of the detector consists of two parts - mechanical and electronic.  Repairing the first one is replacing the belts, as well as reconfiguring the various shafts and pins.  In the electronic part, as a rule, the accuracy of the <span>optical</span> detection <span>sensor is</span> adjusted, as well as the elimination of damage to the power supply, which may suffer due to sudden changes in voltage. </p><p>  Detectors of most companies producing this technique are of good quality.  Device failures often arise due to non-compliance with the rules of operation, as well as due to normal wear (aging) of the mechanisms. </p>
