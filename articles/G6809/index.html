Many guests claim that the hotel does not deserve 3 stars, but as many as 5. After all, quite often in five-star hotels there is not what is in a three-star hotel. </p><h2>  Room Tips </h2><p>  Guests recommend renting a room in the 1st or 5th building, as it is easier to get up with children.  The rest of the buildings are too high, so it‚Äôs hard for the child and the elderly to get there.  In addition, it is advisable to rent apartments away from the pool and bar. </p><p>  The rooms in buildings 6 and 10 are more spacious, but they are located at the very height, where it is difficult and long to go.  The top floor is an ideal solution for those tourists who want to relax from the hustle and bustle. </p>
