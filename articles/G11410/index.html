  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Planet population: size and development trends</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In cities and countries of the world, the number of inhabitants increases every year.  And this pattern has a tendency to increase.  Overpopulation leads to a reduction in available resources.  And this figure continues to increase. </p><p>  The population is growing most actively in India, and it is not yet possible to limit this process.  Despite the fact that China is the leader in absolute numbers, about 1.60 billion people live in the country, however, growth rates are constantly decreasing.  In the coming years, we can expect that the bulk of the people will be concentrated in the Indian state.  This is not a good result, because a large population in one place undermines the economy. </p><p>  Currently, the world's population is more than seven billion inhabitants! </p><p>  Already today in countries with developing economies there is a shortage of food, and production opportunities are at their peak.  As a result of urban growth, there is a decrease in free agricultural land. </p><p>  In recent decades, urbanization processes have accelerated significantly, and the results are no secret to anyone.  China, realizing the destructiveness of its situation, began to take measures to reduce the population, to limit fertility.  In this country, these processes have been fully controlled.  As a result, a certain stability was designated in the Middle Kingdom. </p><p>  Many people wonder what country is in third place in terms of the population of the planet.  Statistics show that this is the United States.  Now in this state about 310 million people live. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, there are also small city-states on the planet, for example, the Vatican.  This city is minimal both in size and in the number of citizens, the number of which is no more than 1000 people. </p><p>  The population of the planet is also characterized by such an indicator as density.  The leaders in terms of population density are small city countries: Singapore, Monaco and others of similar size.  Then the maximum density is observed in countries such as South Korea, Japan (Tokyo).  China and India are slightly behind in density from these countries. </p><p>  The planet‚Äôs population is also characterized by an indicator such as percentage growth in numbers.  The advantage of the hot southern regions is noted here.  So, in the UAE, this figure is about 4 percent.  The list of leaders includes most <span>African countries.</span>  India in terms of percentage growth has only 1.50%, and China only 0.60%. </p><p>  However, there are countries in which there is a <span>natural population decline,</span> which, like overpopulation, is a negative phenomenon.  Russia is no exception.  Here today, the population decline is 0.1% of the total population per year.  And this is taking into account all immigrants arriving in the country.  <span>The population density of the</span> Russian Federation is also too low, and this can be seen by the huge amount of empty land.  In general, the total population of the country at the beginning of the year was 143.30 million people.  Of course, the country does not occupy the last lines in this rating, but it is practically one of the ten outsiders.  However, in comparison with the previous year, a positive trend was observed in fertility. </p><p>  In terms of population, the planet's population is distributed really unevenly.  There is also such a pattern that is associated with the quality of life of people.  It turns out that the poorer the country, the more inhabitants and fertility.  It would seem that everything should be the other way around.  But rich countries have their own principles, they don‚Äôt need a lot of people.  This is reflected in the general demographic situation, which needs to be changed. </p>
