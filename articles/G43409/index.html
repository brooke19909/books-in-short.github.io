Tips and tricks.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the standard sound installed on various audio systems does not suit many.  In order to change this opinion, manufacturers release additional equipment, connecting which you can achieve the desired sound quality. </p><p>  A subwoofer is included in the package of any standard home theater systems; it is necessary for reproducing low-frequency sound special effects.  Connecting a subwoofer will provide the sound as close as possible to the real spectrum. </p><p>  How to connect <span>an active subwoofer</span> ? </p><p>  There are <span>active</span> and passive <span>subwoofers</span> .  Active devices are distinguished by the presence of a built-in amplifier, which allows you to remove the load from the main amplifier located in the home theater.  A similar model requires a separate connection to the electrical network.  The advantages of this type of device include the provided ability to control the separation frequencies.  This allows us to simplify the procedure for reconciling various components of the main system.  The main disadvantage is the relatively high cost. </p><p>  How to connect a <span>passive subwoofer</span> ? </p><p>  This device model is connected to an external amplifier.  A number of disadvantages of such devices leads to their relatively low cost.  Connecting a subwoofer of this type implies the need for its precise coordination with the existing <span>speaker system</span> .  This process is quite difficult to implement.  Connection via a separate <span>power amplifier,</span> as well as an electronic separation filter, will significantly reduce non-linear distortions.  This is achieved by splitting the signal according to a special scheme.  Thus, it is possible to free the main amplifier from increased loads. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What should be done before connecting a subwoofer? </p><p>  In order to achieve the best results, it is necessary to take into account the size of the room where the system will be installed.  Also a very important factor is the size of the device.  This is due to the fact that partially non-linear distortions of <span>sound vibrations</span> depend on the dimensions of the model's case.  Compact models are not able to fully reproduce low-frequency sounds.  Therefore, you should choose those models that optimally fit into the interior of the room.  At the same time, the power characteristics of the device must be calculated in such a way that they exceed the similar performance of the speaker system by at least one and a half times.  The most suitable option for a home system is considered a bass reflex or indoor subwoofer.  The power of such a device should be within 150 W, and the range of reproducible frequencies within 30 - 180 Hz. </p><p>  So, a home subwoofer is a necessary acquisition, which will allow you to fully enjoy real sound when watching a good movie at home.  But to observe all the necessary subtleties during the connection process is very difficult.  Therefore, when buying a device, it is better to resort to the help of a specialist.  He will advise how to connect the subwoofer in an optimal way.  Indeed, with today's wide selection of such equipment, it is quite difficult to choose a device that has the necessary characteristics, design and acceptable dimensions.  Such a specialist is able to more fully satisfy your requirements based on the knowledge of the pros and cons of various models on the market. </p><p>  In today's world, there are expensive models that can reproduce sound within 25 Hz.  The acquisition of such subwoofers is not always justified, since the human ear is not able to hear in this range.  Based on this, you should not overpay and buy a device that you cannot evaluate. </p>
