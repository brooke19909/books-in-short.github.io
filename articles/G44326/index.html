Before you tie a bow from a ribbon, you need to determine the size of the future product.  The dependence is as follows: the wider the ribbon, the larger the bow. </p><p>  The choice of material and color of the ribbon will depend on the texture of the base from which the decorated object is made.  For example, the length of the ribbon for a bow that will decorate a surprise in a medium-sized box should correspond to a double box coverage of + 50-60 cm for a bow. </p><p>  Items needed to create a bow: </p><ul><li>  scissors or knife; </li><li>  glue or wax candle; </li><li>  additional decor elements. </li></ul><h2>  Method number 1.  Simple bow </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.blare.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pink ribbon bow" class="if uuid-2280192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70758/2280192.jpg"></div><p>  A simple small bow is made from a narrow ribbon.  It can be used to decorate postcards, soft toys, personal items and souvenirs.  It is done very simply and quickly: only 3 stages.  How to tie a ribbon bow? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The instruction is as follows: </p><ol><li>  You will need a narrow ribbon about 30 cm long. When the fabric is in your hands, you need to fold it so that the design resembles the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù and the ends of the eyelets hang down. </li><li>  Next, you need to connect the loop-ears with a cross so that one of them is on top of the other.  In the hole formed from the bottom, you should pass the upper eye-loop to you from the back. </li><li>  After the previous step, you need to pull the side ‚Äúwings‚Äù to fix and adjust the desired shape and length of the butterfly.  You can fix the craft using a candle.  Wax will hold the fabric together in such a way that the decoration does not open. </li></ol><h2>  Method number 2.  Bow on a fork </h2><p>  Among all the ways to tie a bow beautifully, tying on a fork is the most interesting.  To do everything right and get the desired product, just follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  The selected tape must be flattened and wrapped around the plug. </li><li>  Through the distance between the teeth located in the middle of the cutlery, they insert one end of the ribbon and wrap it. </li><li>  After the end is pushed in the opposite direction, it rises upward so that the entire fork is wrapped with a cloth. </li><li>  All the same part of the tape must be carried forward through the top of the cutlery.  If a loop formed during these manipulations, then everything is correct. </li><li>  All the same end of the tape is pulled to the right and pushed into the loop through the bottom of the fork. </li><li>  The final stage will be giving the desired shape to the bow and fixing. </li></ol><p>  A ribbon product is ready to decorate a surprise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Method number 3.  Simple bow </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bow on the box" class="if uuid-2280186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70758/2280186.jpg"></div><p>  A strict bow will be perfectly combined with clothes, jewelry and official shoes.
