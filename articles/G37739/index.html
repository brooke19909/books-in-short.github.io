  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The modern concept of science and its functions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Throughout the world, the concept of science is understood as a certain form <span>of human activity that has</span> developed historically and is aimed at the knowledge, comprehension and transformation of objective reality.  The result of scientific activity is facts carefully systematized in the process of targeted selection.  Also, the concept of science and scientific activity implies the presence of generalizing theories, logically verified hypotheses, laws (both fundamental and particular), as well as a variety <span>of research methods.</span>  Summarizing, science can be called both a historically established and constantly evolving system of knowledge and practical activities based on them. </p><p>  The modern structure of science is a combination of many industries - extremely branched, but constituting a single whole.  <span>Scientific activity</span> affects literally everything, starting with the matter that makes up the world and all life in it, and ending with the "" crown of creation - man.  In general, the types of scientific activity can be divided into those that study the laws of nature, the development of all its resources and transformations for the benefit of man - <span>natural-technical sciences,</span> and those that study the social side of life, its various phenomena and laws of development - social sciences.  The latter, among other things, affect the person who is a member of society, and also study a number of philosophical disciplines, among which are the abstract laws of the development of man and nature, the society in which a person exists, and the laws of his thinking. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Science in the modern world involves the use of many research methods: experiment - for the natural sciences, statistics - for the public.  In addition, there are general scientific means of activity, such as analysis, deduction, induction, synthesis, and various approaches (systemic or probabilistic).  Each science as such consists of two levels: the first is called empirical - this is the mass of factual knowledge accumulated over the entire existence of mankind, which is the results of observations and the results of experiments.  The second level is the theoretical sum of empirical data expressed in theories, laws and principles formulated by scientists.  In addition, the concept of science is inseparable from scientific assumptions based on facts and hypotheses that still need to be verified. </p><p>  Science and <span>scientific activity</span> in the modern world is very important, as it performs a lot of functions.  First of all, it is important in public life - the main is the cognitive function, due to which there is an accumulation and active use of knowledge, as well as their transformation into hypotheses and theories.  In addition, the cognitive function of science is to describe and systematize previously acquired knowledge, which allows you to accumulate experience and transfer it in an accessible way to other generations.  Another function that the concept of science includes is the filling of the human worldview with full objective knowledge directly relating to nature and society, as a result of which the formation of an integral human personality takes place. </p><p>  The educational function of scientific activity is intended to fill the educational process with the necessary information, in other words, without it, it would be impossible to form training as such, its methods, forms and technologies.  And around the middle of the 20th century, the concept of science was replenished with a practical function, thanks to which science finally ceased to be a pure theory and became a concrete productive force, embedded in most areas of human life - education, medicine and even everyday life. </p>
