Beckoning tourists with a wonderful beach holiday, it primarily attracts with a Buddhist culture that is different from European.  Here are concentrated historical and natural attractions, which all travelers dream of meeting. </p><p>  Perhaps the most interesting settlement of the state is its cultural and religious center Kandy (Sri Lanka).  What to see in the former capital of Ceylon, we will tell in detail in the article. </p><h2>  The religious capital of Sri Lanka </h2><p>  Located in the very center of the island state, the city, in which 160 thousand people live, was founded in the XIV century.  It is difficult to get to it, since there is no airport, but thanks to well-established road and rail links from Colombo (the unofficial capital of the state) to the tourist center, travelers do not experience any particular inconvenience, covering a distance of 100 kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="candi sri lanka reviews" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1446872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Surrounded by mountains, Kandy (Sri Lanka) is located at an altitude of more than 480 meters above sea level, and on all sides it is bordered by the Mahaweli Ganga River.  The religious capital of the state, protected by UNESCO, is extremely proud of its heritage and Buddhist values.  The Government of Sri Lanka is doing everything possible to preserve the small town in its original form. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Temple of the Tooth Relic </h2><p>  As the last capital of Senegalese kings, Kandy (Sri Lanka) became the home of a very important relic that allowed the ruler to rule the people and the land.  According to legend, the supporters of the spiritual teacher took the tooth of Buddha from the funeral pyre, for a long time it was stored in different places, but after the capital was moved to Kandy, it was decided to transfer the symbol of the sovereignty of the country here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Candy Sri Lanka" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1446858.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Princess Hemamala brought him to the island in the IV century.  To deliver the shrine unhindered, she had to hide it in her luxurious hair.  Now the relic is stored in a casket weighing about 120 kilograms, which is hidden under a golden canopy in the chapel of the huge <span>temple of the Tooth of the Buddha.</span>  Kandy (Sri Lanka) is incredibly proud of the religious building, open from morning until dusk, to which the buildings of the royal palace complex adjoin from all sides. </p><p>  Sights that have become iconic for all Buddhists in the world are located in the very center of the city, and next to the temple lies a picturesque artificial lake created for the family of the last monarch of the state. </p><h2>  Annual holiday </h2><p>  The magnificent building acts as a center for pilgrims and a museum for tourists, but not everyone is given the chance to see the tooth of Buddha.  Only once a year, in the summer, a grand procession is organized in the city, and the shrine leaves the temple.  To look at the relic stored in a golden stupa, thousands of believers come to Kandy (Sri Lanka). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Candy Sri Lanka what to see" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1446875.jpg" width="558"></div>

Tourists admit that the atmosphere of a religious holiday makes hearts beat faster with excitement and awe from the kind of action taking place. </p><h2>  Ticket price and strict dress code </h2><p>  In addition to the tooth of the Buddha, travelers pay special attention to the appearance of the temple, which is a traditional sanctuary with bright ornaments.  Entrance to the religious complex costs more than 10 dollars (1000 rupees), which is very expensive, and visitors often complain about the overpriced ticket price.  To get inside, you need to prepare for the long procedure of a thorough search for the presence of forbidden things. </p><p>  In addition, there is a strict dress code on the territory, and they will not be allowed into the temple with bare shoulders and knees.  For lovers of Buddhist art, there is a museum where ancient masterpieces are stored, describing the way a tooth gets on the island, and frescoes with scenes from the life of Buddha. </p><h2>  Kandy Botanical Garden (Sri Lanka) </h2><p>  Another attraction covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 hectares appeared in the XIV century by order of the king, who dreams of a beautiful garden.  It is believed that this is the most beautiful place that is visited by millions of tourists from all over the world.  The Royal Botanic Garden, located five kilometers from the city center, is open throughout the year for visitors.  It is difficult to get around entirely even in a few hours, so guests of the city of Kandy (Sri Lanka) come here again whenever possible, despite the high ticket prices (1,100 rupees). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kandy city sri lanka" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1446854.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The best botanical garden in all of Asia is known for its unique collection of tropical flora.  Tourists love to stroll along the avenue of memorial trees planted by famous people who visited Sri Lanka.  But the main pride of the garden is the collection of orchids and indoor plants. </p><p>  On the territory of the picturesque corner there is an <span>artificial lake,</span> on the shore of which a white rotunda is comfortably located, where you can relax in the shade and enjoy a delightful sight. </p><h2>  Spice garden </h2><p>  <span>An exotic country</span> has long been famous for its spices, and growing plants allow you to create real gardens from them.  Not far from the former capital of the state there is an unusual attraction that all tourists who come to Kandy (city) seek to visit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kandy Sri Lanka Attractions" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1446848.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Sri Lanka has long been famous for its spices, and in the garden you can see famous and not very plants growing on fertile soil.  Russian-speaking guides will tell you in detail about all the properties of herbs that are included in everyday life, and will not conceal any secret of cooking with spices, which have become the main export goods.  Many plants are related to Ayurveda - an ancient branch of medicine that uses only natural ingredients in recipes.  For the curious, there is a unique cafe where everyone can try a particular plant in dishes and drinks. </p><h2>  What is worth knowing for those who are going on vacation </h2><p>  Travelers who have visited the country of absolute exoticism admit that they got acquainted with the amazingly beautiful city, bearing the unusual name Kandy (Sri Lanka).  Reviews of tourists confirm the uniqueness of natural and man-made monuments, however, there are some points that should be known to those who are going to vacation in the former Ceylon capital for the first time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kandy Sri Lanka Botanical Garden" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1446885.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During the trip, you can rent a car or motorcycle, but it is very expensive - from 10 to 35 dollars a day.  The rules of the road are not respected here, so driving must be as careful as possible.  It is best to exchange money at the airport, but in the hotels they will charge a small commission for this service.  Tourists who are accustomed to using a credit card need to know that not all establishments accept them, so a little cash in your wallet will not hurt.  Drinking tap water is prohibited, and you must not wash vegetables and fruits with it. </p><p>  It is impossible to see all the sights of Kandy for several days, and the rest spent in the city will be remembered for a lifetime. </p>
