They all differ from each other in design, hardware and operating systems.  Next, let's talk about which hardware platform can be installed, and also consider their advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Tablet Features </h2><p>  Most <span>tablet computers</span> are monoblock devices.  The vast majority of models do not have a keyboard.  The input / output device is the screen itself, being a touch.  Pressing can be done with a finger or stylus.  The device may have special mechanical keys, but today most manufacturers refuse them.  Because of this, which OS for the tablet of a particular model is selected plays an important role.  It should be convenient to use without a mouse and keyboard. </p><p>  You need to understand that tablets are often used only for some tasks.  It is about browsing websites, listening to music, reading books and the like.  But the tablet device should also be convenient for working with text documents, for example.  Therefore, manufacturers always approach the choice of an operating system with full responsibility. </p><h2>  Popular operating systems </h2><p>  Today, tablets with OS Windows 7/8, iOS, Android are popular.  In addition to the indicated, less well-known MeeGo, WebOS, BlackBerry OS are used.  We will talk about them a bit at the end of the article, and then a description of the three leaders. </p><h2>  Apple iOS </h2><p>  The most popular tablets are those that run on the Apple iOS operating system.  It is quite convenient for touch use, as it was originally developed for working with touchscreens.  Such devices are good tablets.  They are ideal for OSU (game), although it is quite demanding.  The developers have tried - the operating system is fast and stable.  In addition, it should be noted that the application store has a huge number of interesting products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among the shortcomings, it is necessary to highlight that the platform is closed.  There is no flexible configuration, there are limitations in functionality, you cannot install modern widgets, and most of the applications are available only on a fee basis.  This operating system for tablets is not highly multitasking, and for corporate users offers a small margin of functions and options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arstechnica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="os for tablets" class="if uuid-2568596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568596.jpg"></div><h2>  IOS Description </h2><p>  The system appeared in 2007.  Initially, it was installed only on the iPhone.  Now it is used on Apple tablets.  Unlike the systems described in the article (‚ÄúWindows‚Äù and ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù), the platform is installed only on products from the ‚Äúapple‚Äù.  Supports more than 35 languages, including Russian and English. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guce.oath.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wasp tablet" class="if uuid-2568597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568597.jpg"></div><h2>  IOS features </h2><p>  The platform is based on a UNIX kernel.  Thanks to this, the system allows you to work with the same functions as Mac OS X. When the system was first presented, it did not have most of the functions of the type of installation of utilities from third-party sources.  However, at the moment the platform is powerful.  It can work only on those models of tablets and smartphones whose processors are developed on the <span>ARM architecture.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  IOS reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the operating system in most cases are positive.  Negative comments are rare.  This is due to the fact that the OS stably shows itself in work.  It is protected from viruses, as it is closed.  Most users find no flaws, except for the incompatibility of popular games and applications.  Most often, when they are released, they are designed only for Android, and only with time does the version for iOS appear. </p><h2>  Android </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Android <span>operating system</span> has also been designed to work with touch screens.  The first versions were created for small tablet devices, and a little later - when these devices began to gain great popularity - the developer introduced a tablet on the Android 3.0 OS.  It was distinguished by the fact that it was optimized to work on devices with a large diagonal. </p><p>  Of the benefits, users highlight its openness.  Thanks to this, any user can customize it for themselves.  A specific device can be independently upgraded if you can work with the platform.  Therefore, Android tablets are so popular.  The OS is convenient because it allows the user to perform any action.  The system supports multitasking, although it has some limitations in this matter.  The platform allows you to synchronize with all Google services.  A large number of applications have been developed for the system that can be downloaded for free from the internal store.  The OS is constantly updated, developers are working on bugs, which attracts users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are also disadvantages.  Not all Android tablets are updated.  Some models are not officially supported.  Compared with the above iOS, the "green robot" is not 100% stable in operation. </p><p>  Most experts say that when working with tablet devices, Android looks raw and incomplete.  Most often, new versions are unstable, so users have to work with older versions of the system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dual OS tablets" class="if uuid-2568625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568625.jpg"></div><h2>  Android Features </h2><p>  The operating system was demonstrated on September 23, 2008.  It is built on the Linux kernel.  At the moment, it is owned by the famous company Google.  Distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.  According to statistics, more than 1 billion devices work on this operating system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="graphic tablet for wasp" class="if uuid-2568620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568620.jpg"></div><h2>  Android Description </h2><p>  The system is installed on a large number of models of watches, smartphones, TVs and so on.  It is also planned to be installed in computer cars. </p><p>  The store was opened in 2008, its original name is ‚ÄúAndroid Market‚Äù.  Developers receive up to 70% of the profit, the rest is deducted to those operators that provide mobile communications.  In 2012, Google and Android services were combined, so the store was renamed Google Play.  Now it is used in more than 180 countries. </p><p>  Each version of Android starting with 1.5 is named after various desserts.  Two individual fonts were developed for this system.  In versions from 4.2, developer tools are blocked.  To get into them, you need to click 7 times on the line with the release number in the characteristics.  The official site to this day there is no data on the minimum characteristics that will allow the system to run smoothly on the phone.  In versions from 2.3 there is an easter egg.  To "solve" it, you need to go into the settings and 4 times click on the version of the system.  The animation will first open, which you need to click on for a long tap.  After - the game starts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="windows os tablets" class="if uuid-2568622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568622.jpg"></div><h2>  Windows </h2><p>  Windows OS tablets are also quite popular.  Initially, the system was developed to work on computers and laptops.  However, due to the flexibility of the platform, it is installed on some tablet models.  An example of such devices is the ViewSonic ViewPad 10. This tablet with two operating systems (both Android and Windows is installed, which is an advantage) works quickly and without failures. </p><p>  Of the main features of the system, it should be noted that the platform has a huge number of functions, as it was created for the PC.  She is able to perform tasks of various kinds.  If the tablet is powerful and has a good processor, then it can easily replace the computer.  Windows 8 tablets are popular in the enterprise market.  This is due to the fact that in most cases for business or offices, the capabilities of Android and iOS are insufficient. </p><p>  For the average user, there is a special drawback: the system is not optimized for working with a touchscreen.  There is no special interface for the touch screen.  Also, given the requirements of the system for the tablet to work quickly and smoothly, it must be powerful, have a large battery capacity. </p><p>  Experts recommend the use of the eighth generation system, as it was optimized for working with touch screens.  The interface is more like a Windows Phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.windowscentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="os android tablet" class="if uuid-2568607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568607.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional Information about Windows </h2><p>  You need to understand that all tablets on Windows are expensive.  This is due to the fact that this system, as a rule, is able to work with heavy applications and with a large number of computer utilities.  The latest version of the OS is installed immediately on a large number of devices when purchasing a subscription. </p><p>  If a person needs only to freely use the browser in search of information, then the choice is obvious - you need to purchase ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  Those users who need freedom in games are encouraged to pay attention to Windows.  It all depends on what requirements the programs need.  Given that Windows has an x86 architecture, you can connect a keyboard with a mouse and play popular computer games.  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù has minimal compatibility with peripherals, but it is limited. </p><p>  There is a choice between different versions of the OS, it is better to stay on version 8.1.  She is now quite popular and is receiving good reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hbh-woolacotts.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet with windows 7" class="if uuid-2568612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2568612.jpg"></div><h2>  Other systems </h2><p>  In addition to the above OS for tablets, there are also other platforms.  On BlackBerry devices, a system from the manufacturer is installed: BlackBerry OS.  But in the Russian Federation, such tablets are unpopular, so hardly anyone knows about the OS. </p><p>  WebOS is considered promising, created by HP.  The notorious Intel company introduced its operating system, which is called MeeGo.  Even with the fact that this OS for tablets is often used, few people know about it, it is not in demand. </p><h2>  What to choose: Android or Windows? </h2><p>  Which system to prefer depends entirely on what the tablet is purchased for.  If you want to use a large number of interesting free applications, the regular need for cleaning the memory does not bother you, and you also want to watch movies often and there is no need for office applications, then the Android tablet will be a good choice. </p><p>  In other cases, it is better to prefer the device to Windows, but you need to understand that it must be powerful.  The operating system itself optimizes memory well, but applications can still consume a large resource.  The tablets themselves on this OS are universal. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Each of the described operating systems has its advantages, disadvantages and target audience.  The most popular platforms are Android and iOS.  It is between them that most users choose when buying a device.  The second system is preferred by those who want to work with stable software that does not need to be configured after purchase.  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is more popular due to the fact that it is installed not only on expensive devices, but also on budget ones.  It lends itself to flexible configuration, so the user can configure it "for themselves." </p><p>  The most optimal graphics tablet for OSU will be the one that runs on iOS. </p>
