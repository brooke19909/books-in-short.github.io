Five centuries have passed since then, but the Old World is a concept that is still used today.  What value did you put in it before?  What does it mean today? </p><h2>  Definition of the term </h2><p>  The Old World is that part of the land that Europeans knew in the <span>Middle Ages</span> before the discovery of the American continent.  The division was conditional and was based on the position of the land relative to the sea.  Merchants and travelers believed that there are three parts of the world: Europe, Asia, Africa.  Europe lies in the north, Africa in the south, and Asia in the east.  Subsequently, when the data on the geographical division of the continents became more accurate and complete, it was found that only Africa was a separate continent.  However, the ingrained views turned out to be not so easy to defeat, and all 3 <span>parts of the world</span> continued to be traditionally mentioned separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 parts of the world" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1470807.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sometimes the name Afro-Eurasia is used to determine the territorial mass of the Old World.  In fact, this is the largest continental massif - the supercontinent.  It is home to approximately 85 percent of the world's population. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A period of time </h2><p>  Speaking of the Old World, they often mean not just a specific geographical location.  These words carry information about a specific historical period, culture and then made discoveries.  We are talking about the Renaissance, when medieval asceticism and theocentrism are replaced by ideas of natural philosophy and experimental science. </p><p>  The attitude of a person to the world is changing.  Gradually, from the toy of a whole host of gods, who have the power to control human life according to their whims and whims, a person begins to feel like the master of his earthly home.  He strives for new knowledge, which leads to a number of discoveries.  Attempts are being made to explain the structure of the surrounding world using mechanics.  Improving measuring instruments, including navigation.  One can already trace the origin of such natural sciences as physics, chemistry, biology and astronomy, which are replacing alchemy and astrology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Europe asia africa" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1470809.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The changes that took place then gradually paved the way for expanding the borders of the known world.  They served as a prerequisite for the discovery of new lands.  Brave travelers traveled to uncharted lands, and their stories inspired even more daring and risky ventures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Historical journey of Christopher Columbus </h2><p>  In August 1492, three well-equipped ships under the command of Christopher Columbus sailed from Palos harbor to India.  This was the year of the <span>discovery of America,</span> but the famous discoverer himself never found out that he had discovered a continent unknown to Europeans before.  He was sincerely sure that he had made all four of his expeditions to India. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="year of discovery of america" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1470806.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The journey from the Old World to new lands took three months.  Unfortunately, it was neither cloudless, nor romantic, nor disinterested.  The admiral hardly restrained the subordinate sailors from the riot in the first voyage, and the main driving force for opening new territories was greed, thirst for power and vanity.  These ancient vices brought from the Old World subsequently brought much suffering and grief to the inhabitants of the American continent and nearby islands. </p><p>  <span>Christopher Columbus</span> himself did not get what he wanted.  Going on the first voyage, he prudently tried to protect himself and secure his future.  He insisted on concluding a formal agreement, according to which he received the noble title, the rank of admiral and vice-king of the newly discovered lands, as well as the percentage of income received from the above lands.  And although the year of the discovery of America was supposed to be a ticket to a secured future for a discoverer, after some time Columbus fell into disgrace and died in poverty, not receiving what was promised. </p><h2>  A New World Appears </h2><p>  Meanwhile, the ties between Europe and the New World were growing stronger.  Trade was established, the development of lands lying deep in the continent began, claims of various countries on these lands were formed, the era of colonization was coming.  And with the advent of the concept of ‚ÄúNew World‚Äù in terminology began to use the stable expression ‚ÄúOld World‚Äù.  After all, before the discovery of America, the need for this simply did not arise. </p><p>  Interestingly, the traditional division into the Old and New Worlds has remained unchanged.  At the same time, Oceania and Antarctica unknown during the Middle Ages are not taken into account today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the old world is" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1470808.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For decades, the New World has been associated with a new and better life.  The American continent was the <span>promised land</span> into which thousands of immigrants sought to get.  But in their memory they preserved their native places.  The Old World is traditions, sources and roots.  Prestigious education, fascinating cultural travels, historical monuments - even today it is connected with European countries, with the countries of the Old World. </p><h2>  Wine cards replace geographic </h2><p>  If in the field of geography, terminology, including the division of continents into the New and Old Worlds, is already a relatively rare occurrence, then among winemakers such definitions are still held in high esteem.  There are stable expressions: "wine of the Old World" and "wine of the New World."  The difference between these drinks is not only in the place where the grapes grow and the location of the winery.  They are rooted in the same differences that are characteristic of continents. </p><p>  So, wines of the Old World, mostly produced in France, Italy, Spain, Germany and Austria, are distinguished by their traditional taste and delicate elegant bouquet.  And the wines of the New World, which are famous for Chile, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, are brighter, with obvious fruity notes, but somewhat losing in refinement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="before the discovery of america" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/1470805.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Old World in the modern sense </h2><p>  Today, the term "Old World" is mainly applied to states located in Europe.  In the vast majority of cases, neither Asia nor Africa is taken into account.  So, depending on the context, the expression "Old World" can include either as many as three parts of the world, or only European states. </p>
