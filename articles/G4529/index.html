The role of Napoleon's personality in history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The young Corsican once hated the French for defeating the Republic of Genoa.  He, like his entourage, considered them enslavers.  Having become a ruler, he himself began to seize more and more new lands.  The invincible movement of his troops was able to stop Russia with its impassability and frost.  How did Napoleon come to power? </p><h2>  Youth </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.laphamsquarterly.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon - Emperor of France" class="if uuid-2468718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2468718.jpg"></div><p>  The future Napoleon Bonaparte I was born on 08/15/1769 in Corsica.  Parents were small aristocrats.  Thirteen children were born in the family, but eight survived to adulthood, including Napoleon.  Having come to power, he made all his brothers and sisters noble people. </p><p>  It is known that the future emperor loved to read as a child.  He spoke in Italian, and from the age of ten began to study French.  The father managed to get scholarships for his two sons.  He drove Joseph and Napoleon to France.  In 1779, the future ruler entered the cadet school.  At first, relations with classmates did not work out due to Corsican origin, lack of money, and the character of the young man.  He devoted all his time to reading.  He was fond of mathematics, the history of antiquity, geography.  Gradually became an informal leader among peers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1784, Napoleon was admitted to the Paris military school.  He decided that, specializing in artillery, he could advance his career ladder without even having a noble background.  At school, he never made friends, shocked teachers with his love for Corsica.  But in eight years he nevertheless became a Frenchman. </p><h2>  Military career </h2><div class="photo" data-original="napoleonbonapartepodcast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The battle in 1806" class="if uuid-2468717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2468717.jpg"></div><p>  In 1785, Napoleon's biography changed.  His father died, debts remained on the family.  The young man prematurely completes his studies and takes on the role of head of the house.  He began to serve in the artillery regiment in Valence.  He had the rank of second lieutenant. </p><p>  He unsuccessfully tried to solve the problems of the family, sent the salary to his mother.  He himself lived in poverty, eating once a day.  To improve his <span>financial situation,</span> Napoleon wanted to join the Russian imperial army, but he abandoned his plan, because he would have been demoted. </p><p>  With the beginning of the French Revolution, the officer continued to engage in family affairs.  Together with his brothers, he supported the transformation of Corsica into the administrative unit of France. </p><p>  In 1791, Napoleon again arrived at the service.  He was promoted to lieutenant.  He brought his brother Louis with him, whom he placed at school at his own expense.  A few months later he again went to Corsica.  From there he never returned to Valence.  On the island of Napoleon plunged into political life, he was elected lieutenant colonel of the National Guard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1792 he arrived in Paris, where he received the rank of captain.  He witnessed the overthrow of the king.  In the fall of the same year, the officer returned to Corsica.  There, his family finally sided with France and was forced to leave their homeland. </p><p>  In the ten years after his graduation from the military school, Napoleon went through the entire hierarchy of army production.  He received the rank of general in 1795. </p><h2>  Italian campaign </h2><p>  In 1796, Napoleon was appointed commander of the Italian army.  The financial situation of employees was extremely difficult.  They were not paid a salary, supplies and ammunition were not brought up.  The general partially solved these problems.  He understood that the issue on the side of the enemy would allow to completely settle the issue.  Then the army will be supplied at the expense of the enemy‚Äôs lands. </p><p>  Thanks to the general‚Äôs strategy, the French troops defeated the Sardinian and Austrian forces.  Soon, Northern Italy was cleared of enemy forces.  Bonaparte‚Äôs control also included the possession of the pope.  He was forced to pay a contribution to the French troops and give a large number of works of art. </p><p>  Although the Austrians arrived with reinforcements, the general took one fortress after another.  In the attack on the Arkolsky bridge, he personally carried the banner in his hands.  He was covered by an adjutant who died from bullets. </p><p>  The Austrians were finally driven out of Italy in 1797, after the battle of Rivoli.  <span>The Italian army</span> moved to Vienna.  One hundred kilometers from the city, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers stopped because their forces were running out.  Negotiations have begun.  Bonaparte used the victories of his troops to build a reputation.  Subsequently, it came in handy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For the victories of the Italian army, the general received substantial military booty, distributed it among the military and members of the Directory, without depriving himself and his family.  He returned to Paris, where he bought a house. </p><h2>  Egyptian campaign </h2><p>  The Italian campaign brought Napoleon tremendous popularity.  The directory appointed him to command the English army.  However, landing in Britain was unrealistic.  We decided to send forces to Egypt.  So France hoped to create an outpost for further attack on the British position in India. </p><p>  Bonaparte's troops captured Malta, Alexandria, Cairo.  However, they were overtaken by the Nelson squadron.  The French fleet was defeated, and Napoleon was cut off in the country of the pyramids.  He tried to negotiate with the local population, then tried to capture Syria.  As a result, he was trapped and secretly sailed to France.  Then Napoleon came to power. </p><h2>  First consul </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fineartamerica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon in 1812" class="if uuid-2468721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2468721.jpg"></div><p>  The directory was not able to ensure stability in the republic.  She increasingly relied on the army.  Due to the arrival of <span>Russian-Austrian</span> troops <span>in Italy,</span> all Bonaparte acquisitions were eliminated.  The preparations for the coup began.  The general was persuaded to take part in it. </p><p>  In 1799, and according to the timeline of that time on the 18th Brumaire of the VIII year of the Republic, the Council of Elders appointed Bonaparte as the department commander.  The powers of the Directory have been terminated.  Not without weapons, an interim consulate was established, consisting of Bonaparte, Ducos, Sieyes.  While a new constitution was being created, the general concentrated executive power in his hands. </p><h2>  Consulate Period </h2><p>  When Napoleon came to power, the country was at war with England and Austria.  The consul had to conduct an Italian campaign again.  In 1800, the First Austrian Campaign began.  After victories in the battles of Marengo and Hohenlinden negotiations were held.  The conclusion of the Luneville Peace laid the foundation for Napoleon's domination in Italy and Germany. </p><p>  Napoleon's rise to power completely changed the state system of France.  An administrative reform was carried out, according to which mayors were appointed, taxes were collected.  Established the Bank of France.  Paris newspapers were shut down, and the rest were subordinate to the government.  Catholicism was declared the main religion, but religious freedom remained. </p><p>  The consulate was supposed to last ten years.  But Napoleon all the time strengthened his position in order to switch to life-long rule.  He managed to get this issue through the Senate in 1802.  But Napoleon was not enough to become a consul for life, he promoted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhereditary power. </p><h2>  The emperor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.parcours-napoleoniens.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon Bonaparte" class="if uuid-2468720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2468720.jpg"></div><p>  In 1804, and according to the chronology of France, 28 floreals, the Senate recognized the new constitution.  This meant the proclamation of Napoleon as emperor.  This was followed by major changes in society. </p><p>  Bonaparte wished to be crowned by the pope.  To do this, he even married his common-law wife Josephine.  The coronation took place in 1804 in the Notre Dame Cathedral.  The former consul personally donned the crown. </p><h2>  Empire Rise </h2><p>  Bonaparte continued to plan a landing on the islands of Britain.  For his new campaigns, he took funds from indemnities paid by captured states. </p><p>  The most famous battles of Napoleon: </p><ul><li>  Battle of Ulm - in 1805, the Austrian army surrendered. </li><li>  Battle of Austerlitz - in 1805, Napoleon set a trap for the Russian-Austrian army.  The Allied forces were forced to retreat in disarray. </li><li>  Battle of Saalfeld - in 1806, the twelve thousandth French army defeated the eight thousandth army of Prussia.  Finally they were defeated at Jena and Auersted. </li><li>  The Battle of Eilau - in 1807.  In a bloody battle between the Russian and French troops, there was no winner.  This happened for the first time in many years. </li><li>  Battle of Friedland - in 1807, Russian troops lost.  Napoleon took Koenigsberg, which became a threat to the Russian borders. </li></ul><h2>  Continental blockade </h2><p>  Napoleon's biography is full of military victories.  After another of them, he signed a special decree.  According to it, France and its allies terminated trade relations with Great Britain.  This caused considerable damage to the English economy, but France suffered no less. </p><h2>  War with Austria </h2><p>  In 1809, Emperor Franz II declared war on the French.  But Napoleon‚Äôs forces repulsed the blow and captured Vienna for several weeks.  After the victory at Wagram, Sch√∂nbrunn peace was concluded.  Austria lost part of its possessions in Italy.  Then Napoleon I Bonaparte decided to go east. </p><h2>  Campaign to Russia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="survincity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kutuzov on Borodino" class="if uuid-2468719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2468719.jpg"></div><p>  His decision resulted in a disaster for the French army.  Napoleon in Russia was defeated by the army of Kutuzov.  The harsh winter of 1812, the active support of the Russian army by the people, contributed to this. </p><p>  The success of the Russian troops gave impetus to the national liberation struggle in Western Europe.  Allied forces entered Paris in 1814.  Bonaparte had to abdicate. </p><h2>  The exile of the emperor to the island of Elba </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.panorama.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon after the abdication" class="if uuid-2468716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2468716.jpg"></div><p>  However, the story of Napoleon has not yet been completed.  The imperial title was retained for him and sent to the Elbe.  The overthrown Bourbons returned to France.  The people did not like their policies.  Napoleon took advantage of this, and with a small detachment in 1815 landed in the south of France. </p><h2>  Triumphant return to Paris </h2><p>  Three weeks later, Napoleon came to power again.  He won without firing a shot, as the masses and troops went over to his side.  However, the reign did not last long.  In history, this period is known as "One Hundred Days." </p><p>  The emperor did not live up to the hopes of the French.  To this was added the defeat at Waterloo.  A second abdication followed. </p><h2>  Link to St. Helena </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sidemcicek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon's death" class="if uuid-2468722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25724/2468722.jpg"></div><p>  Bonaparte spent six years on a closed island as a British captive.  The island was removed from Europe.  He was allowed to take officers with him.  The climate on the island was damp, all the actions of the former emperor were monitored by sentries.  He did not try to escape, occasionally received visitors, dictated memories.  Died 05/05/1821. </p><p>  Napoleon‚Äôs path to power began with military affairs, but he is known for his achievements in public administration.  It is rather difficult to overestimate its role in the history of Europe.  By his example, he showed how a lieutenant of noble origin can become an emperor, with whom the rulers of world powers will reckon.  The military operations of Napoleon in Germany accelerated the beginning of the process of unification of its lands. </p>
