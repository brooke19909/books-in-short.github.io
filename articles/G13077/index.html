  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alexander the Great</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Alexander of Macedon was born</span> in 356 BC.  e., in July, in the royal family.  The homeland of this man was the city of Pella.  The director Leonid (one of the relatives of Alexander‚Äôs mother, the Olympics) supervised the upbringing of little Alexander.  From 343 BC  e.  raised a boy Aristotle.  Having received an excellent education in childhood, Alexander the Great subsequently became one of the most enlightened monarchs of his era.  Already in childhood, the <span>character traits of the</span> future conqueror were manifested. </p><p>  A teacher of Alexander the Great in military art - his father, Philip 2, was killed by his bodyguard.  After the death of his father, a twenty-year-old son ascended the throne.  First of all, the new ruler eliminated all participants in the conspiracy against Philip 2 and the alleged candidates for the throne. </p><p>  A few months after ascending the throne, military campaigns of Alexander the Great began. </p><p>  The new king went to the northwest of the <span>Balkan Peninsula.</span>  Quickly breaking the resistance of the triballs and the Getae, Alexander the Great added the conquered lands to his territory.  Thus, the young king showed that he was not inferior to his father in anything. </p><p>  Alexander‚Äôs next campaign took place soon enough.  In some cities in Greece, a riot began.  With a small army, Macedon quickly suppressed all revolts. </p><p>  At the beginning of 334 BC  e.  a young commander with a strong army, crossing <span>the Dardanelles,</span> entered the territory of Persia.  The numerous armed army of the Achaemenids was defeated by the Macedonian.  <span>The great commander</span> went to the coastal Greek cities.  Residents greeted the liberators with great joy.  The population languishing under Persian oppression opens the gates to the Macedonians.  Within just a few months, the territories of Lydia were liberated and recognized the authority of the young king. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 333 B.C.  e.  A decisive battle took place near the city of Isse.  Despite the threefold superiority of the troops of the Achaemenids, Macedon won.  The young king enters Babylon.  This conquest put an end to the dynasty of the Persian kings of the Achaemenids. </p><p>  It should be noted that Alexander the Great changed after the capture of the cities of <span>Asia Minor.</span>  He sought to unite the winners and the vanquished into one strong monarchy. </p><p>  After successful campaigns in Central Asia, the young king went to India.  In those days there were legends about untold riches in this country. </p><p>  However, Indian lands were not welcoming to the conqueror.  The population showed fierce resistance to the invader.  In 326 B.C.  e., in the summer, the last major battle in the life of Macedon on the Gidaspe River took place.  In this battle, King Por opposes the young king.  In the battle, Alexander inflicts Pore a complete defeat. </p><p>  After this battle, the young king decides to return to Babylon, dividing the army into three parts.  At the head of one part, Macedonian places the commander of the Crater, he leads the other himself, and sends the third by sea, led by the commander Nearch. </p><p>  Met all the troops in the territory of Karmania (in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãancient Persia).  Thus ended the eastern campaign of the ruler, who made him Great.  His conquests lasted ten years.  The period is relatively short, especially given the vast territory that Alexander managed to capture. </p><p>  The king returns to Babylon, where the affairs of the state await him.  Along with this, preparations are underway for a future campaign.  Before its beginning, in a week, the king arranges a magnificent feast.  The next day, Macedonian becomes ill - a fever begins, the temperature rises.  Every day the condition of the Great King is deteriorating.  He ceases to recognize relatives, begins to lose consciousness.  The incomprehensible state lasts two weeks. </p><p>  In 323, in the middle of June, before he reached the age of 33, Alexander the Great dies at the zenith of his power and glory. </p>
