However, it can be very, very different: someone will be photographed against the background of the famous Eiffel Tower, someone will definitely want to walk along the quiet and narrow streets of provincial towns, and maybe even go to the ocean. </p><p>  And the country delights with stunning landscapes and monuments, fine cuisine and delicious wine, as well as a peaceful lifestyle. </p><p>  Sights of France, photos and descriptions of which will be presented below, were not chosen by chance.  Often, travelers do not even know about their existence, and numerous tourist booklets provide very scarce information. </p><p>  But in general, it should be noted that the nature of the country is quite diverse.  Here you can see mountain ranges and green meadows, lush forests and calm plains, azure shores and quiet coves.  All this served as an inspiration for many famous artists, writers and poets.  And of course, Paris is the capital of France out of competition. </p><h2>  Section 2. The most visited place in Paris: Sacre Coeur Basilica </h2>

So in our case: the construction of the Sacre Coeur Basilica lasted more than four decades.  Today it is a real masterpiece of architecture.  Once upon a time, an unusual mineral mined in the Chateau Landon was chosen for its construction.  It becomes white under the influence of moisture.  Thanks to this stone, the cathedral has a snow-white appearance. </p><p>  France ... Paris ... Sights, or rather, most of them, can be seen from the hill on which the basilica is located.  From here, a stunning panorama of the entire main city of the country opens.  This is a favorite place for walking not only guests of the capital, but also local residents.  Especially a lot of visitors on Christmas, when the temple hosts fairs and festivities.  The cathedral is striking in its beauty and a huge number of hand pigeons.  The main entrance is decorated with two bronze horsemen, and the interior is amazing with a wonderful ceiling mosaic and statues of saints. </p><h2>  Section 3. The Mysterious If Castle </h2>

It was built in a short time, in the period 1524-1531, on the island of If by order of the French king Francis I in order to protect the city from attacks from the sea.  But the fortress was never attacked, and eventually became an impregnable prison altogether.  Here, in terrible dungeons, political prisoners and Protestants were kept, who were enemies of the king. </p><p>  The fame of the fortress was brought by the heroes of the novel by Alexander Dumas ‚ÄúCount of Monte Cristo‚Äù - the prisoner ‚ÄúIron Mask‚Äù and Edmond Dantes.  However, in fact, these characters have never been in the castle, and Dantes is generally a fictional hero.  Nowadays, If Castle is considered to be a visiting card of Marseille; excursions are held here.  One of the cells on the ground floor was specially designated for Dantes.  On the screen of the installed TV, you can see episodes from various films showing the meeting of heroes from the novel by Dumas.  The chamber of the mysterious prisoner ‚ÄúIron Mask‚Äù is located on the second floor of the castle. </p><p>  For visitors to If Castle, there are cafes on the island that offer magnificent views of Marseille. </p><h2>  Section 4.

    <p>  To date, the park is listed as a <span>UNESCO World Heritage</span> Site.  Access to the territory of Scandola is possible only from the sea and with a special pass.  For this reason, tourist visits to the protected peninsula are limited to boat trips along the coastline and photography of local attractions.  Excursions are held daily, from June to September. </p><p>  The peninsula appeared more than 250 million years ago due to active volcanic activity.  Tourists are especially attracted by the porphyry rocks, which are millions of years old.  The cliffs rise above the sea about three hundred meters and have unusual dark red and purple hues.  Sheer cliffs riddled with grottoes. </p><p>  The sea here is dark blue and crystal clear.  Seals, sea turtles, and many species of fish and algae live in the coastal waters of the Girolata and Porto bays.  The terrestrial fauna of the peninsula is also rich.  There are dozens of rare species of birds, including sea eagles, peregrine falcon and loonie. </p><h2>  Section 6. Attraction for extreme lovers </h2>

    <p>  The most courageous and courageous, loving thrill, can without hesitation go to the mountains and take a step into the void.  At the highest point of Mont Blanc, the peak of the Aiguille du Midi, at an altitude of about 4 thousand meters above sea level, a glass cabin, called Pas dans le vide ("Step into the Void"), was built.  This is the most beautiful observation deck in the world where you can enjoy a beautiful view of Mont Blanc. </p><p>  The construction of the cabin lasted three years.  For the construction, high quality materials and the toughest glass were used, resistant to the most difficult weather conditions and meeting safety standards.  At the same time, the authors of the Pas dans le vide project made it possible to make such an excursion to people suffering from acrophobia.  To get to the top of Aiguille du Midi, you can use two lifts.  Perhaps such a trip will help someone get rid of the fear of heights forever. </p><p>  The cost of visiting is 55 euros. </p><h2>  Section 7. Tribute to modernity and scientific progress </h2>

This is a virtual reality amusement park where, with the help of high-tech equipment, special effects and stereo films, you can witness the actions taking place on huge screens.

Huge cinema halls equipped with moving chairs, 3D films, a museum of the history of cinema, unusual architecture - all this is the Futuroscope park of the future.

Inside the crystal of an unusual shape, a huge screen measuring 600 square meters is installed.  m. having a height of a 7-storey building.  Here is the world's only cinema of the IMAX system, which uses 70 mm film for display. </p><p>  The dynamic cinema room is designed for thrill-seekers.  Armchairs connected to the hydraulic system and a selection of thematic films create the effect of virtual reality.  The Coulers Bresil Pavilion, consisting of 9 screens and 9 projectors, provides a 360-degree panoramic view.  Here you can independently select the image, being in the center of the system. </p><p>  For children, a separate playground is organized with various attractions and entertainments.

And in the Palace of Congresses of the park, business negotiations and teleconferences are held. </p><p>  The park operates year-round.  On its territory there is a network of eateries and cafes that offer their guests dishes of French cuisine. </p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to note that the famous sights of France - the Eiffel Tower, <span>Notre Dame Cathedral, the</span> Champs Elysees - are sure to make you admire and amaze your imagination with their grandeur, but those who really want to get acquainted with the country are encouraged to abandon stereotypes and rush inland, away from battered hiking trails. </p>
