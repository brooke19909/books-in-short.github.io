    <h2>  Excursion to Strelna </h2><p>  Every year, hundreds of travelers come to the village to see the sights of Strelna.  You can get here in several ways: </p><ul><li>  By train, they run daily from the Baltic Station in St. Petersburg.  A significant drawback of this option is that you need to walk from the terminal Strelna station to the main attractions. </li><li>  By shuttle bus - the fastest and most convenient way to get to the former travel residence.  Buses run daily from St. Petersburg to the Upper Park Strelna. </li><li>  Tram from Avtovo metro station. </li></ul><p>  It is best to start your Strelna tour from the Trinity-Sergius desert.  After visiting the holy places, you can go to the main attraction - the Konstantinovsky Palace.  The next object to be seen is the Travel Palace.  Then, to learn more about the noble family of the Orlovs, you need to visit the Oryol estate and the park.  And an amazing journey through Strelna should be completed in the Russian <span>village of Shuvalovka.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, let's talk in more detail about the main attractions of Strelna. </p><h2>  Konstantinovsky Palace </h2><p>  According to the plans of Peter I, this palace was to overshadow the French Versailles with its beauty and perfection.  For its design and construction, the most famous masters were involved - Nicolo Michetti, B. Rastrelli.  Unfortunately, after the death of the emperor, the unfinished palace was neglected.  Prior to the transfer of ownership of Konstantin Pavlovich, he served as a wine storage.  The building acquired its modern appearance only at the beginning of the 19th century.  Architect A.N. Voronikhin completely changed the interior of the palace.  He remade the interior in antique style. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the palace and park ensemble was almost completely destroyed.  Its reconstruction was completed only in 2003. </p><p>  Today the Konstantinovsky Palace is open to the public.  There is also a museum.  The exposition of the Konstantinovsky Palace presents collections of paintings collected by Mstislav Rostropovich and Galina Vishnevskaya. </p>
