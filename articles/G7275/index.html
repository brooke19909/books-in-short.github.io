They are enough to <span>tie laces, a</span> belt, connect the ends of the rope in case of breakage.  To make a knot for a tie, to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù an elegant bow, to mount fishing tackle, practice is already required.  Everyone can take a step forward and learn how to knit self-tightening knots.  It will take a piece of rope, a little time and desire.  In addition, many of the simple schemes are useful for domestic needs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Self-locking knots" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1117744.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Application </h2><p>  Self-tightening nodes are used not only by climbers and sailors.  Some sources claim that there are about twenty such schemes.  Knowing all of them is not necessary even for a professional.  But some universal combinations may come in handy for a simple layman. </p><p>  When camping, the constrictor knot will securely fix the hammock, the gazebo will help to equip the canopy from the rain.  For hostesses, a ‚Äúburlak sea loop‚Äù is necessary if it becomes necessary to tighten the clothesline from sagging or arrange drying for collected medicinal herbs.  Walking the dog, sometimes it becomes necessary to leave the pet temporarily securely attached to the support.  A simple ‚Äúcow knot‚Äù would be just the thing.  It fits easily and quickly allows you to free the leash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Self-locking knots</span> for fishing line should be in the arsenal of any fisherman.  They will also be useful for reliable fastening of the boat.  For those going on a mountain trip, knowledge of the components for insurance equipment is simply necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Self-tightening knots for fishing line" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1117676.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  The principle of operation of such schemes is laid down in the definition itself.  When one or both ends of the <span>rope is</span> pulled, the <span>knot is</span> tightened.  Moreover, the stronger the force, the stronger the connection.  But it should be remembered that some self-tightening nodes reliably "work" only with constant tension.  If it is assumed that the force will change or be jerky, the connection may weaken. </p><p>  Self-tightening knots fit around any reliable support.  They are especially well kept on a non-slip cylindrical base: a tree trunk, a stump, a branch, a power transmission support and the like.  The simplest knitting pattern involves only three movements.  Form a half ring, wrapping a free end around the base. </p><p>  Continuing movement, it is brought under the main rope and passed into the now formed loop.  In fact, this is the same knot as when <span>tying shoelaces.</span>  But in the loop formed during its formation there is a support.  Now, when pulling the main rope, the free end will be pressed against a rigid surface, which will prevent the structure from untying. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Self-locking knot for bracelet" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1117668.jpg" width="600"></div>

After tightening the knot, the free end is re-thrown around the support, winded over the main rope and passed into the newly formed loop.  Such a unit is called a ‚Äúhalf-bayonet‚Äù.  You can make one, two or more reinsurance, if the length of the rope allows.  Such self-tightening nodes will be more perfect, they will remain on the support even with a variable load. </p><p>  In order not to be afraid of accidentally unleashing them, you can use the "constrictor".  From Latin so translated "boa constrictor".  And these reptiles, as you know, when holding the victim form very strong rings.  The constrictor is often impossible to untie at all and you have to cut the rope.  However, if you do not apply excessive force, the knot will do well both by tightening the neck of the bag and securing the clothesline.  In case of emergency, it is best suited to squeeze a damaged artery or vein during bleeding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a knot on a bracelet self-tightening" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1117670.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Circuit option </h2><p>  At the heart of more complex nodes, basic combinations are laid.  So, based on the above diagram, you can make several more options for connections, including self-tightening nodes for fishing line.  On the one hand, they become a little more difficult to implement, but on the other, they make the basic combination universal.  Depending on the situation, you can easily switch to other types of mounts from it. </p><p>  For example, the simple self-tightening assembly described above can be made quickly untied.  To do this, before tightening the loop, the free end of the rope is passed in the opposite direction (not completely), so that another loop is formed.  If necessary, you can pull on the free ‚Äútail‚Äù formed if necessary, so that effortlessly unfasten the fasteners.  The scheme in this design is called the ‚Äúboat node‚Äù.  At the same time, he holds the boat well on the pier and allows you to quickly set sail from the shore, only by pulling the edge of the rope. </p><h2>  Complication </h2><p>  Using a simple self-tightening knot as the basis, you can easily switch to the ‚Äúnoose‚Äù scheme.  To do this, before tightening the free end three times wrap around the rope, forming a loop.  With uniform tightening, the connection is reliably fixed due to repeated pressing force to the support.  To untie such a knot without loosening the main rope is problematic. </p><p>  A self-tightening knot with a loop can be useful in everyday life to shorten a sagging clothesline.  Using it, you can temporarily ‚Äúhide‚Äù (make inactive) a portion of the cord with damaged fibers, which theoretically can break when loaded.  The advantage of the ‚ÄúBurlak sea loop‚Äù knot is its ability to tie on any section of a fixed rope that does not have free ends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Self-locking knot with loop" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1117746.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a knot on a bracelet self-tightening? </h2><p>  There may be several options.  The simplest is if there is already a loop of rope or fishing line at one end of the bracelet.  This is done because it is difficult to work with one hand without assistance.  In this case, a massive <span>decorative knot is</span> knitted at the other end <span>.</span> </p><p>  It should be of such a size that it can end-to-end pass through the hole in the loop.  The knot fits in with the expectation that when it is ‚Äúfastened‚Äù, the strap will need to be pulled slightly.  After threading through the eyelet, the force will weaken, but the loop will not be able to come off on its own. </p><p>  So that the self-tightening knot for the bracelet accidentally could not untie, the easiest way is to use the scheme described above.  The free end is threaded into the eye, swiveled in the opposite direction, wound under the main ribbon and passed into the loop formed.  You can use for these purposes and options schemes shown in the photographs above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fishing how to make a self-tightening knot" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28294/1117745.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Fishing: how to make a self-tightening knot </h2><p>  Oddly enough, in order to fix the end of the fishing line (cord) on the reel, in principle, you can use the same simple scheme, especially if you additionally strengthen it with two or more "half-bayonets", and in addition put a layer of adhesive tape on top.  However, fishermen usually use a different scheme for this - with a drag loop. </p><p>  For the convenience of such mounting, the spool is removed from the reel.  A loop is knitted at the end of the fishing line in any convenient way.  This is best done by the G8, but that‚Äôs not the point.  After that, at a certain distance (15-20 cm) from the nodule formed, the main fishing line is captured, doubled and threaded into the eye. </p><p>  The resulting new loop is stretched to a sufficient distance so that the <span>diameter of the circle</span> allows you to put it on the spool.  Self-tightening knots on a reel with a sealing loop, on the one hand, will keep the fishing line from slipping, and on the other hand, they allow it to be removed and changed if necessary, without cutting the connection.  If the loop nevertheless slips, then when you put it on the spool, it was placed on the wrong side, and it should be rotated 180 degrees. </p>
