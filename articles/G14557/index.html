    <p>  <span>The capital of Latvia,</span> Riga, is one of the most beautiful cities in the post-Soviet space.  Amazing architecture, the unique atmosphere of the Old Town and the friendliness of the locals make Riga a welcome destination for a vacation.  There are many attractions that have been preserved since ancient times.  The most famous are the Dome Cathedral with the famous organ, especially for which <span>Ferenc Liszt</span> wrote many of his works <span>, the</span> Riga Castle, the Powder Tower left from the fortress wall, the Three Brothers medieval house, the ancient Seta Convent, the House of Cats and the Small Guild history, the <span>house of the Blackheads,</span> from which city tours often start - guides usually gather here, ready for a moderate fee to tell about all the sights of the city, many others.  Very often, thanks to its fabulous atmosphere, Riga tourists choose to celebrate the New Year. </p><p>  In addition to attractions, in Riga there are many shops, shopping centers and, of course, hotels.  Thanks to the impeccable service, cozy atmosphere and excellent cuisine, reviews of Riga hotels are rarely negative.  <span>The most expensive hotels in</span> Riga are located in the Old Town, but you can also find good and cheap hotels there.  For example, for those who want to save, there is a great option - TIGER HOSTEL 2 *.  He has his own Russian-language website where you can book a room.  The hotel can send the confirmation of the reservation to the consulate, which facilitates the easy receipt of a visa.  The hotel staff is friendly and welcoming, the rooms are cozy, the hotel building has a 24-hour cafe, and throughout its territory the Internet is free.  The only thing - amenities, toilet and shower, are in the common corridor.  Also, some guests noted that the live music playing in the cafe does not stop all night on Fridays and Saturdays, but someone even liked it.  Prices start at 7.5 euros per place per day.  The hostel is located very close to the railway and bus stations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the three-star and four-star hotels in Riga do not differ much in location or price, so it all depends on the taste.  For example, KONVENTA SETA 3 * is located directly in the historical center of the city and is literally among the sights and is even part of it.  The rooms are small but comfortable, however, without a refrigerator and a safe.  The kitchen is excellent and the staff is very friendly.  This is a great option for those who want to directly experience the story. </p><p>  An interesting hotel is the BOUTIQUE HOTEL MONTE KRISTO 4 *, also located in the center.  This is an elegant building, located very close to the train and bus station.  Among the hotel's services are free Wi-Fi, a restaurant, cable TV, a sauna, rooms are comfortable, equipped with showers, and some have a jacuzzi, a safe, a minibar, a pleasant trifle - the presence of a kettle and tea bags in them.  Rooms cost from 50 to 80 euros, the price includes a sumptuous breakfast and <span>a buffet</span> in the morning.  The hotel restaurant offers delicious cuisine, large portions and reasonable prices.  Among the shortcomings, guests note good audibility inside the building. </p><p>  The most chic hotel in Riga - GRAND PALACE HOTEL 5 *.  It is also located in the Old Town and is also literally surrounded by attractions.  From all the windows of the hotel offer amazing views.  The rooms in it are equipped with air conditioning, plasma TVs, safes, bathrooms with heated floors and much more.  The hotel infrastructure includes a restaurant with European and Asian cuisine, a bar, a sauna, baths, a fitness center, laundry, dry cleaning.  Services include 24-hour room service, childcare and childcare, car rental, and more.  Some guests are not satisfied with the lack of a swimming pool at the hotel, but rare hotels in Riga are equipped with it. </p><p>  Riga is a truly fabulous city, shrouded in many secrets and legends, and it is really worth a visit.  If you want to do it yourself, numerous Riga hotels for every budget and taste will be happy to meet you: the friendly staff here, like most residents of the city, perfectly understand and speak Russian, and the cuisine in them, according to most tourists, is simply amazing .  Riga hotels willingly send the invitation necessary for obtaining a tourist visa, so you can safely and easily go here at any time. </p>
