Hotel description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hurghada is a city in Egypt, which is one of the main tourist centers of the country.  This resort is located on the west coast of the Red Sea.  The hot weather, which is kept here constantly, as well as the almost complete absence of precipitation, allow numerous tourists to come to Hurghada almost all year round (except for winter). </p><h2>  A resort for every taste </h2><p>  Locals who work in hotels are always happy for vacationers who have arrived in Egypt.  Hurghada is a first-class resort, here you can choose a hotel for every taste and budget. </p><p>  The city stretched for tens of kilometers along the coast.  Hot and dry climate, as well as rich infrastructure make Hurghada one of the most popular tourist centers of the Red Sea.  A unique feature of the resort is coral reefs stretching along the entire coast.  This makes Hurghada one of the world's diving centers. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Russian tourists can fly here by charter flights from any major city.  Usually the price of tickets is included in the price of tours to Egypt.  Hurghada is far from the airports.  If you want to make the trip yourself, you should fly to Cairo with a regular flight, and then by plane or bus to get to Hurghada.  A tourist visa can be obtained at the airport upon arrival. </p><p>  The resort itself should be reached by taxi.  It is advisable to agree on the price in advance, after the trip is over it is better not to enter into disputes with the driver.  In Cairo, you can rent a car and get to Hurghada on your own.  But be careful.  Egyptians are not as honest as Europeans.  The car may be faulty, and you will notice this far from immediately.  You are entitled to insurance, feel free to demand it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Locals </h2><p>  According to many tourists, the best resort for anyone who prefers a holiday in Egypt is Hurghada.  Guest reviews are filled with memories of beautiful vacation days.  Locals are one of the main disadvantages of the resort.  Almost all vacationers complain about them.  Egypt is a poor country, and tourists here are the main source of income for many people.  Therefore, local residents always try to tear off an extra dollar from a gapeous guest.  Among them there are wonderful, decent, hospitable people.  But be on the alert.  If you ask the price of a product from a market trader, then it may be overpriced for you.  He will sell it locally cheaper.  This also applies to drivers and guides.  In hotels, the rules are strict, managers carefully monitor the honesty of employees. </p><h2>  How to avoid unpleasant surprises </h2><p>  The Mirage Waterpark Hotel (Hurghada) offers its guests a variety of animations.  During the day, you can play soccer, volleyball, basketball or darts.  In the evening, the animators play a fun theatrical performance. </p><p>  To avoid unpleasant surprises outside the hotel, always ask how much local people pay for a similar service.  If a conflict does occur, keep in mind that there is a <span>tourist police</span> in Egypt guarding your interests.  Appeal to the authorities is better used as a threat.  Doing this is undesirable if you do not know a large number of nuances.  You can complain about theft, overpricing, the imposition of goods and services.  However, all this must be confirmed - a paid check or other evidence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Choice of transport </h2><p>  Accustomed to cycling in Egypt, it is better to forget about it.  Iron horses can be rented in almost every hotel.  But on the roads of this country to travel is very dangerous.  Local drivers drive without any rules.  And if you add to this the poor condition of the roads, it becomes clear why you should prefer hiking or taxis.  Inveterate cyclists who love rest in Hurghada, hotels are chosen based on these facts. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The city has three districts: the central (El Dahar), the old (Sakkala) and the new, which is also called the hotel.  All the resort hotels are concentrated in it.  In Hurghada itself there are almost no attractions.  However, in any hotel you will find an abundance of excursions.  Most tourists are transported to large cities - Cairo and Luxor.  And magnificent pyramids must be seen by every guest of Egypt.  Very often representatives of the tour operator offer boat trips on a yacht.  Traveling to the picturesque islands, you can go scuba diving and admire the coral. </p><h2>  Pools and beach </h2><p>  Tourists who prefer to relax in five-star hotels often choose the Mirage Waterpark (Hurghada).  The hotel got its name thanks to the waterslides located on the territory.  Entertainment will find children and adults.  The hotel pool is amazing.  It consists of several zones.  There is a children's pool with a small slide for kids.  A large area for swimming lovers, several beautiful figured pools.  And a separate area with water slides.  Sun loungers are covered with canopies, because the Egyptian sun is very hot. </p><p>  At a distance of only a few tens of meters from the pool, the beach begins.  It is also equipped with comfortable sunbeds with awnings.  The Mirage Waterpark Hotel (Hurghada) has a sandy beach, which is rarely seen in Egypt.  The entrance to the sea is flat and gentle.  The shallow zone extends far - several tens of meters. </p>

    <p>  In Hurghada, sandy beaches are quite common.  Fans of underwater landscapes will be disappointed.  Pontoon beaches, allowing plenty of fish and corals to admire, are rare here.  Therefore, a vacation with children in Hurghada will be much more pleasant than in Sharm El Sheikh.  Pontoon beaches dominate the Sinai Peninsula.  The coastline is overgrown with sharp corals, so tourists enter the sea from a special floating bridge.  Having descended into the water, vacationers immediately find themselves at a depth of several meters.  Therefore, rest with kids in hotels with pontoon beaches is difficult. </p><h2>  Floor plans and equipment rooms </h2><p>  Mirage Waterpark (Hurghada) has a large landscaped area.  The building is tall and beautiful.  Tourists can choose their accommodation from several possible layouts.  All rooms are quite spacious, their area is about fifty square meters.  You can order a standard room with a view of the sea or the hotel grounds.  At the request of the client, the manager provides a room with a private pool or panoramic window.  Each room has a balcony or terrace. </p>

    <p>  Ignorance of the Arabic language, including numbers, is an excellent reason to raise the cost of goods to the ceiling.  Ask one of the hotel staff to write an approximate price tag for you.  Knowing what the numbers look like in Egypt, you can start bargaining at the bazaar.  You can reduce the price not only in the market, but also in Arab stores.  In addition to those that are arranged according to the European model. </p><p>  What can I buy in Egypt?  Antique statuettes and jewelry, as well as natural aromatic oils.  Often, tourists buy a hookah with elegant coinage or locally produced ceramics.  A wonderful souvenir is natural papyrus. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Are you in the process of choosing a hotel?  Mirage Waterpark (Hurghada), reviews of which are almost all positive, is in the highest positions of the tourist rating.  Guests positively evaluate the hotel complex, noting the advantages of a large territory, many pools, and well-planned rooms.  Positive feedback from Russian tourists earned children's entertainment, animation and food in the main restaurant. </p><p>  The minus of the hotel, some vacationers consider the service.  For some tourists, problems begin already at the settlement stage.  At the reception they provide rooms that do not meet the requirements of the client.  For example, a guest wants a room with a sea view.  But the employee claims that there are no available numbers, and gives out keys to the premises with a view of the service entrance.  And only for an additional fee the client receives the desired room.  However, such cases are quite rare. </p>
