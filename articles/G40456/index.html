    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design of the device received mostly positive reviews: Cubot X15 has an attractive appearance, bright colors, a screen curved on the sides, and high-quality assembly.  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front panel is the display.  Under it are three standard touch buttons, which for some reason do not have a backlight, which can complicate the use of the gadget in the dark.  Above the screen are <span>proximity sensors,</span> light alerts and gesture recognition.  There are also a speaker and a <span>front camera.</span> </p><p>  On the left side of the device there are two metal trays for opening which a special key is required.  One of the trays is designed for a SIM card, the second developers have done a combination: it accepts both SIM cards and memory cards.  So it will not work at the same time to use two SIM cards and a flash card in Cubot X15.  Customer reviews reflect general resentment over this.  We note that the entire frame of the device is made of metal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the right side of the case there is a volume control key, which simultaneously serves as a shutter for the camera, and a power button.  At the bottom there is a micro-USB slot, a grid protecting the external speaker, and a microphone.  The upper part of the smartphone was limited to a 3.5 mm headset jack.  The back cover of the device is plastic, non-removable.  On the back of the model are the main camera and LED flash. </p>

    <p>  The assembly of the smartphone turned out to be good, but there is a backlash of the volume and power buttons.  Also disadvantages include the lack of backlighting on the functional touch keys and the combined card tray. </p><p>  Overall dimensions of the X15 - 76x153x6.9 mm, weight - 181 g. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display is another part of the model that has received mostly positive reviews.  Cubot X15 has a high-quality 5.5-inch screen that supports Full HD resolution.  The display is designed using IPS-matrix and has <span>an oleophobic coating,</span> which is why the finger glides over it very smoothly. </p><p>  The display gives excellent viewing angles so that the information is clearly distinguishable from different angles.  The picture is very bright and attractive.  Multi-touch is designed for 5 simultaneous touches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Speaking of cons, we note that the system slows down a little when scrolling desktops and travels through the smartphone menu.  This is due to the fact that the mediocre processor of the device can not cope with the resolution of Full HD. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The original Cubot X15 is endowed with a main camera with an aperture of F / 2, which has in its asset 15 megapixels, autofocus and LED flash.  The pictures, it must be said, are very solid and high-quality, especially with regard to nearby objects.  In conditions of lack of light and during night shooting, the flash copes well with its work, adequately lighting the shooting area. </p><p>  The front camera has 8 megapixels and very mediocre quality.  It will work, except, perhaps, for posting photos on social networks, since it will not be possible to achieve a truly high-quality image.  Although the front optics received the following reviews from the owners: ‚ÄúCubot X15 is great for selfies.‚Äù </p><p>  The smartphone can shoot videos with a resolution of 1920x1080 at 30 frames / s - the video is very good, but still they are far from high quality. </p><h2>  Cubot X15 system specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone runs on Android 5.1.  The processor is a quad-core <span>MediaTek MT6735</span> operating at a frequency of 1300 MHz.  It is supported by 2 GB of RAM and the Mali-T720 video processor.  To store data, users are allocated 16 GB, which are expandable using microSD memory cards.  Of the interfaces available Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.0, USB and LTE-network. </p>

    <p>  As mentioned earlier, the processor is not able to cope with such a tricked-out display.  A better option would be to install regular HD.  With toys that are demanding on system resources, the filling of the gadget does not work in the best way: the device slows down even at medium graphics settings.  However, we note that the smartphone after 10 minutes of the game practically does not heat up, while the opponents become really hot.  Thanks to this fact, the device got some positive reviews.  Cubot X15 is able to almost instantly search for GPS satellites even after prolonged continuous operation. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The device received a loud and high-quality speaker, to which there are no complaints.  As for playing music through headphones, everything is somewhat worse: the quality is average and does not stand out.  Among the formats, the model recognizes MP3, AAC and WMA.  For lovers of radio in the arsenal of the gadget has an FM-receiver. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device is endowed with a lithium-ion battery capacity of 2750 mAh.  The battery turned out not very good: with moderate use, the smartphone will have to be charged almost every day.  And given the fact that the battery cannot be replaced, this drawback affects the popularity of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Features Cubot X15 (5.5), reviews about it present us with a stylish smartphone with a large and high-quality screen, good sound and a fast GPS navigator.  The problem with the device is that it is not balanced: the system characteristics of such a screen clearly do not pull, and the display requires a much more capacious battery.  All these problems could be avoided if the developers set the HD-resolution: both the processor would have dealt with it and the battery would not have ‚Äúburned out‚Äù so quickly, but, wanting to get everything at once, the creators didn‚Äôt release the highest quality product, which costs from 12 650 to 12 990 rub. </p><h2>  Original Cubot X15: Owner Reviews </h2><p>  The appearance of the gadget users met very well.  There is a beautiful stylish design that looks more expensive than its cost, and chic colors.  The disadvantages include a combined slot for a SIM card and flash drive: it is impossible to use two SIM cards and a memory card at once.  It was also noted that the volume and power digs play strongly.  I did not like the screen protection: scratches quickly appear if you use the device without a protective film. </p>

    <p>  From a quality screen rich in bright colors, everyone is thrilled.  People note that the display produces stunning colors, works great and has good viewing angles.  Everyone quickly got used to the large screen size: it‚Äôs quite convenient to use. </p><p>  There are questions regarding the operation of the system to the device.  There have been cases of freezing and crashing applications.  They also complain about some braking during transitions through menu items. </p><p>  The owners were pleasantly surprised by the fact that even during intensive work - the use of games and heavy applications - the device practically does not heat up, it only gets a little warm. </p><p>  Most users criticize the main camera, citing the fact that it does not meet the declared characteristics.  Most liked the front camera: some claim that it removes better than the main one. </p><p>  As for the battery, everything is ambiguous: here, the owners were divided into two camps.  Some criticize a non-removable battery, saying that it has to be charged almost twice a day, and this is with less active use.  Others, on the contrary, praise the device‚Äôs battery, noting that it copes with its duties and holds a charge much longer than the closest competitors of this gadget. </p>
