  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paper Decorations: New Year Quilling</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In anticipation of the holidays, most begin to think about what to present as a souvenir to their loved ones and loved ones.  As everyone knows, gifts are good, but gifts made with one's own hand are much better.  It is believed that in the process of creation they are filled with soul, charged with the <span>energy of the person</span> who makes them. </p><p>  One of the options for needlework, with which you can create a great surprise, is quilling.  This type of paper rolling appeared quite a long time ago in Europe and nowadays it is a solid donkey in the hearts of fans of various types of needlework.  Many wonderful things can be created using <span>the quilling technique:</span> Christmas decorations, cards, decorations for photo albums or frames, and more.  But, of course, most often the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdecorating the surrounding space with paper crafts comes a few months before the New Year.  In this case, New Year's quilling will certainly turn out to be the most suitable occupation, because, as banal snowflakes, one can hardly surprise anyone. </p><p>  Using the paper-rolling technique to create <span>New Year's decor,</span> there is a great chance not only to decorate the home with unique toys and compositions, but to amaze your guests and make them proud of the owner, or even envy him.  Moreover, such crafts will be filled with soul and love, which will then accompany those present all next year. </p><p>  New Year's quilling does not require special expenses: everything that may be needed to perform compositions is now available for sale at a reasonable price in the nearest stationery store.  For professional paper-rolling, of course, a larger number of tools and materials of the highest quality will be required, but if this type of needlework is not supposed to be turned into a permanent hobby, then it‚Äôs time to do with a minimal set.  In any case, it is necessary to have sheets of paper, scissors and glue.  For the most convenient work, a thin awl with a convenient handle and good tweezers are also useful.  And, of course, it is impossible to do without good imagination and good mood. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to create New Year's quilling, it is necessary first of all to make blanks from which the final composition will be collected later.  The detail is incredibly simple.  Firstly, it is necessary to cut a sheet of paper into even strips of a width of about three millimeters.  This can be done manually, but it is best to skip the sheet through the shredder.  Thus, both hands will not get tired, and nerves will remain intact, and much less time will be spent. </p><p>  Next, each strip must be twisted.  First you need to twist it a little with your fingers, so that it is more convenient to continue to work, and then very tightly wind it around the awl.  The tip of the strip should be greased with glue and pressed.  As a result, you should get a kind of roll of paper, working with which in the future, get different shapes. </p><p>  New Year‚Äôs quilling, as well as any other, involves the creation of various decorations using certain torsion techniques.  Among the main forms, one can distinguish a tight and free spiral.  These are the simplest blanks.  More complex, based on them, is, for example, a drop or a petal.  To achieve this kind, you should squeeze a free spiral with one finger on one side.  If you do this action on both sides, you get an eye.  By and large, all possible forms are given by compressing in certain places the simplest blanks.  You can also decorate Christmas balls using the quilling technique, or completely create them.  The main condition for a job well done is perseverance and calm.  But, of course, the result is worth the effort. </p>
