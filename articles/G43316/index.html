One of the best resorts on the peninsula is the small town of Sudak, which is located on the Black Sea.  Unique landscapes and ancient sights, modern hotels and restaurants - what else can you dream of on vacation?  In this article we will talk about the best hotels of Sudak (Crimea), which have flattering reviews of guests. </p><h2>  "Grand Hotel" </h2><p>  The Grand Hotel Complex is located on Mount Fireynoy, 400 meters from the Black Sea coast.  Next to it is one of the most popular places in the city - the water park, where you can have fun with a happy smile on your lips.  In addition, magnificent views of the Sudak Bay, as well as the famous monument of medieval architecture - the Genoese fortress, built by Italians in the XIV century, open from the windows of the institution.  The hotel itself pleases the eye of tourists with an exquisite facade and elaborate interior, distinguished by luxury and wealth.  The complex consists of 2 buildings, including 44 comfortable rooms.  Depending on the season and category of rooms, the cost per day ranges from 2500 to 8000 rubles.  Speaking about the best hotels in Sudak, we can say that here is one of the best price-quality ratios. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels of pike perch" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41781/1331089.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the best storytellers are the tourists themselves, who left comments on the forums.  Summarizing them, we can draw the following conclusions: </p><ul><li>  The clean and spacious rooms have chic views overlooking the water surface and memorable places. </li><li>  The restaurant serves delicious and satisfying food, and the assortment is very wide. </li><li>  The hotel staff is friendly and helpful, which is important. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantages include weak Wi-Fi, the remoteness of the beach, as well as poor access to the buildings, because there is no paved road. </p><p>  There were some minuses, but if you are looking for private hotels in Sudak with excellent rooms and good service, the Grand Hotel will be a great choice. </p><h2>  Villa Fellini </h2><p>  Over its brief history, the villa has earned many prestigious awards, which indicates the high quality of service and the love of guests.  It is located at the foot of Mount Alchak, whose enchanting view makes you admire the landscapes there.  The 4-storey building boasts an original style inherent in French architecture.  The sea coast is 500 meters away, and the Sudak water park is 300 meters. The number of rooms consists of 38 apartments, including 6 luxury ones, full of remarkable elements of decor and chic furniture.  Fellini offers free Wi-Fi, bike rental, a cozy caf√© and a solarium. </p><p>  But what do tourists say about this hotel?  Most are noted by the friendly staff, clean design rooms, excellent quality of services and excellent breakfasts, which pamper guests.  Negative speeches are extremely rare, and even they are rather more like wishes: to build a sports ground, improve the quality of Wi-Fi, and also introduce a buffet system.  Quite a few guests are upset by the distance from the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels of pike perch crimea" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41781/1331085.jpg" width="600"></div>
