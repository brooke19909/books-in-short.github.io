  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Byzantine Empire</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The fall of Byzantium with the capital in Constantinople dates from 1453.  She had a significant influence in various fields: she became the founder of Roman law, the legal system, which is the basis for most countries of the world, the system of higher and school education.  After all, it was the <span>Byzantine Empire that</span> gave the world the first university.  A <span>financial system</span> was created <span>, the</span> existence of which lasted about a thousand years.  The foundations of diplomatic art were also laid precisely in the Byzantine Empire.  Architecture, art ... This is <span>not a complete</span> list of the achievements of the empire, whose existence lasted a thousand one hundred twenty-five years. </p><p>  1203 is the year of the fourth crusade.  At that time, the crusaders already refused to hike on foot, so the Venetians had to carry them on ships, but there was not enough money for this service.  Therefore, the Venetian side suggested that instead of paying, they would take away debts from residents of the city of Zadar (a trading city on the Adriatic Sea).  The Crusaders agreed and fulfilled this condition, but Zadar did not have enough funds so that the Venetians did not have any complaints.  Therefore, on their part, there was a proposal to listen to the opinion of Constantinople, in which at that time there was an atmosphere of strife between uncle and nephew - Isaac and Alexei Angels - for a place on the throne. </p><p>  One of the parties turned to the crusaders, promising a decent amount of money for restoration to the throne.  So, the Crusaders, having previously plundered, took Constantinople.  The Angel failed to fulfill the promise of paying a large sum, since he simply did not have the necessary amount, so the robbery was the answer of the crusaders.  All the shrines of Constantinople were stolen, including the shroud of the Lord, hundreds of tons of coins, the decoration of temples, and works of art.  The Byzantine army could not compete with one of the strongest and most powerful army of the crusaders at that time, and therefore could not prevent the theft. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, in 1204 there was a final rupture of the western and eastern world.  <span>The Byzantine Empire</span> in the eyes of the West is a territory where heretical views and moods reign.  But, despite this, foreign traders did not disdain to take a leading place both in the economy of Byzantium and in its market. </p><p>  What <span>caused the fall of the empire?</span>  The problem that led to the deterioration of the economic situation of Byzantium was the loss of state control over money and the <span>outflow of capital</span> to the West.  Moreover, over time, a national question arose that could not pass unnoticed.  Until that time, representatives of any nation could become both emperors and top government officials.  The main emphasis was on managerial characteristics and business qualities.  But the West was considered a representative of the barbaric and wild world. </p><p>  The wave of nationalism led to a split among the peoples inhabiting Byzantium.  The West did not miss the opportunity to take advantage of the situation and began to convince the Bulgarians and Serbs that the Greeks had been oppressing their identity for many years.  The imposition of these ideas led to several revolutionary movements and a strong recommendation by the West to leave the Serbs and Bulgarians from the empire and join them in the European world.  So, these peoples for many years were under the tough yoke of the Turks. </p><p>  The Byzantine empire, in addition to the already mentioned ones, also acquired another problem - the growth of discontent on the part of distant districts from the capital, whose standard of living was very different from life in Constantinople. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the end of the 13th century, two parties with directly opposing views were formed in Byzantium.  The first called for development, relying solely on their own forces, and to expand the potential of their country, the second - pro-Western - advocated the restructuring of all the institutions of the empire in accordance with the Western model.  Supported by Europe, the pro-Western party triumphed.  As a result, a number of reforms were carried out that led to the complete defenselessness of the empire in front of its enemy - the Ottoman Sultanate. </p><p>  The fall of Constantinople was the result of his last siege by the Turks.  Despite the proposal of the outstanding caster Urgan to create the tools necessary to counter the Turkish onslaught, the emperor could not give anything else but a negative answer.  The treasury of the Byzantine Empire was empty, and wealthy citizens refused to finance this plan.  So, a representative of the scientific world, with the same proposal, turned to the Turkish Sultan Mehmet.  He agreed by providing the necessary funds.  So, thanks to a student of the Byzantine school, the fate of Byzantium was decided. </p><p>  As a result of this event, a pro-Turkish party was added to the Westerners, whose main task was to lead the rule of the capital. </p><p>  On May 29, <span>1453,</span> after a long siege of the city, Turkish forces managed to break through.  Defenders, frightened by the onslaught, fled.  So, the Byzantine emperor was left alone among the opponents.  A stab in the back by one of the representatives of the Turkish side caused the end of the life of Emperor Constantine XI Paleolog. </p><p>  The Byzantine Empire ceased to exist. </p>
