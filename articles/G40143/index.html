Guests love this complex because, if necessary, you can stay here for the night (in a hotel).  In the morning, enjoy a delicious breakfast in the restaurant. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the numerous reviews of vacationers, the hotel is popular.  Guests of the city, and local residents with great pleasure stay in the hotel complex, celebrate weddings and anniversaries here.  After the hotel opened the Bear Corner in Yaroslavl, reviews about the numbers of visitors were very good.  This trend has persisted to the present. </p><p>  In their reviews, hotel guests speak of excellent service.  The polite staff is ready to make any concessions and eliminate all possible problems.  For example, during the rest of the child an allergic reaction to bedding (more precisely, to powder) arose.  This is not the hotel's fault, but at the first request everything was immediately replaced, and the reaction passed.  It is worth saying that all the linen was clean and ironed. </p><p>  Guests respond positively about their stay at the hotel.  When you first see this building, it becomes a little uneasy.  It looks like Soviet holiday homes for party workers or something like that.  However, the input changes.  Everything is quite new and quite stylish.  Feels the taste.  Standard reception desk with several hours displaying time in different parts of the world.  And very friendly staff.  Young girls are dressed in formal suits (identical), they explain everything in detail.  Registration did not take much time.  The corridors are very spacious.  For those who carry more than one suitcase with them, it‚Äôs very convenient.  The room is also comfortable.  All the standard amenities are there.  In the cabinet you can find several hangers for outerwear, as well as shelves for things (most likely for those who are going to stay here more than a day).  Spacious bed with two sconces and small bedside tables.  Opposite there is a TV stand and a fridge.  The bathroom has soap and shampoo, as well as shower gel (enough for the first time). </p><p>  A big surprise for guests is breakfast.  First, I want to note that the restaurant at the hotel is simply gorgeous.  Guests write that they ate several times in the city, but then decided that they could not find better hotel food.  Breakfast is very hearty and varied.  The atmosphere in the restaurant sets in a positive mood.  Rest in Yaroslavl will be remembered only on the positive side, if you choose for yourself comfortable living conditions. </p><p>  After long walks around the city and sightseeing, I want to relax in peace and quiet.  This will help the Yaroslavl hotel "Bear Corner". </p><p>  Guests in their reviews express gratitude for the impressions received.  Many consider it a big plus that the hotel is not on a noisy street.  This helps to relax before the tour and gain strength.  However, it is worth adding that next to the hotel there is everything you need (shops, shopping centers, train station, public transport stops).  Hotel "Bear Corner" in Yaroslavl (ka get, see above) is one of the most popular and received a high mark on the quality of service from visitors. </p><p>  Some guests found minor flaws in the hotel.  In their reviews, they say that the hairdryer in the bathroom is completely low-power.  It is hard for them to dry their long hair.  As for the plumbing, it requires updating in some rooms.  The water in the shower should ‚Äúrun away‚Äù a little before it becomes warm.  The Internet is intermittent and sometimes at a very low speed.  Most likely, this is due to network congestion with a large number of visitors.  Overall, the hotel is good.  The value for money is excellent. </p><p>  Guests in the reviews say that the staff promptly added everything necessary for a third person to stay in the room (bathrobe, slippers, soap, towels, cups, glasses).  Liked the breakfasts and friendly staff.  Guests write that they will advise this place to their friends. </p>
