For some residents, the phrase "factory museum" can cause boredom, but believe me, this is a unique place.  Visitors can see expositions that are dedicated to the history and finished products of the legendary Izh factory. </p><p>  The museum, by the way, can boast of its ancient origin, because it appeared back in 1847 thanks to the order of Emperor Nicholas I. </p><h2>  What to see in the museum? </h2>

    <p>  At the moment, the Izhmash Museum is ready to demonstrate to visitors a huge collection of unique samples of military weapons that the arms factory produced at different times in its history.  Visitors can find here even the most modern small arms models, which are recognized as the best in the world. </p><p>  Also, the Izhmash Museum has collected all the information about the outstanding workers of the plant, about the history of the plant and the city of Izhevsk, as well as other cities throughout Russia.  For the long one and a half-century existence of the museum at the factory, its managers managed to assemble a large and unique collection of exhibits.  Such a legacy for future generations is largely due to local residents, workers of the Izh plant and other enterprises of the big city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Exterior of the most famous museum in Izhevsk </h2><p>  The Izhmash Museum is located in the oldest building of the city - the former cash pantry.

    <p>  At the end of the 18th century, instead of an old building, there was a pantry built of wood.  The factory treasury was kept in it.  10 years after the demolition, a reliable stone building was erected, which stood up to our time.  No wonder, because the walls were laid with a thickness of one and a half meters. </p><p>  After about half a century, the architect I. Kokovikhin made a radical reconstruction of the building, rebuilding the storage room and turning it into a guardhouse.  A guardroom, an officer dormitory and a small courtyard for prisoners' walks were added to it.  Money stocks had to be transported to another building at the plant. </p><p>  In the XX century, before the start of World War II, the future director of the plant A. Bykhovsky remade the status of the building where the museum is now located into a cash pantry.  But when the war began, all the money was transferred to the deep rear of the country, and only a few decades later, already in 1975, through the efforts of the director of the <span>Izhevsk plant</span> I. Beloborodov, the building was restored after the bombing and again made the famous museum, which opened its doors for our compatriots. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the moment, A. A. Azovsky, who is the director of the cultural institution, runs the museum. </p><h2>  Plan of the Izhmash Museum </h2><p>  The museum is divided into four spacious halls.  Each of them exhibits thematic samples of exhibits. </p>

    <p>  In the first room, visitors can get acquainted with heavy weapons: cannons, machine guns, heavy guns that can penetrate even the most durable armor.  The museum also has the famous Maxim machine gun. </p><p>  Room No. 2 is completely devoted to firearms, mainly carbines and rifles, assembled from 1808 to 1947.  For connoisseurs of Russian weapons, the Mosin‚Äôs three-line rifle, which has survived to this day in perfect condition, is especially awesome.  In addition, sporting and hunting rifles, edged weapons (figured sabers, broadswords, hatchets) made by experienced skilled craftsmen at the beginning of the 19th century are on display.  Also in the hall there was a high-speed air gun.  Do not forget about the visiting card of the Izhmash plant - a machine for turning and screw-cutting. </p><p>  In total, in both rooms there are more than 50 types of weapons. </p><h2>  Kalashnikov Hall </h2><p>  Most of the territory in room number 3 in the Izhmash Museum is occupied by the inventions of the outstanding designer M.T. Kalashnikov.  The administration has collected a rich collection of books written by the designer, his various souvenirs and gifts, as well as working documentation. </p><p>  At the stands with weapons presented samples created by Kalashnikov: machine guns, machine guns, rifles for precision shooting.  In addition, modern modifications of the Kalashnikov assault rifle for civilians (Saiga carbine) are presented in the museum hall. </p><h2>  Motorcycle Hall </h2>

    <p>  The museum is famous not only for weapons, but also for military and civilian equipment.  In the last, fourth in a row, a collection of motorcycles of the Izh brand was assembled, including a genuine example of the Izh motorcycle number 1, which was first assembled in 1928. </p><p>  In 2007, when the Izhmash Museum was restored, thanks to some changes in design, this new hall was created for motorcycle equipment.  In total there are 20 motorcycles of various models. </p><p>  By the way, in 1967, the plant began to produce IZH-Moskvich-412 sedans.  They were similar to cars that were put on the conveyor of the Moscow plant for the production of small cars (MZMA), and were very popular.  It was even believed that Izh-Moskvich had a better build. </p><h2>  Museum Location </h2>
