By Easter you need to start preparing in advance, you will need to work hard on the interior of your home. </p><p>  Easter home decor is very important.  Winter is leaving, spring is coming, so much in the interior is changing.  First you need to work on the balcony of the house, and think about <span>decorating the windows.</span> </p><h2>  Curtains </h2><p>  One of the important elements in the decor of any room are curtains.  They are designed not only to decorate the room and windows, but also to protect the space from direct sunlight.  This is especially true in spring and summer.  Easter decoration means that you need to remove the old curtains from heavy winter materials and hang new ones from lighter ones.  Now many different materials for curtains are produced - they have dirt-repellent impregnation, are treated with a composition that prevents the material from burning out in the sun.  Most suitable linen with the addition of synthetics.  Organza or transparent tulle is also suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter decoration" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/728011.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  Easter home decor needs to be created using curtains.  Before Easter, garlands made from green branches and artificial flowers can be hung on the curtains.  You can add fresh flowers, but they will last for two or three days.  Often by Easter they create hares from cardboard and decorate them with colored paper.  Hares are attached to the curtains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Easter interior decoration includes glass painting.  On the glasses you can draw <span>flowers in watercolor,</span> or you can make them out of <span>self-adhesive film.</span>  Colored paper is also used to create window decorations. </p><h2>  Flowers for Easter </h2><p>  Easter flower arrangements are a common occurrence.  Often used daffodils, which grow in flowerpots or in baskets.  Daffodil can be grown from bulbs. </p><p>  Willow is a tree whose branches are often used for Easter.  From its branches weave wreaths that are decorated with flowers.  You can put in a vase a bouquet of willow twigs.  It is durable, it can stand on your window for a year. </p>

    <p>  Tulips for Easter will be an excellent decoration, especially if you put them in a vase on the window.  Also at this time of year lilac already appears, which can be of different shades. </p><h2>  Tree </h2><p>  <span>Easter</span> home <span>compositions</span> typically include an Easter tree.  His story begins in the Middle Ages.  So, in Western Europe on Easter trees are decorated on the street, generously decorate the interior of the room with twigs. </p><p>  Russian society also had similar traditions before.  Easter trees were transported in carts, they were placed in the main city squares in front of Palm Sunday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is not difficult to make such a tree yourself; it will help to create an Easter decoration in your home in European style.  You need to take a small bucket or pot, put polystyrene there.  A wire is stuck into it, which is then decorated with flowers and leaves.  You can use willow twigs for these purposes. </p><p>  The main European tradition is Easter eggs, which are hung on a tree with laces.  Previously, a hole is made in the <span>raw egg</span> through which all contents are pumped out.  Then the egg is decorated, and a thread is attached to it, for which it is then suspended.  You can make knitted eggs, you can braid them with beads. </p><p>  To decorate the Easter tree, figures of birds and butterflies carved from cardboard are used.  Often on such a tree hang candies and gingerbread cookies. </p><h2>  Easter candles </h2><p>  It is hard to imagine an Easter decoration without a candle.  This invention has been very widely used since the 19th century, when paraffin was invented from which candles are made. </p><p>  In order to make an <span>Easter candle,</span> ordinary household candles are also suitable.  But it is best to make them from beeswax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter compositions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/728012.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The easiest way to make dummy candles, for them you will need first the material for the wick.  You can take a household cotton cord, you can connect 5-6 white bobbin threads.  The resulting threads are wound on a frame, it is made either from a welded reinforcing mesh, or from the halves of an ordinary pencil. </p><h2>  Candle making </h2><p>  So, we make candles to decorate our Easter decoupage.  For this, the wick needs to be dipped in molten wax, and the wax must be painted red.  This is done using lipstick.  You can buy cheap lipstick, drop it in a tub with molten wax, so that it takes the right color.  You can use <span>aniline dye,</span> as well as paint for eggs. </p><p>  And now, Easter decoupage will be ready soon.  The candle needs to be grown.  To do this, take the finished wick, cool it, and dip into the molten mass.  We do this several times, then for cooling we take out the finished candle to the balcony.  You can also roll the resulting candle on something even, so that its sides are beautiful. </p><p>  If you want to use the candles received in the temple, you will need to consecrate them.  And if you just want to put them at home for Easter, then sanctification is not necessary. </p><h2>  Easter chick </h2><p>  To decorate the house for Easter, you can make a cute chicken.  He will meet the guests. </p><p>  For its manufacture you will need: a ball of yellow threads, a ball of orange, a wire from which you will make paws, a piece of padding polyester for filling, a piece of felt or leather. </p><p>  First, you crochet a ring of three or four air loops, while you need to take the thread in two additions.  Then the ring is tied with double crochet.  When the part is ready, you pull it together and fill it with a padding polyester. </p><p>  Chicken legs are twisted from wire.  Well, if the wire is rough for them - it will come in handy.  On the legs we wrap sewing threads in orange.  We fasten the head and body to each other, knit a cone of orange threads and make a beak.  To make the wings, we knit a chain of air loops and tie them with 5 rows of double crochets.  For the tail, we tie a chain of air loops with 10 double crochets. </p><p>  As an eye we use ordinary white buttons, we sew cilia from black felt to them.  We attach black sequins to the buttons, which will be the pupils.  So our Easter chick is ready. </p><h2>  Easter chicken </h2><p>  Crafts for Easter can be very diverse.  They can not only be knitted, they can be sewn.  Easter chicken can be sewn on a sewing machine. </p><p>  First, make a chicken pattern on cardboard.  Then take a small piece of chintz, make figures out of it on the model of a cardboard pattern.  Then we fold the two figures with the front side to the front side, sew them on the machine, while leaving a hole so that this chicken can be turned out and the packing added inside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter chicken" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/728017.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We turn it out, fill the carcass with soft cotton wool, draw eyes with a black pencil.  The beak can be made of plastic parts of the corresponding color.  Scallop and wings for chicken can be made of felt, and we glue them to the carcass with glue ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù. </p><p>  In order to perch, we take a stick, wrap decorative twine on it, sew our chicken to it.  Then such a chicken can be planted on the windowsill in the house or hung under the ceiling. </p><h2>  Easter wreath </h2><p>  The Easter decoration includes various elements, but the main one is the eggs, which symbolize the victory of life over death.  Their frame can be considered an Easter wreath. </p><p>  Such a wreath can be bought at the store, or you can cook it yourself.  To do this, you will need 3-4 glasses of flour, a glass of warm milk, three eggs, three tablespoons of sugar.  You will need a teaspoon of yeast, one hundred grams of margarine, one hundred grams of raisins.  You can also take powdered sugar and water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter decoration" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/728019.jpg" width="556"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So, milk and melted margarine are poured into the flour.  Eggs need to be loosened and added there, pour sugar.  Mix everything with flour, as well as sugar and yeast. </p><p>  Knead the dough.  Put it in a warm place so that it fits.  It is necessary that it increase in size by about two to two and a half times. </p><p>  Divide the dough then into three parts, make long bundles of them.  Weave them together, make a ring.  Leave to stand. </p><p>  Gradually, the ring will increase in size, and then it needs to be greased with a beaten egg.  Then the Easter wreath is baked at a temperature of 200 degrees. </p><p>  When your braid is ready, you can cover it with icing on top and put a boiled egg painted in red in the middle.  Such edible decoration will symbolize Easter in your home. </p><h2>  Easter eggs </h2><p>  The egg is the central symbol of Easter.  Variously decorated <span>Easter eggs</span> are considered the main attribute of the festive table for Easter and decoration of the home interior. </p><p>  Easter decoration is often made using eggs, but remember that before painting, they need to be washed and preferably wiped with vinegar.  If you want the eggs to have a shiny surface, they must be greased with sunflower oil. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="easter home decor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/728006.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <p>  You can paint eggs with either natural dyes or special synthetic products that are sold in stores.  Nothing else is used.  For painting use onion husks, beet juice, turmeric, infusion of black tea.  If you want a picture on the eggs, then you need to use plant leaves to get it, you can use bank gum for money.  In this case, you get a kind of drawing. </p><p>  You can try to achieve the effect of "marble eggs", in which case the eggs are dyed with dye, to which a tablespoon of vegetable oil is added. </p><h2>  Original decoration for eggs </h2><p>  Masters like to decorate chicken eggs with beads; an original work of art is obtained.  In this case, the boiled egg must be dipped in melted paraffin, and then glue the beads one at a time.  You can also crochet eggs, paste over with different colored materials, and paint with felt-tip pen.  Also, Easter eggs are pasted over with pieces of fabric.  For this, chintz, chiffon, satin, organza and so on are used. </p>
