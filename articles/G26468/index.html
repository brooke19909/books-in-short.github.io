    <p>  The apple orchard stretches along the Volkovka River.  The green massif is located on the street.  Belgrade and at its intersection with the street.  Turku (Address: 192212, Russia, 16 Belgradskaya St., St. Petersburg).  The garden has a shape stretching from north to south for approximately 800 meters.  Its width is 250 m, area - 15 hectares. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  In the pre-war years, the garden was located on the territory of the Udarnik state farm.  In the late 1960s, the territory was ennobled: benches were installed, paths laid.  In the 50-70s, the state farm was liquidated, as a result of which the garden became ownerless and became desolate.  In 1972, the site was given over to the district gardening organization.  Then, for 20 years, no one took up the park seriously. </p>

    <p>  For a long time in the northern part of the garden there was severe bogging.  After the reclamation work, the trees in this place still did not grow.  In 2000, a significant part of the garden was allocated for construction, but in the future it was assumed that its entire territory could be built up.  After the decision to restore this object was made by the government of St. Petersburg in 2007, the Apple Orchard began its revival. </p><p>  In 2008, it was reconstructed.  A pond was dug in the northern part, new paths were laid throughout the territory, new benches were placed, squares were destroyed.  In the southern part of the garden, loose hills were created. </p>

    <p>  At any time of the year, the Apple orchard, which has many trees, both from the time of the state farm and newly planted, is very popular among the townspeople.  Today, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe garden is about 15 hectares.  About 650 fruit trees have been planted here, including many plums, pears, and apple trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bloom </h2><p>  Especially beautiful is the apple orchard (St. Petersburg, Frunze district) in spring, during flowering.  It is impossible to give an exact answer to the question of when exactly the garden blooms, since this largely depends on weather conditions.  And yet it is known that in 2012 the Apple Orchard (St. Petersburg, Frunze District) bloomed by May 16-18, in 2014 - at about the same time, in 2016 several trees bloomed by May 9, and on the 13th the whole plot has already bloomed.  This year, according to reviews, the flowering of the Apple Garden began quite early, giving vacationers the opportunity to enjoy the view and aroma of the magnificent flowering of fruit trees throughout May. </p>

    <p>  I must say that from early spring vacationers are in a hurry to see this beautiful natural show - verdant and then blooming Apple Orchard (St. Petersburg, Frunze district).  Everyone who wants to come here should be prepared for the fact that at this time the aroma of flowering trees is often mixed with the smell of fresh barbecue. </p><p>  Thousands of onion tulips plant annually with green workers, which, after a boring black and white winter landscape, the park area is painted in bright spring colors.  But even before human intervention, dandelions bloom on all the lawns, which merge into a cheerful yellow-green landscape. </p><h2>  Landscaping, conditions for a comfortable stay </h2><p>  The garden pays great attention to beautification.  Not only along the central, but also along parallel avenues beautiful lampposts are installed.  In several places at the disposal of vacationers are mobile stalls selling ice cream.  In addition, the garden has many paths that can be attributed to several types - asphalt, paving, paved, as well as sprinkled with granite chips.  Comfortable landscaped garden paths are used for riding scooters, rollers, children and adult bicycles.  In addition, mothers like to walk here with strollers. </p>

    <p>  The garden provides facilities for extreme cycling enthusiasts.  Extreme sportsmen can take advantage of three large slides up to 6-8 m high and one small - up to <span>2-3 m.</span> The tracks on these slides are not covered, so after rain there is even greater expanse for risk lovers. </p><p>  Some people like to ride bicycles from the hill, while others like roller skating.  The smallest kids can jump on an inflatable trampoline or play enough in a children's town, while their parents relax on benches, in the shade of apple trees.  But recently, not only on trampolines you can jump to kids, but also ride a carousel. </p>

    <p>  One of the central places in the Apple Garden is reserved for the arrangement of a pond with a bridge.  Visitors to the garden will never refuse to walk across the bridge and admire the water surface of the pond.  Many stop to take a photo.  The bridge connects parts of the garden.  Its solidity and strength were appreciated by the newlyweds, as evidenced by the huge number of various symbolic castles they left behind on the railing.  The apple orchard is a popular place visited by newlyweds in the area on wedding days, especially in the spring during the flowering of trees, and in the summer, when the path to the bridge is generously decorated with bright flowers, and you can make beautiful wedding photos. </p><h2>  Facilities </h2><p>  You can get to the garden both by personal transport and by city.  Parking along the street  Belgrade is not prohibited, so you can leave the car near the garden and continue to walk or ride on an environmentally friendly vehicle brought with you and healthy.  There is a covered bus <span>stop at the public transport</span> stop, and a paid toilet is nearby. </p>
