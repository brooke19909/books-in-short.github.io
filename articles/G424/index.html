In the past few years, they have become even more famous thanks to the 2014 Winter Olympics, during the preparation for which hundreds of tourist, entertainment and sports facilities were built in the city and its environs.  They transformed the look of Sochi, but the prices in many new hotels make them inaccessible to those who can not afford the big spending on vacation.  Fortunately, in some areas of the resort today you can settle for a little money.  These include the suburb of Sochi, Mamaica, where families with children of any age will especially enjoy a vacation. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Mamaica is a small neighborhood in the north of the Central <span>District of Sochi.</span>  It is located on the Black Sea, at the confluence of the Psache River.  In the north, Mamaika is separated from the Lazarevsky district of Sochi by a small pass, and in the south it borders on a vast green zone.  Its distinctive feature is the combination of the functions of the sleeping and resort microdistricts, since there are many private houses and the active construction of new buildings is ongoing.  Thus, in a few years, the renovated multi-story Mamaica will be at the service of holidaymakers.  Hotels in the suburbs are also being modernized and new ones are being built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, Mamaika (Sochi), the reviews of which are presented below, has a convenient location, as it is 40 km from <span>Adler Airport</span> and 10 km from Sochi Train Station.  From the microdistrict, it is easy to get to neighboring resorts, using city buses, following mainly in the direction of Dagomys. </p>

    <h2>  Mamaica area for tourists </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of those who have already spent their holidays in this quiet suburb of Sochi, it has several important advantages.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  remoteness from noisy highways; </li><li>  pleasant subtropical climate (air temperature during the summer season +25, and water +24 degrees), which makes this region of <span>Sochi a good place</span> for people with cardiovascular problems and babies; </li><li>  proximity to the sea, the distance to which from any corner of Mamaica is about 1 km; </li><li>  favorable environmental situation. </li></ul><p>  The reviews also note that if we consider the Central District of Sochi from the point of view of the possibility of organizing an inexpensive and relaxing holiday with children, the Mamaika microdistrict will also be the best choice.  This suburb is also loved by people of respectable age who avoid neighborhood with noisy youth companies.  They are advised to come there in early September, when the beaches are relatively free, as the number of families with children is sharply reduced due to the completion of school holidays. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, although Mamaika does not have its own developed entertainment infrastructure, all such facilities, including the most famous, are only 20 minutes away by public transport. </p>

    <h2>  Holiday Options </h2><p>  Those who decide to choose Mamaica as their vacation destination will have no problems with accommodation.  First of all, judging by the reviews, there you can find budget offers of housing in the private sector.  Basically, they are rather comfortable rooms in small 1-2-storey houses with gardens and green courtyards, which Mamaica is famous for.  There is also the opportunity to rent a small cottage, but this option will cost a lot, especially when it comes to a new or recently renovated building with all the amenities. </p><p>  Hotels in this suburb of Greater Sochi are also good, and most importantly, inexpensive.  You can relax in the local resorts.  There, guests will also be offered various effective medical and balneotherapy procedures.  There is also a small campsite in Mamaica, which is especially popular with young people. </p>

    <h2>  Sanatoriums </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Mamaika (Sochi), whose reviews are mostly positive, can be a good place to relax for those who want to improve their health.  At their service are the sanatoriums "Stavropol" and "Fazatron."  In the first of them, located 500 m from the beach, there is also an indoor pool, operating in the off-season.  Even closer to the sea, 200 meters away are the buildings of the year-round sanatorium "Fazatron" (formerly "Dawns of Russia").  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, they remain extremely pleased with such medical procedures as taking radon and hydrogen sulfide baths with Matsesta waters, inhalations, microwave resonance and acupuncture, various types of massage, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Camping </h2><p>  Just 100 meters from the beach of the sanatorium "Stavropol" is the campsite "Mamaika", where you can relax on a budget in Spartan conditions, which are unlikely to scare students and other active youth.  The campsite has a caf√© located near the water's edge, a bar, a daily disco and a guarded parking lot. </p>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  City hotels are small and quite comfortable.  Sometimes they have an outdoor pool for those who want to swim and sunbathe at any convenient time, without the need to experience inconvenience from the crowds on the beach.  Among the most famous hotels are the ‚ÄúStarfish‚Äù, which is distinguished by its original architecture, and the six-story guest house ‚ÄúMamaika‚Äù, located at ul.  Crimean, 79/1.  They have fenced areas, their own cafes with almost home-style cuisine, and they offer rooms of various comfort classes. </p><p>  Whichever hotel or guest house you choose (Mamaika, Elite House, etc.) you will have to pay less than for options in more fashionable areas of Sochi. </p><h2>  Mamaica beaches </h2><p>  For many years, visitors who have chosen the central district of Sochi for vacation complain of congestion in the beaches.  It should be understood that during the peak of the holiday season this situation is inevitable and characteristic of any popular resort in the world.  This applies to the beaches of Mamaica, among which there are both departmental and municipal. </p><p>  The main one is the small pebble "Little Mermaid" with a length of more than 100 m and a width of 30 meters.  This beach has a gentle descent into the water and there is no difference in depths, so it is well suited for families with children.  Moreover, the Sochi authorities took care of the little vacationers by equipping them with a children's playground.  On the beach there are also sun loungers, awnings, sun loungers, showers and changing cabins.  You can rent catamarans, scooters, boats and yachts.  It offers vacationers - numerous <span>cafes, canteens</span> and restaurants. </p><p>  Another municipal beach - "Swallow" - 3 times longer and has more than 50 meters in width.  According to reviews, swimming there is quite comfortable due to the presence of a rather long breakwater.  The beach is equipped with everything necessary and offers the same set of entertainment as the Little Mermaid. </p><p>  In addition, most resorts and boarding houses have their own fenced areas near the sea line for the rest of their guests.  On such beaches are usually aqua complexes with slides and a variety of entertainment. </p>

    <h2>  Sights and excursions </h2><p>  What else can please Mamaika (Sochi)?  Reviews indicate that tourists will not be bored.  For example, they will be able to explore the ruins of the ancient Mamai-Kale fortress located nearby, at the mouth of the Pshe River.  Scientists believe that it was founded to protect the trading Roman, and later Byzantine trading post, and existed during the 1st-4th centuries of our era, that is, it is a fortification that has survived to our days for at least 1600 years! </p><p>  In addition, guests of the resort can visit the Orthodox Church of the Great Martyr Panteleimon, which opened its doors to believers in 2001.  Although the temple building is a remake, today it is one of Mamaica's recognizable architectural decorations. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  One of the advantages of a vacation in Mamaica in the private sector is the ability to eat at home, especially since there are several supermarkets, many small grocery stores and a market where you can always buy fresh vegetables and fruits.  In addition, there are cafes and restaurants of different price categories and consumer services. </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Every man to his own taste.  Without exception, Mamaika (Sochi) cannot like everyone.  Reviews of dissatisfied vacationers indicate its disadvantages such as traffic jams at certain hours of the day, which prevent it from quickly getting to the desired area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreater Sochi.  You can also hear complaints about the lack of nighttime lighting on some streets in the private sector of the suburb, which makes it difficult to return to your guesthouse after attending entertainment events. </p><p>  Now you know where Mamaica is.  Sochi (reviews about this resort are very different) is characterized by a variety of options for the proposed vacation.  If you just want to enjoy the gentle sea, see famous Olympic venues and not go broke, then feel free to choose Mamaica and get great pleasure for little money! </p>
