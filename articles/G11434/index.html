The apartments in it belong to the economy class, which in no way detracts from their quality.  True, unfortunately, the start of construction work coincided with the onset of the economic crisis, which affected many, including the real estate market.  Many objects were completely frozen.  But not LCD Nevskaya Zvezda.  The developer, the IPS company, well-known to many, has adequately emerged from the current situation.  The deadlines for the completion of the facilities, however, had to be reviewed, however, work on the sites did not stop for a minute. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neva star" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the company </h2><p>  Construction work is carried out by the IPS company.  Neva Star is far from its first project of such a plan.  The developer enjoys well-deserved respect in the market and is famous for his excellent reputation.  In addition, it works in a very interesting format.  All procedures are completely carried out by the developer independently - starting from the project creation process and ending directly with the construction and installation works.  The company does not involve third-party organizations in its activities, and therefore, it always hand over the objects on time and without any imperfections. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The concern takes a very responsible approach to its activities, trying to offer St. Petersburg residents the most favorable prices for apartments, while making every effort to ensure that the quality of housing does not suffer.  All work is carried out using the latest technologies in the field of construction and using only the best materials. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Neva Star" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  LCD "Nevskaya Zvezda" (St. Petersburg), as already mentioned, is a complex development.  It will be a whole microdistrict equipped with its own facilities of all necessary infrastructure - both social and shopping and entertainment.  It is planned to commission five houses of different storeys, consisting of several sections.  The construction is carried out according to a mixed technology - frame-monolithic with partial use of gas silicate blocks.  In parallel with the houses, infrastructure facilities as well as two parking lots are being built.  At the end of construction, it will be a full-fledged town, the inhabitants of which will be able to enjoy all the benefits of civilization without leaving the microdistrict. </p><p>  Already today you can buy apartments in the residential complex "Nevskaya Zvezda".  Stage 1 was commissioned at the beginning of 2016, at this stage work is underway on the construction of buildings of the second and third stage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ips Neva Star" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288204.jpg" width="600"></div>

As already mentioned, work began in the midst of a severe crisis.  In this regard (and not at all due to the fault of the builder), the deadlines had to be postponed from the end of 2014 to the beginning of 2016.  What provoked a lot of different rumors about the residential complex "Nevskaya Zvezda".  Reviews and interest holders, and those who considered the complex as an option for buying a home, were very negative at that moment.  Nevertheless, the company survived, and today you can buy in the complex any apartment of 404 put up for sale in the first stage. </p><p>  At this stage, the construction of houses of the second and third stage is underway.  All work is carried out in strict accordance with the schedule, no delays are observed, so, according to experts, the deadlines will be met.  A three-sectional house with 20 floors will be commissioned in early 2017.  Already today you can buy any of the 342 apartments offered on the basis of equity participation in the house of the second stage of the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex.  Stage 3, the construction of which is also at an active pace, will be commissioned in 2019. </p><p>  The IPS developer provides everyone with complete information on the construction progress and allows equity holders and potential buyers to visit their construction sites.  So everyone can find the residential complex "Nevskaya Zvezda" at the address: st.  Grandmother  61. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neva star 3 turn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288207.jpg"></div>

There are no industrial enterprises here, in addition, it borders on a suburban area, and therefore there are forests and a river nearby.  In addition, in order to improve the environmental situation, the developer plans to carry out mass work on landscaping the territories of the microdistrict. </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  The multi-apartment complex is located in close proximity to the Proletarskaya metro station, which is a definite plus in living conditions in the metropolis.  In addition to the metro, residents of the LCD can use the services of buses and minibuses, the stop of which is located next to the houses.  On <span>Obukhovskaya Defense</span> Avenue <span>,</span> you can get to the city center (assuming there is no traffic jam, the journey will take no more than ten minutes by car), in addition, there are two exits to the roundabout two minutes from the complex, which makes it convenient to go to the Leningrad Region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neva star reviews" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288206.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Nevsky district has its own, long-established infrastructure, in connection with which all residents of the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex will not experience a shortage in the services of its facilities.  There are three schools near the complex, and one of them has a correctional focus.  There are also several d / s here.  Not far from the complex are located the Zvezda stadium and a large fitness center, which will surely appeal to all fans of a healthy lifestyle.  Near the metro station there are three large supermarkets, there is also a large shopping and entertainment center.  Enough in the area and bars and restaurants. </p><p>  In addition, as already mentioned, the developer is going to erect a school building next to the complex, as well as a d / s.  In all houses, except the first, the premises of the first two floors are arranged for commercial real estate, so that after putting the objects into operation, they will house shops, pharmacies, household institutions, and bank offices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neva star builder" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288208.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Flats </h2><p>  "Nevskaya Zvezda" refers to economy class real estate, in connection with which houses are offered housing in relatively small areas.  A lot of studio apartments and "odnushki".  So, for example, in the second house there will be 37 and 42%, respectively.  However, there are two- and three-room living quarters.  As for the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments, it ranges from 30 to 75.5 square meters. </p><p>  Layouts of apartments are carefully thought out.  Experts have done everything possible to use every useful meter.  All residential premises, regardless of format, are equipped with balconies.  As for the bathrooms, in the studios and some one-room apartments they are combined, while in the rest of the living quarters they are separate.  The kitchens are large enough, in the hallways there are niches for arranging a dressing room or installing a spacious wardrobe. </p><p>  The company's specialists worked hard and provided the buyer with a choice of several design solutions for apartments of each format.  So that everyone can choose something suitable for themselves. </p><p>  The height of the ceilings is 2 m 60 cm. All residential premises are for rent with a <span>fine finish.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neva star 1 turn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1288210.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Finish </h2><p>  The developer rightly decided that the residents did not need to bother with repairs, and therefore offers apartments with a fine finish.  In principle, the decision is correct, especially since the company ‚ÄúIPS‚Äù, trying to provide the buyer with a product of ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù value, did everything possible so that the finishing work did not particularly affect the prices. </p><p>  So, what will the new settlers get?  All failed and connected communications, water, electricity and gas meters, metal entrance and veneered interior doors, two-chamber double-glazed windows in window openings.  Linoleum is laid on the floors, the ceilings are painted with water-based paint, on the walls - wallpaper.  All plumbing equipment is also available;  the walls of bathrooms, toilets and kitchens are tiled with ceramic tiles.  All loggias are glazed using the innovative Vanguard system.  Not so little for the economy class, agree.  In general, not very capricious apartment owners can move in and immediately call friends for a housewarming party. </p><h2>  Cost of housing </h2><p>  As has been mentioned more than once, the apartments, offered by the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex, are positioned by the developer as economy class housing.  In this regard, its cost is quite affordable.  So, for a studio of 30 "squares" you will have to pay an average of about two and a half million.  "Odnushka" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 37 square meters.  m will cost the buyer three million rubles, ‚Äúdvushka‚Äù (about 60 ‚Äúsquares‚Äù) four and a half million rubles, ‚Äútreshka‚Äù - from five and a half to six and a half million.  The average cost of a ‚Äúsquare‚Äù is from 75 to 85 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do those who already bought apartments in it, as well as those who are only considering options for their acquisition, say about the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex?  For the most part, people respond both to the builder and to the housing built by him mostly positively.  The passions that were seething in those days when it was announced that the construction deadlines were postponed have calmed down, today everything is going according to plan, so there is nothing to argue and discuss in this aspect.  If anyone finds any shortcomings in his new home, the developer immediately eliminates them.  Some are not quite happy with the finish.  And not by its quality, but by the color of the doors or the wallpaper pattern.  Firstly, this business is fixable, over time, you can arrange everything to your liking.  And secondly, as opponents say, today it‚Äôs possible to make repairs of such a plan on their own, even more modestly, it will cost an amount that will significantly exceed one million rubles.  So the claims, in fact, to bring at all to nothing.  Almost everyone calls the cost of housing standard, so apartment prices are not overpriced. </p><p>  People also like the fact that there are a lot of necessary infrastructure facilities near the house, however, some believe that clinics are far away.  Everyone is very happy with the layout of the apartments, they consider the designer to be competent and express their gratitude to them for this. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, today everyone is tired of the crisis and the problems associated with it.  Nevertheless, you need to live somewhere.  The real estate market is functioning as it had before the emergence of global problems, developers are trying their best to keep prices in check so that people can buy apartments in the complexes being built by them.  One of these is the Nevskaya Zvezda residential complex.  If you are desperate for your own living space and are currently considering all available options, be sure to include it in your list. </p>
