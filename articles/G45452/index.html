A simple uncomplicated toponym ‚ÄúKrugloe‚Äù has 19 lakes and dozens of villages, villages, towns.  In 18 regions of Russia, from Brest to Chelyabinsk, there are several villages with the same name. </p><h2>  Small fraction of the Volga basin </h2><p>  Krugloye Lake is not always such in the geometric sense, and then it is more difficult to explain the origin of the name.  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLake Moscow Region of the same name also does not very much resemble a circle, rather some part of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="round lake" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/492081.jpg" width="548"></div>  It can be assumed that a reservoir of glacial origin in Dmitrovsky district once corresponded to its name in a form, or Lake Krugloye seemed such to our distant ancestors.  The Moscow Region Laida (wide body of water), which belongs to the Gabovsky rural settlement, is located 28 km from the Moscow Ring Road, and together with the Dolgoye reservoir, which is connected to the channel, belongs to relict lakes.  Eric is called the Meshcherikha River, which belongs to the Oka and Volga water basins.  Its total length is 17 km.

    <h2>  Small rivulet with a great history </h2><p>  It flows into Lake Krugloye, flowing out of it, passes through Krasnaya Polyana.  Further, its path lies through the Dolgoe pond and, bypassing Sheremetyevo Airport from the north, the river flows into Klyazma.  On the way, after the accession of Lobny to it, Meshcherich changes his purely Russian name to ‚ÄúAlba‚Äù.  The history of the 17-kilometer small river is rich in which two factory ponds are also created.  And all these rivulets, flowing mainly to the north, will ultimately give their waters to the Volga, thus joining the great water of European Russia.  Dmitrovsky district of Moscow Region is very rich in water resources - many <span>ponds, lakes,</span> of which Nerskoye is also of glacial origin, and Vvedenskoye and Svinskoe are not.  The rivers flowing through the area are straight, like Dubna, or indirect tributaries of the Volga - Yakhroma and Vela. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Picturesque Moscow Region </h2><p>  Krugloye Lake, surrounded by the Kalinsko-Dmitrov Ridge, belonging to the eponymous hill, is located among picturesque mixed forests, the water in it is not only amazingly clear, but also healing, as it contains radon.
