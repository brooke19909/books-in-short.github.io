    <h2>  History of Rosgosstrakh </h2><p>  The company was established in February 1992 in the form of a joint stock company.  All shares at that time belonged to the state.  On February 10, Decree No. 76 ‚ÄúOn the establishment of a state insurance company‚Äù was issued.  It was assumed that this joint-stock company would become the successor of the State Insurance of the RSFSR, created in 1921.  In 2003, more than 70% of the company's shares were privatized.  Therefore, today the company is no longer fully state-owned.  In 2008, Rosgosstrakh acquired the insurance companies Capital Reinsurance, Capital Life Insurance, and Capital Medical Insurance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In September 2010, the state sold another 13% of the insurance company to private individuals.  Today, 52% of securities are owned by RGS Holding LLC, 21% by RGS ASSETS LIMITED.  The executive director of the insurance company is Danil Khatchaturov. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on the work of the company "Rosgosstrakh" </h2><p>  Throughout its history, the company has truly managed to win the trust of customers.  Many have already managed to receive payments under their contracts.  Some already receive non-state pensions today.  All the most popular insurance programs are offered by Rosgosstrakh.  CASCO customer reviews are as positive as other insurance products.  It is car insurance in the company today that is the most demanded.  Customers note that the contract can be concluded in a matter of minutes (subject to the provision of a full package of documents). </p><p>  The Rosgosstrakh Life program is no less popular.  Customer reviews say that such a deal allows you to feel more confident when traveling abroad.  People traveling abroad can purchase an additional policy that can guarantee high-quality medical care in a foreign country.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to protect yourself from illness even during the holidays.  You can also protect your luggage during flights. </p>
