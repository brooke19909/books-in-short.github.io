    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The advantage of the ski resort "Migovo" is that it is located between the mountains, snow falls here early and lies for a long time.  Natural snow cover does not give such glaciation of the track as artificial snow.  Sometimes the resort uses snow cannons and retracs.  The winter season on the slopes of the mountains begins in December and lasts until April.  The advantage can be called a convenient infrastructure. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and Services </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the ski resort "Migovo" has four hotel complexes, private estates, and recreation centers.  The hotels have rooms of different levels of comfort.  Colorful and memorable will rest in the cottage.  Wooden houses for 6-8 people.  There will be no problems with housing.  Tourists who come to ride and relax in the ski resort "Migovo", the prices will pleasantly surprise you.  For a holiday at the resort acceptable.  So, a standard double room per day costs $ 15-20. </p><p>  Two towing lifts with a length of 1100 and 600 m, two multi-lifts with a length of 150 m will deliver to the highest point of the route. There are several food points.  These are restaurants, cafes, pizzerias.  There is an ice skating platform, which in summer becomes a roller park for roller skate lovers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort prices" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1841501.jpg" width="600"></div>

They have equipment not only for skiers: for hire sledges and snow scooters.  A set of skis, boots and poles will cost you $ 3 per day for hire.  Beginners can hire an instructor, whose services cost from $ 5 per hour. </p><p>  Everything is so thoughtful by the resort's designers and compactly built that moving between hotels, catering, rental and ski lifts is very simple and fast. </p><h2>  Feature of the resort "Migovo" </h2><p>  Each ski resort has its own characteristics.  There is also a highlight in Migovo - these are conversion tracked all-terrain vehicle transporters.  They can deliver tourists to any place in the mountains where vehicles cannot pass.  Two all-terrain vehicles carry out routes to the mountains of the Migovo resort.  The ski resort reviews are only enthusiastic.  It seems to be nothing special on these trips, but what is the climb along a steep slope with a traverse!  Walking is safe, but, as tourists jokingly say, the adrenaline of 12 people (such a capacity of an all-terrain vehicle) is enough to refuel the all-terrain vehicle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="migo ski resort reviews" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1842363.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Newbie Schools </h2><p>  On the basis of the ski resort there is a ski school and a school of snowboarders from the Association of Professional Ski Instructors of Ukraine (APGI).  The instructors at the school are experienced skiers and climbers.  Beginners are trained by the method of APSI.  Both individual and group classes are held. </p><p>  What does the beginner learn and what levels of training?  If the student is diligent, then after a short period of time he will also ride carving skis, and will receive freeride skills, and will hone his ability to ride freshly fallen snow, making his way along it.  The safety of skiing on mountain slopes depends on the culture of skiing, that is, on skill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernivtsi ski resort Migovo" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1842362.jpg" width="600"></div>
