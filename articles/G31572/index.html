  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crafts from garbage bags for the New Year holidays</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Garbage bags are made of polyethylene, and this is an excellent material for a variety of crafts.  The selection of products in the store is large, so you can find the material of the desired color.  <span>Crafts from garbage bags do it yourself</span> in the winter to decorate the premises for the New Year holidays.  This material is light and pleasant to work with, so involve all family members in the manufacture of decor items. </p><p>  In the article, we consider interesting options for snow crafts from garbage bags.  This is a beautiful Christmas tree and a cheerful snowman, original carnival dresses and hats for the holiday, a polar bear is a resident of the cold Arctic.  You will learn how to make a Christmas wreath on a door with your own hands, how it can be decorated and what to take as a basis.  Even novice masters can do such light crafts, so feel free to get to work after reading the article. </p><h2>  greeting card </h2><p>  As a first piece of garbage bags, you can make an original New Year holiday greeting card for a loved one.  Such a picture will look beautiful, only of a larger size, in a frame on the wall. </p><p>  It is best to make a postcard on a dark background so that white polyethylene is clearly visible.  In addition to light packages, buy a few more pieces of a different color for a contrasting snowman scarf.  In our sample, it is green, but you can make it another bright shade, for example, red or purple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowman card" class="if uuid-3097749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3097749.jpg"></div><p>  You can supplement the crafts from garbage bags with an orange pompom from yarn, the snowman‚Äôs eyes are created from black buttons, and his hands imitate tree branches.  It is easy to fill the voids in the picture with paper snowflakes made of paper folded several times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First you need to cut the packages into small square pieces.  Then stick them tightly to the base, spreading PVA glue only in the center.  Sharp edges should stick up.  The more elements are attached to the figure of a snowman, the more beautiful the craft looks. </p><h2>  North bear </h2><p>  It is interesting to make such an easy craft out of garbage bags with preschool children.  This cute bear can simply be presented to loved ones as a gift.  If you cut round holes at eye level and pull a rubber band around the sides, you get a masquerade mask for a matinee in a kindergarten or school. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cabaneaidees.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="polar bear mask" class="if uuid-3097761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3097761.jpg"></div><p>  From a thick white paper, the head of a bear with round ears is cut out according to the pattern.  In the center of the craft, an empty plastic yogurt cup is glued.  A black circle of colored cardboard, cut to size, is reinforced at its bottom.  This will be the character‚Äôs nose. </p><p>  If you make crafts from garbage bags as a postcard, then the eyes are made of cardboard.  If the product will be worn in a carnival in the form of a mask, then eye holes are cut out in advance. </p><p>  Further, the painstaking work of gluing pieces of polyethylene depicting the fluffy hair of a polar bear lies ahead. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Christmas wreath on the door </h2><p>  If you are thinking about what material you can make a magnificent wreath for Christmas or New Year, then pay attention to plastic bags.  It is better to collect the crafts from pieces of blue, white or green, which are strung alternately on a thin wire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imagenesmi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY Christmas wreath" class="if uuid-3097733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3097733.jpg"></div><p>  Between layers insert decorative elements.  The DIY craftwork presented in the photo is decorated with small Christmas balls, which are tied to the base of the wreath for nylon threads. </p><p>  When the required product length is reached, the ends of the wire are twisted together.  You can tie a satin ribbon on top of the wreath to attach the crafts to the door or wall of the room. </p><h2>  Christmas beauty </h2><p>  What a New Year holiday without a Christmas tree?  Families with children try to buy a real pine or spruce smelling of forest by the end of the year.  However, many do not welcome the felling of trees for a week's admiration, replacing it with either artificial or home-made crafts from waste material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nastanova.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a christmas tree from garbage bags" class="if uuid-3098053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3098053.jpg"></div><p>  To make such a fluffy Christmas tree from plastic bags, you need to cut many circles of different diameters.  You will also need a rod on a solid base to hold the craft in an upright position.  It can be a piece of polystyrene and wire or a wooden block.  First, large circles are put on the rod, then smaller elements are placed in descending order.  At the top are the smallest details.  You can leave the tree flat, but the craftsmanship with a curved top looks more spectacular.  It‚Äôs good to fasten a bell with a bow on it or attach a golden foam star. </p><h2>  Fluffy skirt </h2><p>  From long strips of polyethylene it is quite easy to make a fluffy skirt for a carnival costume.  To do this, on any wide elastic band you need to attach a lot of polyethylene tapes folded in half. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="full skirt from packages" class="if uuid-3098126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3098126.jpg"></div><p>  They wrap the base around it and thread the ends in a loop in the center.  The more elements, the more magnificent the crafts will turn out.  You can collect a pack for any suit, choosing the right shade of material. </p><h2>  Cone hats </h2><p>  The cone for the headdress of a magician or parsley is made of thick printed paper.  The main decoration of the craft are pompons.  To make them, you need to cut garbage bags into thin strips and tie them together, creating a long thread.  Then they act similarly to the usual implementation of pompoms from yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="igottacreate.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cone hats with pompons" class="if uuid-3098097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3098097.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, prepare two cardboard rings, the outer diameter of which corresponds to the size of the pompom.  Then the thread is tied through the inner hole and wound many times to achieve greater splendor.  At the end, push the strips apart and push the scissors to cut all the threads in a circle.  Between the rings, a kapron thread is inserted and all the elements of the pompom are firmly tightened together.  Now you can take out the cardboard templates and discard.  Attach the crafts to the hat with a stapler. </p><p>  In the article, we examined crafts from garbage packages.  In winter, from polyethylene, you can create many original toys, Christmas tree decorations and animal figures from pompons.  Try to do such crafts yourself.  Good luck </p>
