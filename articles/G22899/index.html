The private sector in this area we will try to describe.  A small resort village was lost in the Gelendzhik region, between Arkhipo-Osipovka and Dzhanhot.  He is loved by tourists who prefer not to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù at parties and foam discos, but who travel exclusively for relaxation, the sea and the sun.  It is surrounded by gardens and low mountains, although one of them bears the ambitious name Ararat.  It has excellent ecology, clean water, many natural attractions, cheap housing, which is already a big plus of such a climatic resort.  But let's take a closer look at the local guest houses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Betta private sector" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1928380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Betta Village </h2><p>  The private sector is not the only opportunity to relax in this resort.  There are hotels in Betta, and very good ones, and recreation centers, and even sanatoriums.  But after all, so often tourists prefer to relax as a "savage" so as not to depend on anyone ... The village itself is amazingly picturesque.  Its name in the Adyghe language means "hunchbacked".  The fact is that it is located on a high cape, sticking out among the surrounding hills.  And this rugged relief has created numerous bays with beautiful beaches.  To Gelendzhik from here about 40 kilometers, that is, only an hour away.  Minibuses regularly come here, including from the airport.  Therefore, from Gelendzhik to get to the village is the easiest.  Although you can come from Anapa, and from Krasnodar.  Betta's air is an amazing mixture of the smells of the sea and the scents of pine groves.  Juniper, thuja and cypress grow in the wild. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Betta private sector prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1928384.jpg" width="600"></div>

Other owners will also offer you such services as Wi-Fi on the territory, and swimming pools, such as, for example, Family.  And since the village is on a hill, literally from every house an amazing view opens up.  Some homeowners are also part-time guides, and they will at least show you how to get to the observation deck on Cape Chugovas with amazing views of the snowy peaks of the Caucasus Mountains, beautiful waterfalls in these places and ancient dolmens on the Pshada River. </p>

    <h2>  How to eat </h2><p>  Mostly the private sector owners in Betta provide holidaymakers with a common kitchen for cooking, often summer, in the air.  Some guest houses have their own dining rooms.  There are many peaches and apples in the local orchards, as well as other fruits that grow in abundance on the southern coast of the Caucasus.  If you prefer to eat at a public catering, then at your service traditional Caucasian, as well as Russian and European cuisine.  Most cafes and dining rooms are concentrated near the central beach and on Podgornaya street.  The only restaurant in the village is called Sugdeya.  There is a pleasant atmosphere, you can listen to live music.  And the disco works only in the Betta cafe.  The private sector with tourist meals is organized much better than even boarding houses and motels.  In the latter there were mainly Soviet-style canteens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Local beaches and their distance from housing </h2><p>  You can rent a room or a cottage in Betta almost everywhere.  The distance to the sea from most private and guest houses in the village is 400-500 meters.  There are several beaches in Betta, and they are literally for every taste - there are sandy ones, and there are also some pebbles.  The entrance to the water is different, depending on the bay - sometimes flat, and sometimes there are stones and rocks.  Some beaches are wild, but there are also equipped ones with various water activities.  And if you take a mask with you, you won‚Äôt regret it.  Local bizarre cliffs are perfect for snorkeling.  There are many fish and seahorses.  Arrived with the children?  Then take you to the central beach.  Adults can ride a paraglider, and for children, aquazorbing and an inflatable game complex with three water slides are suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik betta private sector" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1928385.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Betta, private sector: prices and reviews </h2><p>  Middle class accommodation in Betta costs about 1,500-1700 rubles per day, and luxury suites - 4-5 thousand.  Economy rooms away from the sea start at a price of 500-600 p.  The cheapest dining rooms of the type ‚Äúlike in the USSR‚Äù really have affordable prices.  The cost of dishes there starts from 70-80 rubles.  And for a full meal in an average cafe, you will pay about 300-500 p.  A trip to Gelendzhik will cost you a lot more. </p><p>  Betta's private sector will not only allow you to have a great rest, but also save your money.  Many tourists praise the local landscapes and the opportunity to enjoy the sunset on the veranda or terrace with a cup of tea or a glass of wine.  Healing, saturated with volatile air, coupled with the warm sea, contributes not only to relaxation, but also to healing.  There are no noisy tracks and railways along the sea.  Although vacationers say that the service is sometimes ‚Äúshovels‚Äù.  And all the housing is upstairs on the mountains.  There is practically no "first line" in the classical sense of the word.  Residents of the Krasnodar Territory often come here just to spend the weekend. </p>
