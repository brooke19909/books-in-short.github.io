    <h2>  Pushing the boundaries of famous products </h2><p>  A few years ago crock-pots were presented to the public, which made it easy to make dishes of any complexity.  Thanks to these devices, there is no need to monitor the cooking process.  The presence of various modes, the ability to set the temperature, pressure, and many other functions necessary for a dish elevated them to the rank of the most popular and useful inventions, pushing pressure cookers and other items of kitchen utensils far back.  At the moment, a new product is gaining popularity among consumers - a multicooker with a smoking function. </p><p>  Many companies are trying to meet the increasing demands of consumers and ease their household chores.  That is why, in addition to the functions already built into the device, engineers “adjusted” the mode of cold and hot smoking.  How does such a device work, and what are the differences between brands?  Let's figure it out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Vitess VS-3006: looking from the outside </h2><p>  One of the popular options in the series of these devices is the Vitess multicooker with smoking function.  An excellent example is the model with the article number VS-3006.  From a visual point of view, this product is a compact device equipped with a control panel with LED-display.  The multicooker case has a special heat-insulated coating, which is part of a multi-level security system.  For ease of use, handles are attached to the sides of the device.  The lid has a special device for automatically removing steam from the tank.  The volume of the bowl is 6 liters. </p><h2>  Modes and features </h2><p>  The smoker “Vitess VS-3006” is equipped with ten programs for cooking main dishes.  This list includes the modes “Rice”, “Fish”, “Baking”, “Meat / Bird”, “Yogurt”, “Legumes”, “Soup”, “Porridge”, “Stew” and “Buckwheat”.  In addition to the main ones, the device has two important additional functions: hot and cold smoking.  In combination with the available programs, this equipment is ideally suited for cooking dishes of varying complexity at both high and low pressure.  The device can be used as a slow cooker, pressure cooker and, most interestingly, as a smokehouse.  Thanks to the non-stick coating of removable bowls, you can be calm for the safety of your dish.  The “Delayed start” function allows you to cook food by the scheduled time, and the mode of maintaining the heat of already cooked foods will maintain the optimum temperature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What is in the box? </h2><p>  The crock-pot with smoking function "Vitess VS-3006" has all the necessary accessories and tools.  For cooking main dishes and smoked meats, there are two separate bowls.  A cover is also attached to each of them.  For steamed dishes, you can use a double boiler.  For the smoking process, the device is equipped with a carbonization bowl.  Wood chips are placed in it, which in small quantities are also included in the kit.  A spoon, a measuring cup, a mitt, a ladle, tongs, a tack and a silicone spatula - that set of accessories that has a crock-pot with the function of smoking.  The price of this model is relatively low compared to other analogues and ranges from 2500 rubles. </p><h2>  Brand Equipment </h2><p>  In addition to the previous version, there are also other devices.  For example, a multicooker with Brand 6060 smoking function. This model has seven built-in automatic programs.  Moreover, each mode can be adjusted manually: set the time and delay the start of work.  The maximum start can be moved 99 minutes.  Key modes include Hot Smoked, Cold Smoked, Stewed, Soup, Steamed, Roast, and Warm.  The slow cooker allows you to combine the first two functions.  You can postpone the cooking process in all modes except “Frying” and “Heating”.  The useful capacity of the appliance bowl is 6 liters.  A special non-stick coating allows you not to worry about the safety of dishes.  A slow cooker makes it possible to cook food both under pressure and without it.  The negative point of this equipment is the lack of a bowl without a heating element.  The price of a multicooker is twice the cost of the previous option. </p><h2>  Redmond RMC-M110: just add smoke </h2>

    <p>  An even more expensive option is the Redmond multicooker.  With the smoking function, several models are available.  One of them is the device with the article number RMC-M110.  In order to cook a terrific dish with a fragrant smoked smell and taste, it is necessary to purchase liquid smoke and, placing the product in a baking sleeve or foil, turn on the equipment in the “Baking” mode for 25-30 minutes.  In addition to these functions, the multicooker also performs a huge number of other operations.  Depending on preferences, this appliance can also be used as a pressure cooker, since there is a special valve for releasing steam installed on the cover of the model. </p>
