  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Space temperature</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Filmmakers and science fiction writers are constantly trying to prove to us that a person who suddenly got into outer space without a spacesuit will die in a split second.  According to them, the temperature in the Cosmos is such that no living creature without special equipment is able to stay in the open space of the Universe for more than a second.  For example, this is quite interesting and vividly written in one of the works of Arthur Clark: a hero who finds himself in open space dies instantly due to severe frost and internal pressure.  However, according to the theoretical calculations of modern scientists, the death of a person in such conditions does not occur instantly. </p><p>  Often, it is suggested that a person who finds himself in the open space of space will be torn apart from within by sharply increased pressure.  Space is an ideal vacuum, and pressure in about one atmosphere is maintained in the human body.  At first glance, it might seem <span>that such a resonance</span> is quite enough for a living creature to instantly die from the ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù. </p><p>  In fact, no ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù will occur - body tissues are characterized by sufficient strength and are able to cope with pressure in one atmosphere.  Instead of the expected reaction, something else happens: the capillaries burst, which supply blood to the skin, this is a rather unpleasant phenomenon, but not at all fatal. </p><p>  Another reason that a person can die very quickly in the open space of the Universe is the very temperature of the Cosmos, which, according to some sources, reaches <span>absolute zero</span> according to Kelvin (-273.15 ¬∞ C).  More precisely, people who do not know anything about the temperature features of interplanetary space think so.  The temperature in open space, strange as it sounds, is the absence of any temperature.  Outer space, according to researchers, has no temperature, respectively, it can neither heat nor cool the living organism in it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is traditionally meant by a term like ‚Äútemperature‚Äù?  Firstly, the random movement of atoms or molecules of which absolutely all bodies are composed.  The more intense the molecules move, the correspondingly the higher the thermometer.  Where there is no substance as such, there can be no talk of such a thing as temperature.  Outer space is just such a place where matter is very small.  Therefore, they say that the temperature in Space is its complete absence.  However, the bodies that are in <span>interplanetary space</span> have a variety of thermal indicators, which depend on many possible parameters. </p><p>  Outer space is filled with radiation from sources having the most diverse intensity and frequency.  And the temperature in the Cosmos, from this point of view, is understood as the total radiation energy in a certain place in space. </p><p>  A thermometer in open space will first show the temperature that was characteristic of the environment from which it was extracted, for example, from the interior of <span>a spaceship.</span>  Over time, the device will heat up, and very much.  Indeed, in conditions where convective heat transfer takes place, objects lying under direct sunlight are heated quite strongly, so that it is impossible to touch them.  In space, such heating will be much stronger, since vacuum is an ideal heat insulator. </p><p>  Thus, the temperature in the Cosmos is a relative concept, but depending on what point in space the body is, it can be heated or cooled.  Far from stars, where heat fluxes practically do not penetrate, the temperature of such a body will be approximately 2.725 degrees Kelvin, since the <span>relict radiation</span> propagates throughout the part of the Universe known to astronomers, however, as the body approaches a star, it will gradually increase. </p>
