Firstly, it is easy to use, as it is an alternation of empty and filled squares.  Secondly, even dresses or tablecloths knit very quickly, which is especially important for impatient beginners.  Thirdly, the simplicity of knitting allows you to create sometimes elegant <span>types of clothing,</span> accessories, household items. </p><h2>  Mesh Knitting Basics </h2><p>  Fillet knitting in its essence imitates the lace that our grandmothers did.  Only crocheting simple stories are created faster, and creation schemes are much more understandable and simpler.  For this type of creativity, monochrome cross-stitch patterns are suitable.  Although professionals have learned how to create color patterns. </p><p>  The sirloin crochet pattern consists of empty and filled with columns of cells.  A chain of air loops fits the size of the product as standard, which in the next rows is filled with cells by alternating air loops and <span>double crochets.</span> </p><p>  The size and density of the mesh will depend on the thickness of the thread, the size of the hook, the number of crochets and the correct execution of the technique.  Loose knitting makes the product larger, but shapeless, and tight knitting creates neat miniature patterns that hold their shape.  When fillet knitting clothes is very important.  When creating decorative elements of delicate work, take the hook half less than the thickness of the thread. </p><h2>  Where filet mesh is used </h2><p>  In addition to the usual filet grid (squares), there is a tulle pattern, where there is also an alternation of columns with loops, but a larger number.  That is, in a regular grid, the columns alternate through two loops (in a filled square, instead of loops, the columns). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And in the tulle pattern there is a ‚Äúdouble‚Äù alternation: 1) the column is replaced by five loops;  2) the usual square is replaced by five loops that are attached to the middle of the arch of the previous row.  It turns out a kind of oval mesh. </p><p>  The fillet pattern, despite its simplicity, is used when knitting napkins, tablecloths, curtains, tunics, tops, sweaters, dresses, paintings, collars, bags, bedspreads, pillowcases. </p><p>  Previously, the loin mesh was only one-color, while the main pattern could be made with double crochet or empty cells.  Since such products require lining, due to the contrasting color, the craftswoman emphasized either the background or the pattern.  Now the crochet patterns of the sirloin net remained the same, but the masters adapted themselves to immediately create multi-colored patterns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet filet pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/628166.jpg" width="383"></div>

    <h2>  We knit napkins </h2><p>  The napkin in this technique can be square, rectangular, oval, round, polygonal, solid or motive.  For beginners, any "loin" schemes even with zigzag edges are strong.  To do this, squares are simply added by dialing the chain and columns, or reduced by connecting columns. </p><p>  You can simply alternate motifs of a different color knitted with a simple filet net.  Such a base is suitable for creating bulk products of mixed technology.  For example, for pillows, pom-poms laid out on a grid are attached to such a grid, or flowers using the kanzashi technique are glued to the base for a napkin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can repeat the same element in a checkerboard pattern, getting the original napkin.  Especially popular is the floral scheme for fillet crochet (turn the work after each row): </p><ul><li>  A chain of alternating double crochet and two loops (23 cells total). </li><li>  2 empty squares (PC), 7 filled (SC), 7 PCs, 5 full, 2 PCs. </li></ul><h2>  Continuation of the element of roses for napkins </h2><ul><li>  4 empty, 5 ZK, 4 pcs, 7 filled squares, 3 pcs. </li><li>  It also starts with 4 pcs, 7 full cells, 2 pcs, 6 zk, 4 pcs. </li><li>  5 empty, 6 ZK, 1 PC, 5 full, 6 PC.  For clarity and ease of knitting, draw this diagram on a piece of paper. </li><li>  11 pcs, 1 full square, 3 empty cells, 2 ZK, 6 pcs. </li><li>  8 PCs, 3 ZK-PK-ZK, 6 PCs. </li><li>  5 PCs with ZK, empty square, 6 ZK and PC. </li><li>  5 empty, 8 ZK, 1 full cell, 5 ZK, 4 PC </li><li>  4 full, 5 ZK, empty, 9 ZK, 4 pcs </li><li>  4 PCs, 1 ZK, 2 PCs, 5 ZK, 3 PCs, 4 ZK and PC. </li><li>  4 filled, 3 ZK, 1 PC, 3 full and empty, per unit of full and empty square, 2 ZK, 5 PC. </li><li>  3 PCs, 5 full, * 1 PC, 3 ZK * - repeat 2 times, * 1 PC, 1 ZK * - twice, 3 PCs. </li><li>  2 PCs, * 3 PCs, 1 PC * - 2 times, 5 PCs, empty, 5 PCs, 2 PCs. </li><li>  1 PC, 5 ZK, empty square, 7 ZK, * 1 PC, 3 ZK * - 2 times, 1 PC. </li><li>  The same as the 15th row, only read the diagram in reverse order. </li><li>  1 PC, 4 PCs, 2 PCs, 7 PCs, 3 PCs, full and empty, 3 PCs, 1 PC. </li><li>  2 PC-ZK-PC, 3 ZK, 1 PC, 6 ZK, 1 PC, 5 ZK, 1 PC. </li><li>  2 empty squares, 4 ZK, 1 PC, 5 ZK, 1 PC, 2 ZK and PC, 1 ZK-PK-ZK, 3 PCs. </li><li>  5 empty squares, * 1 ZK, 1 PC * - 3 times, 4 ZK, 2 PC, 3 full and empty. </li><li>  3 PCs, 2 ZK, 1 PC-ZK-PC, 4 ZK, 1 PC, 2 ZK, 1 PC and ZK, 6 PCs. </li><li>  7 empty, 1 ZK, 2 PCs, 4 full, 1 PC, 2 ZK, 6 PCs. </li><li>  7 pcs, 2 pcs, 1 empty cell, 5 pcs, 8 pcs. </li><li>  23 pcs. </li></ul><p>  The element of the rose can be connected with motives, then connected or immediately distributed along the length of the entire product.  This will not affect the quality (many loin crochet is a feature that many people like).  Napkin patterns can be taken from embroidery magazines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet filet patterns" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/625742.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to knit according to the pattern </h2><p>  Embroidery patterns are good for their variety.  For knitting paintings, panels or napkins, it is better to choose monochrome plots or having two colors.  The pattern for cross-stitch is read as follows: an empty cage corresponds to a column and two air loops, a filled square corresponds to four columns.  Consider a scheme with a spider, the plot of which is suitable for any product (napkins, panels, shirts, tablecloths). </p><p>  Only for clothing, the border can not be knitted, and a spider with a cobweb can be made from empty squares.  That is, first there is a double crochet, then two air loops and again a double crochet.  In this case, the shirt or dress will be made of solid columns, and the picture is transparent, then no lining is necessary. </p><p>  For panels, ‚Äúreverse‚Äù fillet crochet is used.  The napkin patterns in this case are read in the forward and backward directions.  That is, you start to knit from left to right, turn the work over and go from right to left.  For these purposes, ‚Äúblack‚Äù cells are knitted with crochets, and the background - alternating columns with air loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sirloin crochet tablecloth patterns" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/628165.jpg" width="319"></div>

    <h2>  Diagram of napkins with a girl </h2><p>  Many craftswomen use a mesh as a basis for weaving, creating unusual images.  So, on a napkin with a girl, the whole background is connected by ‚Äúempty cells‚Äù (a column-loop), and the lady is made mainly of solid crocheted columns.  The lines show in which place and what color the satin ribbon should be stretched.  In this case, all the voids are filled, so the scheme can be used for <span>knitting tops for</span> young girls. </p><p>  The edges of the napkin are tied with frills: </p><ul><li>  Alternation of two air loops with a crochet. </li><li>  Alternate 6 stitches with single crochet. </li><li>  In one arch, knit 11 double crochet, and in the middle of the other - a connecting column.  So the picture continues to the end of the row. </li><li>  On arches with columns alternate a column with an air loop.  It turns out shuttlecocks, which fasten to each other with a connecting loop. </li><li>  Finish tying with three air and connecting loops. </li></ul><p>  This pattern of fillet crochet is suitable even for beginner craftswomen, but the napkin will be unusual.  If you use coarse threads, then according to this instruction you can knit a bag or clutch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filet crochet pattern napkins" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/628161.jpg" width="464"></div>

    <h2>  Knitting sweaters </h2><p>  Coarse mesh models are worn over shirts.  If you choose a contrasting color, you can see the picture brighter.  Such sweaters, tunics, vests knit quickly, literally in a couple of days, since the pattern is small, and the squares can be knitted large <span>(a column with two crochets</span> and four air loops). </p><p>  When knitting sweaters, make a pattern, apply it strictly on it.  Note that the first row starts with a solid row of columns.  From it up will go knitting sweaters, and down - frill.  A large flower is located on the front shelf, and all other details are made with a net (meaning filet crochet). </p><p>  Sweater schemes can be modified.  To do this, perform the drawing with empty cells, and knit the entire sweater in solid squares from the columns.  Appearance will be different.  Try to connect a small square with a flower in a different style and attach to the shirt, immediately understand what you like more.  Then grind the shelves, knit the sleeves, and in the last turn, work on the product strapping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filet crochet sweatshirts" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/628177.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Combination of filet pattern with a different pattern </h2><p>  The fillet grid shines through, because whole things require lining.  But with a combination of different patterns, you can knit a skirt on a girl without additional material.  The principle of operation is simple.  Knit twenty centimeters from the waist centimeters.  Switch to fillet <span>crochet (tablecloth</span> or bedspread <span>patterns</span> can be taken as a basis, since the grid will be the background, and not the main pattern, like a sweater). </p><p>  Once you have reached the desired length of the product, begin to knit shuttlecocks.  They should be wide, like a bedspread or pillowcase.  Mentally divide the loin mesh in half (this will be the middle).  Now, from the beginning of the pattern (immediately after the belt), you are tying the first shuttlecock.  The next tier begins in the middle, and the last begins immediately after the end of the grid. </p><p>  Thus, due to shuttlecocks, voids are covered.  Another option for knitting a skirt without a lining is to use a grid like a sweater (description of the scheme above) with double columns.  And as a decoration, use separately knitted elements (flowers, leaves) or stretch multi-colored satin ribbons.  With a little imagination, you can get the original model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet filet patterns patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/625745.jpg" width="386"></div>

    <h2>  Fillet crochet: patterns of long products </h2><p>  Bedspreads and tablecloths made in this technique are distinguished by originality and originality.  The fact is that sirloin products are coated on top of a plain fabric to emphasize the pattern. </p><p>  No need to look for complex circuits or technologies.  You can take as a basis a scheme with roses or a flower from a sweater and create a tablecloth due to numerous repetitions.  The edges are tied with frills, as described in the napkin scheme with the girl. </p><p>  Here it is worth paying attention to two ways to create tablecloths.  In a simple embodiment, the product is knitted in length or width.  That is, you type a chain of loops, go to the filet pattern. </p><p>  But there is more to doing crochet.  Fillet patterns (patterns) begin in the middle.  That is, a square is knitted (for example, with a side of 4 loops).  Then knitting goes in a circle with building squares, while one of the sides of the figure is a double crochet.  For beginners, it‚Äôs better to learn the first way to create a grid. </p><h2>  Dress: filet crochet </h2><p>  Schemes can be very diverse, but they are not suitable for everyone.  Slender girls can knit such a dress without lining, emphasizing their shapes.  Full ladies are better to hem the skirt and bodice.  As a rule, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe chest, hips, a dense pattern or ordinary columns without a crochet is knitted. </p><p>  All the rules for knitting clothes are preserved with a filet pattern. </p><ul><li>  Knit a pattern with a pattern. </li><li>  Measure the parameters. </li><li>  Wash, dry the sample.  This is a very important point, as the loin net can stretch out and the dress will lose its presentation. </li><li>  Measure, compare data. </li><li>  Make a full-length pattern, taking into account measurements. </li><li>  Knit on the patterns. </li><li>  Connect all the parts at the seams. </li><li>  Tie the edges of the dress (bottom, sleeves, neck). </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the difficulty lies in the preparatory work with threads, and the process of creating a dress does not take much time.  This is the advantage of the net (meaning fillet <span>crochet).</span>  <span>The schemes of a blouse,</span> vest, skirt or other model of clothing require the manufacture of patterns in full growth.  This is necessary so that the mesh does not stretch when washing the product.  Or combine filet pattern with other dense patterns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet filet dress" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/628168.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  Fillet pattern, despite its simplicity, for beginners can be quite moody.  The product may not keep the shape of the squares, which is possible due to poor density of knitting, improper selection of threads, crochet hook, number of crochets.  It is better to practice on small napkins or knit ten-centimeter samples before work. </p><p>  To create a form, the craftswomen use a double grid.  This is also filet crochet.  Schemes of a tablecloth, bedspreads, clothes in this case involve the alternation of two double crochet and two air loops.  Due to the double columns, the product shines through less and holds its shape well.  This tip will allow beginners to create neat handmade items in a short period. </p>
