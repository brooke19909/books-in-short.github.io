What is its uniqueness?  After all, Iceland is only a small distance from the Arctic Circle, a dull and monotonous permafrost zone.  Indeed, the vegetation on the island is rather sparse, sometimes just ascetic, subarctic climate, partly mitigated by the warm Gulf Stream.  It would seem that here to watch? </p><p>  Meanwhile, the number of visitors to this northern island is growing every year, turning into a serious <span>test of strength</span> for a country with a little more than 300 thousand people that make up the local population. </p>

    <h2>  Iceland - a country of geysers, glaciers and volcanoes </h2><p>  In fact, there is something to see in Iceland, and what he saw will be remembered for a long time - it is here that you can see all the natural power, colossal power and magnificence of Mother Earth itself, manifested immediately in all four elements.  No wonder Iceland has so many names: ‚Äúcountry of ice‚Äù, ‚Äúisland of volcanoes‚Äù, ‚Äúcountry of hot springs‚Äù and, of course, ‚Äúcountry of geysers‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The geysers of Iceland are one of the main attractions of this small state.  Already one hundred kilometers from Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland), all the splendor and grandeur of the Haukadalur geyser valley opens before the traveler.  Seeing the geysers of Iceland in the photo and stepping into the valley itself is far from the same thing. </p>

    <h2>  Nature's own performance </h2><p>  This Icelandic Valley of Geysers, numbering about 40 hot springs, has become famous around the world.  It is this place that attracts numerous tourist flows with its incredibly colorful spectacles and fabulous productions, where the role of the director is assigned to nature itself, and not to human genius. </p><p>  Clubs of white steam creeping along the earth resemble a pop production, when white puffs of smoke creep across the stage, portending something interesting and exciting that will happen there very soon.  And according to the laws of the genre, as in all shows created by man, intrigue has its continuation in the valley of geysers.  Due to the veil of steam, powerful geysers rush out from the ground and rush upwards - the performance begins.  More precisely, it continues.  And day and night, winter and summer - always.  An endless theatrical performance, which differs from man-made productions in its scale, grandeur, richness of colors and scenery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The history of the name of the capital of Iceland </h2><p>  Thanks to this spectacle, the capital of Iceland got its name Reykjavik - according to some sources, in translation it means ‚Äúsmoking harbor‚Äù, ‚Äúsmoky bay‚Äù, ‚Äúgulf of smoke‚Äù.  This place was first called by that name the Norwegian navigator Arnarson (9th century), when he landed with his squad on the island for settlement.  Subsequently, he invited other representatives of the noble Norwegian clan with his squads, who are in constant feud with the jarl working in Norway. </p><h2>  Haukadalur Valley </h2><p>  The Haukadalur Valley owes its fame and popularity to a large number of large geysers, one of which is able to rise up to 60 meters in a column.  A fantastic sight. </p><p>  In addition to large raging geysers, in the valley you can find many smaller hot springs.  They are also able to interest in their diversity: some gush, some are like boiling and seething pools.  There are also those that are very similar to a watering summer sprayer, spraying water jets in the beds.  With one difference.  Geyser water is not harmless at all, it is boiling and can cause severe skin burns.  A persistent characteristic smell of sulfur indicates that this water is not suitable for drinking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Every year the appearance of the valley changes.  The reason for this is the high seismic activity of this area. </p><h2>  The Great, or Great, Iceland Geyser </h2><p>  On the territory of the geyser valley of Iceland is the oldest and most famous seething geyser in the world - the Great Geyser of Iceland, discovered in the 13th century.  Chronicles narrate that its strength and power was so great that the earth "shook and walked" far in the vicinity during the next eruption.  The ancestors of modern Icelanders deified him, and named Geysir.  This name subsequently began to be applied to all similar natural phenomena - geysers. </p><p>  In the 19th century, the powerful Geysir ceased its activity.  Many believed that the geyser ended its existence.  But a strong earthquake once brought Geysir out of hibernation.  The geyser has earned again, however, not so much is left of its former power and magnificence.  The great geyser temporarily ceases its activity, ‚Äúresting‚Äù for several days and even months.  It is considered a great success to see him in action.  In a state of activity, Geysir erupts several times a day, and its pillars can reach 50-60 meters, which leaves him the title of Great.  His "brothers" - the geysers of Iceland, of course, cannot boast of such power.  The second largest geyser in the Haukadalur valley is considered to be Strokkur, throwing out columns of hot water and steam only 20-30 meters. </p>

    <h2>  Geyser Strokkur </h2><p>  Being second is also honorable.  Especially when you consider that the eruptions of Strokkur occur every five minutes (on average).  And to visit the geyser valley without seeing the bright colorful spectacle of this miracle of nature is simply impossible.  Strokkur in translation from the <span>Icelandic language</span> means "butter churn", "butter churn".  This seething geyser has become much more popular with tourists than the more ancient and powerful Geysir.  Eruptions of Strokkur cannot be predicted.  The official part of speech ‚Äî the ‚Äúor‚Äù union ‚Äî is always applicable to them.  A geyser can make one, two, even three consecutive eruptions at a time, the frequency of eruptions is also different.  He is able to manifest himself every 2-3 minutes, and can indicate his presence after 5-6 minutes.  These values ‚Äã‚Äãalternate randomly, which adds uniqueness. </p><h2>  Combination of incongruous </h2><p>  This term can be applied to the island of Iceland.  Volcanoes and geysers, sliding glaciers are in a strikingly close neighborhood, they amaze with their kind a brotherhood of tourists.  Although there is nothing surprising in this.  Geysers around the world are found precisely in areas of increased seismic activity, in places where there are volcanoes.  Geysers of Iceland indicate the ongoing process of volcanic activity. </p>

    <h2>  From the history of Icelandic geysers </h2><p>  The geysers of Iceland have their own history.  The approximate age of the Haukadalur geyser valley (according to various sources) is about ten thousand years.  The mass appearance of geysers is associated with strong earthquakes in this geographic area dating from 1294.  It is with earthquakes that all significant events and changes in the Haukadalur valley are associated: </p><ul><li>  the massive explosion of numerous geysers of 1630 shook the earth and filled the space with unimaginable noise; </li><li>  Geysir's long inaction ceased in 1896, the geyser became active; </li><li>  1910 - the activity of the Great Geyser increases sharply, and emissions occur every half hour; </li><li>  1915 - Geysir again changes its frequency of emissions, increasing the time interval between them to six hours; </li><li>  a year later (1916) its activity becomes minimal, and soon ceases altogether; </li><li>  The year 2000 revives the activities of the Great Geyser with a frequency of up to 8 times a day. </li></ul><p>  All changes can be enumerated indefinitely - they occur regularly and are not always noticeable during the review.  Such a place is the island of Iceland.  Mysterious and unpredictable.  And you should definitely visit it if you have the opportunity to see this miraculous miracle. </p>
