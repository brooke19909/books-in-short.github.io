    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The five-star Vinci Resort Taj Sultan Hotel is conveniently located ten kilometers from the center of Hammamet, on the very shore of the sea.  This resort has long gained the fame of one of the most respectable in Tunisia.  Due to the fact that the hotel is far from the city center, guests have the opportunity to relax in peace and quiet.  However, if you have a desire to have a noisy and fun time, the resort is replete with bars, discos and nightclubs.  You just have to choose an institution to your taste.  In addition, many tourists come to Hammamet not only for a beach holiday, but also for anti-aging and wellness treatments, which this resort is famous for.  As for airports, as a rule, the planes of travelers staying at the Vincci Resort Taj Sultan 5 * land either in the air harbor of Monastir (105 km from Hammamet) or in the capital of Tunisia (68 km from Hammamet).  Thus, the path to the hotel will take you from one to two hours.  48 kilometers from Hammamet there is another airport located in Enfid.  However, it is not as popular as the aforementioned air harbors.  If you buy a tour through a travel agency, then you will most likely be provided with a transfer upon arrival.  Otherwise, you can get to Hammamet by train or intercity bus.  In addition, the Taj Sultan Hotel arranges transfers for its guests at an additional cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Regarding the rooms, most of the guests did not make any complaints.  However, tourists recommend, if possible, not to take the rooms located on the first floor, as their windows do not always offer a pleasant view.  Otherwise, our compatriots were mostly satisfied.  So, the furniture in the rooms is comfortable, the equipment is in working order, cleaning and linen change are regular.  In addition, all rooms are furnished quite elegantly, which evokes thoughts of France, as stated in the description of the Vincci Resort Taj Sultan. </p><p>  Vincci Taj Sultan 5 * did not disappoint and lovers of good food.  So, according to our compatriots, the diversity of the menu here is slightly inferior to the Turkish five-star hotels, but the quality of the dishes is invariably high.  Therefore, no one will remain hungry here. </p><p>  As for the hotel‚Äôs own beach, most Russians were quite satisfied with it.  So, there is always a sufficient number of sun loungers and umbrellas, and you can also rent a scooter, a catamaran, enjoy water skiing and indulge in other water activities.  There is also a snack bar on the beach where you can enjoy a variety of drinks as well as a snack.  However, our compatriots were extremely surprised at the lack of pizza in the snack bar menu. </p>
