    <p>  The food at the hotel is at a decent level - there is a large selection of snacks, meat dishes, as well as fresh fruits and vegetable salads.  The hotel has several shops where you can buy various little things and souvenirs.  Perhaps the problem in this case is that not all staff understand the Russian language, although there are several employees with whom you can talk. </p><p>  Of course, one of the most popular areas today is <span>Hurghada.</span>  <span>5</span> star <span>hotels</span> are usually quite expensive.  But this hotel is perfect for a budget holiday on the beach, which, in fact, makes it so popular. </p>
