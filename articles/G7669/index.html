  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to smuggle a phone through a metal detector?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The use of arched and hand-held metal detectors is one of the most common search methods in any public place, from a regular store, a museum to representative reception rooms and airports.  The article contains the most common myths, facts, and the exact options for cheating with a metal detector. </p><p>  There are situations when, during the procedure of such a check, it is necessary to avoid the detection of certain objects.  For example, for some people in such situations, the most pressing issue is how to carry the phone through a metal detector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="videohive.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to carry a phone through a metal detector" class="if uuid-2837991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2837991.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, you need to understand how this unit works.  In fact, a metal detector is a sensor capable of detecting metal objects of various types and chemical components.  The principles of operation of the sensors differ depending on the purpose of the search.  When examining citizens, pulsed and induction detectors are most often used.  They are harmless to health and the most productive, since there is practically no modern simple way to deceive them.  However, in emergency situations, you can try to use some tricks. </p><h2>  Option number 1. Hide carefully.  Only works with a hand held metal detector </h2><p>  A hand-held metal detector is a portable device used by a security officer to check for unwanted items.  In most cases, in such situations, the human factor works.  The employee examines the areas most suitable for storing things, such as pockets, bags, in some cases sleeves, without attaching importance to less relevant areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A well-trained person using simple psychological methods of trust, namely: a relaxed relaxed state, even breathing and lack of interest in the search, can easily pass the test and achieve the goal of hiding an undesirable item.  In the case where the task is how to carry the phone through a portable metal detector, socks and shoes become an ideal option.  It is important only to securely fix the gadget on the body to avoid loss or damage to property. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone in hand" class="if uuid-2837565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103003/2837565.jpg"></div><h2>  Option No. 2. For an arch type metal detector </h2><p>  In life, many different situations happen that require original solutions.  A hand-held metal detector controlled by a person‚Äôs hand and brain can be fooled, while carrying a phone through an arch-type metal detector is a task with an asterisk.  In such cases, only the device from the electronic unit and orthogonal pillows, inside which the phone is hidden, can save.  This device is not an innovative invention and has long been in demand for use in a wide variety of purposes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guardspiritmetaldetector.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to carry a phone" class="if uuid-2837560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103003/2837560.jpg"></div><h2>  Option number 3. Telephone replacement.  Only works with a hand held metal detector </h2><p>  How to carry the phone through a metal detector and not get into the field of suspicion of the watchful guard?  It is difficult to imagine a person who does not have this gadget available.  With the passage of progress, phones are becoming increasingly necessary assistants in everyday life, everyday life, financial and entertainment.  They store more and more irreplaceable information and less and less trusted by strangers.  At the same time, security structures, realizing this fact, try to more thoroughly check and, if necessary, inspect gadgets under any pretext.  Thus, we take 2 phones with us.  We use the first phone as a bait, put it in the usual place and do not worry about its detection, and we hide the second from the eyes and the metal detector according to option No. 1. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Myths  Metal detector cheating options that do not work </h2><p>  At the moment, in various sources you can find a huge number of ways to hide the phone from a metal detector.  However, any of the methods not mentioned in this article will be a hoax or, even worse, a way to detect you. </p><p>  For example, the option of wrapping a phone in foil is, in fact, the cruelest joke, as it will not only help the detector detect the device, but also make security officers interested in its contents.  Or the use of a magnet is another joke of advisers.  Although in some cases it works as a method of suppressing a metal detection signal, it can only be used on detectors of very old models and if the poles are correctly set relative to a metal object, which is no longer suitable for a modern telephone. </p><h2>  Option number 4. Suitable for passing any metal detector </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.jjscan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metal detector frame" class="if uuid-2837559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/103003/2837559.jpg"></div><p>  Having studied all the details of the principle of the metal detector, clarifying the nuances of the working methods of the security services and setting priorities for yourself, you can draw the right conclusions.  The best way to get your phone through a metal detector is not to go against the law and the rules.  It is better to leave the gadget in the basket for personal items and submit to the requirements.  If the phone stores any secret data or simply information that a person does not want to distribute, then it is better to transfer them to another portable medium or not to take the phone at all.  This will eliminate embarrassing situations, and sometimes even problems with the law.  In another case, you can try your luck and try one of the options provided.  But it should be understood that in case of detection, all responsibility for illegal actions rests with the experimenter. </p>
