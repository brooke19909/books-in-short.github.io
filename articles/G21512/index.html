For example, how much time will have to fly.  Choosing a route is a responsible event.  It is important not only to successfully determine the time of departure and return, but also to consider the services of a reliable airline.  You can only leave from Moscow to the Bahamas with a transfer, since the distance is too great for a non-stop flight.  If you are traveling with children or elderly people, then every extra hour in the air matters, as does the length of time you wait for transfers at transit points. </p><h2>  What airports are there in the Bahamas? </h2><p>  In total, the country has 60 runways.  But not all of them accept international flights, most cooperate with domestic airlines.  Given how popular the local beaches are with the powerful, there is nothing surprising in the fact that it is much easier to see a private yacht or plane than a car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myvacationpages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Bahamas from above" class="if uuid-2405351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75478/2405351.jpg"></div><p>  There are two options for the Russians: </p><ol><li>  The Linden Pindling Airport on New Providence Island in Nassau, the <span>capital of the Bahamas.</span>  It is the largest and well-equipped with everything that guests may require. </li><li>  Airport on the island of Greater Bahama in the city of Freeport.  It is inferior to its predecessor only in size, but otherwise no less comfortable. </li></ol><p>  You can go to any of these islands with transit stops in the USA or Europe.  How long to fly from Moscow to the Bahamas depends on the decision made.  It should be borne in mind that Russians do not need a visa to visit local luxurious beaches.  In 2018, you can freely travel to the islands by reserving hotel rooms.  But since you cannot do without intermediate stops, you will need either a Schengen or an American transit visa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How much fly to the Bahamas from Moscow to Nassau? </h2><p>  If you choose the destination point of arrival of the airport.  L. Pindling with transit through European countries, then in the end you can spend at least 15.5 hours on a flight (change in London).  The waiting time at the transit airport is about 2.5 hours. This is the shortest option in time and the only one with 1 stop (it is also the most expensive).  All other schemes require additional landing in Miami, Atlanta, New York. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nypost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airplane in the sky" class="if uuid-2405362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75478/2405362.jpg"></div><p>  How much to fly to the Bahamas from Moscow with intermediate stops at two points?  It depends on the choice of transit airports and airlines.  The duration of the trip varies in a small range.  With a change in the following cities, the time will be: </p><ul><li>  Paris and Miami - 20 hours; </li><li>  Amsterdam and Atlanta - 20.5 hours; </li><li>  Barcelona and Atlanta - 21.5 hours; </li><li>  London and Miami - 22.5 hours; </li><li>  London and New York - 23 hours; </li><li>  Frankfurt and Miami - 19 h; </li><li>  Madrid and Miami - 22 hours; </li><li>  Zurich and Miami - 24 hours </li></ul><p>  There is a route with one transit change in New York, but it requires a 16.5-hour connection and in total takes 30.5 hours. If you choose Miami as an intermediate point, the total duration of the trip will be 18.5 hours, since both flights are close adjoin each other.  You can choose the option that is more comfortable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  And if you fly to the Bahamas in Freeport? </h2><p>  This is the second most popular route.  Knowing how much distance (9074 km) separates the Bahamas and Moscow, how much to fly by plane - is of fundamental importance, especially when children travel with you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thetikihutcompany.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahamas Bungalow" class="if uuid-2405378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75478/2405378.jpg"></div><ul><li>  London and Nassau - 17.5 hours; </li><li>  London and Miami - 19 h; </li><li>  Milan and Miami - 19.5 hours; </li><li>  Rome and Miami - 20 hours; </li><li>  New York and Fort Lauderdale - 26.5 hours </li></ul><p>  From Freeport you can immediately take a ticket for a local flight to Nassau, they are sent daily at least 5 at approximately equal intervals. </p><h2>  What is useful for tourists to know? </h2><p>  This is the second most popular route.  Given how far the Bahamas and Moscow are between it is important for passengers to know how much to fly by plane to the nearest hour.  Not everyone due to health reasons can freely endure such a long flight, and on business trips sometimes every minute counts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flyingandtravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Bahamas from the cockpit" class="if uuid-2413006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75478/2413006.jpg"></div><p>  Airport them.  L. Pindling and Nassau are 16 km away.  Walking such a distance with suitcases in your hands is unrealistic.  The cheapest taxi will cost $ 15 (about 860 rubles).  It is more profitable to find <span>a public transport stop</span> where you can catch a bus.  And if you have international rights, you can rent a car for about $ 45 per day (about 2500 rubles). </p><p>  In Freeport, the airport is almost within the city limits, so transport here is only required for delivery to the hotel chosen by tourists.  A taxi ride will cost from $ 15.  From here you can also choose any direction for further travel around the islands.  To do this, on-site tickets for flights and private jets are sold.  If you know how much to fly to the Bahamas from Moscow, you can plan ahead of your every step right after landing at the airport. </p>
