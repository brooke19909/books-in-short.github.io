    <h2>  Green corner </h2><p>  This place is called one of the most unusual in the capital.  Neskuchny Garden in Moscow got its name from the Neskuchnoe estate owned by Prince Trubetskoy.  The creator of this place is considered Procopius Demidov.  He was a major industrialist.  Before the Orlovs, he owned picturesque territories.  Demidov began to ennoble the Neskuchny Garden in Moscow with exotic plants and set out to give his possessions the shape of an amphitheater.  Seven hundred workers worked on the implementation of the unusual idea.  Two years later, the facility was ready. </p><p>  One of the pavilions of this garden is familiar to everyone who likes to spend evenings on TV screens.  For fifteen years, experts have regularly gathered in the Hunting Lodge of Neskuchny Sad for once again to be smart in the game ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When?" </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Visitors always have something to do in this green corner.  Neskuchny Garden in Moscow is known for its <span>sports facilities</span> for tennis and large, a chess club, a rope park, a football field and a fitness center that offers its services throughout the year.  In addition, cozy cafes are open on the territory of this recreation area where you can have a good snack. </p><h2>  A piece of Paris </h2><p>  A copy of the main symbol of the French capital is in Russia.  The Eiffel Tower in Moscow was erected near the station.  m. "Aviamotornaya".  The unusual structure is located on the territory of the Moskabelmet manufacturing enterprise.  The workers of the said factory were engaged in the construction of an exact copy of the world famous landmark.  The Eiffel Tower in Moscow reaches the height of a five-story building.  However, admiring this building is not so simple, because it is located on the territory of a sensitive facility.  In order to get to the factory, you need to have a pass with you.  The local administration is responsible for issuing such a document, but only employees of the enterprise receive it.  So is the Eiffel Tower in Moscow inaccessible to tourists?  How to admire her without breaking the law?  You can get all the necessary information in travel agencies that organize tours of the capital.  Tip of experienced travelers: you can call one of the shops on the premises of the enterprise and order a pass in advance. </p><h2>  The memory of the legendary musician </h2><p>  The wall of Tsoi on the Arbat is an unplanned project.  This monument is often compared to a tragic scream.  There are many inscriptions on it, the most famous of which are ‚ÄúCinema‚Äù and ‚ÄúChoi is Alive‚Äù.  In addition, the wall captures excerpts of the musician‚Äôs songs and declarations of love for him.  In the first forty days after the <span>death of Tsoi</span> , his fans were on duty around the clock at a peculiar monument.  Subsequently, people became less and less. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boring garden in Moscow" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/516362.jpg" width="550"></div>

However, after a short time, the fans restored it.  Admirers of the singer‚Äôs talent, according to the established tradition, leave a freshly lit cigarette at the Wall, broken in half.  It was planned to erect a monument to the singer nearby.  Choi was supposed to sit on his favorite motorcycle with bare feet.  The idea could not be realized due to protests by local residents and the disagreement of many fans of the singer. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the <span>Wall of Tsoi</span> is not only in the capital, but also in other cities of Russia, as well as in Minsk, Dnepropetrovsk and Energodar. </p><h2>  Popular store </h2><p>  The tea house on Myasnitskaya appeared at the end of the nineteenth century.  Three centuries ago, Alexey Perlov began to instill a culture of tea drinking in the capital.  He was one of the first to sell an unusual drink at that time in Moscow.  Then Perlov could not have imagined that after fifty years, tea would become an integral part of the life of most people. </p><p>  In 1785, Sergei Perlov - one of the representatives of the merchant dynasty - bought a plot for the construction of the store.  The famous metropolitan architect Roman Klein took part in the development of the project.  He is the author of such well-known structures as the <span>Borodino Bridge, the</span> Central Department Store (previously this store had a different name - ‚ÄúMur and Merliz‚Äù).  Thanks to his efforts, some other unusual places appeared in Moscow. </p><p>  On the ruins of an old building, Klein began to build a three-story house, adhering to the style of the late Renaissance.  In 1895, Alexei Perlov wanted to diversify the facade.  In this way, he wanted to identify an established relationship with Chinese tea merchants.  In addition, soon the influential Qing dignitary Li Hongzhang was to arrive in the capital.  The responsible assignment went to Karl Gippius, one of the most sought-after masters of art of that time.  As a result, the Tea House on Myasnitskaya has undergone fundamental changes.  All the new details - and the ornament, and snakes, and Chinese dragons - just shouted about the East.  The new decoration adorned not only the facade, but also the interior of the store.  Listing interesting places in Moscow, the inhabitants of the capital for a long time primarily remembered the exotic structure - the Tea House. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  For lovers of steam </h2><p>  Sandunovsky baths in Moscow have been operating since 1808.  Currently, they have the status of a monument of architecture.  Sanduns, as the townspeople call them colloquially, are on the corner of Sandunovsky lane and ul.  Neglinnaya.  The furnaces that provide heating for the baths in question are built using unique technologies, the secret of which, unfortunately, has not reached our days.  Sanduns make a good impression thanks to the chic interior decoration and strict adherence to the classical canons of traditional bathing procedures.  The new building was erected in 1895. Since 1990, it has been undergoing regular cosmetic repairs. </p><h2>  Mysterious building on Ostozhenka, 21 </h2><p>  Margarita's house in Moscow is one of the most beautiful architectural structures in the capital.  According to a mysterious legend, it is from here that the well-known heroine of the Bulgakov novel went to the witch's coven.  The external similarity of the mansion with a medieval castle is due to the presence of a small pointed tower.  The building is of architectural value due to the unique stucco decorating the facade.  The role of the main axis of the building is played by a staircase.  All rooms are grouped near it.  Of particular interest are the elements of interior decoration that have been preserved to this day, the developer of which was Lev Kekushev.  Some unusual places in Moscow serve quite earthly purposes.  So, at present, in the walls of the House of Margarita is the Bureau of the Egyptian military attache. </p><h2>  Custom Monument </h2><p>  The stripper‚Äôs monument in Moscow is located opposite the Polar Bear men's club in the very center of the capital.  The graceful sculpture of a graceful girl dancing at the pole is a symbol of the vibrant <span>nightlife of the</span> city. </p><h2>  Olive beach </h2><p>  Continuing to list interesting places in Moscow, we describe the symbol of the reconstruction of Gorky Park.  Olive beach is a flooring brought down from wooden boards.  Sun loungers are placed on it, next to the tubs are olive trees.  Anyone can rent umbrellas.  On the territory of a kind of beach equipped with a shower, a bar, wireless Internet access is available.  Its location is Pushkinskaya embankment. </p><h2>  Dedicated to lovers of frosty freshness </h2><p>  To explore some unusual places in Moscow, you need to gain courage.  This can be said about the bar called "Ice".  In this institution, everything is made of frozen blocks.  But drinks are offered to try not at all cool.  An amazing bar is located on the ground floor of the Globus Gourmet grocery store (TSUM shopping center). </p><h2>  Children are victims of adult vices </h2><p>  The sculptural composition with such an unusual name was inaugurated in 2001 during the celebration of the City Day.  It includes fifteen figures.  Among them are two blindfolded toddlers playing blindfolds.  They are surrounded by a host of huge monsters, which are human figures with the heads of fish and animals.  As the creator of the project, the sculptor M. M. Shemyakin, explained, it is in this way customary to portray vices.  The composition, conceived by him, is intended to play the role of an allegory of the fight against evil on earth. </p>

    <h2>  House under a glass </h2><p>  This structure is a vivid example of the victory of people over their own destructive inclinations.  According to urban legend, the merchant Filatov, due to addiction to drinking, lost half his fortune.  A miracle happened: once a man woke up and realized that his life was crumbling.  The merchant pulled himself together and refused alcohol.  With the money saved, he bought a profitable house of amazing beauty.  As a symbol of a reminder of his own ‚Äúfeat‚Äù, he ordered a flipped glass to be placed on the roof of the building.  The unusual building is located near the metro station "Kropotkinskaya", on the street Volkhonka, 18. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsoi‚Äôs wall on the Arbat" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/516370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Stalin's bunker</span> on Taganka </h2><p>  Some unusual places in Moscow until recently were top-secret objects.  One of the most famous sights of this kind is Stalin's bunker on Taganka.  It is located in the heart of the capital, but is safely hidden from prying eyes: this underground object is located at a depth of sixty-five meters underground.  Its total area is 7000 square meters.  m. Work on the creation of the bunker began in the fifties of the last century during the Cold War, when the threat of using nuclear weapons ceased to seem unrealistic.  Today in the territory of this complex the Bunker-42 Museum operates.  It is equipped with an elevator.  On it, tourists go down to the -18th floor.  In all the premises of this complex, a temperature of twenty degrees Celsius is constantly maintained.  You can leave your personal items in the storage room located in front of the Bunker-42 entrance.  The complex operates not only a museum.  There are rooms for business meetings and banquets.  It is noteworthy that the bunker is open around the clock, however, excursions after seven in the evening must be agreed in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tea house on the butcher" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/516373.jpg" width="600"></div>
