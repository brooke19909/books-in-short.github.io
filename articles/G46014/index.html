The phenomena or bodies that cause it make up the habitat.  Environmental elements that affect living organisms in any form are called environmental factors.  Consider some of their types. </p><p>  <span>Environmental environmental factors</span> are divided into two main types. <br>  If they are associated with the impact of inanimate nature or its elements, then these are abiotic factors.  This includes air temperature, <span>soil composition,</span> light and other climatic conditions. </p><p>  If these are elements of wildlife, then they are called "biotic environmental factors."  That is, this is the interaction of living organisms with each other. <br>  There is another type of factor - anthropogenic.  This is the influence of man on his environment. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail the <span>biotic</span> environmental <span>factors</span> .  They, in turn, are divided into several categories. </p><p>  1. <span>Phytogenic factor</span> implies exposure to plants.  It is characterized by suppression of the growth of some plants or the development of animals by others under the influence of root secretions, growth of root systems, and so on.  An example of this is the intolerance of elderberry smell to mice.  It is also known that some types of plants do not combine with each other (tulips and bird cherry). </p><p>  2. Zoogenic environmental factors.  This is the effect of animals on their own kind or on representatives of the plant world.  So, predators regulate the number of populations of other animals by eating them.  Parasites sometimes cause the death of animals or a decrease in some of their functions.  Individuals of the same species are combined in flocks or herds.  This increases the level of certain processes of their life.  For example, protection against enemies improves or food is extracted more actively.  This factor is called the "group effect." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also <span>intraspecific competition,</span> which is also included in the concept of "biotic environmental factors." </p><p>  The impact of living organisms on each other is most clearly manifested in the interaction between the animal and plant world.  Herds of large animals have a mechanical effect on the vegetation, trampling it.  This is especially evident with a large concentration of fauna representatives.  Destruction of the vegetation cover of the soil leads to a change in its composition and to erosion. </p><p>  3. Mushroom and microorganism factors - this is the effect of bacteria, fungi and other organisms on the environment. </p><p>  As a result of a long period of development of the plant and animal world, the formation of close ties between them.  Every living organism plays a huge role in the interaction.  Biotic environmental factors represent a huge system that is not chaotic, but has a certain balance. </p><p>  Intervention in this process leads to irreversible consequences.  The destruction of a certain type of living organism leads to disturbances in the entire chain.  Even the smallest representatives of the environment are necessary participants in the whole process.  Insects pollinate plants and are the main factor for their full life.  As a result, they get food, and plants - an opportunity for reproduction. </p><p>  Biotic environmental factors are of great importance.  As a result of evolution, living organisms have learned to adapt to processes in the environment.  The fruits of many plants have all kinds of suckers, hooks, or secrete mucus, so that the spread will be more fruitful. </p><p>  We can say that all chains of living organisms invariably lead to a deterioration or improvement in the life of a partner or other organism.  Violation of the chain leads to the death of certain types of organisms. </p>
