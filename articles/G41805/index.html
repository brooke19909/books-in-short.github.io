DVB-T2 TV tuner: which is better?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The DVB-T2 tuner <strong>is a</strong> separate electronic device whose main task is the reception and decoding of a digital television signal.  After conversion, the latter is displayed on the TV screen.  It is the review of this group of solutions that this material will be devoted to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 tuner for tv" class="if uuid-2457129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2457129.jpg"></div><h2>  Device assignment </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the <span>DVB-T2 tuner</span> is aimed at processing second-generation digital television programs.  This is indicated by the presence of the T2 marking in its designation.  But also such devices are capable of processing the television signal of the first generation DVB-T. </p><p>  In addition to this, some manufacturers equip them with the ability to output cable broadcasting DVB ‚Äì C / C2.  In addition, such receivers have a USB port in which you can install various flash drives and display various multimedia information from it. </p><p>  Recently, quite often there are devices that are equipped with a WiFi adapter.  It allows the receiver to connect to the Internet and receive information from there already.  Also, support for IPTV technology is often found in this group of solutions. </p><p>  It is advisable to buy such a system only if an outdated model of a television receiver is used to view programs.  At the same time, the integrated tuner is not able to receive digital transmissions.  But the new multimedia centers in terms of functionality and technical parameters already surpass such discrete DVB-T2 receivers.  Therefore, in this case, there is no need to acquire such a universal solution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 tuner reviews" class="if uuid-2457130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2457130.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Most modern tuners of this class have the following equipment: </p><ol><li>  Discrete device. </li><li>  Remote Control. </li><li>  Manual. </li><li>  Coupon with manufacturer's warranty. </li><li>  Signal wires. </li></ol><p>  Separately, it should be noted that quite often the batteries for the remote control system are not included in the delivery list.  It is also necessary to pay attention to the presence of signal wires.  In some cases, the delivery list includes one communication wire, but it is better if two or even three are available. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 tuner for car" class="if uuid-2457133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2457133.jpg"></div><h2>  Parameters of World Vision Model T62M </h2><p>  First, consider the DVB-T2 tuner from World Vision of the T62M modification.  Nominally, the manufacturer refers this decision to a series of the most budget ones, but at the same time the degree of functionality is very, very good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This receiver can only receive and process DVB ‚Äì T / T2 signals.  Cable and satellite television programs are not affected.  The video device outputs in MPEG2 / MPEG4 formats.  The highest resolution of the resulting image can be 1920 √ó 1080, that is, it meets the specifications of Full HD. </p><p>  The communications list for this model includes a USB connector.  You can connect any external flash drive to it.  At the same time, it can be used both for recording a television program, and for playing multimedia content located on it. </p><p>  There are two main connectors for outputting received channels.  One of them is HDMI, and the second is composite. </p><p>  The software shell of this device has advanced functionality.  In addition to the basic functions, it allows you to access the "global web", output an IPTV signal, and even watch videos on YouTube.  But for this you need to separately purchase an external WiFi adapter in the performance of <span>Ralink RT5370</span> and connect it to the USB jack. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 tuner for car" class="if uuid-2457134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2457134.jpg"></div><h2>  Roks T202HD specifications </h2><p>  This model of the tuner in technical specifications is very similar to the previously reviewed T62M from World Vision.  She also outputs the video to MPEG2 / MPEG4.  The maximum resolution is the same - 1920 √ó 1080. The interface set includes HDMI, USB and component connectors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The key difference of this model is the features of the software shell.  If the younger model provides the ability to connect to the Internet using an external adapter, then in this case the manufacturer completely excluded it.  Therefore, from a software perspective, this solution can only record or play content on a flash drive.  That is, the functionality in the T202HD is significantly lower than the T62M. </p><h2>  Specifications NOMI T202 </h2><p>  NOMI T202 is another stationary DVB-T2 tuner.  Reviews highlight the presence of an information display in it.  Otherwise, this is a complete analogue of the previously considered T62M and T202HD.  The only cardinal difference is the lack of access to the "global web."  The rest of the T202 can output images in 1080p / 1080i, has a communication set of USB, RCA and HDMI. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.idg.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 tuner for tv which is better" class="if uuid-2457139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2457139.jpg"></div><h2>  Digital tuner for vehicles </h2><p>  Also today, you can purchase a mobile tuner DVB-T2 for a car.  As an example, consider the RS device model DVB-T2 HD.  This decision is made as a separate module.  The manufacturer included 2 specialized antennas, a control panel and a user manual in the package.  The latter also includes a warranty card. </p><p>  The communications list includes RCA and USB jacks.  The first of them outputs a video signal and can be connected to any device with the same set of ports (for example, minimonitor), and the second allows you to connect an external drive. </p><p>  Otherwise, such a DVB-T2 tuner for a car is practically no different from its stationary counterparts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bigw.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 tuner" class="if uuid-2457141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2457141.jpg"></div><h2>  Setting procedure </h2><p>  Any modern DVB-T2 tuner for a discrete TV is configured as follows: </p><ol><li>  We remove the multimedia receiver from the package with the rest of the delivery components. </li><li>  Install it next to the TV. </li><li>  Then you need to connect the tuner to the power supply network with a power cord. </li><li>  Next, we connect the receiver and the TV to each other using a signal wire. </li><li>  We include all the individual components of this multimedia system. </li><li>  On the TV set as the signal source the port to which the receiver is connected. </li><li>  Next, on the tuner, go to the setup menu and search for channels.  At the end of this procedure, you need to save the list obtained by its results. </li><li>  We leave the setup menu, and the <span>multimedia system</span> is ready for operation. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.stereo.net.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 tuner for tv" class="if uuid-2457143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2457143.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The most affordable currently tuner DVB-T2 for a TV model T62M, developed by World Vision, estimated at 600-650 rubles.  The second modification of such a receiver Roks RKS-T202HD costs already 800-850 rubles.  Well, the NOMI T202 will cost 950‚Äì1000 rubles already. </p><p>  But the car digital receiver is an exclusive solution.  Therefore, you can buy it for 4,500-5,000 rubles.  At least, the previously reviewed RS DVB-T2 HD modification costs exactly that much. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  All previously considered devices have such advantages: reliability and acceptable functionality, allow you to turn an outdated model of the TV into a modern entertainment center.  Also their loyal pricing policy can be attributed to their advantages.  At the same time, no significant shortcomings were found during operation. </p><p>  Now let's decide which DVB-T2 tuner is best for a TV.  Technical specifications are almost the same.  The main difference is the specifications of the operating system.  From this position, the most advanced device is the T62M.  Moreover, he has the lowest cost.  It is this universal console that is recommended to be purchased. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationalproductreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvb t2 tuner reviews" class="if uuid-2457145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2457145.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this material, a series of digital devices such as the DVB-T2 tuner was considered.  From the standpoint of technical characteristics, the best of them is World Vision T62M.  It is capable of displaying images in 1080p / 1080i formats.  Also, this device implements the ability to work with external drives, and the interface set includes USB, HDMI and component connectors.  At the same time, in the first of them you can install a special WiFi adapter of the Ralink RT5370 modification and thereby connect the multimedia solution with the Internet and improve the tuner capabilities by an order of magnitude.  Also T62M supports IPTV technology.  It is due to the above characteristics that this device stands out from competitors, therefore it is recommended to purchase it. </p>
