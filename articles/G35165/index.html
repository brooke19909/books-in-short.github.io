Kola Peninsula: Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The legendary Hyperborea left its traces on the Kola Peninsula.  It is on this mysterious land with a rather harsh climate that the oldest pyramids of the world were found. </p><p>  According to legends and legends that have survived to this day, Hyperborea, the legendary northern country, was located in the peninsula area a long time ago.  Therefore, this amazing and mysterious land attracts explorers and travelers. </p><p>  After reading the article, you can find out more detailed information about the nature and attractions of the Kola Peninsula. </p><h2>  From mythology </h2><p>  The first information about this country dates back to ancient times.  The Hyperboreans mentioned ancient historians.  The word "hyperborean" had the following meaning: one who lives in the north, or one who lives beyond Borea (beyond the North wind). </p><p>  The inhabitants of Hyperborea, according to ancient sources, had great knowledge, and they were much smarter than the ancient Greeks.  It should be noted that Hercules, Apollo and Perseus (ancient Greek heroes) possessed the epithet "Hyperborean". </p><div class="photo" data-original="slavyanskaya-kultura.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mysteries of the Kola Peninsula" class="if uuid-2674200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2674200.jpg"></div><h2>  Kola Peninsula on a map of Russia </h2><p>  Specifications: </p><ul><li>  area - 100 thousand square meters.  kilometers; </li><li>  highest point - 1200 meters; </li><li>  geographical position - 68 ¬∞ north latitude and 36 ¬∞ east longitude; </li><li>  washing waters - the Barents Sea, the White Sea; </li><li>  subject of the Russian Federation - Murmansk region. </li></ul><p>  The Kola Peninsula is located in the European part of Russia (northwest).  Almost all of its territory is located beyond the Arctic Circle.  The Khibiny mountains up to 1200 meters high and the <span>Lovozersky tundra</span> (1120 meters) extend in the western part of the peninsula.  The nature of the Kola Peninsula is not very rich in vegetation: the north is represented by the tundra, the south by forest-tundra and taiga. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Kola Peninsula occupies about 70% of the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Murmansk region.  Its western border is defined by a depression passing along the Kole River, <span>Lake Imandra</span> and the Niva River from Kola to Kandalaksha Gulf. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="67.29944440000001" data-lng="37.55083330000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/4/5/9/6459.png"></div><h2>  Sights of the Kola Peninsula </h2><p>  Artifacts that confirm the existence of an ancient civilization in the Russian North are the main attraction of the peninsula.  Scientists who made the last scientific expedition to the pyramids of the Russian North, claim that these man-made structures are at least 9000 years old.  This indicates that the pyramids are 2 times older than the Egyptian ones.  It turns out that terrestrial civilization began to develop not from the South, but from the northern part of the planet. </p><p>  Geologists concluded that the elevations are anthropogenic in nature.  These hills (pyramids) are not natural, but the creation of human hands.  In addition, they were rebuilt three times - increasing their height.  Their cavities have the correct shape (research results by modern geophysical instruments), and what is located there is still unknown.  It is assumed that the functional purpose of the pyramids of the Kola Peninsula is an observatory that allows you to follow the stellar system.  The results of the analysis showed that the age of the mysterious observatory is nine thousand years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mir-i-mi.ucoz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hyperborea Pyramids" class="if uuid-2674275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2674275.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  It is assumed that Hyperborea at the North Pole existed approximately 20,000-4,000 years ago.  It was a fairly large mainland with a mild climate resembling a Mediterranean.  Lush and diverse vegetation grew there, and thermophilic animals inhabited.  In the very center of this country (at the pole) was the legendary Mount Meru. </p><p>  The inhabitants of this country possessed various skills - they could control the weather, build large structures and buildings, fly long distances (for good reason Perseus Hyperborean is depicted with wings on sandals).  Apparently, the Hyperboreans were not sick, they lived happily and without contention.  Satisfied with the life of the earth, they ended their life by jumping from high cliffs into the sea. </p><p>  Apparently, the Russian Hyperborea died, having gone under water in connection with some cataclysm that had occurred.  One of the versions is a meteorite fall and, as a result, a shift of the planet‚Äôs magnetic poles.  As a result, there was an increase in sea level and a sharp change in climatic conditions.  One of the evidence for the existence of Hyperborea, according to scientists, is the annual migration of birds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="horek.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landscapes of the Kola Peninsula" class="if uuid-2674236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2674236.jpg"></div><h2>  The fate of the Hyperboreans </h2><p>  The secrets of the Kola Peninsula are still unsolved.  There are many researchers who claim that there were surviving Hyperboreans who managed to cross into the territory of Asia and northern Europe.  So they spread all over the world.  They built pyramids (Egypt and other countries), temples (Greece), erected such complex structures as Stonehenge and Arkaim. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Slavs are considered one of the most direct descendants of the inhabitants of Hyperborea.  Many pagan myths of the Slavs mention this legendary mainland.  In addition, legends about the country of Sunflower, located far away, are found in Russian epics.  The name of the peninsula comes from the Indo-European ancient name of the Sun - Kolo.  Yes, and Nostradamus in his "Centuries" called the Russians "Hyperborean people." </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiatrek.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The nature of the Kola Peninsula" class="if uuid-2674192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2674192.jpg"></div><h2>  1920 expedition </h2><p>  The pyramids of the Kola Peninsula were first discovered in 1922, and the first expedition took place in 1920 under the guidance of the famous science fiction writer and explorer Alexander Barchenko. </p><p>  A.V. Barchenko (b. 1881) - writer, occultist, hypnotist and researcher of telepathy.  From his youthful age, he was distinguished by a penchant for everything mysterious and mysterious, as well as for mysticism.  He always believed that humanity arose in the very north of the planet during the Golden Age about 12 thousand years ago.  Barchenko already knew the approximate time of the disaster on the planet.  In his opinion, the time for changing the axis of rotation of the Earth is every 12,960 years. </p><p>  The writer was always convinced that the Hyperborean race was so highly developed that it was superior in its development to modern people today.  He drew all the information from secret literature accessible to him, and also believed that the ancient knowledge of the country was kept by shamans, who had long lived on the Kola Peninsula. </p><p>  During the expedition of Alexander Barchenko, at the foot of Mount Ninchurt, manholes were discovered that led into the dungeons.  According to the stories of local residents, those who tried to get inside, "had a sluggishness."  Barchenko also made an attempt to enter this dungeon.  However, having experienced a rather strange state, he refused a dangerous undertaking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="x-files.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Labyrinths of the peninsula" class="if uuid-2674255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2674255.jpg"></div><h2>  Expeditions 1998 and 2007 </h2><p>  The last official expedition was Hyperborea 98.  It included historians, archaeologists, geologists, ufologists, ethnographers, and even philosophers.  The organizers of the expedition are journalists who create documentaries from the HypoTeza cycle (Culture channel). </p><p>  Archaeologists on the slope of Mount Ninchurt discovered the remains of a masonry wall.  At the Holy Lake, they found an ancient seid, which is a huge stone of the correct form.  Coals were preserved in the cavity inside it, at its bottom.  Most likely, these are traces of some kind of magic ritual.  Another important find is the remains of an ancient observatory, which is a man-made pyramid and a gutter (15 meters) with two viziers. </p><p>  The third expedition to the Hyperborean Territory was carried out in 2007.  This journey was made in the wake of the previous two expeditions led by A. Barchenko and V. Demin.  During the trip, it was possible to find defensive and religious structures, the ruins of the same ancient observatory (the pyramids of the Kola Peninsula) and plates with mysterious signs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strekoza.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Seydozero on the Kola Peninsula" class="if uuid-2674469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2674469.jpg"></div><h2>  Pyramids </h2><p>  Near Seydozero (Holy Lake) in 1922 and in subsequent expeditions, hills resembling pyramids were found.  In their form, they are similar to <span>Mount Meru,</span> known as the "Axis of Peace". </p><p>  These two pyramidal structures, connected by a jumper and oriented to the cardinal points, have a height of about 50 meters.  Sami shamans apparently used ancient structures to conduct their magical rituals. </p><p>  The Hyperborean pyramids of the Kola Peninsula can be considered a place of Power.  Here, some may feel a deterioration in well-being, and some may discover various previously unknown abilities: the gift of prophecy, ability to speak other languages, etc. </p><h2>  For tourists </h2><p>  True lovers of romantic and active travels will enjoy tours of the most beautiful and mysterious places of the Kola Peninsula, shrouded in unsolved legends and secrets.  Fans of indelible impressions and tourists who want to plunge into the world of untouched nature and learn its riddles and secrets are required to make tours to the Kola Peninsula.  Lakes, rivers, seas, mountains and the Kuzomen desert (the most northern) - all this is located on a small site. </p><p>  It's not as cold as it seems.  Despite the fact that the air temperature in winter drops below -40 degrees, it is relatively comfortable due to low humidity.  There are many ski resorts where various services are provided in terms of outdoor activities.  Snowmobile safaris, reindeer and dog sled races, ski mountaineering, snowboarding, impressive river and sea walks, river rafting, fishing - all this can be done in this mysterious northern region.  There is even the opportunity to swim with the beluga, seals and whales.  There is a high probability of finding wartime objects in the water column. </p><p>  And there are plenty of attractions, including mysterious pyramids.  On the map of Russia, the Kola Peninsula looks like an inaccessible corner of the globe, but it's worth a visit, no matter what. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mir-i-mi.ucoz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mysterious rings" class="if uuid-2674279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2674279.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  According to the assumptions of Russian scientists, the pyramids of Egypt, as well as the pyramids of Mexico and Russia (including the Crimea), are an integral part of the energy and space-time global planetary biocomputer, which supports the Earth‚Äôs vital processes and is associated with the cosmic mind supporting the vital functions of the Universe. </p><p>  It turns out that Russian scientists have almost completely unraveled the mystery of the most ancient pyramids of the Earth.  Nevertheless, there is plenty of work for researchers on the Kola Peninsula. </p>
