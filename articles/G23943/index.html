    <h2>  Reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  Studying the comments of our compatriots, we can note the fact that many chose this hotel largely due to its original design.  According to most tourists, they were not disappointed in their decision.  So, in their opinion, despite the fact that the Caves Beach Resort 5 * was built recently, and there are still enough imperfections in it, travelers can safely count on a comfortable and memorable vacation. </p><p>  Many guests note interestingly decorated rooms.  By the way, the apartments offered to the guests seemed very spacious and clean.  The only minus some of our compatriots considered the fact that the rooms are a bit dark.  Of course, this was done to maintain the overall cave style, however, some guests would be glad if a few more light sources were added to the apartments. </p><p>  Almost all tourists were satisfied with the work of the restaurant in the hotel.  According to them, there is a very large selection of well-prepared dishes.  At the same time, one could always taste meat, fish, poultry, and, of course, a variety of snacks, salads, fruits, pastries, and sweets. </p><p>  As for the beach, in general, our compatriots liked it.  However, guests express their hope that the construction of the pier will be completed soon, since the sea has yet to go from the shore, and a couple hundred meters must be walked to the depth, which is not very convenient to do along the rocky bottom.  But by the way, if you wish, you can use the pier of a neighboring hotel. </p><p>  As for the staff, there were no serious complaints from the hotel guests in this matter.  So, according to tourists, the cleaning was carried out efficiently and regularly, the cooks worked perfectly, the waiters were quick, and the administrators were always polite and attentive. </p>
