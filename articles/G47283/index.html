The name of this place sounds truly fabulous and magical.  Most of the population of the island of the same name lives in the capital of the Balearic archipelago.  Every day, a huge number of tourist liners, completely packed with tourists, moor on the island. </p><p>  The vast majority of Mallorca's income comes from the tourism industry, which is the most developed in these parts.  There are a huge number of hotels of different classifications.  You can stay in the premium complex and in a simple budget hotel.  A worthy accommodation option in the resort is the Manaus <span>3 *</span> hotel <span>(Palma de Mallorca).</span> </p><p>  The favorable climate of the island has a calm and respectable rest at any time of the year.  Swimming on the beach begins in late April or early May, then a huge number of tourists come to the island. </p><p>  The water temperature rises to a maximum of +38 degrees, which allows even small children to bask in the sea foam.  In winter, the water temperature drops to +8, which pleases many "walruses" who arrived at the resort.  There is practically no snow in Mallorca, there can only be the thinnest layer that melts quickly. </p>

    <p>  At first glance, all the charm of this complex may not be noticed.  The old, dilapidated building does not look attractive at all.  But over time, you just stop paying attention to it.  Nevertheless, almost at any time, the hotel is just packed with tourists.  And if you do not book a room in advance, then you can stay without a bed for the night.  Sometimes you need to wait a few hours to check into the room.  At the same time, the administration offers to leave things in the safe and go for a walk or to taste local delicacies in the restaurant for an additional fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Apartments </h2>

    <p>  The rooms offer scenic views of the hotel's courtyard, sea and forest.  The rooms themselves are very spacious and comfortable.  The room has a safe.  Use is paid.  Television practically does not show Russian channels.  This is rather a plus, since you don‚Äôt really want to immerse yourself in television broadcasting on vacation.  A refrigerator is available at an additional cost.  He is locked, and the key is issued at the reception. </p><p>  For your convenience, each room has both air conditioning and a fan.  On the balcony there is a table with chairs.  The bathroom is in excellent condition.  Many travelers are pleased with the absence of insects. </p><h2>  Service </h2>

    <p>  It‚Äôs not always possible to run into the maids and see how the rooms are cleaned, but nevertheless they are always clean.  Towel change every day.  The staff does not tip, you can not even leave.  From the windows of some rooms you can see the roof of the dining room, which can be a lot of garbage.  For some reason, no one there ever cleans.  Internet can be used for 3 euros per day.  At the reception they issue a network access key. </p><p>  The beach is not very close, the path to it is not easy.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs good.  You can quickly burn unnecessary calories after hearty dinners in wonderful Spanish restaurants. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Manaus 3 * (Mallorca) offers visitors a variety of options.  You can only take breakfast or purchase a full package of food.  Ideal is to buy breakfast and lunch, and dine in local cafes.  The food does not differ in variety, but satisfying meal is enough.  The menu includes various dishes of meat and fish, an assortment of vegetables, salads, side dishes, soups, desserts and ice cream.  From fruits offer melons, apples, pineapples, watermelons, pears and plums. </p><p>  Drinks are served for a fee.  It's hard to stay hungry.  The food is cooked quality. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2>

    <p>  The beach here is one of the best.  Such clear sea and sand can only be found in the Caribbean.  Nevertheless, on the Mediterranean coast of Mallorca is no worse.  You can even see in the water how grains of sand move from the waves.  The sea is shallow, so you can safely come here with young children.  There are a lot of people on the beach in season.  For an additional fee, sun loungers and umbrellas are available.  Between the sunbeds can be located for free.  <span>Beach mats</span> are inexpensive, you can not carry with you.  All stores are littered with goods for vacationers.  Prices are low, but the quality is not very.  When buying an air mattress, you need to check it well for holes.  Although even the sellers themselves say that the fact that it is periodically blown away is normal.  Nobody will change anything for you. </p><p>  All day long drinks, fruits, glasses and other trifles are worn on the beach.  Massage therapists advertise their services. </p><h2>  Cafe near the hotel </h2><p>  Those who are tired of eating in the dining room of the complex, can go on a reconnaissance in local restaurants.  Especially tourists praise the cafe "Del Sol".  There are simply huge portions.  Prices are not the cheapest, but no one has regretted it yet.  In addition, you can use free internet and enjoy the gorgeous view.  Some restaurants do not always bring what the customer orders.  For example, in "El Puerto" often bring only part of the dish.  But perhaps there are some errors in the menu.  Near the hotel there is a tent with fruits, fast food, waffles and yogurt. </p><h2>  Sightseeing trips </h2><p>  The hotel Manaus 3 * (Mallorca, Spain) has a tour desk.  Vacationers are advised to purchase excursions only through a guide at the hotel.  So you can save and have a good time.  Most often advised to go on an inspection of the island.  Mallorca has many attractions, including the Luke Monastery.  You can get here only with a sightseeing tour.  The trip involves a visit to a leather factory, a monastery, a picturesque bay, the port of De Soller.  The whole trip is made on different modes of transport.  A ship delivers tourists to the port.  There is a local tram to Soller, and an old train to Mallorca. </p><p>  It is also worth going to Alcudia and visiting <span>Cape Formentor.</span>  <span>Mallorca is</span> not a very large island, but it is incredibly hot here.  If you want to enjoy not only a beach holiday, but also sightseeing, you must come here in early spring or autumn. </p><p>  It is worth a visit to La Seu Cathedral.  You can also get here by bus number 23, which runs from Hotel Alegria.  You can also go to the Aquarium.  But all these late ones are much cheaper if you arrange them through a guide. </p><p>  With children, you can visit Kathmandu Park.  A 5-minute drive away is a good water park.  On guided tours, guides mainly talk about the history of Mallorca. </p><p>  Do not be afraid to travel on your own.  Sometimes it is much more effective and informative than with a group. </p><h2>  Go shopping </h2><p>  There are practically no normal stores in El Arenal.  Mostly small <span>stalls</span> with cheap beachwear, fruits and other little things. </p><p>  For big purchases it is better to go to more developed areas.  Spain has a "tax free" system (value added tax refund system).  In large shopping centers, you can purchase various goods and at the same time collect checks.  On the last day of shopping you need to present all the checks and passport in the store.  Managers will draw up a form, which then should be presented at the airport.  They will put a stamp there, after which you can get back about 20% of the amount spent.  Even if you do not succeed in doing this in Spain when drawing up all the necessary documents, the money can be withdrawn in your country. </p><p>  Mallorca is a great place for families on the Mediterranean coast.  The resort is designed for people with an average income. </p>
