However, due to the fact that it will be needed anyway for full-fledged and legitimate activities, very many immediately ask themselves how to open a current account in Sberbank. </p><h2>  Why Sberbank? </h2><p>  As in any other bank, Sberbank has a lot of both positive and negative qualities.  However, it is for individual entrepreneurs that the proposed conditions are quite favorable, in comparison with other financial organizations.  In addition to the directly favorable conditions for opening and servicing an account, an additional advantage of Sberbank is a large number of service points, which greatly facilitates the work of an individual entrepreneur, makes it more comfortable and faster. </p>

    <p>  Also, it is Sberbank that is very highly reliable that for so many people who are worried about their money and want to <span>open a current account in Sberbank for</span> individual <span>entrepreneurs, it</span> plays an important role.  Nobody wants, once having come to the bank, to find out that all his accounts are frozen, since this organization went bankrupt.  The chance that this will happen to Sberbank is extremely minimal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Benefits of having an account </h2><p>  Thanks to the availability of a current account, the individual entrepreneur is able to quickly make any financial transactions in a cashless way: pay for goods and services, receive payments from other organizations and individuals, and so on.  Since legal entities are obliged to make all payments exclusively through a current account, the lack of such an individual entrepreneur can significantly complicate, or even nullify, all attempts to cooperate with counterparties. </p><p>  In addition, if you open a current account in Sberbank for individual entrepreneurs, you can conclude an agreement on the provision of payment terminals with a plastic card.  Previously, this was not particularly important, but recently more and more people understand the profitability, reliability and security of plastic cards and use them much more willingly and more often.  So, having the opportunity to pay for goods or services with a plastic card can attract more <span>potential customers</span> to the IP <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Card account </h2><p>  We should not forget that withdrawing money from an account in cash is far from always profitable and convenient.  However, if you tie the IP account to a plastic card issued specifically for this purpose, you can freely transfer funds to it, and subsequently, if necessary, cash them out.  All this is offered by Sberbank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is easier and faster to open an IP settlement account in it than in most other banks, and high reliability and low maintenance fees will allow you to comfortably and confidently use your account.  Also, this plastic card will help to pay more favorably and conveniently not only in the Russian Federation, but also in other countries, which can be very useful for those entrepreneurs who plan to conduct international activities. </p>

    <h2>  IP requirements </h2><p>  As such, Sberbank does not have direct requirements for an <span>individual entrepreneur</span> .  However, there is a certain list of necessary securities that an individual entrepreneur is obligated to provide to the bank, since it is simply impossible to open a current account for an individual entrepreneur whose agreement, documents or any other documents do not meet the requirements of the law. </p><p>  In order to have no complaints against an individual entrepreneur from either the bank or the legislative authorities, it is required to provide: </p><ul><li>  application for opening an account; </li><li>  certificate of registration in the tax (it should be notarized); </li><li>  <span>certificate of state registration of</span> IP (also notarized); </li><li>  a copy of the extract from the USRIP (from the moment such a statement is issued until the current account is opened, it should not take more than one month, otherwise it will not be considered valid); </li><li>  a copy of the relevant certificate from the statistical authorities; </li><li>  copy of the license if the activity of an individual entrepreneur is subject to licensing; </li><li>  copy of the passport of the entrepreneur himself; </li><li>  a print of the seal and sample signatures of all persons who, to one degree or another, will have access to a current account (chief accountant, deputy, senior administrator, etc.). </li></ul><p>  After providing all the listed securities, the account will be opened in the near future. </p>

    <h2>  Sberbank Terms </h2><p>  According to what the instruction on opening a current account in a bank for private entrepreneurs says, tariffs and payments for its opening and maintenance may vary, depending on the territory in which the opening takes place.  On average, the payment directly for the opening itself will be in the region of 2000 rubles, and the monthly service ranges from 1500 rubles. </p><p>  In addition, you can immediately write an application for connecting Internet banking and a corporate card.  These financial instruments will eliminate the need to visit the bank often (and, as a result, there will be no need to lose time in the queue) and will allow you to easily and easily cash out the required amount if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  pros </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, Sberbank has many advantages, especially for those who want to open an account for an individual entrepreneur in Sberbank.  What most entrepreneurs need to know if they are looking for a financial institution that would agree to open an account for them is the fact that their funds will be completely safe at Sberbank.  The reliability of this organization is unparalleled among other banks of the Russian Federation.  In addition, the convenience and ease of maintenance, relatively low tariffs, the absence of hidden fees and charges and the huge number of branches and branches in all cities of the country - all this will help to make the right choice. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  As in any other organization, Sberbank has some negative aspects.  Despite the huge number of service points, the number of its customers is so large that very often in the departments you have to stand in lines.  Naturally, this is not acceptable <span>for an individual entrepreneur whose</span> time costs money.  However, once you have stood in line to open a current account with Sberbank for an individual entrepreneur, you should immediately apply for the connection of Internet banking and a plastic card to this account.  Due to the opportunities provided by such financial instruments, further visits to the bank can be minimized. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Summarizing all of the above, we can conclude that opening a current account in Sberbank for entrepreneurs will be a very profitable and convenient solution for most citizens.  Perhaps in other banks you can find lower rates for servicing, opening an account or other bonuses that are not provided by Sberbank, but when it comes to cash, it is recommended to overpay a little and be absolutely sure of their safety.  This is much better than constantly twitching and worrying about whether it will be possible to work with your account tomorrow or if the bank suddenly closes (or the license is taken from him). </p><p>  In fact, there are many reasons why a financial institution can suddenly freeze money in an entrepreneur‚Äôs account, and not all of them depend directly on the bank, but if possible, such risks should be minimized.  It‚Äôs one thing - if the movement of the account is stopped for a short time and one contract breaks down, it‚Äôs very unpleasant, but tolerable, and it‚Äôs quite another thing if, after receiving a large amount of money, the businessman‚Äôs account will be ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù allegedly arrested, frozen, closed etc. </p>
