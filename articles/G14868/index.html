    <p>  Let's consider in stages one of the ideas that tells about how to make glasses for Monster High dolls from clay.  For this it is necessary to prepare the following materials: self-hardening polymer clay of any color, cellophane, varnish, transparent or dark plastic.  Working process: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Take the doll and put a piece of cellophane on her face, this is necessary in order to correctly determine the necessary dimensions of the craft quickly. </li><li>  Roll small pieces of clay into tubes and apply toys to your face, simulating the desired shape of the spectacle frame (without arches). </li><li>  Then remove the cellophane from the workpiece and lay on a hard surface.  Immediately proceed to the formation of the frame by lightly pressing on clay, resulting in a flat figure.  All curvatures must be cut with a knife or trimmed with your fingers. </li><li>  To start working on the temples, for this it is necessary to measure the distance from the edges of the frames of the glasses to the ears of the doll and mold them from the material used.  If desired, pieces of thin wire can be placed in the temples. </li><li>  Next, you need to attach the arms to the frame so that they hold well on the toy.  Leave to dry completely. </li><li>  To make glasses for future glasses, they need to be cut from a plastic bottle of a suitable color, and then gently glued to the frame. </li><li>  Open the finished product with varnish of a suitable color. </li><li>  To further decorate the craft, it can be decorated with various clay flowers. </li></ol><p>  When working with polymer clay, it is necessary to take into account the fact that it hardens very quickly, so all actions must be performed without delay. </p><h2>  Plastic beauty </h2><p>  Sometimes to create interesting and stylish things you can use the materials that are most often thrown away.  These items include empty plastic containers of cotton candy or other products.  Meanwhile, they can be an excellent blank for doll glasses.  Consider how to make glasses for Monster High dolls self-made using recycled materials.  To do this, you will need such materials: an empty transparent container, a plastic bottle, scotch tape, nail polish of any color, glue, <span>manicure scissors, a</span> pencil and a sheet of paper. </p>

    <ol><li>  On a sheet of paper, draw glasses of the desired shape and size (measure the width, height, nose bridge and length of the arches of the glasses on the doll). </li><li>  Cut the drawing with scissors and stick it on a thin tape. </li><li>  Next, stick the adhesive tape with the workpiece onto a small piece of a rectangular shape cut from a plastic container. </li><li>  Then you should cut such glasses, along with the holes for the glasses. </li><li>  After the work done, it is necessary to proceed to the next stage for the manufacture of glasses.  They will not be cut separately, but glued to the back of the glasses frame.  To do this, you need to take a piece of rectangular plastic from a dark bottle, attach a blank to it and scratch it with the edge of the scissors along the contour of the glasses.  Cut the scratched shape. </li><li>  Now you should glue the two blanks together with glue, you need to do this carefully so that there are no glasses on the glasses.  Before gluing two layers of arches, the lower one must be bent first, and then the outer part should be glued over it.  Otherwise, the layers of the arches will diverge. </li><li>  The final stage will be painting the product with varnish. </li></ol><p>  In the process of the work, very beautiful glasses are obtained, which can be additionally decorated using several colors of varnish.  Also sometimes interspersed with sequins in the frame of the crafts, which gives the product elegance and sophistication. </p><h2>  Openwork weaving </h2><p>  All products created from copper wire look unusually beautiful and stylish.
