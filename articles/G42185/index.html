  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitted ties: a feast, a peace, and good people!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The male image is very easy to raise to a level higher if you add interesting details.  It can be a watch or a scarf in your pocket, but nothing looks as good as knitted ties! </p><p>  In combination with the classic style, they simply flip your mind and catch your eye so much that it‚Äôs hard to look away.  Although they look luxurious and expensive with a jacket, trousers and a shirt, you can make them yourself in half an hour! </p><h2>  Completely new </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Internet is full of various products where you can find knitted ties, but in real life it is not so easy to meet them.  If you think about it, then most likely, many simply don‚Äôt know that such an augmented image does not look silly, but stylish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sferamagazine.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted ties are different" class="if uuid-2523233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2523233.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the limited variety in the stores also makes you sad, because what remains to be done if none of all the colors suits you?  Of course, you need to contact us for help, as it is today that we will tell you how to make a man's knitted tie. </p><p>  In order not to mislead you, we immediately say that it will be better and easier to make such a variation of this men's accessory as a bow tie, and there are several reasons for this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, it is easier to combine with the rest of the wardrobe.  Secondly, its scheme is more understandable and quick to manufacture, and the image with a butterfly looks much fresher and brighter! </p><h2>  Tool list </h2><p>  Most likely, if you have been fond of knitting for a long time, then you already have everything you need at home, because a knitted bow tie is made from ordinary leftover yarn.  And if you don‚Äôt have them, then you can find everything you need in the shops for creativity: </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme for a tie" class="if uuid-2523324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2523324.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Yarn.  You can use any of its appearance, colors or even unnecessary residues from other products.  The most important thing is that everything looks concise together! </li><li>  The hook that you need to match the thickness of your thread. </li><li>  Needle for further stitching of parts. </li><li>  An elastic band, ribbon or lace that will hold your knitted tie. </li><li>  The scheme will also facilitate your entire work process. </li></ol><p>  After everything you need is ready, you can safely start crafting knitted ties. </p><h2>  Manufacturing Process: Crocheted Bow Tie </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fancy Knitted Tie" class="if uuid-2523229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2523229.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Guided by the scheme, start knitting with a set of air loops.  For an average tie size, you need to dial 45-50 loops, but remember that depending on the type of yarn and hook, the sizes will vary.  So make sure in advance whether this length suits you (keep in mind that the entire number of loops will be folded in half). </li><li>  Fold the chain in a circle and continue knitting according to the scheme with single crochet.  At this stage, you can change the colors of the yarn, make simple splashes, or even try simple patterns.  The total thickness with a length of 45-50 loops should be about 15-20 rows. </li><li>  With a needle with a thread matching the knitted base of the tie, make several large stitches in the center to form the correct fold in the middle of the bow, as can be seen in the photo above.  Thanks to the soft yarn, the fabric is very pliable, so it‚Äôs very easy to get a beautiful shape. </li><li>  We also knit a jumper according to the scheme, but already from 15 air loops.  In this case, it is not necessary to lock everything in the ring. </li><li>  Knit 3-5 rows of single crochet to the required width, cut the thread and use it to sew a jumper into the ring, wrapping around our knitted base. </li><li>  Make a strip for the neck from any material by attaching fasteners to its ends for easier use.  For a tight-fitting butterfly, even a dark elastic band that can be beautifully designed is suitable, and for a free version, a knitted strip that matches the main accessory will look great. </li><li>  It remains only to fix the ribbon for the neck on the bow-tie with inconspicuous seams, after which this wonderful bow-tie can be put on and put out immediately! </li></ol><h2>  Finished result </h2><p>  The knitted ties that we did today have gone great, so you can be proud of yourself.  In addition, such a men's jewelry can be created not only for each set of clothes, but also as a gift. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bow tie made of yarn" class="if uuid-2523217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2523217.jpg"></div><p>  Just imagine how a person will be delighted and surprised when they receive such an original and beautiful accessory.  It will be really very unusual, and you can easily stand out from the crowd. </p><p>  Indeed, at present, a bow tie is a fashion trend that many are chasing, and we just could make it with our own hands! </p>
