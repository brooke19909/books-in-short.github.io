It is unique in its beauty and fascinates with mystery.  From all sides this lake is surrounded by ridges and massifs, in connection with which it is often called the "drop of the sea among the mountains."  And this is far from the only epithet.  Locals also use other names - "the pearl of the Carpathians", "sea eye", "lake of lovers."  Each of them in its own way reflects the essence and legends associated with this amazing creation of nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Synevyr Lake" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/485015.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Located within a mountain range called the Carpathians, Lake Synevyr was formed in the postglacial period at an altitude of 987 meters above sea level.  It was the result of a blockage in the Mezhgorny district of the Transcarpathian region.  Nearby is the small village of Sinevirskaya Polyana, which is located in a gorge formed by the mountains of Slenizir and Ozernaya, as well as a spur of the Water Separating Range. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The total area of ​​the reservoir is about seven hectares.  The average depth here is 16 meters, while its maximum is 24 meters.  Synevyr Lake is fed by surface water and precipitation.  And from it flows a small stream.  There is an island on its territory, which is located in the central part.  You can see it only in the summer and only subject to a small amount of rainfall.  When it appears, from a height it all resembles an eye with a pupil (island) and eyelashes (forests).  The water in the lake is very clear and clean, therefore, as a rule, the bottom is visible through it.  It has a constant temperature of 11 degrees.  Aquatic vegetation here is actively developing only within the coastal strip.  The shores themselves are covered with dense forests.  On high mountain meadows that have not yet been touched by civilization, in the area of ​​the reservoir, there are about a hundred different varieties of endangered and rare plants.  As for the local fauna, its representatives are certain species of microscopic crustacean creatures, and trout are also found. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Synevyr rest" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/485018.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is believed that the girl’s father categorically opposed such a union, so he ordered his servants to throw a large stone at the guy.  Upon learning of the death of her lover, Xin ran to the scene of the tragedy, hugged the guy, cried for several days and nights.  This continued until a body of water formed from tears carried it to its depths.  About this sad story in our time resembles a sculpture made by Transcarpathian mahogany masters in 1983.  It is for this reason that Synevyr is commonly called the "lake of lovers."  A small island in the center of the reservoir, which was mentioned earlier, is considered the place where Vir was killed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Synevyr photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/485016.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  National park </h2><p>  In 1974, the USSR government decided on the need to protect such a unique natural attraction as Lake Synevyr.  As a result of this, a landscape reserve appeared, which received the status of a natural national park in 1989.  Currently, its area is more than forty thousand hectares, while six thousand of them are protected areas.  Nowadays, the natural national park "Synevyr" is not only a famous lake.  It also includes other attractions, among which it should be noted <span>Lake Wild,</span> swamp Gluhany and many other interesting places.  The timber rafting museum located on the territory of the park deserves special words - the only <span>hydraulic structure of</span> this kind built on the water.  In general, each of the corners of the park is a real picturesque picture that opens before the gaze of the traveler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recreation and tourism </h2><p>  From the well-known resorts “Mezhgorye”, “Pylypets”, “Izki”, “Podobovets” you can quickly get to Lake Synevyr.  Rest and tourism here are quite common throughout the year.  The main local treasures are the clean air, forests untouched by humans, environmentally friendly berries and mushrooms.  In summer, trekking, hiking and horse riding are very popular.  In winter, lovers of skiing and snowboarding come here.  It should be noted that to go here to ride makes sense only to beginners.
