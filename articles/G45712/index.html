It is best for the boy to give <span>carpentry tools</span> and a piece of wood in his hands, proposing to create something interesting.  And what could be more interesting than creating a flying glider? </p><p>  <strong>DIY glider: Arsenal</strong> </p><p>  When choosing a tree, it is easiest to take a pine tree.  Paper will be needed for pasting surfaces, it is better to take <span>tissue paper.</span>  PVA glue is quite suitable, the thicker the better.  Elastic band ("Hungarian") is needed to connect removable parts and for the motor.  A sharp boot knife is the main tool.  A manual jigsaw is essential for cutting curly details.  Many of them will need to be pre-processed before production, so that the participation of serious machine tools is indispensable. </p><p>  <strong>Start</strong> </p><p>  First you need to explain to the boy how to handle a knife and a jigsaw.  Safety in this case is not particularly useful, it will still be studied by trial and error.  A brief outline of the overall work plan and expected result should also be outlined.  Knowing what will turn out in the end, he will make every effort to make the glider with his own hands exactly the way the imagination draws him. </p><p>  <strong>Design</strong> </p>

The wings are made in the form of a central horizontal section with a length of 600 millimeters and a width of 100 millimeters and two ‚Äúears‚Äù bent upwards with a length of 150 millimeters.  The structure of the wing is simple.  It consists of two rails five by five millimeters in section, passing through the front and rear edges of the wing, and ribs located across the structure every five to seven centimeters.  In shape, they should resemble a drop to provide glider <span>lift.</span>  You can make them from two curved slats, but it is better to give the child a stack of thin pieces of wood and a jigsaw.  The stabilizer and keel are made trellised from the same rails five by five millimeters in cross section.  The stabilizer is 200 x 70 millimeters, the keel is a trapezoid with bases 70 and 40 millimeters and a height of 100 millimeters.  All parts are glued and clamped with something heavy.  After that they are pasted over with paper.  The main thing is that the paper is pulled.  The wings are attached to the fuselage with rubber at a distance of about one third of the length from the front end.  A keel is attached to the rear end, followed by a stabilizer.  A drop-shaped weight is attached to the nose of the aircraft, the size and weight of which depends on the weight and location of the elements of the aircraft.  You can praise the child: he made a glider with his own hands!

    <p>  After happy hours of work and cheerful launches of the aircraft, you can think about the further activities of the child.  If a child is carried away, for example, by decorating an airplane, you can make various models with him - copies of airplanes.  And you can offer him to make a more complex version of the aircraft using a rubber engine.  Making airplane models with your own hands is interesting and informative.  After all, aviation is a whole world that always attracts boys.  If the child was able to make a glider with his own hands, then everything can be trusted with him.  Or almost everything. </p>
