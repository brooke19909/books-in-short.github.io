There are several such places in Russia.  First of all, Kamchatka is famous for it - “the land of ice and fire”.  There are thermal springs in Altai, the Caucasus, in the Baikal region.  Their healing properties have long been used in medicine. </p><h2>  Thermal springs of the Stavropol Territory </h2><p>  In the Stavropol Territory, the first thermal spring was discovered back in 1959 on the banks of the river.  Big Zelenchuk.  To this day, he fills the baths of a small hydropathic institution in the village.  Voronezh: people with various disorders of the cardiovascular, nervous and endocrine systems come here to improve their health. </p>

Kazminskoe (Stavropol Territory) is a small settlement founded in the middle of the 19th century by immigrants from near Kharkov and Orel.  Even now, the number of villagers is only 7 thousand people.  At the end of the 70s of the last century, a geological exploration group studied the <span>Stavropol Upland</span> for the presence of oil deposits.  Then Kazminskoe waited for her finest hour.  The new thermal spring came as a surprise to scouts: the find, to put it mildly, did not meet expectations.  But all that is being done is for the better: the locals have only won.  Thanks to the wonderful gift of nature, the village received an additional impetus to development: numerous vacationers provide an opportunity to earn and improve the quality of life of the population.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Physico-chemical characteristics of the source </h2><p>  It is unlikely that there are people who want to bathe in 120-degree boiling water, so you have to cool the water from the source before use.  High temperature also determines its unique characteristics, analogues of which can only be found in Kamchatka.  Scientists at the State Scientific Research Institute of Balneology rank the Kazminsky thermal spring as “typical high-rate nitrogen-silicon alkaline mineralized deep waters”.  They are not suitable for drinking, since they contain almost half of the periodic table, but they can be effectively used in hydrotherapy: the researchers did not find toxic or harmful substances and elements. </p>

    <p>  Many are attracted by the opportunity to splash in 45-degree water when it is freezing outside, and fluffy white snowdrifts surround the pool.  This opportunity gives its fans Kazminsky thermal spring.  The schedule of the complex allows you to visit it at any time of the year.  Especially such entertainment is in demand for Epiphany: on January 19, the real crowds besiege the pool. </p><h2>  Base in Belovsky </h2><p>  As they say, demand creates supply.  In 2009, another recreation center was built three kilometers from the village of Kazminskoye.  A new thermal spring was not needed: both complexes are provided by one well with a depth of 2720 meters (this is the very “high flow rate” noted by scientists - the ability of a well or well to provide sufficient water). </p><p>  The recreation center near the Belovsky farm is rapidly developing.  The visitors here have nine outdoor pools with healing water, divided into three “territories”.  Each of them has three reservoirs: </p><ul><li>  main, the temperature in which is about 34-39 ° C; </li><li>  hot (40-43 <sup>about</sup> C); </li><li>  cold (10-25 <sup>o</sup> C). </li></ul><p>  Bathers will have to plunge into each one in turn to enjoy contrasting sensations and additional bonuses: Sharko shower, Jacuzzi effect, “air cushion” or meditate under the “cobra” waterfall.  Kazminsky thermal spring, visitors assure, has a magical effect: bathers feel rejuvenated, healthy and relaxed.  All life's adversities and troubles recede into the background.  After water procedures, the body embraces pleasant fatigue, I want to lie in a comfortable bed and sleep well. </p>

    <h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Such a desire is quite feasible: there is a hotel on the territory of the complex where you can rent a room and stay for a couple of days or weeks.  This is very convenient, especially in the case of a course of treatment, since it lasts from 10 to 15 days. </p><p>  Increasingly, the Kazminsky thermal spring is visited by people from distant regions of the country.  In many respects, this is the merit of competent management.  In 2013, the complex acquired an official website where everyone can get acquainted with a variety of useful information: work schedule, cost of visits, a detailed description and photos of the pools.  The site will help you choose and book a hotel room. </p><h2>  Place of everyday rest </h2><p>  Lucky Stavropolites living nearby, the hotel is useless.  One can only envy them: it is difficult to come up with a better way to relieve stress after a hard working day than the Kazminsky thermal spring.  <span>The work schedule</span> from this point of view is very convenient: you can splash around in the pool from 10-00 to 22-00 (visitors are allowed to pass until 21-00).  So it’s quite possible to leave the office, plunge the family into the car and go swimming in healthy mineral water in order to return home happy and relaxed. </p>
