    <p>  What is the closest planet to the sun? </p><p>  The planet closest to the luminary is Mercury.  It has a very small size, rocky structure.  And proximity to the Sun determines the inconceivably high temperature on the surface of the planet.  Mercury is the fastest planet in our system.  The duration of its rotation around the Sun is 88 Earth days. </p><p>  Now name the planets of the earth group!  We have already remembered the closest planet to the Sun.  Hint: in addition to Mercury, also Venus, Earth and Mars are separated from other planets orbiting a star by an asteroid belt.  Therefore, they are called the terrestrial planets. </p>

However, the atmosphere on this planet is very dense, tens of times denser than the earth, and incredibly hot.  These features of the atmosphere determine the characteristic gentle color of the planet, for which it was identified with the female deity of love.  It is interesting that here the whole day lasts 243 Earth days, but the Venusian year is shorter - only 225 days.  In addition, it is the only planet in our star system that rotates counterclockwise.  There is no generally accepted explanation for this phenomenon. </p><p>  Mars is the personification of war. </p><p>  The reddish body in the starry sky of many ancient peoples was associated with fire and destruction.  Actually, thanks to its ominous appearance, Mars got its name, becoming the god of war in Roman mythology.  On this planet is the highest mountain of the entire solar system.  <span>Mount Olympus</span> reaches almost 27 km in height, it is three times higher than our earthly Everest.  <span>The surface of Mars is</span> very mottled with many canyons and mountain ranges.  Some of them have such a bizarre shape that people who have observed them through a telescope have repeatedly rushed to declare the artificial origin of these formations. </p><p>  Jupiter and Saturn - giant planets </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neptune planet solar system" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/147852.jpg" width="600"></div>

Jupiter exceeds the mass of the Earth by 318 times.  Interestingly, it is a gas cluster.  It is impossible for a spaceship to land on the planet, since it does not have solid soil, but consists mainly of active hydrogen and helium.  Saturn exceeds the mass of the Earth by about 95 times, although it is also not a solid in the Earth's representation.  It is famous for its rings, which are clearly visible around the planet.  They are formed from dust and small satellites orbiting.  Only more or less large satellites at Saturn, there are 62. </p><p>  Uranus is a planet with many satellites. </p><p>  Of all the <span>planets, Uranus</span> is the lightest.  Its interesting feature is that it rotates as if lying on its side. </p><p>  Neptune - the planet of the solar system </p><p>  The mass of Neptune is 17 times greater than the earth.  Moreover, its density is also higher than the earth.  Neptune has thirteen satellites, the largest of which is called Triton.  He is the only planetary satellite in our system that moves in the opposite direction. </p><p>  And what body closes this row? </p><p>  And now I’m asking you, name the last planet orbiting the Sun!  We have already named the closest planet to the Sun, gas giants, a <span>planet with a ring</span> and the largest satellite of Neptune, but what about the borders of our star system?  If you think that this is Pluto, then you are mistaken.  A few years ago, such an answer would be true, but not today.  After the discovery of some other Pluto, not inferior to it in the size of bodies, but not moving in a clear planetary orbit, the question arose in the scientific world: "What, in fact, is legitimate to call a planet?"  The consensus was as follows.  The planet must: </p><p>  1) circulate in the orbit of the sun; </p><p>  2) have sufficient dimensions to take a spherical shape under the influence of its own gravity; </p><p>  3) to clear the path for oneself in orbit, and not to leave it under the influence of other bodies. </p><p>  Alas, Pluto does not meet these parameters, like many bodies in the so-called Kuiper belt, discovered on the outskirts of the solar system in the last decade: Eris, Sedna and others. </p>
