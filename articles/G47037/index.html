The best hotels of the Krasnodar Territory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who plan to spend a vacation on the sea coast, improve their health and gain vitality are well suited for holidays in the Krasnodar Territory.  Hotels here have a variety of price categories and are ready to accept tourists of any income.  This is one of the richest and most beautiful Russian regions.  A feature of relaxation in the resorts of the region is not only a great opportunity to bask in the sun somewhere in Sochi or Yeysk, splashing around in the sea water, but also get acquainted with many historical monuments. </p><p>  Anapa, Tuapse, Gelendzhik ... These resorts offer many kilometers of beaches, interesting places for hiking, exciting diving and the pristine beauty of the surrounding nature.  Rest here is combined with wellness and medical procedures, which use water from mineral springs and, of course, healing mud, for which many people come to the Krasnodar Territory. </p><h2>  All Inclusive Hotels </h2><p>  The all inclusive concept at our resorts is a relatively young concept.  The owners of the domestic hotel business have adopted it from their foreign colleagues.  However, Russians are well aware of this service, so they appreciate all-inclusive hotels when they come to Krasnodar Krai.  The coastal hotels of the region work mainly on this concept. </p><p>  Tourists are attracted by the fact that the whole range of services offered by the hotel can be obtained for a single, pre-set price.  This means that residents can spend the entire vacation, paying for it at the very beginning, in a travel company, and no longer spend almost nothing during their entire vacation on room, food and entertainment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This option, according to many, contributes to cost savings and makes it possible to spend a good time by the sea for a relatively small fee.  True, at the same time, for those who come <span>to Krasnodar Krai,</span> all-inclusive hotels provide only standard services, as elsewhere in the world, offering additional entertainment for a fee.  But many <span>all inclusive</span> package is quite happy. </p><h2>  Upscale Hotels </h2>
