This question is asked by anyone who is first planning their vacation in Thailand.  Both resorts are on everyone's hearing.  These are huge recreational areas with an abundance of entertainment for every taste and budget.  In many ways they are similar, but they also have differences. </p><h2>  Pattaya </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cntravels.com.np" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya nature" class="if uuid-2388114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2388114.jpg"></div><p>  The resort surprises with its dynamism.  Pattaya consists of an endless cycle of events in which all its inhabitants are involved.  At the disposal of energetic and curious tourists, night clubs and discos, excursions to ancient Thai temples, tasty and exotic food, a clean and warm sea. </p><p>  The epicenter of the cultural and resort life of Pattaya is the main walking artery of Walking Street.  Prices in this part of Thailand are considered the most affordable.  The thing is that the village is located just two hours from Bangkok International Airport, whose runways were chosen by low-cost airlines. </p><p>  Pattaya Strengths: </p><ul><li>  low prices; </li><li>  plenty of entertainment; </li><li>  dynamism; </li><li>  proximity to transport hubs in Thailand; </li><li>  vast and clean beaches. </li></ul><h2>  Phuket </h2><p>  As for the country's second most popular resort, it is chosen by a respectable and respectable audience.  Fashionable family hotels are concentrated on its coast.  The resort is divided into several large recreational areas: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Patong </li><li>  Kamala. </li><li>  Karon Beach </li><li>  Phuket (municipality). </li></ul><p>  Nightclubs and discos are located in Patong.  This is the noisiest part of the coast.  Kamala is the choice of those who value pristine nature.  The beauty of the local beaches is fascinating.  Karon Beach is designed for fans of active sports.  Its beaches are chosen by surfers.  The city is a place for meeting friends and shopping.  Hundreds of boutiques and souvenir shops, restaurants and traditional Thai eateries are concentrated on its streets. </p><p>  Strengths of Phuket: </p><ul><li>  quiet and secluded beaches; </li><li>  clear and transparent sea; </li><li>  comfortable hotels; </li><li>  wealthy European public; </li><li>  A large selection of programs designed for families with children. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantage of the resort is its remoteness from the capital region.  Transport accessibility also leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  Difficult choice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket nature" class="if uuid-2388113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2388113.jpg"></div><p>  So, Pattaya or Phuket?  The answer depends on the purpose of the trip, the composition of travelers and the availability of finance.  Let's figure it out! </p><h2>  Best kids </h2><p>  When traveling with kids, parents carefully plan their route.  Choose a hotel and carefully study the reviews.  Therefore, the question: "Pattaya or Phuket?"  especially relevant for them.  Experienced tourists claim that the beaches of both resorts are equally suitable for families.  They have developed infrastructure and everything necessary for swimming. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Battle of the beaches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.phuketgazette.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Beach" class="if uuid-2388110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2388110.jpg"></div><p>  If you believe the reviews, then the cleanliness of the coast of Pattaya is still inferior to the order that prevails in the recreational areas in Phuket.  The beaches are noisy and crowded.  The cleanest parts of Pattaya are Naklua and Jomtien.  Near them there are cafes and restaurants, sports equipment rentals.  Children ride on inflatable "bananas", and adults on the "tablets". </p><p>  Phuket has a variety of beaches.  The most popular among Russians is Karon.  It is covered with imported sand with a high content of quartz, which, if stepped on, emits a characteristic crunch.  There are no complaints about the sea in Phuket.  The exception is Patong.  It resembles the noisy and cheerful coast of Pattaya. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Where is the best entrance to the sea, in Pattaya or in Phuket?  In both resorts, the coast is gentle.  The depth of water increases gradually.  The bottom is sandy everywhere.  True, in Pattaya around May strong excitement begins.  Swimming becomes unpleasant, and sometimes dangerous.  The storm ends in late October. </p><p>  The sea in Phuket is mild in nature.  But in some places <span>of Knighton Beach</span> there are underwater pits.  They are very shallow, but those who come here with young children need to be extremely careful.  High waves at all resorts of the island are a rarity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Issue price </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelplusstyle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in Phuket" class="if uuid-2388112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2388112.jpg"></div><p>  And yet, what to choose - Pattaya or Phuket?  Where is better and cheaper to relax?  The abundance of entertainment facilities that are concentrated in Pattaya allows the resort to welcome travelers all year round.  The cost of accommodation, food and travel services in this part of Thailand is considered the lowest. </p><p>  For a bed in a decent hostel they ask 500 rubles a day.  For a room in a comfortable hotel you need to pay about 1,000 rubles.  Based on the reviews of Russians, a <span>rating of the best hotels in Pattaya</span> was compiled: </p><ul><li>  Nova Platinum Hotel. </li><li>  Venu Residence Cabaret SPA. </li><li>  Dranken Duck Guesthouse. </li><li>  “Vog Hotel.” </li><li>  "Siam Guesthouse". </li><li>  Whitehouse Condotel. </li><li>  Mosaic Luxury Apartments. </li><li>  Centara Pattaya Hotel. </li><li>  “Zing Resort SPA”. </li><li>  High Lords Residence. </li></ul><p>  In Phuket there are hotels of various levels.  There are premium options and simple but cheap.  The cost of living in local hostels is almost the same as in Pattaya.  But the hotels are more expensive.  Up to 40,000 rubles are asked in them per night.  List of hotels that have received the maximum tourist ratings: </p><ul><li>  Lofts Boutique Hotel Apartments. </li><li>  Savasdi Village </li><li>  "Centara Karon Resort Phuket." </li><li>  "Marriott Phuket Resort SPA." </li><li>  Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort. </li><li>  "Dusit Thani Laguna Phuket." </li><li>  "Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort." </li><li>  "Suga Marina Resort." </li><li>  "Movenpic Resort SPA Karon Beach Phuket." </li><li>  "Racha." </li><li>  "Nap Patong." </li></ul><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Pattaya or Phuket?  Where better and tastier food?  A comprehensive lunch in the area of ​​the beaches of Pattaya will cost 300 rubles.  In Phuket, they are already asking for 500 rubles for lunch. </p><p>  The most popular and affordable eateries in Pattaya are Yasmins Cafe, Bronx Pizza, Davis Cantina, Dosa Hut, Imli Grill, Tinnis Thailand, Pool Siam, Rinapp Restaurant, La Strada Cafe ”,“ Kiss Food ”. </p><p>  In Phuket, Russians choose the restaurants Tavern and Noti Nuris Phuket, Le Brooklyn Patting and Pad Thai Shop, Golden Pradiz Restaurant, New Cafe, Mr. Coffee, Da Puccio Restaurant, Tandoori Flames ”,“ Halvey Inn ”and“ Sandwich Shop Cafe ”. </p><h2>  Minor expenses </h2><p>  So what should a tourist stop at - Pattaya or Phuket?  What to choose?  How much money to cook?  No additional costs can not do.  On the beaches of Pattaya, 300 rubles are asked for renting a deck chair and an umbrella.  This is a standard rate.  It operates everywhere in Thailand. </p><p>  True, Phuket will have to fork out additionally if the plans include independent travels around the island.  Renting a moped costs 400 rubles.  A trip by public transport will cost 500 rubles. </p><h2>  Warmer climes </h2><p>  What to choose in Thailand?  Pattaya or Phuket?  Both resorts have a year-round holiday.  The high season in Pattaya begins at the very end of October, and ends in early March.  Phuket is warm and quiet in November, December, January, February, March and the first half of April.  Therefore, the answer to these questions depends on the date of the planned trip to Thailand. </p><h2>  Wandering wind </h2><p>  Is it better to go to Pattaya or Phuket during the off-season?  Pattaya is a resort where tourists are welcome at any time of the year.  About 150,000 people live in it.  Almost all of them are engaged in the service sector.  Therefore, the local infrastructure is considered the most developed in all of Thailand.  In high season, the beaches of Pattaya are crowded, there are few empty seats.  But in the off-season, the coast is empty, and housing prices are fifty percent lower. </p><p>  In Phuket, hotel rooms are more expensive even during the wet monsoon season.  But entertainment during the quiet period is much less than that of the neighbors.  Therefore, here Phuket loses the noisy and dynamic Pattaya. </p><h2>  Crime </h2><p>  Pattaya or Phuket reviews say that both resorts are safe for foreign tourists.  The crime rate here is low.  But since youth companies are gathering in Pattaya, and alcohol is pouring in, care should be taken in this part of Thailand. </p><p>  You should not take large amounts of money with you if you are going for a walk along Walking Street.  Experienced tourists do not recommend wandering at night alone in the unknown neighborhoods in which the locals live. </p><p>  There is order in Phuket.  Party parties on the island do not roll up.  The local people are good-natured and friendly people.  You can face theft only in the market square or in nightclubs.  Police arrive at the scene promptly.  Tourists are assisted in the restoration of documents, are allowed to contact friends and family. </p><h2>  sights </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.scmp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya Attractions" class="if uuid-2388116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2388116.jpg"></div><p>  Where to go on a trip - to Pattaya or to Phuket?  Where better to relax?  Where are the most interesting excursion programs?  Unfortunately, Pattaya cannot boast an abundance of architectural monuments.  True, several Buddhist structures are concentrated in the resort: </p><ul><li>  Temple of Doom. </li><li>  Temple of Truth. </li><li>  Temple of the Big Buddha. </li></ul><p>  There are practically no nature reserves in the Pattaya area.  To admire the inhabitants of tropical nature, you need to go to the archipelago located nearby.  The greatest interest among tourists is excursions to the islands of Koh Phai, Koh Lan, Koh Sak. </p><p>  List of available trips from Pattaya: </p><ul><li>  River Kwai (2 days). </li><li>  "Capital Bangkok." </li><li>  Discovery 7 in 1. </li><li>  "Madagascar". </li><li>  "Kao Keo." </li><li>  "Ramayana" (water park). </li><li>  "Cambodia" (2 days). </li><li>  Nong Nooch. </li><li>  "Ko Samet." </li><li>  "The temple complex of Wat Yang." </li></ul><p>  Phuket is the abode of ancient Thai shrines.  The calling card of the region is the colossal Buddha statue.  Its height is forty-five meters.  You can get acquainted with the so-called Sino-colonial style in architecture in the municipal center of the island.  The most popular among guides are walking along the streets of Phang Nga, Talang, Krabi. </p><p>  Range of sightseeing trips to Phuket Travel Agencies: </p><ul><li>  "The main attractions of the island" (8 hours). </li><li>  "Pearl Farm". </li><li>  "The world of crocodiles." </li><li>  "Botanical Garden". </li><li>  Dolphinarium. </li><li>  "Inverted house." </li><li>  The Kingdom of the Tigers. </li><li>  "Khao Lak." </li><li>  "Kao Sok." </li><li>  "Shopping tour." </li></ul><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Which is better - Pattaya or Phuket?  In reviews, surfers recommend the first option.  Fans of water activities also agree with them.  A large number of diving, windsurfing and kiting schools are concentrated on the coast of the resort.  Tourists are entertained by riding on ATVs, scooters, playing airsoft.  The Ramayana water park invites you to relax with your whole family.  The ticket price for an adult visitor is 2,500 rubles.  Children receive a 50% discount. </p><p>  <span>In Phuket, entertainment</span> has a slightly different character.  Travelers carried on elephants.  They are offered to go through the most difficult tracks in the Extreme Jungle Park.  There is also a small zoo.  There is karting.  The scope of the local water park is inferior to the scale of the famous "Ramayana" in Pattaya. </p><h2>  Purchases </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shopping in Pattaya" class="if uuid-2388115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2388115.jpg"></div><p>  Which is better - Phuket or Pattaya - in terms of shopping?  There is no consensus on this.  Shopaholics claim that the cheapest souvenirs and beach items are sold in Pattaya's stores.  But there are practically no boutiques selling authentic items at the resort.  The risk of running into a Chinese fake is very high.  For jewelry, souvenirs, created by the hands of local artisans, and colorful clothes, it is better to go to the flea market. </p><p>  The basis of trading in Phuket is latex.  Pillows and orthopedic mattresses made of this plastic and universal material are very popular among visitors.  Estimated cost of production is 4,000 rubles. </p><p>  Local jewelry stores are famous for their affordable natural pearl jewelry.  Customers praise crocodile leather accessories.  Clothing of European brands is sold in specialized departments of large shopping centers. </p><h2>  Cultural program </h2><p>  New Year's Eve is the most important event in Thailand.  Photos of Pattaya or Phuket are the best proof of this.  Resorts are literally transforming.  But the main fun happens on the first night of the coming year.  Pattaya residents take to the streets and pour themselves water and water from head to toe.  Tourists, armed with water pistols, also take an active part in the celebration. </p><p>  New Year's Eve in Phuket is happening exactly the same.  All the inhabitants of the island take to the streets of the resort and cheerfully greet: "Savadi pi may." </p><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buddha statue" class="if uuid-2388111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2388111.jpg"></div><p>  Those who rested in Thailand strongly recommend not limited to acquaintance with only one region of the country.  If you are in Phuket, feel free to leave the island and rush to Pattaya.  In the afternoon, artists and musicians perform on its streets.  Ice cream traders are inviting in a cafe.  Eateries attract spicy aromas of fried vegetables and meat.  Amazing fruit cocktails are served at the bars.  Children will remember the trip to the water park for a long time. </p><p>  Travelers with kids traditionally travel to Phuket.  The resort guarantees safety and upscale service.  Yes, and there is enough entertainment on the island.  But youth companies need to think things through.  You will have to choose between the crystal clear sea of ​​Phuket and the fun nightlife of Pattaya. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The table shows the main criteria by which tourists rate their holidays in the resorts of Thailand. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Youth vacation </td><td>  For children </td><td>  Security </td><td>  Sea </td><td>  Shopping </td><td>  sights </td></tr><tr><td>  Pattaya </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Phuket </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Have a nice trip! </p>
