The first such gadget appeared in 1989.  And Samsung released it.  He had a black and white screen, and the tablet allowed him to do very few things.  Its price was astronomical - as much as $ 3,000.  This cost scared away potential buyers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet circuit" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2204172.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, the owners of such devices were those who really needed such mobile devices.  Most often, buyers were entrepreneurs, company leaders, accountants of the highest level.  But today it is an affordable device for the average person. </p><h2>  Components of a modern tablet </h2><p>  The tablet‚Äôs device layout includes a display, touch screen, system board, and battery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet power" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2204182.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The display itself is a means for displaying visual information.  The smallest diagonal is 7 inches.  A gadget with such dimensions fits easily in your hand.  It is great for reading books.  And with a good battery, it holds a charge for a long time.  The larger diagonal starts from 8.9 to 10 inches.  The large screen allows, without peering, to view various videos and movies.  The touch screen is used to enter data and control the tablet.  It is divided into the following types: resistor, capacitive, matrix, projection-capacitive, screen on surface-acoustic waves and a screen with a grid of infrared rays.  The main types of sensors used in tablet circuits are the first three types because of their practicality and durability.  The last two are extremely rarely used due to the high cost and complexity of management. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet device diagram" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2204183.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The motherboard is an important element in the tablet circuit.  This electronic "filling" includes: memory, processor, video accelerator and components connecting them.  All these components are installed on the tablet motherboard.  This is a very "capricious" module, which can fail under the influence of moisture, temperature, voltage drop and other factors. </p><h2>  Tablet charging </h2><p>  The last of the tablet‚Äôs circuitry was the battery.  They are divided into two types: lithium-ion and nickel-cadmium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet motherboard" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2204184.jpg"></div>  In most cases, Li-ion batteries are used to power the tablet.  They have an advantage over NiCd batteries in size (with the same capacity), are characterized by low self-discharge and low maintenance for the entire service life.  However, they lose to them in the speed of discharge at negative temperature and the presence of a protection circuit built into the gadget.

    <h2>  External devices connected to the tablet </h2><p>  The first thing that connects to the mobile device is the adapters.  They provide power to the tablet and recharge the batteries.  There is a special nest for this.  What else can be connected to the device is monitors and LCD TVs.  Some of the tablets are even equipped with HDMI ports, allowing you to enjoy high-quality video viewing.  If the gadget does not have the ability to connect HDMI, then you can try to do this via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.  For example, Samsung TVs have a Smart TV function that allows you to make such a connection.  Connecting a mouse and keyboard is difficult.  The fact is that not all tablets support OTG mode.  It is this function that allows the gadget to recognize these devices.  As a rule, information on the availability of such an opportunity is available in the passport of the mobile device.  There are no special problems with connecting a flash drive.  Just insert it into the USB-connector and use it calmly.  Also, an audio headset, speaker system and portable speakers are simply connected to a special socket on the tablet.  There is also the ability to connect and wireless headphones.  This will require only an additional modem.  The development of the gaming industry required the use of joysticks and tablets.  But you need to know that not all games support this device.  Wireless internet is connected using Wi-Fi.  To do this, you need a modem connected to a USB port. </p><h2>  The best tablet model </h2><p>  According to Yandex.Market, the most popular model in 2017 was Microsoft Surface Pro.  This gadget has a Core i7 processor on board, which is very impressive.  In the basic version, it has 256 GB of internal memory.  But if you wish, you can install an additional slot for a memory card.  The screen with a diagonal of 12.3 inches shows a resolution of 2736 x 1824. There are two cameras: 8 megapixel main and 5 megapixel front.  The manufacturer guarantees 13.5 hours of continuous video viewing without recharging the battery.  There is a ‚Äúsupport‚Äù for the keyboard, which makes the device closer to the netbook.  The only drawback is the price.  It starts at 103,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the tablet circuits of different manufacturers are different from each other, they perform the same functions: maintaining mobile communications and acting as a multimedia entertainment center, as well as surfing the Internet.  We can definitely say that the tablet occupies the middle step between the phone and the laptop.  At the same time, by increasing the ‚Äúpower‚Äù of the electronic ‚Äúfilling,‚Äù he constantly strives for a laptop. </p>
