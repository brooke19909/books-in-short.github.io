But, of course, the most beautiful are hanging.  One of them will be discussed in our article. </p><h2>  Manhattan Bridge: Construction </h2><p>  Connecting two metropolitan areas (Brooklyn and Manhattan), a suspension bridge crosses the East River Strait. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manhattan bridge construction" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1296660.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main reason for the construction of the legendary structure was the huge load on the <span>Brooklyn Bridge.</span>  Constant traffic jams interfered with normal traffic, and the city had an urgent need to build a suspension structure, which began in March 1909.  And on December 31, the Manhattan bridge, 2089 meters long, was commissioned. </p><h2>  Sample for other hanging structures </h2><p>  Despite such a short construction time, the impressive construction was erected using new technologies, and still it is a model for hanging structures with huge spans. </p><p>  Thanks to its modern design, the bridge looks beautiful against the backdrop of the strait and luxurious skyscrapers of New York. </p><h2>  Tiers of construction </h2><p>  Having two levels, Manhattan Bridge has long been a favorite place for walks in the heart of America.  On the upper tier there are four lanes for moving cars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manhattan bridge" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1296668.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The lower one is used for freight transport, in addition, there are laid railway lines for the city metro, daily transporting a huge number of people.  On the bridge there are pedestrian and bicycle paths fenced with a grid. </p><h2>  Opening scenic views </h2><p>  From any part of the hanging structure, a picturesque panorama of the Big Apple opens, and at night the city is highlighted with colored lights reflected in the water, which makes walks especially romantic and mysterious.  At night, pedestrian paths do not close, and couples in love from all over the world strive to put small locks, symbolizing fidelity, on the protective grid of a monumental masterpiece. </p><h2>  Baroque arch </h2><p>  One cannot fail to tell about the main difference between a unique work of architecture and its neighbors - an impressive arch with colonnades at the entrance, made in the Baroque style.  A kind of gate to the Manhattan Bridge was created a few years after its opening.  The famous sculptor Heber was engaged in the development of panels with two figures embodying the spirit of trade and industry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manhattan bridge photo" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1296661.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the top of the recently reconstructed arch is a composition depicting an Indian hunt for a bison, made by an American author.  And on the back there were stone statues of two women, symbolizing Manhattan and Brooklyn, which connects the bridge.  After several decades, the statues were transferred to the museum to expand the space. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such luxuriously designed portals make Manhattan Bridge one of the most aesthetically attractive transport structures.  Interestingly, the area in front of the arch completely repeats the outlines of the Roman square of St. Peter. </p><h2>  Repair work </h2><p>  During the passage of trains, fluctuations were observed, becoming more noticeable every day.  The country's transport department acknowledged the problem, after which a decision was made on large-scale repairs that began in 1984 and lasted more than ten years. </p><p>  Subway traffic on the lower tier was limited.  Four lanes of railways were gradually closed for restoration work, and the number of trains passing was significantly reduced.  Only in 2004, all four metro lines were re-engaged. </p><h2>  Disturbing video </h2><p>  And recently, an amateur video shot by a local artist for a creative project has become the reason for discussion among Americans.  Everyone saw how the Manhattan Bridge, which immediately got to the first pages of the media, vibrates violently from cars and trains passing by it. </p><p>  Concerned residents cut off the Department of Transportation's telephone to find out the current state of affairs.  The government department issued an official statement saying that such a wiggle, not exceeding forty centimeters, is provided for by the suspension structure of the bridge itself.  For more than a hundred years, the construction has been raised and lowered thanks to special flexible cables, and after the repair work has been carried out aimed at enhancing the safety of passengers, the citizens of the country have nothing to fear. </p><h2>  Popular bridge </h2><p>  More than 75 thousand cars, 320 thousand metro passengers and about three thousand pedestrians and cyclists cross the Manhattan Bridge in New York every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manhattan bridge in new york" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1296669.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The famous hanging structure has been used repeatedly as decorations in popular Hollywood films such as King Kong, Once Upon a Time in America, Independence Day, I Am a Legend, Panic in New York. </p><h2>  National masterpiece </h2><p>  In October 2009, mass events were held to mark the centenary of the bridge.  Exhibitions devoted to the history of the construction of the building opened in the city, and in the evenings the sky was colored with flashing colored fireworks. </p><p>  In the same year, the Manhattan Suspension Bridge, a photo of which is often found on the pages of world publications devoted to architecture, was recognized as the national masterpiece of America. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manhattan bridge" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1296658.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beloved place of all residents and guests of the city is striking in its grandeur and power, and the unique panorama that opens from the bridge fascinates with a magnificent view.  The man-made architectural work is fabulously beautiful and incredibly adorns the metropolis. </p>
