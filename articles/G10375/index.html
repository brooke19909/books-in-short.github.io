    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Bristol is a warm city in England.  The average annual temperature does not fall below 0 degrees Celsius.  Even in January, it is kept at 2-5 degrees with a plus sign.  However, the weather here is mostly cloudy - due to the proximity of the Mendip-Gills hills, which prevent the Azores anticyclone from penetrating into the city.  The annual rainfall is from about 740 to 1062 mm.  The largest number of them falls in the autumn-winter period.  It can snow between November and April, but usually not much. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The city of Bristol is considered one of the largest in the south-west of Great Britain.  The population in 2007 was about 450 thousand people.  It is expected that by 2027 it will reach half a million.  Interestingly, there are more children and youth than pensioners, and they love their city, are not going to leave here.  Some scholars say a population explosion is possible here.  It is not known whether this is true, but at least in the Sunday Times magazine in 2009 Bristol was described as the best city in England due to the large number of supermarkets and other public institutions, as well as the high culture of its inhabitants. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The city of Bristol was founded in 1155.  During the reign of Edward III (1327‚Äì1377), its inhabitants produced woolen fabric from material brought from Ireland and sold it to Spain and Portugal in exchange for port and sherry.  In the 16th century, the city became a major industrial port.  In 1552, the Trade Society was established here.  The hall in which its members gathered was destroyed by the Germans during World War II. </p><p>  Until 1645, the city was a stronghold for the royal family, hiding during the civil wars, after which it was captured by parliamentarians.  In the late XVII-early XVIII centuries, the city flourished as a major center for processing sugarcane and tobacco imported from the British colonies in America, where he sent various industrial goods: glass, textiles, ceramics and so on.  In 1809, the first UK floating harbor was built here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1838, the city of Bristol became the starting point for Great Western - the second ship that crossed the Atlantic Ocean.  In 1841, thanks to the railway, it became a lively commercial English center.  The construction of the suspension bridge, stretching across the Avon Gorge, only helped to improve the situation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bristol Attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61635/2038083.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Modern city </h2><p>  During World War II, a significant part of Bristol was destroyed.  However, this was only an impetus to its reconstruction.  Here at that time the House of Soviets was built (1956), other public institutions and new shopping centers, designed to improve the life of the population.  Only the church of St. Mary Radcliffe (buildings of the XIV century), the Cathedral of Bristol (1141), the chapel of St. Mark, the Baptist chapel associated with the early non-conformist movement, and the Royal Theater, which was built in 1776, remained in their places. . </p><p>  The construction of a bridge in the north of the city and the completion of the M4 highway in South Wales strengthened Bristol's position as the main shopping center in southwest England.  Today, city residents import petroleum products, livestock products and non-timber forest resources.  They mainly export automobiles, tractors, and other manufactured goods from the West Midlands.  They produce sugar, cocoa, chocolate, thin glass, ceramics and porcelain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bristol: city coat of arms </h2><p>  The coat of arms of Bristol is very symbolic.  For example, the unicorns that hold him mark the supporters of England.  Hands above their heads - the Devil himself.  If you look closely, in one of them is a wriggling snake, which caused the fall of Adam and Eve, and in the other - scales.  This plot, as it were, recalls the possibility of the fall.  The building is the <span>castle of St. George</span> on Mount Werth, which in ancient times served as protection for the inhabitants of England.  The inscription below Virtue et Industrie translates as "Virtue and Industry" - this is the main motto of all the inhabitants of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Culture </h2><p>  Bristol City is an important cultural center of England.  There are many theaters, museums, art galleries and other similar institutions.  In 2010, the city was also named the most musical settlement thanks to the founders of the trip-hop genre - groups Massive Attack and Portishead.  The style of the works of these artists today is called the Bristol sound.  And although now it is not so popular, however, many other musical directions have been created on its basis. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that on the streets of the city, especially on Nelson Street or Stokes Croft, you can see works of street art.  Only they are very ephemeral: appearing literally an hour ago, in a second they can disappear.  The most famous graffiti artist on the walls is Banksy.  This person is also the creator of the movie ‚ÄúExit through the Souvenir Shop,‚Äù which in 2011 was nominated for an Academy Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. </p>
