History of the Great Wall of China</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the most visited places on the planet is the Great Wall of China.  Ever since its foundation, the people there are many legends, secrets and discussions.  They are connected with the history of its construction, with the question in which direction the loopholes of the Chinese wall are directed.  One thing is certain - this is the greatest structure created by human hands. </p><h2>  Description and location of the attraction </h2><p>  The Chinese Wall is considered the largest historical architectural monument in the world.  According to official sources, the history of the Chinese Wall began a long time ago.  The construction of such a large-scale fortification began in the III century BC.  e., during the ruling Qin Dynasty, under the leadership of Emperor Shi Huang. </p><p>  Subsequently, it was built in separate sections, at different times and under different rulers.  To say that it was an integral structure is impossible.  Some gaps were built in the northern provinces, others in the Gobi desert, and others in the mountainous regions near Beijing.  But for the most part they were earthen ramparts with a fortress and a stone wall in a strategically important zone and were intended for defense and protection of the territory.  That's why they built the wall of China.  Something similar was being built in Russia and the Roman Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="findamazinghoteldeals.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who built the china wall" class="if uuid-3108681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3108681.jpg"></div><p>  The thickness of the Chinese wall ranges from 5 to 8 meters, and the height is from 6 to 10 meters in different places.  Apart from numerous branches, it is located along the Tien Shan mountain range, passing through spurs, rises and gorges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Length </h2><p>  The official figure for the length of the China Wall is 8850 kilometers.  Here it is worth emphasizing once again that it was not built simultaneously, but over a period of 2700 years.  While in one place it was only settling in, in another it was completely abandoned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="superiorfacts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which side are the loopholes of the Chinese wall" class="if uuid-3108687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3108687.jpg"></div><p>  The exact figure depends on the calculation method.  In 2012, a study by local scientists lasting five years was published in the media.  According to him and the calculations made, the length of the Chinese wall is 21 196 kilometers.  Nevertheless, the official community is in no hurry to recognize this information.  Today, research is ongoing. </p><p>  The task is complicated by the disappearance of many sections of the building due to climate change and desertification of soils.  According to China Great Wall Academy, only 30% of the wall is in good condition. </p><h2>  Purpose and function of the wall </h2><p>  The construction of the structure was ordered by the emperor of China, Shihuandi, in order to protect the conquered territory.  The loopholes of the Chinese Wall also helped to fulfill this function.  However, she did not stop the raiders completely, small groups of nomads quite simply overcame this barrier.  In fact, it was an obstacle, not a military structure.  The sentries guarding the fortification were not supposed to fight the enemy.  Their main task was to warn the nearby garrisons of danger by lighting signal fires.  This is one of the appointments of the Great Wall of China. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.therakyatpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why did you build the china wall" class="if uuid-3108679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3108679.jpg"></div><p>  She had many other functions.  For example, the Great Silk Road crossed the wall three times, therefore, three times travelers went through customs control, paid a fee and were searched for smuggling.  The loopholes of the China Wall helped track movement from both sides.  Migration control was also carried out here. </p><p>  In addition, the wall performed a transport function.  It was easy and quick to get to your destination.  Even during heavy rains, the road was not transported, which significantly accelerated the movement. </p><h2>  How old is the Great Wall of China? </h2><p>  The first mention of the construction dates back to 476-221.  BC  e.  The walls were erected to protect against attacks by nomads and neighboring states.  In the III century BC.  e.  the emperor of China ordered the construction to protect his territories.  The next Han dynasty continued the work he had begun.  At the same time, the famous Jade Gate outpost was being built.  The loopholes of the Chinese Wall are located on both sides of it almost throughout the entire facility. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mtflix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wall of china why loopholes towards china" class="if uuid-3108670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3108670.jpg"></div><p>  After the reign of the Han Dynasty, the construction of the wall was practically suspended.  Only in some places are fortifications being built to protect against northern nomads, most of them have not survived to our time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  With the advent of the ruling Ming dynasty, which defeated the Tatar-Mongol yoke in the XIV century, the construction of the wall undergoes a rebirth.  A more powerful and higher brick fortification with towers and embrasure begins to be actively built.  It is in this form that today's tourists are used to seeing the construction.  When visiting attractions, they are often interested in: why are the loopholes of the Chinese Wall directed towards China?  Why is it not completed? </p><p>  The answer is simple, at least to one of the questions.  By the middle of the 17th century, the Ming dynasty was overthrown.  The new government did not demolish the wall, however, its construction was not continued. </p><h2>  Loss of human life </h2><p>  Who built the wall of China?  According to ancient legend, one girl who lost her husband at this construction site during the reign of Emperor Shihuandi wept so much that the stronghold collapsed.  Inside, she saw thousands of buried bodies, found her beloved and buried, as required by tradition.  This legend is very popular among the Chinese, but there is no reliable data on the number of deaths at this construction site. </p><p>  Of course, the working conditions were very difficult, but the terrifying details were clearly exaggerated.  During the reign of Ming, the wall was erected by soldiers and artisans.  In some sections of the structure, bricks with the names of the manufactories where they were made can be seen. </p><h2>  Destruction and restoration </h2><p>  After the overthrow of the Ming, the ruling Qing dynasty (1644-1911) belonged to the wall with obvious indifference.  As a result, for almost three centuries, the building has deteriorated and in some places collapsed.  Only the section from Beijing to Badaling was maintained in proper order, since it served as a gateway to the capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.360-expeditions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loopholes of the chinese wall" class="if uuid-3108669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3108669.jpg"></div><p>  In 1984, restoration work began, financed by Chinese and foreign philanthropists, as well as large companies.  Despite all efforts, sections of the structure remote from the tourist areas are still in a deplorable state.  In some places, the wall is dismantled using stone for construction, in others it collapses as a result of the laying of highways and other objects.  The loopholes of the Chinese Wall, which are also a tourist attraction, also disappear from sight. </p><p>  Due to the active farming in China, groundwater is being drained, and powerful sandstorms are often emerging in the region.  So, in the Gansu province, a seventy-kilometer section of the wall undergoes erosion, and over 40 km everything completely disappeared.  In some places where the height of the structure reached five meters, this value decreased to two.  In 2012, a 36-meter stretch of wall was completely destroyed in Hebei Province as a result of heavy rains. </p><h2>  What does symbolize? </h2><p>  For foreigners visiting China, the Great Wall symbolized protection from the outside world, and at times was a sign of xenophobia and lack of diplomacy in the conduct of foreign policy.  That is how the members of the imperial family and Chinese officials behaved, with whom the first European travelers had to deal. </p><p>  Partly the interest of visiting foreigners brought the Chinese closer to the largest building in the world.  Until the 19th century, the Wall of China was associated with terrible legends about the Emperor Shihuandi and almost forgotten fights with the Mongols.  Only thanks to the lively interest from the aliens did the reappraisal of the importance of the border fortification begin.  For the Chinese themselves, it is a symbol of unimaginable accomplishments that can be achieved through perseverance and diligence. </p><h2>  Is a wall a reliable defense? </h2><p>  It is difficult to unequivocally answer this question.  On the one hand, a lot of effort, money and time was spent on its construction.  Caretakers were even punished for poor work and embezzlement.  On the other hand, the generals themselves opened the gates for the Manchu troops, who subjugated all of China.  There are cases when the Mongol troops surrounded Beijing, once even capturing the emperor.  At the same time, more than once, thanks to powerful strengthening, it was possible to recapture the borders of the state from the army of many thousands of nomadic tribes. </p><p>  It is more correct to perceive the Great Wall of China as a defensive, and not as a defensive structure.  This duality can explain the theory of why the loopholes of the Chinese Wall are directed towards China and why they are located both to the right and to the left over a large extent.  The enemy could be on both sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixy.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wall of china loopholes" class="if uuid-3108689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3108689.jpg"></div><h2>  Non-Chinese Heritage Assumption </h2><p>  From time to time in the press and on television, assumptions are made about the alien origin of the wall.  It is worth saying right away that they are baseless. </p><p>  The theory is based on the facts of the location of the loopholes of the Chinese Wall, which are directed to both sides of it, that is, inside the country too.  There is a logical explanation for this.  Easily breaking the wall, small groups of nomads headed inland, overtaking them was almost impossible.  Moving back with the loot, and it was not only horses and money, but also any other objects that were valuable in the steppe (ceramics, bags of rice and grain), they faced the problem of transporting them over the wall.  It was then that the defenders could give them a fight. </p><p>  Irrefutable paper evidence from the Chinese side.  In the historical archives are stored plans, estimates, reports on the construction and maintenance of the Great Wall, which leave no doubt that the local people built it. </p><h2>  Wall of China as a Landmark </h2><p>  A trip to the building is the most popular tour in China.  Tourists visiting a country for the first time should go north from the capital; the most interesting sections of the wall are located here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uz.m.sayfamous.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the chinese wall" class="if uuid-3108674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3108674.jpg"></div><p>  When planning an independent trip, it is recommended to visit the Badaling area, electric trains from Beijing regularly go to it.  For excursions as part of a tourist group, the Mutianyu site in the vicinity of the capital is considered optimal.  As a rule, guided trips are combined with visits to the tombs of the Ming Dynasty emperors. </p><p>  Only having seen firsthand such a large-scale construction can one imagine how much labor has been invested in its construction and understand why the Chinese consider it a national pride. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Let's look at some details about this attraction: </p><ol><li>  The Great Wall of China is considered the largest building in the history of mankind, here it even went around the Egyptian pyramids. </li><li>  Its average thickness is 6 meters. </li><li>  One end of the wall abuts against the sea. </li><li>  The Chinese used rice porridge mixed with lime as a solution. </li><li>  Annually over forty million tourists come to see the landmark. </li><li>  The Great Wall of China is not considered an ancient wonder of the world. </li><li>  The fortified building, which appears before tourists today, was restored, since in the last century the wall was partially looted for the construction of private houses. </li><li>  Since 1977, China imposed a fine for its damage. </li><li>  There are no images of the Great Wall on any monetary unit in China. </li><li>  Residents of the Middle Kingdom called the construction of the "Wall of 10,000 li."  Is one equal to 500 meters. </li><li>  According to a survey, the Wall of China is recognized as the country's number one symbol; it is ahead of the Peking duck, panda, Mao Zedong and Confucius. </li><li>  Three times a year, charity races are held in it, in which anyone can participate. </li><li>  The wall is depicted on Chinese visas. </li><li>  A lot of commercials were shot at the building, including international companies and clips of world famous stars. </li></ol><h2>  Is it visible from space? </h2><p>  Many people wonder if the Chinese wall is visible from space without appliances.  According to numerous calculations and studies, as well as surveys of astronauts, the answer is one: the structure is not visible to the naked eye.  To make out such an object, a person must have seven times sharper vision. </p><p>  The average wall width is six meters.  There are larger streets in the world.  However, from outer space it is only possible to make out the outlines of the widest objects from them.  Among other things, the Wall of China is almost the same color as the surrounding landscape. </p>
