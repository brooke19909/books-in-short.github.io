Initially, these were just servants who ran the estates.  Over time, the meaning of the word has changed.  A respected public office has appeared: the procurator is the governor of the province or the head of part of the imperial property. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the procurator is" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1423763.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <h2>  Post transformation: </h2><ul><li>  A servant, slave or freedman, at the direction of the owner, could manage the rural estates of his master. </li><li>  Between 27 and 14 BC  Emperor Augustus introduced a new economic policy, increased the value of tax collection.  There were officials who were called prefects and prosecutors. </li><li>  Under the <span>emperor Hadrian</span> (117 - 138), procurators acquired greater national importance.  They came from the estate of horsemen, who after the senators had the second most important title.  For the rider, a procurator is a career upgrade. </li><li>  During the reign of Claudius (41 - 44), the importance of the position rose even more.  Now the procurator is both a financier and a judge. </li></ul><h2>  The scope of activities of prosecutors </h2><ul><li>  The caretaker of the house of the emperor, who was engaged in hereditary affairs, warehouses, storage of valuables. </li><li>  Head of Chancery. </li><li>  Tax office that monitored provincial tax collection. </li><li>  The procurator is the provincial civilian and military ruler. </li></ul><h2>  Activities of the procurator </h2><p>  It is divided into 2 parts: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. Fiscal service, which implied the steady and accurate compliance with tax laws.  Including they provided payment for the occupying forces in the provinces, their supply of food. </p><p>  2. Provincial governors concentrated big rights.  In their hands was the financial, administrative and judicial powers.  The latter was carried out when the special powers of the emperor were issued. </p><h2>  Province of Judea </h2><p>  It was formed in the sixth century and was part of Syria.  Its center was Caesarea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jewish Procurator" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1423766.jpg" width="600"></div>  It was in it was the Roman governor.  The first thing that was done was a population census to collect taxes in Rome.

    <h2>  Fifth Prefect of Judea (AD 26 - 36) </h2><p>  He is best known for the gospel, the novel "The Master and Margarita" and the story of A. France, "The Procurator of Judea."  <span>Josephus Flavius</span> calls his position a jemon.  But the modern finds of historians (1961) indicate that he was a prefect.  The personality of Pilate overgrown with legends for 2000 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="procurator pilate" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1423774.jpg" width="440"></div>

Procurator Pontius, probably descending from a Roman family, made a high career and ruled Judea.  The name of the procurator, Pilate, is translated as "horseman with a spear." </p><h2>  Pilate's personality </h2><p>  The procurator Pilate was a rather tough, if not cruel, ruler.  The people were humiliated by an insult to their religious beliefs and customs, crushed by taxes.  All this caused the appearance of messiahs in one place or another.  The people followed them.  Sometimes they went into the desert, they were caught by the Romans, sometimes they attacked legionaries in groups, they were destroyed.  Contemporaries complained in letters to the emperor of Pilate's sentencing without trial, of cruelty. </p><h2>  Pilate and Christ </h2><p>  And now there is a new messiah who cannot correctly answer the questions of the Sanhedrin, who is credited with declaring himself king.  This is just a simple carpenter who has not received an education, and whose illiterate admirers are fishermen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="procurator of pontius" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1423776.jpg" width="600"></div>  His hatred of the educated Pharisees, who knew and interpreted the Covenant, which he did not know, was understandable.  Naturally, Caiaphas demanded the death of the false messiah.  Pontius Pilate three times refused to execute, but then was forced to yield.  It is striking that his name is listed in the ‚ÄúCreed‚Äù, the daily prayer of Christians.  This is not a missionary article.  There is no indoctrination.  The author does not call to believe or not to believe.

    <h2>  The last years of Pilate </h2><p>  After the crucifixion, Pontius Pilate departed for Rome in 36.  His future fate is legendary.  According to one legend, he committed suicide.  Places are called different (Gaul, Rome).  Allegedly, his body was thrown into the Tiber.  But the water did not accept the body and threw it away.  The same thing happened in the Rhone.  Even Switzerland is mentioned.  The body is thrown into a lake near Lucerne.  Now there is a swamp in this place.  According to another version, he was executed by Nero. </p><p>  A. France believes that Pilate lived to a very old age, lived in Sicily, traded in wheat.  Pilate met a certain Lamia, a noble man and who was in the East.  At the end of the conversation, Lamy recalls one red-haired beauty of free behavior, who then joined the handful of the miracle worker from Galilee.  ‚ÄúDo you remember him?‚Äù  - asks Lamy.  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù says Pilate, thinking. </p>
