A small town with "merchant" architecture, "combed" greenery of courtyards and parks and numerous churches is located 99 kilometers south of Moscow, on the banks of the picturesque <span>Nara River.</span>  However, the sights of Serpukhov will not only honor the provincial village, but they will also interest the sophisticated metropolitan.  It is impossible to tell about everything in the framework of a short article, therefore we will dwell on the most interesting urban ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù. </p><p>  <strong>Sights of Serpukhov: peacocks</strong> </p>

Many objects (or creatures) could become a symbol of the city, however, on the flag and coat of arms of the village flaunts ... a peacock, a perfect exotic for Russian land.  It turns out that in the XVIII century, on the <span>orders of Catherine II,</span> Count Francisco Santi thought out coats of arms for Russian cities.  In an effort to find interesting features of each locality, the empire's main heraldmeister sent out questionnaires throughout the country.  Having received the questionnaire from Serpukhov, Santi was amazed: in one of the city monasteries - Vysotsky - peacocks were bred.  So the overseas bird became the main symbol of the native Russian settlement.  Peacocks in Serpukhov are bred today, however, in another monastery - the female Vladychny.

In 2006, on the 225th anniversary of the city coat of arms, the Peacock Museum was opened in Serpukhov.  A small exposition will tell interesting details about an exotic Indian bird.  Children are usually offered to draw or make a peacock with their own hands, which will immediately decorate the museum exhibition.  Adults, at this time, can taste aromatic tea or coffee with magnificent pies. </p><p>  <strong>Sights of Serpukhov: monasteries</strong> </p>

Both were built in the XIV century, full of interesting and mystical stories and interconnected by invisible threads.  The territory of the Vvedensky Vladyka Monastery for women is fragrant with the aroma of delicious homemade pastries and <span>colorful roses, of</span> which there are a great many.  As already mentioned, the nuns also look after peacocks, which visitors can feed.

    <p>  Vysotsky Monastery looks more pompous and strict.  First of all, he is famous for being the site of an all-Russian pilgrimage to the list of the miraculous icon ‚ÄúInexpressible Chalice‚Äù.  In fact, such a list is also kept in the Vladyka Monastery, but special prayers are organized here, in Vysotsky, and it has become the place where hundreds of thousands of people are drawn in the hope that the holy icon will help to heal loved ones (or be cured by themselves) from the terrible and universal Russian trouble - alcoholism.  According to the realities of the new time, a prayer for drug addiction is included in the Sunday service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All kinds of gifts make a particularly strong impression (even on an unbeliever): money, precious stones, jewelry that people donated to the temple in gratitude for healing.  Behind each of these gifts is a tragic story with a happy ending, because the energy in the monastery is simply amazing.  Truly a prayer place. </p><p>  <strong>Sights of Serpukhov: temples</strong> </p>

It is devoted, as is understandable, to the protector of all the orphaned and wretched miracle worker Nikolai and is a magnificent snow-white building in the Empire style.  It was built in the 18th century.  In the Soviet years, pasta was produced in the cathedral and clothes were washed.  But in the 90s, the church was returned to believing Serpukhovites.  People go here to pray to the miraculous icon "Assistance to childbirth."

    <p>  Tourist map of Serpukhov is replete with religious attractions.  In a small town of district significance, there are about a dozen temples - both ancient and new.  If time permits, tourists can visit the Trinity Cathedral, and the complex of church churches (red Assumption, yellow Ilyinsky and white-green Trinity), and other buildings. </p><p>  <strong>Journey to the world of art</strong> </p><p>  While in Serpukhov, you should definitely visit the local Museum of History and Art.  The collection of this institution, located in one of the best merchant mansions of the city, is one of the largest in the country.  Icons of the Moscow school, wooden painted sculpture and translucent marble, porcelain dishes, <span>paintings by Aivazovsky,</span> Rokotov, Polenov, Shishkin, Levitan, Savrasov, Vasnetsov, <span>Konenkov sculptures</span> and much, much more.  Any visitor will receive true pleasure! </p><p>  <strong>And most importantly</strong> </p><p>  Leave time for a leisurely walk through the streets of the city.  Sit on park benches, have a snack in a local cafe, admire the unique architecture of the old Russian village, feel its taste, aroma, energy.  Be sure to get another magnet and the book "Sights of Serpukhov (with photos)."  Leafing through it many years later, you can again feel the emotions experienced during a short trip. </p>
