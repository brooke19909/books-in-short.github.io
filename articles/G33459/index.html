Almost all of them are somehow used by someone as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, and someone grabs them for the full realization of their capabilities.  This article will examine one of the typical representatives of this class - ZTE Blade L5 Plus and reviews about it. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  For a cost of 5500-6500 rubles, this smartphone looks pretty good.  Judging by the reviews of the ZTE Blade L5 Plus of its owners, the performance of the case is reliable and durable.  Someone notes that the phone has withstood several falls. </p><p>  There are no special frills in the design.  On the front panel is a standard set of elements for smartphones - camera, speaker, sensors.  At the back is the main camera, external speaker and flash.  Physical control buttons are installed on the right side of the device. </p>

    <p>  Available ZTE Blade L5 Plus in two colors - gray and white.  Less common is golden. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Reviews of the ZTE Blade L5 Plus showed that the screen in the smartphone is very mediocre.  With a diagonal of 5 inches, its resolution is 854 by 480 pixels.  The result is that the total pixel density is 200 dots per inch.  The result, to say the least, is so-so.  Viewing angles also did not please users.  Even with a slight tilt, inversion, or even complete disappearance of the image, can be observed.  In sunny weather, using a gadget is not possible at all - brightness is sorely lacking.  The sensor can recognize only two touches.  However, among the reviews on the ZTE Blade L5 Plus, it was not possible to meet those dissatisfied with this factor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Computing power in the device provides a budget four-core <span>MediaTek MT6580.</span>  Not the fastest processor, but quite economical due to the use of 28 nm technology.  The cores in it are Cortex-A7.  The maximum processor clock speed is 1300 MHz.  The graphics core Mali-400 MP2 can decode hardware video in 1080p at 30 frames per second.  In theory, the phone should watch videos in HD-format without ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù. </p><p>  The claimed internal memory in the phone is 8 GB.  Naturally, about 4 are available to the user. 1 GB is operational, which is not so bad for an ordinary state employee. </p>

    <p>  The total amount of memory can be expanded with an SD card up to 32 GB.  True, in this smartphone there are problems with displaying the real amount of memory in the system. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The reviews for the ZTE Blade L5 Plus smartphone in this context are mixed.  On the one hand, someone uses his phone only for calls and SMS.  Then the batteries of 2150 mAh installed in the device calmly last for 1.5-2 days.  Someone is actively using all the functions of the device - watching videos, playing games, and then the battery life "melts" after 5-8 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interfaces and Communication </h2><p>  The maximum that you can squeeze out of a smartphone is 3G.  Supported, of course, are the old GSM standards.  Paying tribute to the latest trends, you can use two SIM cards in the phone. </p><p>  If there are wireless networks in the immediate vicinity, you can connect to them using the built-in Wi-Fi module with 802.11n standard.  For communication between devices there is Bluetooth 4.0. </p><p>  Navigation is presented by foreign GPS.  Judging by the reviews on the ZTE Blade L5 Plus Black smartphone, the system works for a long time and is unstable.  Even if satellites were found, it is not a fact that the phone will not lose them. </p>

    <p>  Of the sensors there are a proximity sensor, lighting and an accelerometer. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The operating system on the smartphone is Android 5.1.  There are a lot of applications that come with the kit.  But with the right approach, they can be ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù a little. </p><p>  The kit also has a proprietary ZTE shell, which adds a bit of functionality to the interface. </p>

    <p>  The device is easily subjected to obtaining root rights and accordingly firmware, including one of the versions of CyanogenMod that can be installed on it.  The recovery also changes if necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The front camera has 2 megapixels.  The main one is 5. At the same time, both create pictures of mediocre quality.  There is a large amount of noise and autofocus malfunctions.  In good light, you can still somehow achieve decent shots.  But in the dark or twilight you have to ‚Äúconjure‚Äù a little with the settings.  In general, to photograph something interesting, cat or schedule, without nitpicking to quality, it is possible. </p><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  Among the closest competitors we can single out the LG K8 K350.  With a relatively equal price, this device has the best resolution of 1280 by 720 with the same 5 inches.  The version of Android is 6.0 here, which is already an order of magnitude higher.  Support for LTE will also give odds to the hero of the article. </p><p>  Samsung Galaxy J3 2016 costs about 1500-2000 more.  However, the kit has a more efficient processor with a frequency of 1500 MHz and a screen with a resolution of 1280 by 720. The internal memory is the same, but the operating memory is 1.5 times larger.  The ability to use 4G is also a plus of this smartphone.  The version of Android is the same, but it can be updated to a newer one. </p>

    <p>  A less productive analogue, which is also cheaper - Lenovo Vibe C A2020.  Has a screen of the same size and resolution.  The same memory indicators, both built-in and operational.  The processor has 4 cores, but with frequencies of 1100 MHz.  The battery is slightly larger in volume - 2300 mAh.  The average price of this gadget relative to the hero of the article is lower by 1000 rubles. </p><h2>  Review <span>ZTE</span> Blade L5 Plus <span>phone</span> reviews </h2><p>  Since the phone is budgetary and everyone can afford it, there are quite a lot of user comments about it. </p><p>  The positive ones relate mainly to attractive prices.  It even softens a little negative feelings from not quite successful characteristics. </p>

    <p>  The big screen is also present in many reviews of the ZTE Blade L5 Plus smartphone as a positive point. </p><p>  Defenders of the small-capacity battery were those who called back, who used the phone to a minimum - calls and SMS, rare Internet access during the day.  With this application, the battery could last up to a week.  This was also facilitated by the energy saving mode built into Android 5. </p><p>  The fact that the phone, for all its budget, was assembled efficiently and comfortably in the hand, was also noticed by users in reviews of the characteristics of the ZTE Blade L5 Plus. </p><h2>  A bit of negativity </h2><p>  From the negative, it can be noted that with not the worst technical stuffing, the phone still sometimes ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù and dulls.  One user noticed that after prolonged playback of a video or game, a noticeable heating of the device occurs. </p><p>  It was noted in the reviews about the ZTE Blade L5 Plus Gold and the strange behavior of the sensor.  Periodically, its lethargy and prolonged or not at all correct processing of touches were observed. </p><p>  The lack of the 4G standard seemed to some to be very critical.  After all, today LTE already covers a good territory. </p>

    <p>  The latest version of the operating system to which it will be possible to upgrade is ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù 5.1.  All that is above, unfortunately, is not available.  But you can solve this problem by installing ‚Äúcustom‚Äù firmware. </p><p>  As for the software, one of the users left a detailed review about the ZTE Blade L5 Plus Black about this.  First, he periodically observed the disappearance of contacts from his phone book.  The solution was to use a Google account and synchronize it.  Many system settings during the operation of the smartphone were often confused and set to random values.  He especially highlighted the constant lack of memory. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Based on the characteristics of the smartphone, as well as extensive reviews, we can conclude that the strengths of the device are: </p><ul><li>  acceptable price; </li><li>  high-quality assembly and design convenient for a hand; </li><li>  when used as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù - a battery; </li><li>  Android operating system 5.1; </li><li>  two sim cards; </li><li>  not the worst performance. </li></ul><p>  The weak areas in the smartphone were: </p><ul><li>  with intensive use of all functions - battery; </li><li>  too much pre-installed "software"; </li><li>  insufficient quality of cameras; </li><li>  lack of LTE; </li><li>  poor performance; </li><li>  the inability to update the operating system above the version of Android 5.1; </li><li>  frequent crashes in system software; </li><li>  lack of internal memory. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We can say that the presented smartphone is really an ordinary budget employee.  Low price, average technical specifications, mediocre camera quality.  This smartphone is from the ‚Äúwhile it goes‚Äù class, which is acquired for a while, then to buy a more convenient and productive gadget.  Or for those who use the phone as a telephone, and not as a multimedia center. </p><p>  In any case, there will be fans of the smartphone and, with a reasonable approach, will be able to cope with it and squeeze its maximum out of it. </p>
