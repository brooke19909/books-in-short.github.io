    <p>  Probably, everyone would like to know interesting facts from the life of a scientist.  Lomonosov Mikhail Vasilyevich fate did not spoil too much.  For example, it is known from the words of the leader himself that his father was a very kind person, but brought up in extreme ignorance.  And mother Lomonosov lost at 9 years old.  But after a couple of years he had a stepmother.  Vasily Dorofeevich married a woman who was the daughter of a peasant from a neighboring volost.  Her name was Fedora Mikhailovna Uskova.  But she soon died, having lived in the Lomonosov family for only three years.  But not even a year had passed when Mikhail's father married for the third time.  Now his chosen one was called Irina Semenovna, and she was a widow.  As Mikhail Vasilievich told many years later, the third wife of the pope was for him an envious and evil stepmother. </p><p>  <span>The best memories</span> of his childhood are associated with numerous trips with his father to the open sea.  <span>Without a doubt,</span> these moments left an indelible mark on Mikhail's soul.  Little Lomonosov became an assistant for Vasily Dorofeevich at the age of 10.  Going to the fields early in the spring, they returned home only in late autumn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lomonosov interesting facts" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17443/308736.jpg" width="600"></div>  Father took him with him both to distant and near diving.  All this, of course, was very popular with Mikhail and a lot of tempered physical strength and skills in him, and also enriched his mind with a variety of observations.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are interesting facts from the life of Lomonosov that he inherited a love of reading from Elena Ivanovna, his mother, which she taught him.  At an early age he realized the necessity and usefulness of teaching and knowledge, and one of his first books was Grammar, Arithmetic, and the poetic Psalter. </p><p>  By the age of 14, Mikhail Vasilievich had learned to write competently and clearly.  Gradually, his life in his father's house became unbearable due to everyday quarrels with his stepmother.  And the more his interests expanded, the more hopeless the surrounding reality began to seem to the youth.  Irina Semenovna was especially annoyed by her stepson's love of books.  The result of everything that happened was the decision of 19-year-old Lomonosov to go to Moscow. </p><p>  There are interesting facts from the life of Lomonosov, thanks to which it is known that his path was about 3 weeks, then he was able to enter the Academy.  At first, studying was difficult, but perseverance and work helped him achieve success, and very great.  Five years later, teachers of the Academy sent Lomonosov to the gymnasium of the Academy of Sciences, which was located in St. Petersburg, and there a talented young man was sent to study in Germany. </p>

    <p>  In 1745, Mikhail Vasilievich became a teacher of chemistry, and only 3 years later he opened the first real chemical laboratory.  The discoveries that enriched many branches of knowledge were made precisely by Lomonosov.  Interesting facts about his work also make us understand that he was not only a great chemist and physicist, but also an excellent astronomer.  After all, none other than Mikhail Vasilievich, while observing the passage of Venus, noticed that she had an atmosphere. </p><p>  In addition, interesting facts from the life of Lomonosov indicate that he was well versed in rhetoric.  It is known that it was he who first compiled the textbook on this subject in Russian, however, as did the textbook on grammar. </p><p>  In addition to all the above, Mikhail Vasilievich was fond of poetry, and the verses that he wrote very much influenced the Russian literary language and its development. </p><p>  In 1755, on his initiative, the Moscow University was founded, which is still working. </p><p>  One cannot but mention <span>interesting facts from the life of Lomonosov</span> about his own family, which are actually not so many.  Being far abroad, in the beautiful city of Marburg, he met his future wife Elizabeth Zilch.  In 1740, their wedding took place.  In total, they had three children, but two of them died in childhood.  Only one of their daughter, Elena, survived.  Many years later, she married the son of a priest from Bryansk, Alexei Alekseevich Konstantinov.  The posterity of the daughter of this great man exists to this day. </p><p>  Mikhail Vasilievich died in 1765 at the age of 54 after an unfortunate cold.  His grave is in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. </p>
