Indeed, in our past there is a lot of interesting things that can and should be learned.  So, very often recently the Ottoman Empire (history) has been affected.  Roxolana is the woman who is the most influential person of her time after the great Sultan.  Films, series and other stories were made about her.  Indeed, Alexandra (according to some sources, Anastasia) is a symbol of femininity, mind and power;  the only girl in the world who conquered the Sultan of Suleiman not only with her beauty, but also with logic, ingenuity, and education. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ottoman empire history of roxolan" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/255604.jpg" width="249"></div>

    <p>  <span>The Ottoman Empire</span> (Roksolana acts here as the wife of the <span>greatest commander,</span> politician, sultan) has always been a strong rival and a prosperous state.  Its ruler Suleiman <span>never gave up,</span> he was always confident in himself and his people.  But once his determination, firmness and <span>fortitude</span> swayed - he fell in love with a stunning girl who was kidnapped from his home.  Roxolana already decided that she would be the most beloved wife of her master.  And I got my way.  In addition, she began to take an active part in politics, gave wise advice to her husband and supported him under any circumstances.  Roksolana accepted the faith of her beloved to prove the loyalty and sincerity of her feelings, since then she was called Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan.  Many troubles and failures fell on her fate, but she never gave up and devotedly loved her master. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ottoman roxolan" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/255606.jpg" width="250"></div>

Suleiman and Roksolana were proof of this.  After all, it was this woman who achieved the official marriage, in addition, she gave birth to her husband beautiful five sons and a beautiful daughter.  Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan could afford to take part in the development of political strategies, campaigns, respond to letters from foreign ambassadors.  Beloved wife dedicated poetry to Suleiman, danced only for him, every day astounded her knowledge and unpredictability. </p><p>  Ottoman Empire: history ... Roksolana - a person who is interested in more and more people every day.  Many women crave to be like the most influential <span>beauty of the world of</span> those times.  The main secret of Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska Sultan was that she knew what to do, how to behave in different situations.  She could always quietly move away from her husband, leaving him completely calm, able to give her image a drop of sadness, or, conversely, happiness and joy.  A wise woman knew when to keep silent, and at what point to express and defend her point of view.  Thanks to its influence, the Ottoman Empire (history) changed for the better.  Roxolana could be proud of her accomplishments.  It was with her help that the harem became a model of beauty, enlightenment, and the rulers of other states began to recognize Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska as the most influential woman of that era. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ottoman Empire Suleiman and Roxolana" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/255607.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that when Roksolana was left completely alone to manage a huge state with an empty treasury, she was able to fill it with coins to the top in the shortest possible time.  The Sultana began to open wine shops, reconstructed moorings, erected mosques.  This was highly praised by the Ottoman Empire itself, history.  Roksolana will never be forgotten, because she was loved not only by a powerful spouse, but also the entire population of the country. </p>
