    <h2>  River Ob.  Features of the water stream </h2><p>  A significant river in the Russian Federation and almost the longest in Asia is the Ob.  Its total length is 5410 km.  The source of the watercourse is the confluence of Katun and Biya, which are located in Altai. </p><p>  The water stream is divided into three parts: the lower section (the territory to the Gulf of Ob), the middle (to the Irtysh), the upper (to Tom). </p><p>  Due to the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pool, amounting to 3 thousand square meters.  km, Ob occupies a leading position in the Russian Federation.  It is worth noting also the fact that the Ob is third in terms of water availability after such great rivers of the country as the Yenisei and Lena. </p><p>  On it is a dam built in the 60s.  Ob forms the Novosibirsk reservoir.  In order to create it, more than one village and part of the city of Berdsk was specially flooded.  People living near the Ob call it the Ob Sea.  It is a great place for relaxation and fishing.  Sanatoriums and recreation centers were built on its shores. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the XIX century, it was decided to build a canal that would connect the Ob with the Yenisei.  However, at the moment it is not used at all and completely abandoned. </p><p>  The main tributaries of the Ob: Irtysh, Tom.  Yugan, Chulym, Charysh and Ket also fall into it. </p><p>  The food of the river is mainly provided by melting snow.  High water occurs in April-May in all currents of the water stream.  During freezing, the water level begins to rise and often the river can go beyond its banks.  In autumn, the flood is characterized by flood, and in summer - low water. </p><p>  The water of the watercourse, like all tributaries <span>of the Ob River, is</span> rich in fish.  They live in more than 50 species.  The most common and valuable: nelms, whitefish, sturgeons and others.  Sometimes there are crucians, perches, ides, pikes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ob tributaries" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/776382.jpg" width="499"></div>

Its length reaches 1000 km.  The river basin in some places is more like a swamp.  It has many small and fairly long tributaries.  The source of Vasyugan is located in the Ob-Irtysh watershed.  In his flood plain there are a sufficient number of lakes and elders.  In the middle reaches, the shores rise to a height of 50 m. In the lower reaches, Vasyugan expands to 600 m, becomes multi-water, the floodplain also increases in size, there are more lakes, channels and rifts. </p><p>  All tributaries of the Ob are important waterways, which differ from each other in characteristics, in particular in length.  The largest is Tom.  Its length is 827 km, its width is 3 m. Ice coating takes place in November, opening in April.  The main type of nutrition is rain, but snow and ground are also characteristic. </p><p>  Throughout the Omsk region, there is no better river reservoir than the main left tributary of the Ob.  It flows through the territory of the People's Republic of China, Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.  The total area is 4000 km, which makes it, together with the Ob (5410 km), the first watercourse in Russia, the second in Asia and the sixth in the world. </p><p>  The Ob, whose tributaries are located mostly in the Tomsk Region, is distinguished by the fact that there are many lakes, ponds and small rivers in it.  Their total area exceeds 7 thousand ha.  Most of them are currently overgrown with aquatic vegetation.  Some water bodies were created as a result of various natural factors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tributaries of the Ob river" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/776384.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Irtysh - the main tributary </h2><p>  All tributaries of the Ob River are able to impress every person, but the most powerful is the Irtysh.  Besides the fact that it plays an important role for the countries in which it flows, this water flow is the longest in the world.  After it is Missouri, whose length is only 3700 km. </p><p>  The river got its name due to the fact that over the entire period of its existence it changed channels several times due to the destruction of the banks.  Translated from Turkic, its hydronym means "digging". </p><p>  Almost all tributaries of the Ob, including the Irtysh, have a calm flow, the <span>maximum speed of</span> which rarely exceeds 2 m / s.  The channel is narrow, not more than 700 m. Surprisingly, the ecology of the river was practically not affected, the waters of the stream are clean, contain a minimum amount of <span>harmful substances.</span>  Food is provided thanks to melt water.  Due to the fact that hydropower plants were built on the river, floods are very rare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="left obi tributary" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/776385.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tom </h2><p>  Like other tributaries of the Ob, Tom is located in the Tomsk region.  Leaking, washes Khakassia and the Kemerovo region.  Due to the fact that in some <span>parts of the river</span> the water level has reached a critical level, there is no navigation here.  The shallowing occurred due to the fact that gravel was constantly scooped out of the watercourse for its own needs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water tributary Tom" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/776386.jpg" width="600"></div>
