    <p>  As you know, theme museums and all kinds of reconstructions are today a fashionable entertainment attraction.  So is the ‚ÄúNomad‚Äù ethnopark a regular ‚Äúdecorative‚Äù village for tourists?  This question can be answered in the affirmative or negative.  Of course, the northern nomads in the Moscow Region did not appear by chance, but in order to receive guests and acquaint them with the peculiarities of their culture and traditions.  However, this ethnopark cannot be called exclusively entertaining.  Its main task is to popularize and familiarize the population with the traditions of small nationalities.  Real northerners, not specially made up actors, work and almost constantly live in the open-air museum.  During the tour you can hear a lot of interesting facts and fascinating stories firsthand.  Of course, while visiting the park you will not get bored.  Since the theoretical part of the tour is completely intertwined with the practical.  Here you can try national cuisine, sit in the nomad‚Äôs dwelling or take part in an unusual master class dedicated to one of the folk art forms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ethnopark population </h2>

The plague owner Alla Nabutova is Kumandink by nationality and is very proud of it, since today there are about 2000 people left in our country.  It is in the Nomad that Alla walks in the national clothes of the Nenets young ladies and gladly treats guests with national dishes.  By her main profession, this amazing woman is a journalist, the author of a project dedicated to the small ethnic groups of the Russian North.

That's just the house here is very unusual.  These are: plague, yarangi, as well as Kazakh, Mongolian and Kyrgyz yurts.  In addition to residential buildings, there is also a food service - a tea yurt (here you can also have a bite to eat) and a nomadic coffee house.  Ethnopark "Nomad" is also famous for its menagerie.  In spacious open-air cages, there are already quite manual camels, curiously bowing their heads to each visitor in anticipation of a treat, and Mongolian yaks, because of their huge horns, seem more dangerous.  And geese, goats and donkeys calmly walk around the complex.

Everything here seems so realistic and real that it is difficult to describe in words.  According to visitors, when you go to the ethnopark, the Moscow region seems very far away, and it is impossible to believe that you were in this place without air travel or a long train trip.  Tours are conducted in an informal setting.  Animals can be touched and fed, which is especially liked by children.  On-site photography is permitted (and encouraged).  Ethnic park ‚ÄúNomad‚Äù has positive reviews among the vast majority of visitors, it is difficult to find someone who was here and was not satisfied.
