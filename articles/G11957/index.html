From a strip of thick cardboard roll a hoop around your head and fasten its edges with a stapler.  Then it is glued around a strip of paper so that the edges can be tied on top of the tape.  You will get a hat that looks like a candy wrapper.

The length of the dress is chosen at will, it is better to make it extended downwards so that it does not hinder movements during dancing. </p><p>  The neckline is sheathed with white faux fur.  If you have a lace frill, then you can pin it in front on a pin.  For this New Year's costume, the tail can be made of the same fabric by sewing the tip of the same fur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chanterelle outfit" class="if uuid-2502392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502392.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, the sides of a rectangular piece of fabric are sewn together on the wrong side, the resulting pipe is turned on the front side and filled with cotton.  The edges are gathered and stitched.  Attach the tail at the back at the level of the belt.  Triangular ears are easy to attach to the hoop or made of colored paper and stick them on the rim of cardboard.  In an extreme case, you can simply tie two lush orange bows on your head.  Complete the outfit with a white blouse or turtleneck, wear the same knee-high socks or tights, Czechs. </p><h2>  Wizard </h2><p>  Consider making a simple New Year's costume for a boy.  This bright outfit is best sewn from satin shiny fabric.  The costume consists of two elements - a cape on the eyeballs and a magic cap in the shape of a cone.  Any color can be chosen.  If you find matter with stars, it will be just great, if not, do not be discouraged, you can trim the edges with gold or silver rain after the main sewing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wizard in a cone hat" class="if uuid-2502398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502398.jpg"></div><p>  Cutting is done by the type of semi- or sun-flared.  The neck is treated with a edging of satin ribbon of a contrasting color, leaving the ends to tie.  The length of the cape is chosen either by waist or to the knees.  Do not sew too long a cloak, as the child will be uncomfortable to move, sit and dance in it.  How to make a conical hat for a costume for the New Year, we will consider below on the pattern. </p><h2>  Hat for character </h2><p>  A conical hat can be made of thick cardboard with and without brim.  A sheet of whatman paper is wrapped around the child's head and the desired size is noted.  Then the excess is cut off with scissors.  To fasten the edges, either a stapler is used, or when cutting paper, a strip or small corners are left on the side for spreading with glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a cone hat" class="if uuid-2502665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502665.jpg"></div><p>  If desired, you can sheathe the cone with a cloth.  If you want to make the fields near the hat, then stick to the bottom pattern.  Attach a strip from the inside to PVA glue so that the cut triangles are not visible. </p><p>  Next, we will consider how to sew a girl a costume for the New Year with her own hands using such a hat. </p><h2>  Herringbone </h2><p>  The Christmas tree attire at the New Year's carnival looks very impressive.  The dress is sewn according to a simple sundress pattern.  Fabric choose any shade of green.  The highlight of the costume will be the sewn shuttlecocks at different levels.  Since the sundress is flared downwards, the ‚Äúbranches‚Äù of the tree will increase.  For frills, you can buy strips of green lace, matching tulle or wide satin ribbons. </p><p>  On frills sew pompons from bright threads.  They serve as Christmas balls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smart girl for New Year" class="if uuid-2502419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502419.jpg"></div><p>  The top of the tree is a conical hat decorated with frills and balls.  On top of the cone you can attach a yellow star made of cardboard. </p><h2>  The musketeer of the king </h2><p>  Boys at the carnival want to look courageous, so they choose the role of heroic personalities.  These are the Knights and Batman, Spiderman and Pirate.  At the New Year's Carnival, it is easiest to make a royal musketeer outfit yourself.  Black trousers and a white shirt can be found in any wardrobe.  The hat can be borrowed from dad or bought at the New Year's fair.  It remains only to tie its base with a bright ribbon and insert a fluffy feather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="suit for boy" class="if uuid-2502395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502395.jpg"></div><p>  The most time-consuming in sewing such a children's costume for the New Year is the manufacture of wraps.  You need to sew it flared down.  To do this, the blue atlas is cut into several stages.  First, the length of the cape from the shoulder to the upper thigh is measured.  Measurements are added on, 10 cm on each side is added to the width of the shoulders, and a rectangle is cut out.  It is folded in half and a rounded neckline is cut out.  The head should pass freely.  After fitting, the length of the shoulder from the neck to the extreme point is measured, the measurements are transferred to the fabric.  Next, you need to connect the resulting points with the edges of the rectangle.  The result is a downward expansion in the form of a trapezoid.  The edges of the material are turned off by the edging. </p><p>  <span>With your own hands, a suit</span> for the New Year of such a plan is not difficult to do.  To do this, cut out on the size and arm ruffles.  These are pieces of trapezoidal fabric, the length of which corresponds to the length of the sleeve, the top line is 10 cm, from the middle of the shoulder 5 cm to one and the other side.  The bottom edge has an extension.  It remains to connect all the pieces together and make a cross in the center of white satin ribbons.  Royal lilies will be easy to perform with a glue gun.  If there is no such equipment at home, then a template is drawn and all the flowers are cut from a golden satin.  The edges of the flowers need to be melted with a candle so that the fabric does not crumble, and carefully sew on the edges with stitches.  Armbands can also be decorated in the same way, but this is not necessary.  You can leave only the central element. </p><h2>  The Snow Queen </h2><p>  A popular <span>costume for the New Year</span> for a girl is the outfit of the Snow Queen.  Everyone loves the famous fairy tale of H. H. Andersen with his sparkling queen whiteness.  To create an image, you can wear a white or blue dress, add a crown of snowflakes or a kokoshnik made of cardboard, put on a drape trimmed with white or silver fluffy rain.  The pattern for this part of the costume is available below.  White or pale blue fabric is knotted with satin ribbons.  On the edges you can attach pompons from white yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a drape" class="if uuid-2502660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502660.jpg"></div><p>  To create the crown yourself, prepare a sheet of cardboard, a simple pencil, scissors, an awl and a simple elastic band.  A symmetrical pattern is drawn on the cardboard.  The sample can be seen in the photograph in the article.  Then, the part is cut out along the contours with scissors.  The edges can be glued with a silver rain around the perimeter of the craft.  Holes are made on the sides into which the gum is inserted.  After fitting, they cut off the excess and tie a durable knot from the inside. </p><h2>  Clown costume </h2><p>  A child in a clown costume will look very impressive and bright.  For this outfit, you need to choose a satin fabric in several colors that are compatible with each other.  Overalls with fasteners on the back are sewn.  It can be either buttons or Velcro.  How to make a cone hat, you already know.  For a clown hat, complement it with a frill on the bottom edge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clown boy in hat" class="if uuid-2502401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502401.jpg"></div><p>  The work is laborious, because the satin fabric is strewed, it is not very comfortable to work with it, you need to process each seam with a piping or hem two times.  Sleeves are cut wide and long.  Then an additional strip of fabric is sewn at the brush level and an elastic band is inserted.  The resulting frills are obtained.  The same thing is done from below the legs.  Shoes do not need to be sewn such as in the photo in the article.  You can wear ordinary Czechs for your child.  But do pompons for decorating.  They look very impressive. </p><p>  Next, we consider a universal pattern of overalls that can be used when making a costume for the New Year with your own hands. </p><h2>  Outfit pattern </h2><p>  Using the pattern presented in the article, you can sew not only a clown outfit, such a jumpsuit will suit a suit of Parsley or any animal, for example, a hare, a bear or a wolf.  The fabric matches the character's color.  After cutting the fabric by the standards of the child, all the details are sewn together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="suit for overalls" class="if uuid-2502653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502653.jpg"></div><p>  The collar can be made a frill or stand, attach a circular frill or sew a strip of fur.  Depending on the chosen character, decoration methods also vary.  On the diagram, you can also consider how to properly cut a hat for buffoon or Parsley. </p><h2>  Snowman </h2><p>  One of the most popular Christmas outfits is the snowman costume.  According to the pattern of overalls, you can sew a white suit on the fasteners on the back.  Buttons of a snowman are usually made black, so prepare black yarn for making pompons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowman costume" class="if uuid-2502439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2502439.jpg"></div><p>  As a headdress, you can wear a dark hat with brim, tie a striped bright scarf around your neck.  If you don‚Äôt have such things in your wardrobe, don‚Äôt be upset.  Take and make your child a ‚Äúbucket‚Äù of cardboard.  They make it on the principle of a conical hat, only the sharp tip is cut off, a circle with triangles for fastening and PVA glue are prepared.  After twisting the sheet of whatman paper around the head, all the parts are fastened together.  It turns out a truncated cone that performs the function of a bucket.  The handle can be made of satin ribbon, selected in color.  White Czech shoes are worn on the feet. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  According to many mothers, costumes for children for the New Year can be done on their own without buying an expensive outfit for one day, and even more so without putting on a costume after an unfamiliar child, rented.  It is not only not hygienic, but also dangerous.  After all, you can easily catch any skin disease, and after putting on hats, according to reviews, there are frequent cases of pediculosis.  Masters advise not to risk the health of their child, but to sew costumes on their own.  The outfit will turn out not only new, a piece of the mother‚Äôs soul will be invested in it.  Having made a costume at home, you can be absolutely sure that another child in exactly the same outfit will not meet on the matinee.  Your costume will be unique. </p>
