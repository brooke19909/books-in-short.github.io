    <h2>  Hero from the pages of an ancient epic </h2><p>  For a long time, researchers unsuccessfully tried to find documentary evidence proving the existence of its historical prototype.  Since it was not possible to do this, it was decided, without finally attributing this character to the category of fiction, to rely in his biography mainly on what the most ancient legends conveyed to us.  This is done not only in England.  The historicity of our prince Rurik is also called into question by many scientists, but this does not prevent us from believing everything that the <span>chronicler Nestor</span> writes about him <span>.</span> </p><h2>  In the teachings of the wizard </h2><p>  The family tree of Pendragons, which took root on the British chernozem, sometimes brought very interesting fruits.  For example, it is known that the birth of King Arthur himself was the result of the intrigues of the wizard Merlin.  In the VI century, under the influence of his witching charms, King Uther inflamed with passion for the young Duchess Igreyn and, finding a plausible excuse, killed her old weak husband in a duel, receiving a beautiful widow as a reward.  Coming up with this dubious matter, Merlin set the king the condition that as a payment for help he would receive from him the upbringing of a child who was destined to be born.  And when the future <span>king Arthur</span> Pendragon was born, he was immediately sent to the castle of the sorcerer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The magic sword that opened the way to the throne </h2><p>  Further, the legend tells that after a few years, the Duchess Igrein had to widow again.  King Uther, whose wife she became after he killed her husband, was poisoned by his close associates, which was in keeping with the spirit of those times.  After his death, the throne remained vacant for some time.  Young Arthur, having received secret magical knowledge from his mentor, continued his education with the old and very worthy knight, Sir Hector. </p><p>  Britain could not remain without a legal king for a long time, and she had to choose a new one.  This time, it was not without the machinations of the wizard Merlin, who led the election.  Each of the pretenders to the throne had to pass the test - try to draw a sword, stuck in stone.  No matter how all the other candidates sweated, no one succeeded, and only the young Arthur Pendragon, who had learned the lessons of his mentor well, easily coped with the task and became king of Britain. </p>

    <h2>  Victory over the opposition </h2><p>  But it turned out that not everything is so simple.  Those same courtiers who had recently poisoned his dad did not recognize the legitimacy of the elections and, together with some neighboring monarchs, having gathered a considerable army, went to Arthur's war.  It is difficult to say how the matter would end if the newly-made king of the Britons did not find reliable allies in the person of two overseas warriors Ban and Bors.  With the help of magic and these two thugs, he successfully defeated his enemies, and began to rule to the joy of all the survivors.  Arthur Pendragon made the glorious city of Camelot his capital. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Magic sword Excalibur </h2><p>  Resting from state affairs, the young king indulged in purely chivalrous joys - he challenged arrogant British aristocrats to a duel and famously smashed them with the same magic sword that he had once pulled from a stone.  This continued until one day the treasured sword broke.  According to legend, this unfortunate incident prevented Arthur from sending his next adversary, Sir Pelinor, to the forefathers, which he was incredibly happy about. </p>

    <p>  The same Merlin, who became one of the proxies for helping during the elections, comforted the warlike king.  He presented the king with a new sword, which was forged upon his order by the elves living on the shores of Lake Vatelin.  These cute fairy-tale creatures set a condition: Arthur Pendragon will fight for them only for a just cause and, in addition, undertakes to return in due time.  The sword they made had a secret power that allowed them to smash the enemy on the spot, while remaining unscathed.  It was called Excalibur. </p><h2>  Create a round table </h2><p>  To make Camelot worthy of his capital's brilliance, Arthur gathered in it all the most noble and valiant knights of that time, and so that they would not kill each other because of a more or less honorable place at the table, he made a very wise decision, making the table round - so that no one it was not a shame.  Since then, the expression ‚Äúround table‚Äù has become not just a designation of an attribute that creates convenience during negotiations, but a symbol of the equality of those present. </p>

    <h2>  Fatal marriage </h2><p>  Like all the kings of Britain, the young monarch spent his days hiking, tournaments and feasts.  This continued until he got married.  His chosen one was the daughter of the neighboring king - the young beauty of Guinevere.  By the way, the <span>wizard Merlin</span> really discouraged him from this marriage.  It is not known whether the future was revealed in a supernatural way, or simply saw that the girl was already very spoiled and nothing good could come of it.  One way or another, and the wedding took place. </p><p>  Soon Merlin's fears were confirmed.  It so happened that the young wife of Arthur was abducted during a walk by a certain Baron Meligrans.  The hunter took her to his castle, but before he had time to unleash the criminal passion, he was killed by the round knight Sir Lancelot, who learned of the misfortune and rushed to the aid of the beautiful lady.  Guinevere was so grateful to him for her salvation that from an excess of feelings she immediately cheated on her husband.  Their romance did not end there. </p><h2>  New troubles </h2><p>  The fact that the young queen violates marital fidelity, Arthur was informed by his nephew (and, according to some versions, his illegitimate son) - the evil and treacherous schemer Mordred.  About morality in those centuries was strict.  The wife convicted of adultery was sent to the fire, and Arthur hastened to arrange this pleasure for her.  But, unfortunately, the lovers managed to escape, and the first ship sailed to France, where they looked at these things through their fingers.  Burning with a thirst for revenge, Arthur went after them, leaving his vicegerent Mordred. </p>

    <p>  He could not overtake the fugitives, and when he returned, he found out about a new trouble: in his absence, Mordred usurped power, declaring himself a monarch.  There was something to depress.  Yesterday, a brilliant king and a happy husband, Arthur lost both his crown and his wife.  He had already come to terms with the latter, but it was not so customary to give up power.  Gathering an army of knights devoted to him, he fought his nephew on the Kammlan field. </p><h2>  Arthur's death </h2><p>  The description of what happened on that fateful day occupies an important place in the writings of all the biographers of the king.  It was a grand battle in which all the legendary figures of that time came together.  It lasted from sunrise to sunset.  They write that all the British army perished in it.  Mordred also found his death and the villain, having managed to mortally wound the rightful king before this.  With his death, the family tree of Pendragons also withered. </p><p>  Before losing his breath, Arthur ordered his friend Sir Bediver to return the <span>Excalibur</span> magic <span>sword to the</span> elves on Lake Vatelin.  When he closed his eyelids, his body was buried on the <span>island of Avalon.</span>  There is a legend that Arthur‚Äôs death is just a dream that will be interrupted when disaster strikes over his beloved Britain, and he rises from the grave to save her. </p>
