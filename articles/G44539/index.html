But over the past few years, the number of Russian tourists who want to spend a vacation at Cyprotel Faliraki Resort 4 has also increased. Reviews about it are mostly positive.  First of all, they note real cosiness and sincere hospitality of the inhabitants of the island.  Living conditions are more than worthy.  The only disadvantages are the beach, which is not too close.  On the other hand, a relatively affordable price is an obvious advantage, since a day of staying at the hotel costs about 3,000 rubles per person. </p><p>  Moreover, here you will find a lot of entertainment.  Parents having a rest with children will also be pleased, as the guys really have something to do.
