The simplest ornaments and patterns with knitting needles: description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Needlework is becoming more and more popular in our time, many craftswomen gladly delight themselves and their loved ones with wonderful <span>knitted things.</span>  Knitting aces know that in order to get an excellent thing you need to choose the right yarn and ornament for <span>knitting.</span>  The scheme of the chosen ornament or pattern should be well read, because the result depends on the correct execution. </p><h2>  How to choose an ornament for knitting? </h2><p>  The speed of knitting and the appearance of the future product largely depend on the choice of ornament or pattern.  That is why their choice must be taken seriously.  A lot of various beautiful examples for knitting with a description can be found in books and magazines on knitting, on needlework sites or adopted from a familiar craftswoman.  But even the most magnificent ornament or pattern is sometimes simply not suitable for knitting the intended thing, and the simplest one can make it beautiful. </p><p>  The use of simple ornaments greatly facilitates the work: their scheme is easy to read, and this reduces the time for manufacturing things.  In most sweaters and sweaters, only in the front of the product there are ornaments and patterns, for other details simple knitting is used. </p><p>  You need to carefully select a pattern or ornament for knitting.  The scheme should have clear and understandable designations. </p><h2>  How to knit ornaments? </h2><p>  Knitting with a description of the sequence of execution of the ornament, of course, will be given easily, but such patterns are quite rare.  You often have to deal with the scheme.  Handicraft masters deal with this quite easily, but beginners may have difficulty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Every beginner in knitting should remember that for an ornament of any complexity, yarn of the same thickness is selected, regardless of color.  Otherwise, the work will look ugly. </p>

    <p>  When knitting an ornament, two or more types of colored threads are involved immediately.  Before starting knitting an ornament, you need to fix the thread of the necessary color from the wrong side.  If the fragments of the ornament are small, then the main thread should simply pass behind the loops of the pattern, which are knitted in a different color.  After knitting part of the ornament, the main thread is taken again. </p><p>  When knitting ornaments, you need to ensure that the threads are not mixed up.  After finishing a row, correctly rotate the work.  If you stop knitting, fold the balls so that they do not unwind. </p><h2>  Same patterns for ornament and pattern. </h2><p>  There are simple patterns by which you can knit patterns and ornaments.  An example would be a heart ornament.  To obtain it, dark cells of the scheme need to be knitted with threads contrasting with the main fabric.  If you want the picture to be brighter, you can knit all the cells in the middle of the heart together with dark ones in a different color. </p><p>  To obtain a pattern, you can, for example, knit a fabric with <span>purl loops,</span> and dark cells (in the diagram) - facial.  As in the case of the ornament, the entire middle of the heart, circled by dark cells, can also be knit with facial loops.  This will make the drawing more magnificent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Everyone can come up with a similar pattern or ornament for knitting.  The scheme is drawn very simply: at first a figure is depicted on a sheet in a cell, and then its edges are indicated by dark cells. </p><h2>  Children's ornaments </h2><p>  What child will not be delighted with clothes with ornaments of animals, toys or favorite fairy-tale characters?  Most likely, for him she will become the most favorite.  Knitted children's ornament with knitting needles makes any thing more vibrant and beautiful.  To knit such clothes, it is enough to have a pattern according to which you can easily repeat the pattern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting ornament for children" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/874967.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is very good to use schemes with a colored pattern: you will immediately see what colors of yarn you will need and which background is better to choose for a future ornament.  If you go for <span>threads,</span> it is better to take a <span>drawing</span> with you.  Sometimes, if the desired color is not available, you can choose another, most suitable, by attaching a thread to the picture. </p><p>  To diversify the knitted thing, you can use several simple ornaments at once.  In this case, you need to make sure that they are clearly visible on the selected background.  You also need to follow the general theme: cars next to flowers will look strange. </p><h2>  Knitting with the description of the pattern "Steps" </h2><p>  If you have only one color of thread, then for knitting a beautiful thing you can use a simple children's pattern.  For example, the ‚ÄúSteps‚Äù pattern is simple, but very beautiful.  It makes the thing voluminous, soft and warm.  It is because of these qualities that it is often used for knitting children's things.  To knit such a <span>pattern with knitting needles, it is</span> enough to be able to knit front and back loops.  The pattern is simple, but still attentiveness when knitting will not hurt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simple ornaments" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/874896.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For <span>knitting mittens</span> for adults, you can use <span>jacquard patterns.</span>  They can be used to decorate a certain part of the mittens or be present on the entire product.  Knitting such patterns is easy, the main thing is to carefully work with the scheme.  Scarves and hats associated with the use of similar ornaments look very nice. </p><p>  If it is difficult for beginners to knit complex ornaments, you can use their individual fragments.  To do this, circle the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe diagram on which the fragment you like is located, and work with it as a separate ornament.  You can also complement a single ornament with your favorite fragments from another pattern.  To do this, they need to be transferred to the scheme you use. </p><h2>  Is it possible to come up with an ornament myself? </h2><p>  Sometimes, for knitting the desired thing, you can review all the examples from all resources, but still can not find the right ornament.  Or on the product I want to place some original inscription that no one has used before.  In such cases, it is quite possible to make an ornament for knitting yourself.  The scheme for it is done quite easily: you need to take a piece of paper in the box and draw on it what you want to see on your product.  After that, the cells that are inside the picture need to be painted with a suitable color and you will get your own ornament. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/874959.jpg" width="497"></div>
