    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  What does any user need to know first of all about the purchased product?  IN the video card?  The memory?  No, the most important is the environment in which he will work.  Someone is striving for everything new and without looking back is buying a laptop with Windows 10, while someone prefers older and stable versions. </p><p>  Asus X552MJ offers customers one of three options.  Although, given the widespread transition to new OSs, the choice clearly seems imaginary.  In stores, you can find models with operating systems such as the "eight" on the Asus X552MJ-SX012H, the "ten" or just with the "bare" Dos. </p><p>  As you can see, despite the fact that the vast majority of users prefer the older "seven", it is not included in the package.  And due to some structural features of the new generation operating systems, reinstalling Asus X552MJ old versions can become problematic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the lack of an OS for the most part does not affect the price of the device, and therefore you should better think about what to do in advance: are you ready to get used to the new OS or for a long time trying to reinstall the so-beloved "seven". </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The heart of any computer is its operations center.  This parameter affects the speed of any software and hardware equipment.  When buying a laptop Asus X552MJ pay attention to its processor.  The price category from this parameter does not change, so choosing a better configuration in different stores for the same price is quite possible.  There are several variations of the kit: </p><ol><li>  Asus X552MJ-SX011D has a <span>Pentium N3540</span> series <span>processor</span> with a clock frequency of 2167 MHz and 4 cores.  Not bad for a modern computer, but not all games will go at high settings. </li><li>  Another configuration implies the presence of a core from Celeron.  The quad-core N2940 processor with a frequency of 1830 MHz is much farther in performance from its predecessor, but for some reason it is not very different in price. </li><li>  Notebook <span>Asus X552MJ-SX012H</span> has a "heart" Celeron N2840 with two cores and a frequency of 2160 MHz.  As you can see, the equipment is even worse than in the other two assemblies, but this also does not affect the price. </li></ol><p>  Obviously, the <span>Asus X552MJ laptop</span> comes in a wide variety of assemblies and configurations, which unscrupulous merchants use.  Despite such differences in processors, the price of this series differs only within one thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Everything here is more or less simple.  Asus X552MJ has one slot for a DDR3 memory card.  Therefore, be sure to pay attention to the equipment when purchasing.  You will not be able to add memory later, but only replace the existing one.  Get this laptop with only 4 GB of RAM or more.  The 2 GB offered is too little for modern technology, so there‚Äôs no point in overpaying for a replacement later. </p><h2>  HDD </h2><p>  As for the place on the laptop, there are several nuances.  The configurations offered in stores have a hard disk size from 500 GB to 1 TB.  If you are going to use a newer operating system, it is better to take a larger hard drive, since it not only takes up a large space in the computer's memory, but also requires a large swap file. </p><p>  If you plan to reinstall the "seven" on your own laptop, then you can get by with 750 GB.  The smaller size, with today's volumes of stored information, will be simply useless, and you will have to spend money on an external hard drive. </p><p>  Especially pay attention to the fact that the hard drive is connected via SATA2.  This means that you cannot replace it with a more modern and faster one.  However, users still recommend replacing the bundled hard drive with any other.  Along with this, the speed increases and some of the freezes disappear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Which monitor does the Asus X552MJ laptop have?  15.6 "is a completely standard wide screen for most devices of this series. It does not have any special" chips "like a sensor or multitouch, and it doesn‚Äôt support such fashionable 3D. It‚Äôs just a screen for displaying information, but not multimedia However, based on user reviews, it was made soundly - it does not reflect and does not darken, and the viewing angle is quite wide. </p><p>  Resolution 1366 x 768 allows you to watch movies in HD-format without loss of quality, which is a definite plus for a device in this price category. </p><h2>  Video card </h2><p>  And here Asus X552MJ, the review of which we are compiling, brings its users.  All assemblies of this model are equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce 920M card.  Despite the fact that it has DirectX 11 support, it is built on the basis of the chip used in older models (730, 740, 825), therefore it would be possible to say that this device is outdated.  But manufacturers continued to surprise and in addition lowered the core frequency to 575-954 MHz, which, without a twinge of conscience, allows us to classify this card as a low-level one. </p><p>  If you are going to buy a laptop for entertainment, then this model is poorly suited for this task.  Games such as Far Cry 4 or Evolve will play "grunting" already at medium settings. </p><p>  However, the card does a great job watching a widescreen video.  At the same time, it has reduced energy consumption, due to which the laptop becomes much easier. </p>

    <p>  Advanced users will benefit from the Nvidia Expirience program.  It will allow you to independently adjust the performance of the video card to the desired level, as a result of which even the most demanding and modern games will be able to run at minimum and medium settings. </p><h2>  Slots </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Asus X552MJ laptop receives only positive reviews, it is presented by the manufacturer "as is".  It does not have any expansion slots, including Express Card. </p><p>  A special slot with support for all SD formats is allocated for external memory cards.  MicroSD has nowhere to connect, but for this there are special adapters for SD, which often go immediately in the kit. </p><h2>  Communication and interaction </h2><p>  To connect to the Internet and other devices, Asus X552MJ has several special interfaces: </p><ol><li>  Bluetooth 4.0 for sharing files with other devices continues to sin with inaccuracy and often sees gadgets only from the same manufacturer.  This is not to mention the fact that this method has long been outdated. </li><li>  The Wi-Fi 802.11n standard is quite common for laptops of any series and copes with its purpose by 5 points. </li><li>  The integrated network card has one LAN port with support for speeds up to 100 Mbps. </li><li>  There are also two USB 3.0 ports. </li><li>  From the video card we get two outputs - HDMI and VGA. </li></ol><p>  In general, the set is pretty standard for any model in this price category.  Unless most users are unhappy with the small amount of USB. </p>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  What can be said about this?  This unit has a built-in microphone and a pair of speakers.  They are far from the sound produced by home theaters, but the volume and clarity allows you to watch videos and listen to music without a strong loss of quality. </p><p>  Headphones can be connected to the laptop via the standard miniJack jack, however there is no jack for the microphone.  Apparently, the developers believe that shouting at the whole apartment so that the built-in microphone can hear you, this is normal. </p><h2>  pros </h2><p>  After familiarizing yourself with the technical side of the device we presented, let's figure out how it works in practice, and what you should pay attention to when buying. </p><p>  <span>Asus X552MJ, reviews</span> of which we will now consider, receives an average score of "4" from users.  Despite the fact that there are many shortcomings, buyers are clearly aware that the device fully justifies the proposed average price of 26 thousand rubles.  So, what are the good things people make? </p><ul><li>  Sound.  As we already wrote, the built-in card allows you to play music and movies quite adequately. </li><li>  Performance.  However, buyers were clearly in no hurry to test the laptop on over-demanding games. </li><li>  Silent  Due to the video card and its chip, the design avoids the increased load on cooling systems. </li><li>  Holds the battery well. </li><li>  Build quality.  There is no creaking or backlash as on Lenovo models of the same price category. </li></ul><p>  Manufacturers have created a good and reliable laptop, which is nice to work with.  But the minuses will have to be mentioned separately.  After all, it is on them in most cases that buyers pay attention.  Who will be interested in the advantages of the device, no matter how beautiful and powerful it may be, if at the same time it will start and work every other time? </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  It‚Äôs clear that you don‚Äôt have to expect much from the ‚Äúoffice‚Äù computer.  But even so, users manage to find flaws and justify them: </p><ul><li>  Slow hard drive.  Given the already outdated SATA2 technology, this is indeed so.  Any resource-intensive applications, the speed of which will depend on the speed of access to the hard drive, are slow. </li><li>  Only 1 slot for RAM.  Accordingly, 8 GB of maximum memory.  The laptop is clearly not designed for craftsmen who love to upgrade everything on their own. </li><li>  Another drawback - the keyboard bends.  Obviously, the plastic from which the laptop is made is not of too high quality. </li><li>  Only 2 USB.  Given all of the above, this model is more suitable for the role of a workstation than a gaming laptop.  However, the low number of ports will not allow connecting a huge variety of office equipment, which means that as an office ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù it is also not very good. </li></ul><p>  Now you can see what Asus X552MJ offers in practice.  The reviews turned out to be very versatile, but at the same time completely interconnected and not contradicting each other.  If you are ready for a long setup and "witchcraft" over this instance of technology, then you can safely acquire it. </p><p>  Summarizing everything that was written here, we can conclude that this Asus X552MJ model was not entirely successful.  At its price, you could find a better and more efficient laptop that would not require any manipulation from you.  This device is clearly overpriced (apparently due to the brand), especially when you consider that in order to optimize and improve its performance, you will have to purchase another hard drive and in some cases replace the memory card.  If you need a laptop for office and surfing the Internet, then you can pick up models much cheaper and more competent assembled than this unit. </p>
