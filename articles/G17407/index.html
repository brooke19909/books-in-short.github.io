They differ from each other in the quality and resolution of shooting, the presence of additional functions, the size of the storage medium and dimensions.  At the same time, it is important to note that the pricing policy of manufacturers is to impose a product with maximum equipment and overpriced on the modern user.  Sometimes the buyer simply overpays for those features that he will never use.  That is why drivers are most often looking for budget models, the bright representative of which is the AdvoCam FD Black.  Reviews about this product deserve our attention, because they allow us to understand all the features of this device. </p>

    <h2>  Price group </h2><p>  You must immediately point out the fact that this product is included in the category of registrars, which can be arbitrarily designated ‚Äúup to five thousand‚Äù.  At the same time, even the AdvoCam FD Black GPS DVR, reviews of which indicate the presence of better assembly details, fits into this group.  This is due to the fact that the manufacturer is trying to offer its buyer a device with all the necessary functions in the optimal configuration and at an affordable price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  Considering the AdvoCam FD Black GPS auto-recorder, reviews of which claim to have good build quality, it is worth mentioning that the product is manufactured in Russia.  The plant for design and subsequent testing is located in the city of Alexandrov (Vladimir region).  Assembly is carried out in China in order to reduce the cost of production. </p><p>  It is important to say that this registrar cannot be called the cheapest.  However, it combines all the most necessary functions, good shooting quality and the best price.  The developers themselves claim that they have found a compromise in picking, which will be interesting to people who do not want to overpay for the brand. </p>

User reviews often indicate that the driver himself sometimes does not know what to do with the existing record.  Therefore, many simply post it on the Web or try to independently prove their rights.  With this in mind, lawyer Viktor Travin in his booklet describes a detailed procedure for submitting all the necessary documents and points out some options for the development of events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  This device has some design features: </p><ul><li>  The design requires a camera and screen. </li><li>  Records video with a resolution of 1920x1080 at 30 fps. </li><li>  Two recording modes: cyclic and continuous. </li><li>  There is <span>a shock sensor</span> type G-sensor. </li><li>  The presence of GPS is provided in the model AdvoCam FD Black GPS.

    <h2>  Own impressions and test drive </h2><p>  In order to understand all the advantages of a particular model, you must independently test it in practice.  You need to inspect and check the AdvoCam FD Black DVR.  Reviews sometimes give only the general impression of certain people.  Only an independent test will show all the advantages and disadvantages, since they will be carried out on a large scale, taking into account different situations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Inspection </h2><p>  Taking the device out of the box, it is immediately worth noting the quality of its assembly.  The recorder does not look flimsy, does not creak with a slight compression and has no noise when shaking.  It is also important to mention that the case is made of soft touch plastic.  This material has a matte surface, which does not allow dust to collect on it, although if we consider the AdvoCam FD Black GPS DVR more critically, user reviews are inclined to believe that the coating could be better.  However, you must remember that the product can be attributed to the line of low-cost devices. </p><p>  The design of the recorder looks very nice and somewhat resembles a small camera.  At the same time, the dimensions of the design can not be classified as miniature, which some users do not like. </p><p>  The control keys are located on the upper end of the product.  They are placed in pairs on both sides, which makes using the recorder very convenient.  At the same time, the keys are large enough, which makes it possible to switch modes while driving, without fear of pushing the wrong way. </p><p>  On the right side of the device there is a slot for a memory card.  At the bottom of the recorder is an HDMI output and a micro USB connector. </p>

    <h2>  Functional </h2><p>  Usually AdvoCam FD Black GPS reviews have the most positive.  Moreover, the most frequent among them are precisely those that indicate ease of use.  The manufacturer studied in detail all the requests of motorists and based on them created the functionality of their product. </p><p>  One key with a point can start and stop recording.  At the same time, it allows you to get a photo and is responsible for the confirmation function in working with the menu. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúM‚Äù button allows you to immediately mark the required file as emergency, excluding it from the record.  This is very convenient, because at the time of the incident a person experiences severe stress and can often not clearly control his actions and, moreover, go to the menu and perform certain work in it.  This button also puts the device in control mode and makes it possible to switch from photo to video. </p><p>  To call the settings, the developers have provided a special button, which especially stands out AdvoCam FD Black.  Reviews, review and test drive showed that such a solution, many users consider it very practical.  The driver needs to minimize the number of actions that distract him from participating in traffic.  Such a constructive solution is also convenient for people who do not really like to poke around in various menu items in search of settings. </p><p>  There are also two arrow buttons on the side of the product.  They allow you to navigate through the menu, and in recording mode, they allow you to turn off the microphone or screen.  They are located on the left, which is very convenient for the driver. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The device is equipped with a 2.7-inch display that fits perfectly into the dimensions of the AdvoCam FD Black.  Reviews, photos and a test drive showed that the recorder is difficult to attribute to compact products, but the presence of such a screen has its advantages.  The fact is that the product body itself is relatively small.  It fully accommodates the screen, leaving a little space around the edges. </p><p>  It is important to note that the sides of the 16: 9 display are considered the most optimal, and the complete absence of buttons on the front panel makes the design very convenient.  The only addition that can be seen on the front of the recorder is made in the form of a small light bulb indicating that recording is in progress. </p><p>  Special attention also deserves the AdvoCam FD Black menu.  Reviews, specifications and all kinds of reviews emphasize the fact that it has almost no abbreviations.  The driver does not need to guess which menu item is hidden under the abbreviation.  Everything looks very convenient and practical.  Therefore, even a novice user can understand the management. </p><h2>  Mount </h2><p>  Considering the AdvoCam FD Black, reviews, advantages and disadvantages, you immediately need to pay attention to the type of mount.  The fact is that most manufacturers devote very little time to this element during development.  As a result, we get very good devices that are simply impossible to use.  We have to look for third-party fasteners to fix the registrar. </p><p>  However, when developing a specific model, the manufacturer did not pay attention to this detail at all.  The company felt that it was enough to use the standard hardware, which is included in the package of delivery of more expensive models.  And this can safely be called another advantage of this registrar. </p><p>  In the AdvoCam FD Black mount, the reviews practically did not reveal any shortcomings.  This is due to the fact that this part has a special connection for charging, which is joined at the time of installation.  As a result, additional wires will not interfere with the driver, and when removing the recorder, you do not need to disconnect the additional connectors. </p><p>  The presence of a spherical connection makes it possible to adjust the device without using special screws or clamps, which cheaper models cannot boast.  Some skeptics argue that this embodiment of fasteners is impractical, because of the constant vibration, the hinge loosens and its fixation loosens, as evidenced by excellent reviews about AdvoCam FD Black.  The advantages of this model are proven by practice, and such fasteners continue to perform their functions well even after prolonged use. </p><p>  Also, GPS is integrated into this fixture.  Such a technical solution should help simplify the communication of the device with the satellite.  However, it is believed that for such products the absence of a constant and stable signal is not critical. </p><h2>  Compatibility </h2><p>  It is immediately worth noting that the AdvoCam FD Black GPS car DVR has the most positive reviews on compatibility.  When connected to a computer, the product is defined as a disk drive that you can work with, just like with a regular USB flash drive.  An installed memory card is defined as another disk. </p><p>  If you need to connect the device to the TV, then this is done using a special cable.  As a result, all information from the display is displayed on the screen with all the necessary functions retained.  Of particular note is the fact that when the connection is established there are no malfunctions in the registrar and there is no braking at all. </p>

    <h2>  Test </h2><p>  When installing the product, ease of fixation was noted, which indicates the quality of the AdvoCam FD Black recorder itself.  User reviews claim that the product can be installed covertly.  This turned out to be true, since the dimensions of the device made it possible to place it behind the rear-view mirror so that it was not visible from the side. </p><p>  The tests were carried out on uneven roads, and even large potholes could not affect the position of the device.  With a big shake, the recorder kept the previously set angle and performed its functions perfectly. </p><p>  The location of the product buttons is quite convenient.  Hand almost intuitively rest on the right keys.  All manipulations can be made without being distracted from the road. </p><h2>  Daytime video </h2><p>  Our car DVR AdvoCam FD Black reviews during the daytime work has the most positive.  The fact is that the product has matrices that were previously used only on professional surveillance systems.  At the same time, they are complemented by six glass lenses and create a viewing angle of 170 degrees. </p><p>  In principle, daily shooting with this product is carried out at a high level.  Excellent color reproduction, lack of blurring and blurry areas around the edges.  However, it is important to note that there is a slight defect.  This is a violation of the white balance.  The fact is that blue dominates periodically, although it quickly returns to normal parameters and does not cause inconvenience. </p><h2>  Night shooting </h2><p>  Speaking about the night video AdvoCam FD Black, user reviews note the presence of stains from headlights and flashlights.  However, in practice, this drawback has almost no effect on the quality of the survey.  The picture is quite clear and contrasting.  At such a time of day, even the most expensive registrar can not boast of absolute quality, but this model deserves a solid four.  Recognition of numbers is quite possible at a distance of 5-10 meters, which is acceptable.  It is important to mention that the test drive was carried out on the settings that were used for the day trip. </p>
