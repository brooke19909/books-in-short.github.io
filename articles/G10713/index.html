However, in 2013, reconstruction was carried out here.  Therefore, the decoration in the lobby, corridors and hotel rooms is relatively new.  The same goes for furniture and household appliances. </p><p>  The hotel Matina 3 * ( <span>Rhodes island, Greece) is a</span> three-story concrete building of modern construction with a rather large courtyard.  On the territory of the complex there is a huge pool, and flower beds with exotic plants are broken.  A five-minute walk from the hotel is a small church in which peacocks live.

    <p>  The disadvantages of rooms rented at the Matina Hotel Faliraki (Rhodes), many tourists attribute the presence of a large number of mosquitoes.  Unfortunately, <span>mosquito nets on the doors of balconies</span> and windows in the rooms are not installed.  Russians who bought tours to Faliraki with accommodation at this hotel should definitely take records with them, for example, such a tool as Raptor.  Judging by the reviews of many vacationers, they help quite well from Greek mosquitoes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Tourists consider the showers in this hotel not particularly convenient.  The area they have, according to most guests, is too small.  In addition, the souls themselves are very small.  They are closed with very short curtains, and therefore, water from them pours onto the floor during bathing.  In addition, in the showers of this hotel there is no bracket for a watering can.  This, of course, is also extremely inconvenient. </p><p>  Most residents like the balconies in this hotel.  Their dimensions are really huge.  In particular, the loggias of the corner rooms have a large area.  In addition, for the convenience of guests, plastic summer furniture is also installed on the balconies of the hotel.  Therefore, here you can very pleasantly relax in the evening.  Of course, many guests use the balconies of the hotel and for hanging beach items.  The climate in Greece is rather damp, and therefore drying, for example, a swimsuit in the shower room even overnight is extremely problematic. </p>
