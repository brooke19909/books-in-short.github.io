    <p>  The model under the name A5 occupies middle positions in the entire relevant product line.  She will, of course, be better than A3.  However, above the subject of our review today is the A7, which is equipped with a screen with a diagonal of 5.5 inches.  In addition, the device has built-in hardware an order of magnitude more powerful, which provides better performance compared to the A5.  In general, the seventh model can be equated to a phablet, in which there is simply no metal case and stylus. </p><p>  Samsung Galaxy A5 SM A500F, reviews of which are discussed in this article, entered the market at a modified price, and not at what was planned during the development of the device.  The reason for this was the change in the dollar.  And this negatively affected the sales of the device.  The fact is that it is much more profitable to purchase any previous model at a lower price.  For example, the same Galaxy S4.  A phenomenon of internal competition has arisen, with which the South Korean manufacturer is currently trying to cope. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is expected that towards the end of the year, the company will revise the prices of all its devices, which are included in the corresponding model range.  Exceptions are unlikely to be, they are not yet expected.  But now, until the pricing policy has been revised, the price of the Samsung Galaxy A5 SM A500F DS (reviews eloquently testify to this) is somewhat illogical.  She simply knocks out of the segment.  Such a peculiar contrast is felt beautifully, and it should be said that the hardware analogues in terms of sales prevail over the new product. </p><p>  Generally speaking, the device under the name Samsung Galaxy A5 SM <span>A500F 16GB,</span> reviews of which are given at the end of the review, can be called just an image.  If you are a supporter of the theory that the device needs to be selected on the basis of price-quality considerations, then you can safely pass by.  Well, for those who are seriously interested in this device, we will write a further review.  So, if the A3 was presented as a smartphone, designed more for calls, then the A5 for us is already a device that provides its owner with a full range of functions.  The device is multifunctional, which can not be said.  To get started, let's figure out what the Samsung Galaxy A5 SM A500F White can offer, reviews of which are written at the end of the article. </p><h2>  Brief Specifications </h2>

    <p>  There is an LTE module that allows you to work in the fourth generation cellular network.  There are spatial navigation features such as GPS and GLONASS.  The composition of wireless interfaces is represented by Wi-Fi, operating in the b, g, n bands, Bluetooth module version 4.0, as well as a port for synchronization with a personal computer.  This is MicroUSB - USB 2.0. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The battery is designed for a day of battery life.  Its capacity is 2,300 mAh.  The height and width of the device are, respectively, 139.3 by 69.7 mm with a thickness of 6.7 mm.  Weight Samsung SM A500F Galaxy A5 Duos, reviews of which can be found in this article, does not exceed 123 grams. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  What can we find inside the package from under the Samsung Galaxy A5 SM A500F Black, reviews of which are very different?  This, of course, is the smartphone itself and vital accessories.  This is a charger, which is equipped with a removable cable such as MicroUSB - USB.  You can also find the instruction manual along with the warranty card in the box.  Well, completing the whole composition is additional accessories represented by a wired stereo headset and a needle, with which you can pull out the tray from the phone into which a pre-processed SIM card is installed. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Surely you have already noticed that the devices of the product line ‚ÄúA‚Äù of the Korean manufacturer have a similar design.  This has spread to the Samsung Galaxy A5 SM A500F Gold, reviews of which will help determine the choice of phone.  Soon after the first announcement of the device, it became known that the company took a very long time to create the most high-quality variation of the case.  The company reacted to the process very, very responsibly, which manifested itself in excellent build quality. </p><h2>  Edging </h2><p>  Along the perimeter of the Samsung Galaxy A5 SM A500F, reviews confirm this, a metal frame passes.  The same thing can be seen with devices such as Samsung Note 4 or Samsung Alpha.  In the same way, the edges of a smartphone are framed.  In sunlight, they play, casting off glare.  The back panel of the device is made of the same material (metal).  The only difference is that it is painted in the color that the rest of the body has.  There is a pair of recesses in which the antennas are built.  However, it is difficult to notice them, since the paint was applied precisely with this in mind. </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> A5 SM A500F Single Sim reviews can be found at the end of the article, but for now we‚Äôll add a few words about the combinations in which the manufacturer‚Äôs devices are sold.  From the very beginning, the A5 was supplied to the smartphone market in two colors, classic: it is black and white.  However, the situation later changed.  So, in the salons of cellular communications began to appear models of pink and blue, gold colors.  Perhaps in the near future new variations will be put on the smartphone market.  But note that in this regard, the device is similar to the A3 model. </p><h2>  Winning option </h2><p>  Perhaps the optimal color scheme will be just white.  Why exactly him?  The fact is that it is pearly, not matte.  That is why in the world he plays quite well.  If you try to intentionally cause physical damage to the case, then scratches will appear, this is a fact.  But on white to find them is not an example more difficult than on other colors.  At the same time, scratches will be generally invisible, unless you specifically look for them with your eyes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, what about the subject of our review today?  What advantages and disadvantages does it have, and what is the opinion of the owners of the phone? </p><p>  First of all, we note the features characteristic of the devices of the South Korean manufacturer.  This, of course, is a good quality connection.  Not bad, one can even say that a very high-quality conversational speaker has a volume margin.  You can not complain about the purity of sound.  The interlocutor‚Äôs speech is heard very, very well. </p><p>  At the same time, the volume of the incoming call is not lame.  You can be sure that you will not miss an important call even in noisy environments.  The radio part is made with high quality.  Something similar to the S4 and S5 models. </p><p>  Currently, the cost of the device is about 22-23 thousand rubles.  The hardware is on the level, but there‚Äôs nothing to boast of.  According to buyers, the price is still too high.  Competition may be made by Apple devices.  However, they still have a slightly different price tag, so we are still not worth comparing them. </p><p>  If you belong to an audience that does not want the smartphone to be made of plastic, then you can try to purchase the device.  Especially if you are not particularly interested in specifications.  But as such, the model is not very good.  There are practically no differences from the devices of the previous season. </p>
