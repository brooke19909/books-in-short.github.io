    <p>  Solomon was the son of the famous <span>king David.</span>  It was his king who chose as his successor.  However, the elder brother of Solomon did not agree with the decision of his father and arbitrarily decided to declare himself king.  Upon learning of this, David was furious.  They initially wanted to execute the naughty son, but at the last moment they had mercy.  This was a lesson for everyone, and no one else encroached on the royal throne. </p><p>  Solomon was endowed with an extraordinary mind.  Under his rule, the kingdom of Israel reached its peak.  Under him, the <span>Jerusalem Temple</span> was built <span>,</span> which later became the main shrine for believers. </p>

In medieval legends, the seal of Solomon appears in the form of two <span>equilateral triangles</span> superimposed on each other.  This symbol was placed on the legendary ring of King Solomon.  It is believed that he gave him power over spirits, genies and the ability to communicate with animals. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seal solomon photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6836/67230.jpg" width="377"></div>  Seal of Solomon became the occasion for the creation of many legends.  In some, it is described as a ring on which the name of God is written.  In others - it is said that this is a symbol, called the Star of David in our days, enclosed in a circle.  Between the rays there are points and other symbols.  An example is the six-petal rosettes found in ancient Egypt, Hellas, Mesopotamia.  In the Middle Ages they were called the seven-circle seal and looked like the seal of Solomon.

    <p>  Christians associated the seal with seven centuries of world history, which are under the auspices of the Archangels.  The head of the board is Archangel Michael.  He personifies the fifth element (quintessence) of the center of the press.  All other six elements are around it. </p><p>  In Muslims, a six-pointed star enclosed in a circle is considered a symbol of great intelligence and wisdom.  It is placed on interior and household items.  In some countries, for example, Morocco, the seal of Solomon (whose photo can be seen from various angles on the Internet) was placed on coins. </p><p>  Today, the seal of Solomon and the Star of David have merged into one concept.  This symbol is found disguised in many works of art - statues, drawings, altar paintings, engravings and so on.  A seven-circle seal can be seen in the center of the labyrinth of the floor <span>of Chartres Cathedral.</span>  Some give this symbol a mystical meaning and associate it with legends about the construction of the magnificent <span>Temple of Solomon,</span> located in Jerusalem. </p>
