    <h2>  Legislation </h2><p>  An important legislative document that spells out the nuances <span>of OSAGO insurance</span> is the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Compulsory Third Party Liability Insurance of Vehicle Owners‚Äù.  Issue of the act refers to April 25, 2013.  Later changes were made to improve customer engagement. </p><p>  Based on the requirements of the document, it is clear that insurance should be mandatory.  It is required to protect against traffic accidents so that there are no unnecessary expenses in case of violation of the rules.  The insurance company undertakes to reimburse funds to the affected party. </p><p>  All car owners must abide by the rules of the contract.  If you do not conclude it in time, then deprivation of rights will follow as a punishment.  And restoration occurs only after obtaining the necessary documentation, in particular, compulsory motor liability insurance. </p><p>  Reviews indicate that it is better to draw up a policy immediately, since fines are issued to the owner of the car.  Many believe that it is better to use the services of trusted companies.  Most of them offer favorable conditions.  Many owners are advised to immediately issue and CASCO, so that the ride was much calmer.  This policy involves compensation for the repair of your car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of Insurance Companies </h2><p>  Where is the best way to issue CTP?
