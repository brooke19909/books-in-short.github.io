    <p>  Arriving here, tourists, of course, expect to relax on the beach.  What should tourists expect at Margaret Studios 3 * hotel?  Rhodes is an island that is famous for its spacious and incredibly beautiful beaches.  The distance to the seashore from the hotel is no more than 300 meters. </p><p>  Reviews say that the coast is beautiful.  The beach itself, as well as the entrance to the sea, is covered with large pebbles.  That is why travelers are advised to acquire suitable shoes.  Immediately it is worth saying that the sea is not too calm here, most of the year there are quite large waves.  It is this fact that makes the beach popular among surfers - there is even a windsurfing center nearby where you can rent boards, suits and other equipment, as well as take a short training course. </p><p>  There are sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach, but their rent is paid.  Nearby is a small bar where vacationers can enjoy a chilled cocktail or even have a tasty meal.  Of course, here tourists can go boating and water skiing, engage in various types of water sports and relax actively. </p><h2>  Additional amenities for guests </h2>

    <p>  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that the Margaret Studios 3 * hotel complex is used by most tourists only as an overnight stay.  But in the daytime tourists bask in the gentle sunshine on the beach, learn windsurfing skills and travel around the island, studying its history and attractions.  By the way, the hotel sometimes organizes group cycling trips in the surroundings. </p><p>  But a break from noisy entertainment is sometimes also nice.  In the courtyard there is a large pool with cool water, however, it only works in the warm season.  Nearby, on the terrace, guests rest and relax on comfortable sun loungers, get to know and chat with each other.  There is even a special small section where the kids bathe. </p><h2>  Hotel Margaret Studios 3 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  As you know, reviews of people who managed to relax in your chosen hotel can shed more light on the big picture.  Margaret Studios 3 * hotel is considered a suitable place for a relaxing and at the same time budget holiday on the island of Rhodes.  Guests say that the rooms here are quite large and clean, although the atmosphere is straightforward.  Household appliances are working. </p><p>  By the way, in a local restaurant you can really eat well, but many tourists do not pay in advance, preferring to explore the local cuisine, visiting various cafes in the town.  The location is advantageous, since in 10 minutes you can reach both the central part of the resort and the seashore.  The service is not bad, although sometimes there are inconveniences in communication, because local employees do not speak Russian.  Nevertheless, the prices for accommodation in this hotel are very affordable, and the conditions are not bad, so there is no shortage of tourists. </p>
