    <h2>  Good location </h2><p>  The location of the hotel is very important for a person who has come to rest.  It is advisable to be closer to the center and near the sea.  And I must say, Defne Defnem Hotel 5 in this regard is an excellent option.  Firstly, the beach is located very close to the complex - literally three minutes walk.  Side is also a little from the city center - 3 kilometers, this is a maximum of 10 minutes by car or minibus.  Manavgat is quite close - the hotel is 8 km from its center.  The airport is 62 km away.  By the way, Antalya is not so far (72 kilometers).  Staying on vacation in Turkey, you should at least once go to this city, which is the main resort of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We can say with confidence: if you do not like to sit in a hotel and want to visit not only the beach, you should check into Defne Defnem Hotel 5, because in terms of location this is an excellent option. </p>

    <h2>  Architectural features </h2><p>  If we talk about the most original and beautiful hotels in Turkey, then the Top 10 will definitely include Defne Defnem Hotel 5. Photos of this complex are simply fascinating.  The snow-white ideal building of the hotel attracts the eyes of everyone - both guests of Turkey and local residents.  It looks like a huge temple, made in the ancient Greek style, with arches, high columns, stunning picturesque sculptures.  Defne Defnem Hotel 5 cannot be attributed to ordinary seaside hotels.

And all this is decorated with real stone and artwork.  In general, everything is done in the best ancient traditions, and all the guests like to be inside such splendor. </p>
