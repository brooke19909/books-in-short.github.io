The beauty of colorful Ireland, washed by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, is indescribable.  And everyone should rest here at least once. </p><h2>  "Green Island" </h2><p>  It is worth remembering that one part of the small island (Northern Ireland) belongs to the UK, and the other, the Republic of Ireland, is located on its main territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beauty of local landscapes" class="if uuid-3135268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3135268.jpg"></div><p>  The country of unlimited freedom, in which the descendants of the mysterious Celtic people live, is a popular tourist region.  Amazing even for experienced travelers, it is full of medieval sights and miraculous masterpieces.  Holidays in Ireland, the most beautiful pearl of Europe, called the "Emerald Isle", will plunge into the magical world of ancient myths.  Tourists dreaming of spiritual harmony and unity with nature come here to restore strength and improve their health. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  The country is dominated by a temperate marine climate.  Its west is washed by the warm Gulf Stream, which brings moisture and warm air with the winds.  In summer it is pretty cool, and above 20 ¬∞ C the temperature does not rise.  Winters are mild and comfortable, the average air temperature is 7 ¬∞ C. Snow falls very rarely and not for long. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As the locals joke, in just a day you can see all the seasons.  And this is true: a sunny morning ends on a cloudy rainy evening, so even in the summer you should definitely take an umbrella and warm clothes with you. </p><p>  The water temperature in winter is 6 <sup>¬∞</sup> C, and in summer - about 17 <sup>¬∞</sup> C. </p><h2>  The best time to relax </h2><p>  When is the best time for tourists who are afraid of the harsh climate of the country to go on vacation to Ireland?  The most favorable time to visit the island state is July and August, when the sea waters are warmed up enough and you can swim, because the swimming season is very short. </p><p>  In early September, all guests will also have an excellent rest: you can‚Äôt swim, but you can go on fascinating sightseeing tours.  And it‚Äôs worth hurrying, because already in the middle of the month it begins to rain, which makes trips unattractive.  However, autumn is the favorite time of festivals and holidays, and the Irish know how to have fun. </p><h2>  Founded by the Vikings </h2><p>  Dublin is the capital of Ireland, and rest in the county city will be remembered for a long time, because it is one of the most distinctive settlements in Europe.  They rush here to immerse themselves in a special atmosphere.  Founded by the Vikings, it is famous for its architectural sights that reflect a rich history.  It is called the "most English" city in the country, because for many years Dublin was the center of the already difficult relationship between the royal court and ordinary Irish.  And to this day, national color and colonial heritage are harmoniously combined here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  The administrative center is located on the shores of the Gulf of <span>Ireland.</span>  The luxury of fashionable streets, ancient architecture, green parks, expensive restaurants - all this delights vacationers.  The most famous sights of the city are located on its territory or in the immediate vicinity of it. </p><p>  The visiting card of the capital is the old St. Patrick's Cathedral, in which the famous writer D. Swift found the last shelter.  Dublin Castle is another landmark monument that arouses the interest of vacationers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dublin Castle" class="if uuid-3135270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3135270.jpg"></div><p>  A guided tour of the Guinness brewery is always popular.  In exchange for an entrance ticket, visitors will be poured a pint of delicious beer, and from the observation deck they will admire amazing city views. </p><h2>  Travel tip </h2><p>  You should definitely get a Dublin Pass - a discount card that will save on holidays in Ireland.  Reviews of tourists about her are the most positive, and this is not surprising, because it provides guests of the capital with a number of significant benefits.  The card can be ordered for 1, 2, 3 or 5 days on the official website, and pick up at the airport terminal or tourist center (25 Suffolk Street).  Its cost is from 39 to 114 euros. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  With Dublin Pass you can count on discounts at theaters, shops and restaurants.  The price includes a free transfer from the airport to the center of Dublin.  But most importantly, the map gives you the opportunity to visit more than 30 main attractions of the capital of the country for free and make a trip on a sightseeing bus. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Dublin </h2><p>  Travelers note that there are a lot of cozy hotels offering their services.  Moreover, they often run promotions that make it easy to rent a room with big discounts. </p><p>  The picturesque parks of the city are great places for walking, and many attractions of the modern indoor water park will appeal to visitors of all ages. </p><p>  In Dublin, it is very easy to combine relaxation with excellent shopping, which is not affordable.  Sales season is in the middle of summer, as well as on winter holidays. </p><p>  Temple Bar is considered the most favorite area among tourists, because it is here that dozens of restaurants, bars and nightclubs are concentrated.  It is impossible to deny yourself the pleasure of visiting one of the pubs and buying a designer souvenir in the store.  Here, life does not freeze even for a minute, so you should pay special attention to the atmospheric area, where everyone is imbued with the spirit of Ireland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelwifi.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple Bar in Dublin" class="if uuid-3135284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3135284.jpg"></div><p>  Rest in the capital is not only educational excursions.  According to tourists, their most memorable impressions remain after the celebration of St. Patrick's Day.  The national holiday is celebrated on a special scale.  It thunders across the country, but the center of the fun event is in Dublin.  On March 17, each guest will be in the thick of things!  Orchestras go along the streets, beautifully decorated carts ride, and all the participants in the amazing parade are dressed in green.  The apotheosis of this holiday of life is the grandiose fireworks, the multi-colored lights of which illuminate the night sky.  And then admiring tourists admit that this particular vacation will remain in their memory forever. </p><h2>  "Celtic Venice" </h2><p>  Where is it better to relax in Ireland?  Travelers who have already visited the blessed land know for sure that not only the capital of the country is of interest to them.  Small towns located near Dublin attract with picturesque landscapes and ancient architecture. </p><p>  Cork standing on the water, where they go to be alone with nature, falls in love with itself at first sight.  Situated on both banks of the fast Lee River, it is not like any other city in Ireland.  Its central part is a kind of island, and the unique landscape leaves an unforgettable experience.  "Irish Venice", surrounded by the muddy waters of the river, is famous not only for a huge number of bridges and castles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eu.ironman.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Celtic Venice&quot;" class="if uuid-3135272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3135272.jpg"></div><p>  People come here to visit the wildlife park - a nature reserve where most animals live in conditions close to natural.  Monkeys rush along overgrown paths, zebras and giraffes graze on green meadows, and cute pandas conveniently perched on tree branches.  The animals are so accustomed to the influx of people that they do not even run away when they approach. </p><h2>  Where the spirit of the Middle Ages hovers </h2><p>  Waterford, founded by the Vikings, has become an attractive tourist destination, each street of which recalls the past.  The spirit of the Middle Ages hovers here, giving the picturesque town a mysterious halo.  The most popular attraction is the well-preserved Norman Reginald tower, which is the oldest building in Ireland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Vadrefjord, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ireland's oldest building at Waterford" class="if uuid-3135273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3135273.jpg"></div><p>  Thousands of archaeological finds are kept in the treasure museum.  Visitors will be able to see jewelry adorned with precious stones, minted coins, beads and much more.  Most of the exhibits dedicated to the times of the Vikings are in the tower, where the historical museum is located. </p><h2>  Archaeological site </h2><p>  Thousands of tourists are thinking about what to see on holiday in Ireland.  Few people know that 40 kilometers from Dublin is Newgrange - the oldest religious building on our planet.  It appeared between 3100 and 2900 BC, which means that the giant mound is older than the pyramids in Giza and Stonehenge in England.  Fenced in with a stone wall, it served as a center for various rituals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.renegadetribune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Newgrange - a religious building" class="if uuid-3135281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3135281.jpg"></div><p>  Scientists to this day are wondering with what technology Newgrange was built, and its true purpose remains unknown.  Some researchers suggest that the mound, inside which tombs with human remains were found, was a burial ground, while others consider it as an ancient observatory. </p><p>  Travelers who find themselves in a picturesque country always take the time to visit one of the most significant monuments in the history of mankind. </p><h2>  Holidays at sea in Ireland </h2><p>  A small country that at all times inspired the work of writers and artists, offers an abundance of opportunities for recreation.  Since the Gulf Stream passes through its northwest coast, the temperature of coastal waters in summer is 20 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><p>  Beach holidays in Ireland are very popular among tourists.  In July and August, guests of the country rush to the local beaches located in its west, east and south.  Many of them have been awarded prestigious international awards for the purity of sand and water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adventurous-travels.com" data-author=": Tom @ Adventurous Travels, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of Ireland" class="if uuid-3135276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3135276.jpg"></div><p>  At the resorts located in the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Wexford, Mayo, there are always many vacationers with children who like long sandy beaches with a gentle slope into the water.  Lovers of natural beauty will appreciate the abundance of picturesque bays.  But the places of rest located around Dublin are not very suitable for family vacations, since they differ in very steep descent into the water. </p><p>  In addition, for lovers of surfing and diving there are unlimited opportunities. </p><h2>  Holiday Reviews in Ireland </h2><p>  According to vacationers, the "green island" is a multifaceted country where everyone can find entertainment to their taste.  In Ireland, both beach and sightseeing vacations are developed, and ecotourism lovers enthusiastically recall the amazing nature, which the local authorities take very carefully.  The most fascinating activity is walking, allowing you to slowly get acquainted with the original corners of the country. </p><p>  There are many picturesque bays, as if specially created for water sports.  And how many great fishing spots are here!  Well, the numerous holidays and festivals that are held annually in the country will not let anyone get bored. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, a vacation in Ireland is unthinkable without tasting good dark beer and dishes of national cuisine.  In numerous pubs where life is in full swing, you can immerse yourself in the real atmosphere of the country, seasoned with culinary masterpieces and fiery music.  In addition, the Irish, who love to tell local legends, are very sociable people who are happy to meet tourists. </p><p>  Anyone who once visited a charming country knows that it is already impossible to throw it out of your heart. </p>
