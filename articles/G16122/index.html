The classification of human races</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, more than 7 billion people live on our planet.  Scientists predict that by 2050 this figure could increase to 9 billion. We are all alike, and each of us is unique.  People vary in appearance, color, culture and character.  Today we will talk about the most obvious difference in our population - skin color. </p><p>  <span>The classification of human</span> races is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Caucasian (white people); </li><li>  nongoloid (with a characteristic narrow section of the eyes); </li><li>  Negroid (black people). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="classification of human races" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1596309.jpg" width="420"></div></li></ul><p>  That is, our entire population is divided into 3 species, and the inhabitants of the continents in one way or another belong to these three races.  Let us consider in more detail each of them. </p><h2>  Caucasoid race </h2><ul><li>  Caucasoid.  White people are a large group whose habitat originally included not only Europe, but also the Middle East and even Northern India. </li><li>  Physical signs.  Most of the Caucasian race are people with the whitest skin tone (whose tone, however, varies depending on the place of residence of people).  Northern people are distinguished not only by fair skin, but also by a light shade of eyes and hair, however, the farther south a person lives, the darker his eyes and hair.  This transition is especially noticeable among the Indians.  Almost all Caucasians of high or medium height, have large eyes and dense vegetation on the body. </li></ul><p>  About 40% of the total population of our planet are white people.  Nowadays, Caucasians are scattered throughout the earth, but they mainly live in Europe, USA, India, North Africa, where the majority of the population are Arabs, also belonging to the Caucasoid race.  The Egyptians also enter it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="people with white skin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1596306.jpg" width="412"></div>

The latter is the most numerous of all. </p><p>  <span>The Indo-Mediterranean race</span> is distinguished by a relatively thin complexion and narrow facial features, combined with short stature.  There are directly pygmy representatives of this group. </p><p>  The Balkan-Caucasian race is more massive and has large, broad features.  A characteristic hump on the nose, some say, is associated with a large volume of lungs and a developed chest.  The hue of their hair is predominantly dark, as are the eyes. </p><p>  The European race of people also includes a mid-European subspecies - this is a cross between the above groups.  Facial features of this group vary in a wide range. </p><p>  If we consider the classification of Caucasians more narrowly, they can be divided into three groups - northern, transitional and southern with many subgroups and external features.  Nevertheless, all of them are conditional, and, having visited the habitat of any of them, you will understand that the similarities between the people of this group are relative. </p><h2>  Blue eyes are a sign of the Caucasian race </h2><p>  Blue eyes in humans are the result of a mutation of the 86 gene.  For the first time, this mutation arose in people living off the coast of the Black Sea, about 10,000 years ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="european race of people" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1596305.jpg" width="424"></div>

Although recently you can see negroids with blue or blue eyes.  Scientists believe that in this case, among the ancestors of the child, a blue-eyed Caucasoid must be present. </p><h2>  Mongoloid race </h2><p>  The Mongoloid race is located in Asia, Indonesia, parts of Siberia and even in America.  These are people with yellow skin and a characteristic narrow section of dark eyes.  In obsolete terminology, this race is called "yellow."  These are the Yakuts, Buryats, Asian Eskimos, Indians and many others.  In addition to a narrow section of the eyes, this race is distinguished by a wide, cheeky face, black hair and an almost complete absence of vegetation on the body (beard, mustache). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="White people" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1596339.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  External features are due to climatic conditions in which the race originally lived.  So, narrow slits of the eyes are designed to protect against wind, and the vast nasal cavity performed an important function of heating the air entering the lungs.  Growth is predominantly low. </p><h2>  Types of the Mongoloid Race </h2><p>  In turn, the Mongoloid race is divided into: </p><ul><li>  Northern Mongoloid. </li><li>  Asian continental. </li><li>  American (or Native American). </li></ul><p>  The first group includes, for example, the Mongols and Buryats.  These are typical representatives of the <span>Mongoloid race,</span> however, with somewhat vague facial features and a lighter shade of skin, hair and eyes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="european race of people" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1596304.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Asian continental group living in Southeast Asia (Malays, probes, etc.) is distinguished by a narrower face and sparse facial vegetation.  Growth is significantly lower than other representatives of this race. </p><p>  The American group discovers a connection with both one and the other group.  At the same time, there are some features "borrowed" from the Caucasian race.  This group is characterized by the presence of the darkest, brownish-yellow tint of the skin, almost black eyes and hair.  The face is <span>wide, the nose</span> protrudes strongly. </p><h2>  Negroids in the classification of races </h2><p>  The Negroid race is perhaps the most recognizable even with the naked eye.  People with dark skin (sometimes it has a golden brown tint), thick hair and characteristic broad lips, with a protruding mucosa and nose.  Here, the growth rate varies widely - from the highest to the smallest indicators. </p>

    <p>  The main habitat is South and <span>Central Africa,</span> although historical facts prove that initially the representatives of this race lived in North rather than equatorial Africa.  Now North Africa is mainly inhabited by the Caucasoid race. </p><p>  Currently, the black race can be found in various parts of the world - America, the countries of the former USSR, France, Brazil, etc.  Due to mixed marriages, the border between racial differences is steadily blurring, which is especially evident among blacks, who show high birth rates. </p><p>  An interesting fact: the first inhabitants of the Sahara belonged to the Negroid race. </p><p>  The appearance of Negroids was formed against the backdrop of the climate of their historical homeland - dark skin protects from the sun, wide nostrils provide good heat transfer, and plump lips with protruding mucosa allow you to get rid of excess moisture.  Negroids in their historical homeland are divided by skin tone, breadth of lips and nose, and these species are quite numerous.  However, some are sure: there is only one kind of Negroid race - Australoids. </p><h2>  Is there an australoid race? </h2><p>  Yes, austroloids exist, although they are often ranked as blacks.  Today it is believed that Australoids are a related race with Negroids, which makes up only 0.3% of the total population of the Earth.  <span>The inhabitants of Australia</span> and blacks are really similar - the same dark skin, thick curly hair, dark eyes and large teeth.  They are distinguished by high growth.  However, some still consider them a separate race, which may not be without foundation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="people with white skin and blue eyes" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/1596308.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Australoids are also divided into species - the Australian, Vedoid, Ainu, Polynesian, and Andaman types.  They live on the mainland tribes and are not much different from their ancestors in terms of education and living conditions.  Another type disappeared in the 19th century, and now the extinction threatens the Ainu species.  Scientists believe that, being the least numerous race, Australoids will disappear much faster than other species of races, as a result of mixed marriages. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  However, scientists argue that after thousands of years the difference in races will no longer have any weight, because they will completely be wiped off the face of the earth.  As a result of numerous mixed marriages (such children are called sambo or mestizos, depending on what types of races the child combines), the border between historically developed external signs melts.  Previously, races maintained their uniqueness thanks to isolation, which is currently absent.  According to biological data, in the marriages of Europeans and Mongoloids with blacks, the genes of the latter prevail. </p>
