  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much did an apartment in the USSR cost: analysis</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How much did the apartment cost in Soviet times?  Here a certain period and the effect of a particular policy matter.  So, in 1958, the next meeting of the country's ministers ended with a decree on the creation of housing cooperatives (housing cooperatives).  In them, for a certain amount, it was possible to make an apartment purchase, the price of which was determined by the total cost of the apartment building according to the design estimate. </p><h2>  Position for the family </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rusvst.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The family gets an apartment in the USSR" class="if uuid-3207823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3207823.jpg"></div><p>  Since the cost of an apartment in the USSR was formed on the basis of the total price of a residential building, a special principle functioned.  It concerned a separate family, the cost of housing for which should not be inferior to the same indicator in the estimate. </p><p>  There were also standards that formed the relationship between the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhousing and the number of rooms in it with the number of families.  Even if people were able to completely redeem an apartment with a larger area, they could not do it.  The reason for this was the then norms.  After all, the price of the apartment did not fit into them. </p><p>  This parameter was determined on the basis of state value: </p><ul><li>  building erection; </li><li>  installation activities; </li><li>  materials; </li><li>  working potential (number of construction workers). </li></ul><h2>  Variations </h2><p>  How much did an apartment in the USSR cost?  Values ‚Äã‚Äãvaried, although not significantly.  For example, according to data for 1971, in the central regions of the country 1 quarter.  m cost about 165 rubles.  And in areas with a more severe climate, the figure reached 200 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A slight price difference was associated with the use of template projects.  They implied the presence in the apartment of premises, modest in area.  Although there were options with a larger footage.  Accordingly, their price tag was more solid. </p><p>  For example, when asked how much a one-room apartment in the USSR cost, having a parameter of 36 square meters.  m, the answer was 5800 rubles.  60 sq.m.  m cost 7300 rubles.  Treshka cost about 10,000 rubles.  Moreover, the average salary was approximately 150 rubles. </p><h2>  Opportunities for acquiring an apartment </h2><p>  Not every Soviet citizen was able to make the purchase of such real estate. </p><p>  Only a few possessed the necessary financial potential.  As a rule, these were citizens who received huge amounts of money at one time.  For example, winners of any state status prizes. </p><p>  Other people, even with decent incomes, were only able to pay by installments with the help of a loan or a loan taken at the enterprise. </p><p>  A simple engineer, teacher or doctor knew very well how much the apartment in the USSR cost, so they could only dream about it.  Only the elite of the country or those who profited by fraudulent means could pay the full fee immediately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuban.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="USSR elite" class="if uuid-3207824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3207824.jpg"></div><p>  For youth, there were no options for acquiring an apartment.  And the cooperative included mature citizens who achieved certain material successes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Opportunities to get an apartment </h2><p>  There were four of them in the USSR: </p><ol><li>  Receiving housing from the state. </li><li>  Building your home. </li><li>  Buying a cooperative option. </li><li>  Receiving from parents or other relatives at the place of registration. </li></ol><p>  As for cooperatives, everything happened according to a simple scheme.  At the plant, in some other organization, or in a settlement, or in a district, ZhSKs were formed.  The state provided him a loan for building a house.  Everyone who wanted to buy a house became members of this cooperative, paying an entrance fee (share) and fees every month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rosned.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Housing cooperatives in the USSR" class="if uuid-3207821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3207821.jpg"></div><p>  Of these citizens, a queue was formed for housing.  When the construction of the house was completed, apartments were distributed to the waiting list.  They also made contributions until the full repayment of the costs of this construction. </p><p>  But even after that they did not become owners of the housing that was in the possession of the housing cooperative.  And real estate transactions were possible only between the participants of this cooperative.  And then for this special meetings were organized, which were to make a positive verdict. </p><h2>  State program in the early 80s </h2><p>  The erection of houses within the framework of a cooperative policy occupied only 7-10% of the total construction needed in the country.  And all the people who wanted to buy housing within this system could not do this.  The reason is that enormous queues formed for joining such associations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And in the early 80s, a state program was developed, which implies the provision of an apartment for each family.  For this, about 100 thousand cooperatives were created.  But these plans were violated by the policy of perestroika.  And many houses were completed only in the late 90s, already in Russia.  And people have been waiting for more than 15 years to get their apartment.  And at the same time often had to make significant surcharges. </p><p>  And how much did the apartment in the USSR cost at the beginning of the activity of the designated state program?  It implied the creation of the most favorable financial conditions for each family.  So, for example, odnushka could cost 2000-3000 rubles.  Although the success of this program was seen in the free provision of housing. </p><h2>  Rent from the state </h2><p>  One of the most popular and affordable ways to obtain housing was its independent construction.  However, in the 60s, a new policy severely limited the ability of citizens in this area.  The plots were given only to well-deserved persons, families with 3 or more children, and according to the criminal law. </p><p>  And by the end of the 80s, the main method of obtaining an apartment was state rental on a queue basis.  Apartments in this system had two statuses: departmental and executive committee. </p><p>  The first involved obtaining real estate from the housing stock of the enterprise.  The second - from the reserve of the district city executive committee on a queue basis. </p><p>  Departmental apartments were awarded to employees of large factories and companies.  Executive Committee housing received: </p><ul><li>  workers of minor municipal organizations that do not have their own housing estate; </li><li>  those categories of citizens who were supposed to receive real estate by law, for example, the country's heroes, honored artists, etc. </li></ul><p>  Citizens could get registered by providing the following documents to a special commission: </p><ul><li>  certificate of family size; </li><li>  characteristic from work; </li><li>  certificate of available housing; </li><li>  statement. </li></ul><p>  The commission reviewed the documentation and application submitted.  Most often refused to those persons whose family accounted for more than the required meters per person.  Standards in the 70s dictated a limitation of 7 square meters.  m, in the 80s - already 9 square meters.  m </p><div class="photo" data-original="tavrio.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Free apartments in the USSR" class="if uuid-3207819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3207819.jpg"></div><p>  They were based on the parameters of residential premises only.  The utility room, kitchen, bathroom and hallway were not taken into account. </p><p>  When a person was approved for registration, he received information about his number in this queue.  When in the municipal system, documentation followed in the executive committee. </p><h2>  Inheritance housing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Property Inheritance" class="if uuid-3207822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3207822.jpg"></div><p>  It could get only to those who are registered in it.  The recipient was least concerned with the question of how much the apartment in the USSR cost, since real estate in these conditions became a free object. </p><p>  On this basis, some citizens went to special tricks.  For example, they got married and quickly got divorced or specially prescribed to elderly relatives, after the death of which they found housing. </p><h2>  Soviet elite issue </h2><p>  In those days, a young family could receive various gifts, the best of which was considered a contribution to the housing cooperative.  The presence of their property in it testified to citizens belonging to a high social class. </p><p>  After all, the cost of a cooperative apartment in the USSR could be mastered quickly and without unnecessary hassle only in this category.  And the price tags here reached serious values ‚Äã‚Äãdepending on the parameters of housing.  For example, a four-room joy of 75 square meters.  m was worth about 12,000 rubles. </p><p>  It mattered and its location (district, floor) and the level of comfort.  And the rooms could have a large area, which favorably distinguished this housing from the rest of the array. </p><p>  How much did a cooperative apartment in the USSR cost on average in the 80s is set out in the table below. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Number </p><p>  rooms </p></td><td><p>  Average price tag (rub.) </p></td><td><p>  Contribution (RUB) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  3000 - 5000 </p></td><td><p>  500-2000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  2 </p></td><td><p>  5000 - 8000 </p></td><td><p>  2000-4000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  3 </p></td><td><p>  8000 - 10000 </p></td><td><p>  4000 - 5000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  4 </p></td><td><p>  10000 - 13000 </p></td><td><p>  5000 - 6500 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Other nuances </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mirtesen.svpressa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Housing policy in the USSR" class="if uuid-3207820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/3207820.jpg"></div><p>  In the Soviet years, situations where citizens were not able to fully pay for the purchase of an apartment were rare. </p><p>  The surviving share was paid by people for years, but not like with a modern mortgage.  Then there were no nightmare percent.  The ruble was stable, the state defended the interests of citizens and tried to exclude their impoverishment.  In an extreme case, a person who had corporate real estate with debts could exchange it for a state counterpart.  Because she was valued higher.  And its owner received a good profit. </p>
