And although the main purpose of the device is to maintain reliable and constant communication, the smartphone is no worse than its older ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù, and the battery life is even longer than theirs.  In addition, the A5000 turned out to be a serious competitor to Philips phones and other smartphones aimed at long-term battery life. </p><h2>  <strong>Lenovo A5000 phones</strong> and their design features </h2><p>  The smartphone case, like all inexpensive phones, is made of durable plastic, without squeaks and various defects.  The battery can be removed, which is very good, since even expensive models do not always have such a function. </p><p>  The device is available in two basic colors: black and white.  But on sale there are special colored silicone covers that will help diversify the color palette of the device.  The back surface of the smartphone is made of rough plastic to protect the device from slipping out of hands. </p><p>  An important feature of the <span>Lenovo A5000</span> is the presence of three standard ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù touch buttons, which are always on the devices of this operating system. </p><p>  Power and volume keys are located on the right side of the phone.  At the top of the device is a microUSB connector for charging and connecting to a computer, as well as an audio output for headphones.  The left side of the smartphone is free.  The slots for memory cards and two SIM cards are located under the back cover, which provides protection against dust and moisture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Lenovo A5000:</span> display review </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs screen is 5 inches wide.  A special matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused, which allows producing an image in HD format and a resolution of 1280x720. </p><p>  For a smartphone of this class, these parameters are very good, but the A5000 is seriously behind in comparison with last year‚Äôs popular models of mid- and high-end phones. </p><p>  However, it is worth remembering that this is a budget version, you should not wish for anything supernatural from the phone.  It already has a viewing angle and display brightness at a high level, the video quality is acceptable.  The screen is covered, according to manufacturers, with a layer of nanoparticles, which protects against scratches and chips. </p>

    <h2>  Operating system and hardware </h2><p>  The smartphone has an average processor with a frequency of 1.2 GHz, as they say, "a system on a chip."  The device‚Äôs RAM is 1 GB, which is a necessary minimum for the operation of the Android 4.4 OS.  The internal memory of the phone is 8 GB.  These parameters are enough for you to run almost any application on Android, play 3-dimensional games, watch videos online and much more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, <span>Lenovo A5000 (reviews of</span> most users emphasize this) has its own serious minus.  The most unpleasant ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù after buying a smartphone is constant braking when switching from one function to another.  This is due to the low hardware data of the device and the incorrect installation of downloaded applications. </p><p>  The device runs on Android 4.4, which supports the Vibe UI 2.0 interface, a characteristic feature of which is the distribution of programs and applications into semantic folders.  Although this approach is convenient, it takes some getting used to. </p><p>  Manufacturers have already installed the standard set of programs, antivirus, auxiliary applications for working with documents, social network icons and much more. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras and Battery </h2><p>  Lenovo A5000 has two cameras: the main one with 8 megapixels and the front one with 2 megapixels, which is used only for video calls.  The main camera can take good pictures if they are taken in the daytime.  It has autofocus and an LED flash. </p><p>  The main advantage of the described smartphone is its battery, which is able to support the phone in standby mode for up to one month.  This feature will appeal to those people who like to relax in nature for a long time, go on long trips and the like. </p>

    <h2>  Customizable options </h2><p>  When buying a phone setup device, it is better to entrust it to an experienced and professional operator - seller, since all devices based on Android are very sensitive to incorrect user intervention in their parameters and data.  There are frequent cases when, after acquiring a smartphone, it was returned back due to an attempt by the owners to remove, erase or reinstall something by themselves.  Unfortunately, this is a significant minus of the OS.  Not knowing what and how to do, you can bring the device into an idle state. </p><p>  If, nevertheless, a system malfunction occurs or after installing the application, the phone starts to freeze, and there is no time or go far to the nearest phone repair service, you can try to "deal" with this problem yourself. </p><p>  For this, nothing extra needs to be installed, you should not change any applications.  All that is needed is to go into the phone‚Äôs settings, select the ‚Äúreturn to factory settings‚Äù item and click on it.  The smartphone itself will reboot and return to the ‚Äúclean‚Äù state it was in at the time of purchase.  Yes, some games, files and applications will be lost.  But this does not matter, they can be reinstalled, given past mistakes.  The main thing is that the phone will work and perform its functions. </p>

    <h2>  Purchase a smartphone </h2><p>  You can buy the device both in the store and through the Internet.  Moreover, its cost will differ significantly.  So, for example, on <span>Lenovo A5000 the</span> price on the Internet is 9 - 10.5 thousand rubles.  At the same time, in company stores, the cost of the phone reaches 13 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Application Installation </h2><p>  When downloading programs and files, remember that this OS for its stable operation consumes up to 1/3 of the phone‚Äôs internal memory.  If you load a bunch of other applications in this area, which, in turn, will constantly connect to the Internet and draw additional resources, then the device will begin to "dull", as many users say in reviews, freeze and slow down when switching from one function to another .  Therefore, experts recommend transferring newly installed programs to the internal SD card.  This is a special free area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe OS, which is just designed to store and process new applications installed by the user.  And, of course, you should delete unnecessary and rarely used files so as not to drag additional resources for their maintenance. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Lenovo A5000 is a good and high-quality "average" that does not have advanced features, it has a standard set of programs and functions, but it can work for a long time and reliably without recharging.  For those people who do not need a cool game console or a hand-held TV with the power of a modern PC, but just want to be able to make calls, including video calls, watch videos, use the Internet freely, play good games, this phone will seem like a great option.  For an acceptable price, the user receives a smartphone that is no worse than many others of their kind and is no different from other phones of the same price niche.  Moreover, all tests showed excellent results according to the parameters declared by the manufacturer.  What else can be required of him? </p><p>  So that the device does not hang up and does not slow down, it is necessary to periodically clean it from debris, check for viruses, try to install applications not in the internal memory, but on SD and remember that you have a smartphone in your hands with average capabilities that ensure the device is working at average workload.  If you want more memory, a more powerful processor, and so on, it is better to buy another smartphone.  True, it will cost much more and not the fact that it will not hang too. </p>
