It is ancient, medieval.  <span>Magdeburg law,</span> allowing to be called a city, received in the thirteenth century.  And then it even became an imperial residence - the Habsburgs loved to live here.  Like a <span>Faberge egg,</span> framed by shining peaks of Innsbruck.  Austria is a mountainous country, but here it is especially noticeable.  They say that in this city it is difficult to get lost.  After all, the main landmarks are mountain peaks, which are illuminated at night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Innsbruck Austria" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/284723.jpg" width="431"></div>

    <p>  The architecture of Innsbruck as if by magic is blended into the surrounding breathtaking landscape.  The latter is very difficult to describe, it is so beautiful and unique.  As for the sights, it is often compared with Prague.  True, he is very small, this Innsbruck.  Austria, like most European countries, is mainly small, cozy and beautiful towns.  Its center is a pedestrian zone that you can get around in a few hours.  If you want to see everything and save money at the same time, use the Innsbruck Card - this system allows you to visit many museums in the city for free (even the famous Swarovski collection), as well as cheaper to eat in some cafes and restaurants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about comparisons with Prague, then there are even matches in the names.  But if in the <span>Czech capital</span> crowds flock to look at Zlata Ulicka, then there is a Golden Roof.  This late Gothic bay window became a symbol of the city of Innsbruck.  Austria in the 15th century was under the control of the Kaiser Maximilian.  He ordered a balcony (which for some reason was called the roof) to be lined with more than two thousand gilded sheets.  In the same era, the town hall was erected with a dome and a gallery under the arches - another attraction of the city.  Of the ancient buildings you can mention the Helbling House - a dwelling used in this capacity for almost 800 years.  Only its facade was redone in the 18th century.  The city has very beautiful Baroque churches - Hofkirche, Wilteneer and St. James Cathedral. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Innsbruck Austria tours" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/284724.jpg" width="600"></div>
