  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We calculate maternity allowance based on changes in 2012</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every woman planning a pregnancy begins to worry about many different questions: how will the pregnancy proceed, whether the baby will be born healthy, when it is necessary to consult a doctor and how to tell his boss about it. </p><p>  Of course, only with the onset of pregnancy, women begin to think about their rights, which include the transition to easy labor, release from harmful factors and reduce the load.  It is forbidden to involve a pregnant woman at night or overtime for work, without written consent to send on business trips.  In case of failure to comply with the requirements specified in the legislation, each woman has the right to rely on state support based on protection from unscrupulous employers. </p><p>  Many already know about the changes that took place in 2011.  Nevertheless, let's dwell on them and consider how to calculate maternity allowance for a woman who received a sick leave. </p><p>  Maternity allowance is calculated on the basis of <span>average earnings</span> two years before the proposed vacation.  Before calculating, it is necessary to clarify that the maximum amount of accruals on payments for the entire period should not exceed 415 thousand rubles.  (the value is constantly indexed). </p><p>  Example.  Let's look at an example to help you calculate this value.  Determine how much <span>salary</span> you received for 2 years (conditionally - 2010 and 2011).  Add up the wage for all months minus vacation pay and hospital payments.  For example, 200,000 + 120,000 = 320,000 rubles. </p><ol><li>  We find the amount of average earnings - 320,000: 730 = 438.35 rubles.  It is worth noting that the value of 730 is the number of calendar days in 2 years. </li><li>  We find maternity allowance.  The amount of average earnings is multiplied by the number of days on the sick leave.  If it is a one-pregnancy, then the calculation is made in 140 days, if it is multiple, then 194 days.  So, 438.35 x 140 = 61,639.86 rubles.  In case of complications during childbirth (cesarean section or laparotomy), the woman is extended the sick leave for 16 calendar days. </li></ol><p>  If your earnings do not exceed the minimum wage (currently it is 4611 rubles), then the calculation of maternity allowance is based on this value. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Average earnings - (4611x24): 730 = 151.59 rubles. </li><li>  The amount of maternity allowance - 151.59x140 = 21,223 rubles. </li></ol><p>  Maternity allowance for the entire period is paid in 100% of the volume, regardless of length of service.  Moreover, the experience should be at least 6 months. </p><p>  How is maternity allowance paid to women on transitional maternity leave (from maternity to maternity)?  The calculation is carried out as shown above.  However, the data for the calculation of benefits are taken from previously worked time.  For example, if you went <span>on maternity leave</span> in 2010 and are on maternity leave.  In 2012, we are going to maternity again, then the calculation period includes 2010 and 2009, since the replacement of an incompletely worked year, in connection with the sick leave, is prohibited. </p><p>  In addition to <span>paying maternity</span> allowance in 2012 to expectant mothers registered in the early stages of pregnancy (the law clearly states - no later than 12 weeks), a one-time payment of 465 rubles is required.  20 kopecks  To receive it, a pregnant woman must submit a certificate of employment issued by a medical institution.  Typically, a woman receives such a document with a sick leave. </p><p>  In addition, a woman should be paid a lump sum in the amount of 12 405, 30 rubles.  (benefit amount from 01.01.2012 year, excluding <span>district coefficients).</span>  It is paid after the birth of the child.  To obtain it, you must provide the accounting department with an application for the grant of benefits, a certificate of the birth of your child, an <span>extract from the work book, a</span> copy of the passport, a certificate from the registry office and from the spouse's place of work. </p><p>  It is worth noting that women can independently choose until 31.12.  2012, according to what rules ("old" or "new") maternity allowance will be calculated. </p>
