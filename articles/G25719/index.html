Growth figures</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cardboard figures are one of the subspecies of scenery.  In business, they are used to attract the attention of partners and customers, in the entertainment sector - to create the necessary surroundings, in everyday life - to design the space.  Such installations are common, but not everyone knows how and where they are made.  The article will tell <span>you what</span> cardboard <span>shapes are</span> , what they are, how they differ, and where they are taken.  The publication also presents useful picture templates, with which you can independently make large cardboard decorations for a party or presentation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="advancedgraphics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardboard superhero growth figure" class="if uuid-2792272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2792272.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a growth figure? </h2><p>  Large, human-sized figures carved from thick cardboard were the first to be used by advertisers in their work.  They called their creation a hardposter, which literally translates as "a solid poster."  In fact, figures made of cardboard are original posters, but not in the form of ordinary posters that are attached to a wall or a stand, but silhouettes of whatever.  The main "hero" of the hardposter can be an actor, a cartoon character, a comic book, a product or service being marketed, a representative of a particular profession. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main task of growth figures is to attract the attention of passers-by.  And indeed, wherever the hardposter stands, it always catches the eye.  Mainly due to the fact that on it a person sees something bright and interesting, and even served unusual, voluminous. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kidmincorinne.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoration of the party with cardboard figures" class="if uuid-2792275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2792275.jpg"></div><h2>  Business use </h2><p>  Growth figures partly replace living models.  They can act as a pointer and direct visitors to the desired office, trading floor or exhibition stand, such hardposts are especially relevant during large-scale fairs and other similar events. </p><p>  Their other task is to inform customers.  Information is useful to the consumer on the figures made of cardboard - contact details, description of services or goods, price, etc. Also, such a stand can ‚Äúmeet‚Äù guests on the threshold of an office or store.  Memorable welcome words on the hardposter will initially create a positive mood in them and make them more loyal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="betterhauntsandgraveyards.tumblr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardboard Man Figure for Halloween" class="if uuid-2792291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2792291.jpg"></div><h2>  Party decor </h2><p>  On holidays of any subject and style, growth cardboard figures will become a real highlight of the whole solemn program.  They are installed at children's birthdays, and at weddings, and at theme parties, corporate parties.  The purpose of hardposters at various events may vary: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Creating a photo zone.  With the help of growth cardboard figures, you can decorate the site for photosets, especially in this case stands with a hole where a person inserts a face.  They are called tantamarescans, these designs evoke real delight among the guests, because with their help you can "turn" into a popular movie hero or any other character (bullfighter, strongman, astronaut). </li><li>  In addition, hardposters are the easiest way to equip a celebration hall in accordance with the theme of the event.  On it you can put an image of a popular star or architectural object. </li><li>  The figures look very original, which depict not strangers to the organizers of the holiday people or characters, but his culprits - a birthday man, newlyweds, graduates, director of the company. </li></ul><p>  Another interesting idea, for the realization of which figures of people from cardboard may be needed, is the creation of a predictor.  Small pieces of paper with comic predictions are attached to the hardposter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brandbooks.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great inscription for a party, banner" class="if uuid-2792277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2792277.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to get? </h2><p>  There are two options for how to get a growth stand: </p><ul><li>  make it yourself; </li><li>  order at special printing houses. </li></ul><p>  There are many organizations that provide ready-made hardposts for rent, and they can also make an individual project.  Ready-made growth figures will be cheaper, since they are mass-produced and can be reused.  If this is an order made according to the customer‚Äôs designs, it will cost a little more. </p><p>  In industrial production, hardposters are made from corrugated board, foam board or plastic.  The image is usually applied not on a paper or plastic base, but on a PVC film, which is then glued to the stand.  In order for the structure to be stable, a special stand is attached to it at the back.  Figures with a complex silhouette are cut out using a plotter (it is more correct to call this tool a cutter, but in Russia this term has not taken root).  High-precision blades are mounted in it, which cut the stands along the contour specified by the computer program. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theimaginationtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardboard dinosaur" class="if uuid-2792274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2792274.jpg"></div><p>  This equipment helps to make figures of any complexity, and it is able to cut them not only from the thinnest vinyl film, but also immediately from cardboard, plastic and even thin sheets of metal.  As a rule, cardboard hardposters are installed exclusively indoors, as they are light, deform from moisture and burn out in the sun.  Plastic stands are more resistant to weathering, so they are quite durable and reliable and can serve the customer for several seasons, which is especially important for event agencies. </p><h2>  How to order cardboard shapes? </h2><p>  It is quite simple to buy ready-made products by contacting the seller of such products.  But if you need to order a hardposter according to an individual sketch, you should do this in advance.  To make a growth figure, you need to create a layout.  It is done using a special computer program, then a template is made according to it, according to which the stand is cut.  This procedure is time consuming and requires a significant investment of time and money.  Before the customer confirms his order, the manufacturer should discuss with him the smallest details regarding the size of the hardposter, its shape and the printed image. </p><h2>  Large figures with their own hands.  Tips for beginners </h2><p>  The growth stand can be made independently.  Of course, it is unlikely that it will be possible to print a high-quality image or photograph of a person, because few people have access to all the necessary equipment for this, but it is quite possible to make universal figures with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.j-subculture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardboard scissors" class="if uuid-2792276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2792276.jpg"></div><p>  Cardboard shapes templates can be bought at stores that sell various party supplies or download from the Internet.  It is better to transfer them to large sheets of thick cardboard.  To do this, try and find large boxes from under household appliances (TV, refrigerator, washing machine or dishwasher). </p><p>  Animal shapes from cardboard are usually drawn by hand, and then cut along the contour.  Then the image is painted with paints.  The image will turn out brighter if you use gouache or acrylic paints, watercolor is not suitable for this.  Also, the hardposter can be decorated with sparkles, tinsel, electric garlands.  Cardboard is a thick and dense multilayer material, it is inconvenient to cut it with ordinary scissors or an office knife.  Especially for working with it, special curved cardboard scissors are created.  Working with them is an order of magnitude easier, and the end result is more accurate and professional. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Big cardboard robot, template" class="if uuid-2792273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2792273.jpg"></div><h2>  Voluminous crafts </h2><p>  Recently, voluminous figures made of cardboard boxes have gained particular popularity among the clients of event agencies.  They are ordered for children's parties or corporate theme parties.  The most favorite hero of customers is a robot with a large head, moving arms and legs.  It is not made up of sloppy boxes, but glued to a special template.  The article has a sample blank for this craft, as well as a photo of the assembled robot. </p>
