    <h2>  Panorama is one of the main attractions of the city. </h2><p>  What you need to see in Sevastopol is the main attraction that describes the military affiliation of the city.  The canvas shows heroism during the war, it is dedicated to the period of defense of the city.  And Sevastopol has such beauty.  Panorama is a famous monument, to which the main alley of the Historical Boulevard leads.  The author of the monument is Franz Alekseevich Roubaud (the opening took place on 05/14/1905).  This is a building of unique architecture, which has no analogues in the world, decorated with lawns and a beautiful multi-level fountain; inside it is a canvas with the image of the Malakhov Kurgan. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the canvas and the building were partially destroyed, but skillfully restored by Soviet artists and builders, they did not lose their value and beauty.  On the building itself, you can see the portraits of the great admirals, the defenders of the city.  All the faces and limits of admiration at the sight of this are simply erased, you can stand silently for hours and hours and be touched by beauty. </p>

    <h2>  Monument to the Scuttled Ships </h2><p>  There is something else that every tourist needs to see in Sevastopol.  This is the magnificence and grandeur of the monument to the <span>sunken ships.</span>  The entire pavement leading to this monument is lined with stone, and the approach to it is washed by raging waves.  It is located 20 meters from the coast, recreated as an <span>artificial rock</span> in the form of a pedestal with a column for a bronze eagle towering on it.  On the contrary, on the wall, or rather in the wall, there are two black admiral anchors in chains, dedicated to the armed uprising of the Black Sea Fleet in 1905, led by Lieutenant Schmidt.  And in the square there are sundials, around which there are always many hand-made pigeons.  Majestic steps descend downward, they practically plunge into the abyss of surging waves.  This has become a real entertainment and attraction for children and tourists, it is not rare and local residents love to frolic under the spray left by the rolling sea waves.  And the steep slope was chosen by jumpers and everyone who likes to ride roller skates and scooters.  Numerous various cafes and eateries, tents with souvenirs and exotic fruits are conveniently located along the promenade. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beautiful and majestic </h2><p>  The ship "Sevastopol" is a military battleship of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet period.  This is a warship that took an active part in the hostilities of the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Kronstadt rebellion.  At present, all battleships, of which Sevastopol is, have come to be referred to and subdivided as the Sevastopol class.  It was this battle battleship that became the founder and gave the name to the entire class of ships.  In 1921, in honor of the restoration of the Paris proletariat, it was renamed the ‚ÄúParis Commune‚Äù and already in 1930 passed under the command of Sevastopol, where it was completely restored and modernized.  In November 1941, the ship adopted a ‚Äúbaptism of fire‚Äù and showed itself perfectly as an offensive and gunshot. </p>

    <h2>  Graf Marina </h2><p>  Perhaps one of the main attractions of Sevastopol is the Count's pier.  It is located on Nakhimovskaya Square and is a white colonnade with <span>granite steps</span> running down from it <span>,</span> which are immersed in the sea.  The essence of the project was to make it the main berth of warships.  Now this is an incredible miracle of architectural thought, a work of art and the heritage of history, a beauty that is difficult to describe in words.  A majestic white arch of columns, many steps that seem to go under water and continue to the bottom, a stone washed by the waves of the Black Sea - a majestic and beautiful view opens up to the eye. </p><h2>  Seaside Boulevard and Dolphinarium </h2><p>  It is on Primorsky Boulevard that the building of the first Institute of Physical Treatment Methods is located.  For the first time in this building, scientists have proved the beneficial and healing effects of the Crimean climate on the human body.  This building has its own history and its own secret, it certainly deserves attention from tourists, especially at a young age, because a little further Primorsky Boulevard leads to the world-famous dolphinarium.  These cute mammals under the guidance of experienced trainers will give you unforgettable minutes of eccentric and funny tricks and tricks, after which you can swim with these cute creatures in the same pool. </p>

    <h2>  Khersones </h2><p>  A few kilometers from the city you can see the majestic ruins of ancient Chersonesos.  This is an ancient Greek city, now known as a historical and archaeological museum-reserve.  The history of the city has its roots deep in the past, it is undoubtedly exciting and tragic, but the view that opens to the eye here will make you forget about everything.  Towering several meters above the sea, the main columns and the bell are on the edge of the cliff.  It is in such places that I want to believe in a fairy tale.  A light and enchanting breeze gently strokes hair curls, subtle moist air gently envelops the skin, the sound of the surf mesmerizes and soothes.  It seems that time is stopping here, so that everyone can enjoy the peace and quiet, the softness of the earth, the purity of the air and the enchanting landscapes.  Only here you can see how the sky is bathing in the sea waves, how the sun is drowning in the depths of the sea, how the first or last rays of the sun are pouring in the enchanting colors of the whole famous palette. </p><h2>  Balaclava </h2><p>  Not far from the city is <span>Balaklava Bay, which</span> has long been claiming the title of a wonder of the world.  Such beautiful landscapes, which can only be seen here, pacify and inspire, purify the mind and soothe the soul.  This place is for those who are tired of the hustle and bustle of the big city, from noisy and fun beaches, from entertainment and clubs, only here you can immerse yourself and reveal your full inner potential.  Ancient architecture plunges into the depths of history, the ruins are saturated with the spirit of the past, the sea, enclosed between two rocks, recalls the greatness of nature and its strength.  Cape Fiolent, which resembles a huge stone pyramid, is very popular among tourists.  On the edge of the cliff, on the other side of the cape, washed by the white foam of the surging waves, the building of the St. George Monastery proudly settled down.  According to legend, several shipwrecked sailors found refuge right here, off the Black Sea.  Having immortalized the icon of George the Victorious on the rock, they organized a cave church, and this was the beginning of the monastery. </p><p>  Each of these places is worthy of attention, each has its own history and secret.  If you are on the Black Sea coast, where your grandfather caught a goldfish, do not forget about the miracle, you just need to believe in a fairy tale, and it will certainly become true, especially in such beautiful and fabulous places. </p>
