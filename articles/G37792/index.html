    <p>  Reform Start </p><p>  Such an attempt was the complex of reforms of the head of government Pyotr Arkadyevich Stolypin.  First of all, it concerned the transformations in the agricultural sector.  It was expected that the results of the Stolypin reform will give a powerful impetus to the development of all significant areas in the country.  Their main plan was to create a powerful layer of a wealthy, independent and entrepreneurial peasantry that would revive commodity relations and turn Russia into an even more important exporter of agricultural products.  The final results <span>of the Stolypin reform were</span> seen by her mastermind in the emergence of a class of strong business executives, similar to American farmers.  For these purposes, the state </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stolypin reform results" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/286554.jpg" width="432"></div>  a credit bank, by decree of the government, launched a massive campaign to issue loans to peasants for the purchase of land.  At the same time, non-return of debt was rather severely punished - by confiscation of the purchased land.  This, according to the plans of the reformers, was to spur private initiative.  The second important part of agrarian reform was the land development program in Siberia.  Land in this region was distributed and completely free to the willing peasants for use.  And the government in every possible way encouraged and facilitated the movement of peasant families beyond the Urals.  For these purposes, special trains were created, later known as "Stolypin cars".  In addition, infrastructure was actively created in Siberia during this period.

Thus, it can hardly be said that the results of Stolypin‚Äôs reforms were any sufficient.  However, a number of trends during their period have nevertheless been outlined, so some results can be summed up.

    <p>  Positive results of Stolypin's reform in the agricultural sector </p><p>  The result of government actions was that from 10% to 20% of the population stood out from the peasant community.  The latter began independent farming.  In the next few years, successful peasants began to give up to half of all the bread that appeared on the market.  Partially, plans for the <span>development of Siberia</span> were implemented <span>,</span> since during the reform more than 3 million households moved there.  As a result, new regions were involved in commodity-market relations.  The country has significantly expanded the area of ‚Äã‚Äãarable land. </p><p>  Negative Stolypin Reform Results </p><p>  The stratification of the independent village led to the fact that along with the successful, poor peasants also appeared.  Even the farms that left the community still maintained close relations with it.  In this regard, the reform was half.  It also did not have a tangible impact on the technological development of agriculture.  By 1911, the archaic plow was still the main instrument of the Russian peasant. </p>
