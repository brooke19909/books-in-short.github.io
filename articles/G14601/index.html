    <h2>  Guest Impressions </h2><p>  Guests of the "Surf" with admiration respond to the rest spent at the camp site.  According to many, everything here is simply amazing: well-groomed, clean area, comfortable equipped rooms, very tasty and varied food, fascinating animation.  Here is a lot of fun, guests assure.  Vacation days at the Priboy camp site pass by unnoticed, and this is its only drawback, the authors of the reviews say. </p><p>  According to tourists, the Priboy camp site successfully combines comfort, coziness, traditional southern hospitality, peace and quiet.  The best option for relaxing small groups of guests, including families with children, according to tourists, simply can not be found.  Many reviewers plan next year to come again to the Priboy camp site. </p>
