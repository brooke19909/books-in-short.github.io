    <h2>  Hotel Kaissa (Adler): traveler reviews, comments </h2><p>  Any hotel, even the best, has some shortcomings and disadvantages.  Certain disadvantages are also characteristic of the Kaissa Hotel (Adler).  Reviews indicate the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  there is a cooler with drinking water only on the ground floor, and therefore you will have to go down each time (it‚Äôs good that at least an elevator is provided); </li><li>  the rooms really lack an electric kettle; </li><li>  terrible insulation in the apartment (or rather, its absence); </li><li>  in the fall for some reason they do not turn on the heating, although it becomes very cold in the rooms (the maximum you can count on is a fan heater, which helps a little); </li><li>  the hotel has some problems with sewage, and therefore the bathrooms in the rooms located on the ground floor have a very unpleasant smell; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that heating is provided in the pool, it is not included, and therefore in cool weather it will not work to swim in the sea or in the pool; </li><li>  as a family-friendly hotel, it would be nice to consider the possibility of pets; </li><li>  there is no curtain in the bathroom, and therefore, after bathing, puddles constantly form on the floor; </li><li>  if you arrive at the hotel during the cold season, then all the smoke from the stove heating of private houses will be in your room; </li><li>  a huge and very unpleasant surprise was to see cockroaches in the bathroom; </li><li>  in the fence around the hotel it would not hurt to make another entrance from the side of the station, since you have to make a very large hook; </li><li>  For those who are in the city for the first time, the unpleasant moment is the lack of an Adler card at the reception staff. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  For lovers of the sea and beautiful nature, the Kaissa Hotel is perfect.  It is surrounded by green spaces, as well as in close proximity to the sea.  Very close to the train station, from which you can reach the hotel on foot.  Sochi Airport is also relatively close - no more than 20 minutes by taxi. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the main advantage of the hotel is the ratio of the quality of services and the cost of living.  Most hotels located in mountainous areas are expensive.  Here the price is quite affordable.  And due to the fact that the station is within walking distance, you can quickly get to any popular resort.  This hotel also has excellent food and a pleasant atmosphere.  The hotel was built relatively recently, but because the repair in it is quite fresh.  As for the staff, all employees are very polite, smiling and friendly.  Even though there are minor flaws, this hotel can be considered one of the best for a holiday in Adler. </p>
