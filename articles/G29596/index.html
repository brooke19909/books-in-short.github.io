    <h2>  What is a "wrecker"? </h2><p>  What does ‚Äúnon-wilock‚Äù mean in an iPhone?  <span>The literal translation</span> from English never lock is ‚Äúnever locked‚Äù.  These words indicate to users that the phone will work without any restrictions with any operators.  After the purchase, you can insert your card into the device and use it calmly without any additional settings or devices. </p><p>  What seems to us an obvious state of affairs is not so necessary for the USA and some European countries.  There, often the purchased device is tied to only one specific operator.  And to use another card (which is especially important for phone owners in Russia, Ukraine), you have to carry out additional manipulations with the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So if you want to avoid difficulties, buy only the iPhone "non-werlock".  This applies to the interpretation of the term.  But why are phones blocked abroad and how do they bypass this restriction when selling in our country? </p>

    <h2>  Why release locked phones? </h2><p>  You may have heard that you can buy an iPhone in the United States much cheaper than in our country.  But any outstanding discount has a price.  In this case, we are not talking about the usual iPhone "Verlok" (they are sold on the shelves of all our stores with rare exceptions). </p><p>  Abroad, networks enter into agreements with mobile operators.  They sell phones at a significantly reduced price.  But such devices are already connected to this operator on the condition of the contract (usually we are talking about several years).  Since the user is forced to pay the established monthly fee, he buys his phone as if on credit.  While the lock is in effect, the operator benefits in the form of regular payments.  They cover the size of the discount and even allow you to get a plus.  So that the user could not violate the terms of the contract, such phones ‚Äúlock up‚Äù. </p><p>  So if your favorite iPhone 4 is ‚Äúunverified,‚Äù it means it has never been blocked by a specific mobile operator.  Other users are less fortunate.  If they bought at a reduced cost (sometimes the discount reaches 1/3 of the total price), it‚Äôs just not possible to insert the card of the usual operator and use the phone.  To unlock the phone, you have to carry it to the service center.  But sometimes even there they will not be able to help you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How can I unlock my iPhone? </h2><p>  So what to do for those who did not choose the iPhone "Verlok" (what is this, we already found out)?  Then the phone can be sent to junk or use the card of the American operator in our country?  Of course, there are ways to get around the lock.  But this is not always possible to do.  Nevertheless, Apple is a world-renowned company, and it is carefully following its obligations. </p><p>  You can try to bypass <span>iPhone lock</span> using the following methods: </p><ul><li>  Use an additional device (Turbo SIM), which is inserted into the SIM card slot.  With the help of such manipulation, a forgery is performed.  The device ‚Äúthinks‚Äù that you are using the services of the right operator.  To do this, you will have to cut your card.  And you need to do this very carefully, otherwise the tray may jam.  Then you will have to spend money not only on the device, but also on fixing the slot. </li><li>  Sometimes it helps to unlock by software intervention.  The method can only be applied to older versions of software.  Inaccurate actions with the modification of the firmware lead to serious problems with the phone. </li><li>  The surest way is to order an unlock from the operator with whom the contract for the phone is concluded.  This process is not only complicated, but also will cost a pretty penny. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How to check iPhone status? </h2><p>  How to check the iPhone: "neverlok" or "unlock"?  This must be done if you do not want to receive additional difficulties in addition. </p><ol><li>  Inspect the SIM card slot.  It should not have any extraneous devices.  If you see something that looks like a card, the ‚Äúunlock‚Äù device is in front of you (that is, unlocked using this special device). </li><li>  Why not buy an unlock phone?  Because you have to re-unlock after any reboot.  In addition, firmware updates will be banned for you.  And no service! </li><li>  To check the phone, insert your card and try to call.  If it doesn‚Äôt work out, but some messages appear on the screen, the phone is locked. </li><li>  You can also check through the official website. </li></ol>
