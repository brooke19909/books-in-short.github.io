Flip models are considered one of the successful in the assortment of the manufacturer.  They are in the middle price segment and are necessary in order to provide a person with music at any time of the day.  Last year, the fourth generation of this model was introduced. </p><p>  At present, three similar columns compete with each other.  We are talking about the mini JBL 168, Charge 3 and Flip 4 models. A comparison of the last two devices will be given later in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mall.sk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charge 3 speaker charges the phone" class="if uuid-2246670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2246670.jpg"></div><h2>  Price, dimensions and weight </h2><p>  To begin with, the Charge 3 column can be purchased for 8,000 rubles.  on average, but Flip 4 will cost a lot less.  Most often it is sold for less than 6 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The height of the latter is 19 mm less when compared with the other described column.  With regards to the driver, the Flip 4 has a size of 40 mm.  His opponent has 45 mm.  A driver is a device that reproduces sound through a speaker.  The larger the part, the more powerful the bass. </p><p>  As for the width, then everything is clear from the photographs.  Flip 4 is 38 mm thinner than Charge 3.  Its indicator is 175 mm against 213 mm.  The thickness of the Flip 4 is less.  Only 70 mm.  His opponent has a thickness of 18 mm.  With regard to weight, Flip 4 wins here. He is 285 g lighter than his opponent.  The Charge 3 has a weight of 800 g. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mall.sk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black column Charge 3" class="if uuid-2246671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2246671.jpg"></div><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The described devices have a control panel that is built into the design itself, which is convenient.  Thanks to this, you can get easy access at any time.  Also, due to this solution, it is allowed to control the speaker volume using a wireless device. </p><p>  A detachable cable is available only in Flip 4. Due to this, at any time you can disconnect the wire if it is broken or, if necessary, move the column.  Also, if you pull the cord, then it will not be damaged, but simply fly out of the equipment jack. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Flip 4" class="if uuid-2246674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2246674.jpg"></div><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Trying to understand what is still better - JBL Charge 3 or Flip 4, it should be said about the sound quality.  Both models have built-in stereo speakers.  Due to this, the sound is quite rich and impressive.  Both devices received an active speaker.  It is built directly into the structure.  This amplifier helps you get the best sound.  Therefore, completely different playback sources can be used with speakers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Continuing to decide what is better than JBL Charge 3 or Flip 4, you need to talk about frequency characteristics.  Which device is leading in this matter?  Low frequencies, that is, bass, in Flip 4 they will be much richer and stronger.  Charge 3 has this indicator at 65 Hz, while Flip 4 has 70 Hz. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flip 4 underwater" class="if uuid-2246675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2246675.jpg"></div><h2>  additional characteristics </h2><p>  Both devices have Bluetooth version 4.1.  They are also equipped with a passive radiator.  It looks like a regular driver.  However, it has no filling.  Thanks to this radiator, you can play deep bass.  Its sound output, in principle, is the same as that of most speakers.  Unlike a regular driver, this heatsink is slightly smaller. </p><p>  It is quite difficult to decide which JBL Charge 3 or Flip 4 to choose, so you should continue the comparative description.  Also, the devices are protected from weather conditions.  There is a special input that allows you to play content from various sound sources.  Just connect to a regular port. </p><p>  As for the number of drivers, then both devices have two of them. </p><p>  Also, these models can be used wirelessly.  They have a battery that needs to be charged.  Devices are equipped with a special indicator.  He notifies of discharge.  The audio output power depends on the number of speakers and is calculated in watts.  The higher this indicator, the louder and cleaner the sound.  And what is better in this matter: JBL Charge 3 or Flip 4?  The first option wins, since its indicator is 20 watts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.officeworks.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flip 4 in the pool" class="if uuid-2246676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2246676.jpg"></div><p>  The devices have USB-connectors, as well as a special microphone with noise reduction.  The highest frequency is 20 thousand Hz for each of the described devices. </p><p>  The microphone is set up well, has a noise reduction function.  Flip 4 comes with a special bag.  It allows you to transport the device.  These devices have the same signal-to-noise ratio.  It is 8 dB.  The Charge 3 speaker is protected against water and dust.  The warranty period for both devices is one year.  No microphone jack for speakers.  The last device has no noise reduction function. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  As for the battery capacity, the Flip 4 has 3 thousand mAh, and the second column has 6 thousand. On average, Flip 4 charges faster. In just three and a half hours, it reaches 100% from 0.  The second device to the maximum mark will be charged in 4 hours.  However, do not forget that the latter has more battery power.  These indicators are relevant not only for the described models, but also for comparing JBL Flip 3 vs JBL Charge 2 Pluse.  The latter also leads. </p><h2>  JBL Flip 4 </h2><p>  Trying to understand which device is better, you should conduct a separate review of the <span>JBL</span> Flip 4 <span>wireless speaker</span> . This device has a mirror surface of radiators.  The keys that are built into the device received a trim and are slightly recessed into the case.  The device easily withstands immersion in water for up to 30 minutes.  If we talk about sound, then this model received well-developed frequencies.  The lower and upper ones became as saturated as possible, and the problems of reproducing the middle ones, in comparison with the previous Flip 3 column, disappeared.  Some songs feel a slight deviation from the sound, but it is not critical.  The volume level is also good. </p><p>  In general, this device is pretty good, especially pleased with the ability to work wirelessly, so the device can become a reliable travel companion.  However, it will not claim the best in this segment.  Unfortunately, the device is available only in some color shades, respectively, not all consumers like this lack of personality.  It should also be noted that for its segment of sounding is not bad, however, when compared with some more expensive counterparts, the described device loses noticeably.  But still, many are amused by the attractive cost, which makes this column stand out among many others.  In principle, it should be said that the device undoubtedly deserves attention from the buyer, so it can be fully recommended for purchase.  To understand what is better than JBL Flip 4 vs JBL Charge 3, you should consider the second column. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Flip 4 column underwater" class="if uuid-2246687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2246687.jpg"></div><h2>  JBL Charge 3 </h2><p>  This device has a fairly large battery, all other characteristics are also good.  In addition, a special security protocol is built in.  It allows you to take the column into the sea or into the pool.  The device is sold in a small cardboard box, which has a matte finish.  The complete set contains instructions, a cable for the power adapter and the column itself with other documentation (warranty ticket, certificate, etc.).  If we compare with the previous model, then it should be highlighted - there is no special protective cover.  They abandoned it, since the column became immune to moisture. </p><p>  The design is quite interesting, since the device is sold in a large number of colors.  Anyone will be able to choose the right one specifically for his taste.  With regard to sound, then it should be said about the highest level of the frequency range.  The bass is excellent, the middle does not fail, high reproduced perfectly.  This model can be safely called one of the best in the price segment.  Also, the volume margin here is quite large.  In general, this speaker is enough for music to be heard indoors up to 40 square meters.  When the sound level is increased, its qualities are not distorted: there are no defects and rattles. </p><h2>  Reviews about Charge 3 </h2><p>  The reviews also write that the model has no shortcomings.  The only thing missing in this column is the NFC module.  However, there are no other minuses.  The characteristics of the device are good, the build quality of materials is excellent.  Often, when answering the question about what is better than JBL Flip 4 vs JBL Charge 3 with sound, they select the second option. </p>
