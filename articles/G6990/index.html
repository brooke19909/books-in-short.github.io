    <h2>  Material for knitted beret </h2><p>  Given that hats have been in contact with the scalp for a long time, only high-quality yarn should be used to make them.  Berets for women are usually knitted from soft wool, for example, from merino.  Sheep wool mixed with acrylic, cotton or nylon is also suitable.  It is important to apply a thread that does not prick.  Otherwise, the beret will cause discomfort and irritation of the skin in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe forehead and neck. </p><p>  If the material turned out to be tough, there are two ways out of the situation: </p><ul><li>  She takes a tie for a woman, and then sew a lining of warm and soft fabric (flannel, fleece) inside. </li><li>  Use another (non-spiky) yarn to make the belt. </li></ul><p>  However, these techniques will not be useful when working on knitted scarves.  For these products, you need to take only high quality material, as they come in contact with a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãskin on the neck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tie takes for woman" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1395499.jpg" width="400"></div>

In addition, it‚Äôs easier to control the size of the canvas by cutting loops rather than adding.  In this article, the knitting spirit of berets will be described precisely according to the second method. </p><h2>  Reference sample and pattern calculation </h2><p>  Below are different berets for women (patterns are attached to the patterns).  First of all, it is worthwhile to make out the knitting of an openwork pink headdress. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="berets for women" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1395494.jpg" width="394"></div>

    <p>  Here, a thread of medium thickness was applied, approximately 300-350 m / 100 grams.  The thicker the yarn is, the larger the rapports will be, and their number will also decrease.  However, when using too thick threads, the knitting will be quite rough. </p><p>  To find out how many strips of the pattern fit in the beret‚Äôs canvas, you need to knit a control sample (at least 10 cm in height and width).  Measure it after steaming with an iron.  For example, the density of the canvas is as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  22 loops x 10 cm; </li><li>  30 rows x 10 cm. </li></ul><p>  Thus, to get a beret with knitting needles for women (head circumference 56 cm), you need to dial 110 loops.  For the calculation, the figure was 50, and not 56, since the beret should stretch a little. </p><p>  The width of the rapport is 8 loops, so 14 openwork stripes will fit in the canvas.  Based on these data, you need to adjust the total number of loops: </p><p>  14 x 8 + 2 (edge) = 114 pieces. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  For knitting the belt on circular knitting needles, the number of loops obtained in the calculation is gained (114).  Then, to a height of three to five centimeters, garter stitching is performed (facial loops in all rows). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles for women" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1395495.jpg" width="339"></div>

    <p>  The algorithm of knitting openwork fabric: </p><ol><li>  When the belt is ready, proceed to the execution of the pattern.  It is advisable to mark the entire series with markers, indicating the borders of the rapports.  True, the reverse loops can play the role of borders in the ornament (in the diagram, this is a black dot in the cell). </li><li>  In the third and fifth front row expansion of a cloth by means of nakida is provided.  This is done so that berets for women are voluminous.  In the diagram, the places of formation of new elements are marked with an icon similar to a spindle. </li><li>  A new symbol appears in the seventh row: a black triangle denoting the reduction of two loops.  With its help, the pattern is balanced, as the number of added and reduced elements becomes the same.  To cut two loops at once, you need to first transfer to the right knitting needle, then knit the next two together.  Then, the element obtained during contraction is dragged through the previously taken loop.  So from three elements one is obtained. </li></ol><p>  In this form, rapport is repeated two times.  Then proceed to narrow the canvas. </p><h2>  Finishing beret knitting </h2><p>  The diagram clearly shows how, after an even area, the rapport begins to narrow.  This is necessary to make it easier to finish knitting with needles for women.  With a description of the final stage, the craftswoman should be attentive.  It is not necessary to blindly carry out all the points, since the thickness of the selected yarn is of great importance.  If the thread is thin, the product will turn out small.  In this case, you need to knit another rapport evenly. </p><p>  To narrow the beret, the developers of the scheme intentionally upset the balance of the pattern: in several places the loops are shortened, but there are no crochets.  Therefore, the canvas is uniformly reduced. </p><p>  When two loops from each rapport remain on the spoke, they are transferred to a thick thread and tightened tightly.  Then the product is sewn along the side seam, washed and dried.  Steaming hats is not necessary, as they then become too soft. </p><h2>  Circular scarf </h2><p>  In the diagram on the right is a pattern for knitting a small circular scarf.  It also tapers a little to the top edge.  The circumference on the bottom should be 85-90 loops, and on top 55-60.  The optimum height of the scarf is 25 cm. </p><p>  Start and finish work with several rows of garter stitches. </p><h2>  White beret and a long scarf </h2><p>  According to the same principle, the following beret model is performed.  However, here the belt is connected with an elastic band and there is no expansion at the beginning of the rapports (inclined lines indicate in which direction 2 loops should be cut). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet berets for women" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1395497.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <p>  The main part of the beret is made according to the pattern located on the diagram on the left (A.3).  Its lower part is balanced, and contractions begin above.  In the process, you need to monitor the size of the product.  If necessary, you can repeat the lower part so that the beret is wider. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles for women with a description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1395498.jpg" width="442"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  When the pattern A.3 is completed, proceed to the designation designated as A.2.  It is designed to complete beret knitting.  When the number of loops on the spoke becomes minimal (two pieces for each rapport), they need to be put on the thread and tightened tightly. </p><p>  Often <span>berets for women are knitted</span> with scarves.  For a classic long scarf, you can use the ornament located on the right and at the top of the diagram (A.1).  It is balanced and perfect for making a flat canvas, that is, it has an equal number of added and reduced loops.  The standard width of such a scarf is about 25-30 centimeters, and the length is from one and a half meters. </p>
