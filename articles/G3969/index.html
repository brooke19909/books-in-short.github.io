At first it was just wooden products wrapped in pieces of skins.  Gradually, the dolls, following their masters, evolved, becoming more and more like a person.  The beginning of the 19th century gave us a completely new look, designed for girls and even women, but practically not interesting to children - these are boudoir dolls. </p>

    <h2>  The concept </h2><p>  The name of these toys fully explains the place they occupied in the house.  Boudoir dolls, or, as they were called, "bed" and "salon", were an indispensable accessory in any home.  It was a stylish decoration that matured girls played with, dressing them, giving them natural poses, photographing them.  Often these creatures were companions and when they were published - in this case, they tried to dress them in the same style as the hostess. </p><p>  Since boudoir dolls are an accessory, they should be noticeable, almost striking.  So, their growth should not allow them to get lost in the pillows of the sofa.  It is for this reason that the smallest dolls were not less than 50 cm, on average, their growth reached 90 cm. Sometimes, up to 120 cm were also produced - these were very convenient to take with you on a trip or on a trip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Causes of occurrence </h2><p>  It is difficult to say unequivocally why boudoir dolls appeared.  One of the reasons was the decrease in childbearing and, as a result, the ruin of factories producing toys.  The head of one of these factories decided that if dolls are not required for children, then adults may like them, you just need to adapt the appearance of the toy to the needs of already grown girls. </p>

    <p>  Others believe that the French, yearning for beauty during the First World War, decided to express in this way the need for beauty. </p><p>  One way or another, the first boudoir dolls arose precisely in France. </p><h2>  First appearance </h2><p>  It is believed that for the first time this accessory was presented to the public by Paul Poiret at a fashion show in the very beginning of the 1910s.  He dressed the dolls in the same style as the model that carried them.  The French society enthusiastically accepted the new fashion trend, but in other countries they supported this trend only by 1915-1918. </p><h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  Dolls gained special popularity by 1920, being in demand until the end of the forties.  This can be explained by the fact that women in this period gained independence, they got the opportunity to work, to choose for themselves how to look, what to dress up.  And they decided that such a toy is a suitable companion in their new life.  These changes were reflected in the appearance of the dolls: their eyes were brightly made up, their lips covered with red lipstick.  Short haircuts were frequent, and one of the leading manufacturing companies even produced dolls with a cigarette. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The moment when the fame of this accessory reached America became very important for manufacturers.  For lovers from the United States began to be released a huge variety of models: cowboys, Indian women, movie stars.  At one time, nude dolls were very popular.  A huge amount of clothes and accessories was produced for them, which their owners enthusiastically changed several times a day. </p><p>  Salon beauties were often made to order, trying to achieve similarities with the one for whom she was intended.  These dolls began to symbolize material wealth and a certain status in society.  Grooms gave them to their brides, dressing in wedding dresses and decorating with jewelry. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  Since boudoir dolls spent most of their ‚Äúlife‚Äù lying on sofas, their bodies were soft, ‚Äúlimp‚Äù, which made it possible to adopt languid poses.  The body shell was made of various fabrics, while the head was made of papier-m√¢ch√©, composite or even felt.  The interior of the doll was made up of sawdust, fluff, cloth or even hay.  At first, the legs and arms were composite, but later such babies appeared, whose limbs were from celluloid. </p>

    <h2>  Doll today </h2><p>  Today, these accessories are very rare - boudoir dolls.  Photos of some of them are posted by collectors, but most of them are in very poor condition.  There are two reasons for this.  First, they were never considered a value, so they were treated accordingly.  Secondly, dolls are made of materials that do not imply durability.  Most of the toys that have survived to this day have very shabby clothes, a lot of patches on their faces, faded paints, and significantly thinned hair.  Often the limbs of these dolls are less than what was created by the manufacturer.  Of course, amateurs and collectors restore them whenever possible, but nevertheless, time has left its imprint forever.  Therefore, those who want to purchase a boudoir doll in good condition prefer to order a ‚Äúremake‚Äù. </p><h2>  Do it yourself </h2><p>  Now many lovers are trying to figure out how to make a boudoir doll.  There are various master classes, courses, and video tutorials.  Many of them are taught to create exactly what was the decoration of the salons a hundred years ago. </p><p>  Of course, today a do-it-yourself boudoir <span>doll is</span> made using other materials, much more modern.  The body is sewn from various fabrics, stuffed with synthetics or wool.  Hair is most often natural or made from special materials that mimic natural. </p><p>  Dolls made one hundred years ago could not accept poses requiring a rigid frame.  They mostly lay in pillows.  A modern movable boudoir doll often has in its design details that make it possible not only to sit without support, but also to take various poses inherent to a person, and sometimes to stand using simple devices. </p>

    <p>  Today, this toy is no longer the companion of the ladies going out, it does not decorate the homes of most of us.  Only large puppet industry enthusiasts and lovers of antiquity are engaged in their manufacture.  In the homes of such people, and even on the shelves of collectors, these days you can meet this interesting creature - a salon doll. </p>
