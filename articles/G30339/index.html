    <p>  The most important task of our state at the present stage can be considered the regulatory regulation of accounting.  Accounting is a <span>source of information</span> for external users, including tax and other government agencies.  Therefore, it is the normative regulation of accounting that is extremely important in modern conditions for making the right decisions.  It all depends on how quickly the state will respond to changes in the economic environment, developing new forms and methods that form the basis of this concept. </p><p>  General rules and regulations that should be applied by all organizations engaged in business activities are the legal regulation of accounting.  The existing problems, gaps and contradictions in the regulation of accounting significantly complicate the professional activities of all employees of the accounting service of various enterprises and organizations, leading to the appearance of misunderstandings and disputes with auditors and regulatory authorities.  Nevertheless, all the facts of the economic activity of the company or enterprise, even if there are any problems with the regulatory regulation, should be reflected in <span>accounting documents.</span> </p><p>  Accounting regulation in Russia is represented by the following hierarchy: </p><p>  1. The legislative level of regulation. </p><p>  2. The standard level. </p><p>  3. Methodological level. </p><p>  4. Organizational level. </p><p>  As already noted, at present, a four-level accounting regulation system has been formed in our country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The name of the first level of regulation speaks for itself: this level includes various legislative acts, including the Constitution, federal laws and codes, decrees and decrees, and many other regulatory documents that are generally binding throughout the country.  Of course, the law ‚ÄúOn Accounting‚Äù plays the biggest role, which is a kind of foundation for accounting in organizations.  Now this is Law No. 129-FZ, adopted back in 1996.  At the same time, in 2013, an improved accounting law, No. 402-FZ, began to operate. </p><p>  The next level is represented by the Accounting Regulations.  At this stage, 24 provisions have been approved and are in force.  Some of them are being finalized and changed over time and the changing economic situation. </p><p>  The meaning of PBU is that they disclose aspects of accounting, as well as its variability for individual accounting objects.  However, while PBUs are general in nature, without revealing specific mechanisms.  That is why the third level, called methodological, is included in regulatory accounting.  This level is represented by various guidelines for any <span>business operations,</span> for example, inventory. </p><p>  In addition, an important role at this level is assigned to a special document - the chart of accounts.  The principle of application of the dual system is indicated in the associated document - instructions for its use.  This level also includes documents such as instructions for filling out reporting forms, various guidelines for assessing financial obligations and <span>inventory of property,</span> recommendations for cost accounting, which are included in distribution costs, financial results at a public catering enterprise, and so on. </p><p>  It should be noted that the regulatory regulation of accounting often provides for the variability of the reflection of certain operations.  Therefore, based on the documents of the above levels, organizations draw up their accounting policies, which refers to the fourth level of regulation.  The fourth level of regulation is the organizational and administrative documentation that forms the accounting policy of a particular organization.  These documents are developed by consulting firms commissioned by the organization or directly by the organization.  Documents of this level include orders, work instructions, instructions, instructions for accounting for certain operations or objects. </p><p>  As part of the <span>accounting policy, an enterprise</span> has the right to choose from the proposed accounting methods the most optimal option for itself, to develop its own based on the general chart of accounts, which would take into account the specifics of the enterprise.  You can also develop your own <span>primary documents that</span> meet certain requirements. </p><p>  Thus, the regulation of accounting in our country is centralized and provides for variability of methods of reflection in accounting operations. </p>
