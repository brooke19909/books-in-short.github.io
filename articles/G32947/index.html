Crochet dress yoke: scheme</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Crocheted crocheted yoke</span> will decorate any dress <span>.</span>  Its scheme, as a rule, differs little from a round or square napkin.  Only inside there is room for an armhole so that the product can then be put on.  Work on coquette also does not require a special level of skill.  Even a beginner knitter can handle it. </p><h2>  The need for coquette </h2><p>  Many sources describe the coquette for the <span>dress (crochet).</span>  Its schemes are both very simple and quite complex.  Sometimes, look at such a description and think about whether it is worth bothering. </p><p>  Definitely worth it.  The fact is that this piece of clothing organizes the whole product well.  She transfers the emphasis from its lower levels to the very top.  Quite often, this is in a favorable light represents almost any female figure.  Even if the young lady has rather wide shoulders, a yoke with a vertical pattern visually reduces them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet yoke" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/962951.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <p>  Most often it is a round yoke (crochet).  Her pattern foresees knitting in a circle, which provides simply gorgeous decorative effects.  Therefore, coquette is not only practical, but also very beautiful. </p><h2>  Children's dress for beginners </h2><p>  For craftsmen who have not yet fully mastered such needlework, this children's crochet coquet is perfect for training.  Its layout is extremely simple, so you should not even draw up its graphic version. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We start work from the top of a chain of air loops.  The width of the initial ring is equal to the width of the neck.  The whole coquette fits with crochet columns.  For those who do not know how to do this, recall.  Crochet captures the working thread.  Then the tool is threaded into the loop of the previous row and extends another loop formed from the working thread to the front side.  On the hook, 3 loops are obtained.  We knit them two at a time. </p><p>  This crochet dress yoke, the scheme of which is suitable for beginners, foresees a gradual expansion of the canvas, so that it turns out in one plane.  Therefore, in every second or third row we knit in one base 2 loops through an equal interval. </p><h2>  For textile dress </h2><p>  It is not necessary to make the coquette for the dress (crochet), the schemes of which we are considering, be the basis for a knitted product.  You can decorate it with textile clothes.  This option is ideal in the case of remaking old things that have already lost their appearance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet round yoke" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/962952.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the proposed embodiment, the work is performed from the bottom up.  First, the product is tied in a circle at regular intervals using arches from air loops.  Their number depends on the yarn and hook number.  The second row is performed similarly in a checkerboard pattern. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following rows already have a simple pattern of groups of single crochet columns.  To make it more interesting, the author of this particular version in one of the series increased the number of air loops in the intermediate arch. </p><p>  An important feature that the coquette presents with a hook, the scheme of which will be different for different craftswomen - we do not increase the number of loops, but decrease it by tightening the product. </p><h2>  Little children's coquette </h2><p>  The next pattern is not a finished product for an adult, but rather an option on how to use crochet in everyday life.  The yoke, the scheme of which is presented here, is designed for the doll.  But it can be easily transformed into a full-fledged clothing item. </p>

    <p>  She knits with fans of <span>double crochets.</span>  You need to start with a chain of air loops closed in a ring that forms the neck of the dress.  The diagram clearly shows how the work is done.  For a full-fledged product, it is worth making some corrections. </p><p>  Firstly, the number of rows is much larger so that the width of the canvas is about 15 cm, depending on the size.  Secondly, adding loops in each row, at the exit we get a very wavy product that resembles little yoke.  Therefore, the addition should be carried out in 2-3 rows.  Experienced craftswomen know how to control this process. </p><h2>  Another yoke from the bottom up </h2><p>  Here is another <span>crocheted round yoke, the</span> diagram of which is built in the direction in the neck.  It begins with the line, which is located near the number 1 in the figure. This is the edge of the finished bottom of the product.  Do not forget that it is very important to monitor the reduction in the number of loops so that the yoke is pulled up. </p>

    <p>  The double crochet columns indicated by vertical lines and air loops indicated by rings are used in the pattern. </p><p>  When the last row is completed, it is recommended to make another 1-2, which will form a beautiful edge.  Such bindings are made, as a rule, with single crochet columns, so as not to increase the length.  Thus, you get a crochet yoke, a diagram of which is readable even by beginners. </p><p>  But in any case, you always need to leave room for improvisation.  At least change the number of air loops between the columns and see what happens.  But you need to do this with yarns that do not lose their appearance after the product unfolds. </p><h2>  Gourmet pineapple </h2><p>  Pineapple weaving technique, which actively uses crochet, is very popular.  The coquette, the scheme of which is presented here, turns out to be openwork and simply luxurious.  But for its implementation, considerable attention will be required, since it is necessary to follow the pattern all the time.  The slightest mistake will be very visible and spoil the whole appearance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dress crochet pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/962955.jpg" width="543"></div>

    <p>  The scheme uses double and double crochet bars and air loops.  Knitting begins with three rows of arches of air loops.  Their number must be calculated in advance, based on the multiplicity of the report. </p><p>  The whole coquette is 32 rows of two rows of pineapple pattern.  It is worth noting that the size in length of this product can be impressive.  Therefore, before starting work, do a trial knitting with your yarn and crochet from crochet posts.  This will make it possible to approximately calculate how wide 1 row is and to evaluate how long the coquette itself will be. </p><h2>  Flirty motifs </h2><p>  From round motifs you always get a beautiful crochet yoke.  Every craftswoman has a scheme of such a motive.  In addition, you can always come up with something new by experimenting with round patterns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's crochet crochet pattern" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/962956.jpg" width="520"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The width of the future coquette depends on several factors: the size of individual motives and the number of rows made from them.  These parameters can always be adjusted. </p><p>  Since we knit a product from motifs, it is better not to stitch them, but to bind to each other.  This is obtained if in the last row in the connecting chain of air loops knit the same element from a ready-made motive.  This allows you to design the product more accurately. </p><p>  Do not be afraid to create coquette for dresses and blouses.  It makes your clothes individual and special. </p>
