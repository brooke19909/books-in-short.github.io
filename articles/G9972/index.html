  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew a coat itself: 2 simple options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many fashionable women would like to sew outerwear with their own hands.  But even the more experienced seamstress will not immediately understand how to sew a coat of a complex cut, observing all the rules and proportions.  In any case, even the simplest models can only be sewn by those who have initial sewing skills.  Therefore, it is better to start with sewing a poncho, capes and other similar models, especially since these silhouettes are so popular lately.  At fashion shows you can find the most diverse coat options - wraps, with a colorful pattern, plain, with the addition of leather and fur elements, light and warm, with and without lining.  The choice is the largest. </p><p>  <strong>Cape Coat</strong> </p><p>  Here is one of the simplest and at the same time interesting and trendy options for how to sew a coat of the ‚Äúcape‚Äù model according to one of the simplest patterns. </p><p>  First of all, you need to decide on the material.  There will be no lining for this model, and you can put on a coat on two sides.  For this, double-sided fabric is selected that does not have a clear pile direction. </p><p>  The less the selected fabric will wrinkle, the better.  The edges of the fabric should not roll too much. </p><p>  We need a piece of such fabric with a length of 2 meters and a width of one and a half meters. </p><p>  For decoration you will need small pieces of genuine or artificial leather to match the fabric, as well as a beautiful decorative clasp. </p><p>  Now we cut out a rectangle from the fabric with a length of 170 and a width of 150 cm. The remaining fabric will be needed to make the collar and waistband. </p><p>  Add the cut 4 times. </p><p>  We will get a rectangle with sides of 75 and 85 cm. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where the side is 75cm, there will be our sleeve and shoulder.  The side of 85 cm is the length of the coat itself. </p><p>  In the corner, where there are no free edges and there is a fold of fabric, we make a curved neckline. </p><p>  Now you need to cut the shelf in half.  The base pattern is ready. </p><p>  Next, we process all the edges.  To do this, bend them along the entire length so that the width of the hem is 3 cm, and sweep. </p><p>  In order for the corners to look neat, you need to do the following.  Each corner bends in half from the wrong side.  Now, from the obtained bend, lower the perpendicular with the length of the bending width, sew.  The resulting corner is cut off and twisted. </p><p>  We iron thoroughly through the gauze fabric the entire hem.  We sew on a typewriter. </p><p>  Then proceed to the <span>pattern of the collar.</span>  To do this, measure the length of the entire neck.  For this, it is easiest to use a tailor's meter.  After we designate on a fabric a rectangle 12 cm wide and a length equal to the resulting measurement.  Cut out. </p><p>  Now fold the rectangle in half along the measurement equal to the length of the collar.  Sew the edges and attach to the neck. </p><p>  We sew a decorative fastener. </p><p>  Next we make a belt.  To do this, we cut out a strip of fabric with a width of 16 cm and a length necessary for the length of the belt. </p><p>  Fold the strip in half, stitch it.  Then we turn out and iron. </p><p>  The last step is to fasten the belt at the waist.  To do this, on its line it is necessary to outline the lines of the transverse section 9 cm long. From above, we sew pieces of leather on the line of the transverse section.  Sew them and cut them.  Insert the belt into the obtained sections. </p><p>  Our cape coat is ready. </p><p>  <strong>Poncho coat</strong> </p><p>  Another interesting option on how to sew a coat is a poncho. </p><p>  Also, it all starts with the choice of fabric.  This model will require a soft fabric in structure, without a clear direction of the pile.  The color is better to choose a plain, small cell or a symmetrical strip, a small pattern without direction. </p><p>  We need a piece of fabric in the form of a square with a side length of one and a half meters.  You should also purchase a wide slanting inlay matching the color of the fabric with a length of 7.5 meters. </p><p>  In this option, you don‚Äôt have to think about how to sew a coat.  The main thing is to make a pattern correctly. </p><p>  At the beginning, like with a cape coat, we fold the fabric into 4 additions.  In the same place we make a cutout for the neck, but at the same time we make a deeper cutout on the front of the shelf.  We will not have a through cut.  This coat is worn over the head and is short in length. </p><p>  Now we trim the edges of the coat so that in the expanded form we get a circle with a diameter of one and a half meters. </p><p>  We <span>process</span> all the edges and the <span>neck</span> using a slanting inlay. </p><p>  These two simple models are the basis for how to sew a coat of the most and trendy style in a short period of time. </p>
