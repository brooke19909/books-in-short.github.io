Here everyone is simply obliged to visit the fabulous sea.  Tourists once again come from rest and are still satisfied with the end result. </p><p>  Today we will discuss the hotel Lotus Bay <span>Beach Resort 4 *</span> (Hurghada, Safaga).  Many tourists are satisfied with everything here: a relaxed atmosphere, many pools for the smallest, playgrounds and places for adults to relax - all this and much more you will find in this wonderful place.  Now more! </p><h2>  Accommodation in hotel rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has a good location.  The family apartments are two-room, it is convenient.  The rooms are connected by a small corridor.  Each room has its own bathroom and its own bathroom. </p>

    <p>  The location of the rooms does not cause any inconvenience.  The furniture is ok with lots of lockers.  Each room has a TV and fridge. </p><p>  Lingerie is changed every day.  The large room has a huge <span>panoramic window</span> with access to the terrace.  The cleaning, of course, leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  The Egyptians, and especially men, do not know how to clean thoroughly.  They simply don‚Äôt notice much or are lazy.  Alas, in the country this is practically the norm.  The most important thing is that there is no sand in the bed, which tourists every day bring from the beach in huge quantities on children's toys and slippers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rooms at Lotus Bay Beach Resort (Ex Lotus) have great beds.  They are large and comfortable.  The blankets and pillows are soft and pleasant.  The bedding is new and not washed.  Towels are also normal. </p><p>  Cleaners try to tidy up the room before the arrival of tourists.  There are no problems with beach towels. </p><p>  The hotel is constantly undergoing repairs somewhere, but this does not cause any inconvenience to customers. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The Lotus Bay Beach Resort hotel, reviews of which are mostly positive, impresses with its gardens and parks, the number of pools and well-groomed. </p><p>  The territory, of course, is very large, but it‚Äôs better than when vacationers ‚Äúsit on each other‚Äù.  If you want, swim in the pool, but if you want, go to the sea.  All kinds of mini-bars on the territory and at sea allow you to relax in comfort. </p><p>  The beach is nice.  You will love fine white sand.  Sun beds with fences and straw umbrellas, as elsewhere.  It is advised to go into the sea in special shoes. </p>

    <p>  All kinds of fish and corals are sometimes unsafe for the body, and especially for children, and there are a lot of them here, believe me.  It is a great pleasure that you do not need to sail somewhere on a yacht for an additional fee in order to observe corals.  The hotel has its own coral reefs, which is undoubtedly an advantage.  It is also nice that you can go on a yacht tour to another city from the beach, and take a massage course or make a tattoo (temporary) on the shore. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The service at the reception is not very good.  There are a lot of tourists, which is why there are not enough working personnel at all.  Unfortunately, employees of the institution do not always offer their own help. </p><p>  The hotel has several <span>A La Carte</span> restaurants <span>.</span>  You can get there by appointment and eat some delicacy that is not served in a regular catering establishment. </p><p>  Not far from the main entrance to the hotel there is a pharmacy, which is very useful there.  In general, in Egypt you always need to have a bargaining chip, as the indigenous people are very reluctant to give change (if at all). </p><p>  The staff throughout the hotel are very friendly.  Especially tourists like the restaurant service.  Cooks and waiters are very helpful, treat small children well. </p>

    <p>  Everyone considers it his duty to serve the child well, take pictures with him and treat him with something.  The chef always serves culinary compliments for the younger guests of this modest 4-star hotel. </p><h2>  Kitchen at the hotel </h2><p>  The cuisine at Lotus Bay Beach Resort (Hurghada) is quite good.  Here you will find a variety of menus, and the waiters will help you choose something really worthwhile. </p><p>  True, in the children's menu there is no such variety as in the adult, but the child will still not remain hungry.  The chef will always find what every kid will surely like! </p><p>  A variety of cereals, cereals, yoghurts have always been, are and will be at breakfast.  The only thing visitors might miss is seafood.  Yes, fried fish is regularly served here, but you must admit that sometimes you want shrimp and lobster. </p><p>  In the main menu you will find a huge number of salads, all kinds of delicious buns, pasta, egg products, mashed soups and much more, which you and your friends will definitely like. </p><p>  By the way, black cumin is present in many dishes - this is one of the features of dishes in Egypt.  Believe me, this spice betrays the original taste of the dish, and it is very useful.  The Egyptians consider it a panacea for all diseases. </p><p>  There are enough cakes here, but not enough fruit.  From drinks for adults - all that the soul desires.  There are no drinks for little children.  Only plain water and milk.  Yes, and also, the Egyptians are not very friendly with meat, so do not count on fried steaks, and if you find something like this on the menu, visitors do not recommend trying, because here they simply do not know how to cook such kind of dishes.  The hotel has more than enough drinking water. </p><h2>  Hotel animation </h2>

    <p>  Lotus Bay Beach Resort 4 * hotel, reviews of which are very positive, pleases children with good animation.  In the evenings, people gather in a small amphitheater, and animators arrange performances.  Everything goes fun and interesting. </p><p>  For the smallest there is a children's room where Russian-speaking girls are engaged with young guests.  Children are busy with drawing, designers, various games - this is very convenient, especially for tired parents. </p><p>  In the pools, they also conduct various competitions and classes in water aerobics.  Competitions are fun because they are attended by Germans, French and people of other nationalities, and it‚Äôs very funny to compete with them.  The animators are mostly Russian guys. </p><h2>  Adjoining territory </h2><p>  Near the hotel there are a number of souvenir shops.  In them you can buy everything that only the soul desires.  There is also a hairdresser where you can cut and pluck your eyebrows in an interesting way (thread). </p><p>  Near the Lotus Hotel, you can take a taxi and leave on your own in the old center of Hurghada.
