Using the operating system, you can control your device.  Back in 2005, Google acquired the rights to this OS, and in 2008 the first product was released - Android 1.0. </p><h2>  Briefly about the platform </h2><p>  This operating system quickly gained popularity, being under the auspices of one of the largest IT companies.  And this is not strange, because even children can figure out the use of this system (which they have successfully practiced today), and the mass of ‚Äústuffing‚Äù for the device can be downloaded absolutely free from one of the Google‚Äôs resources of the same name.  On Android, most devices of the largest and most well-known companies, such as Samsung, Motorola, HTC, Sony and others, are produced. </p><p>  According to research and statistics, 75% of all products manufactured over the past year gadgets running this platform account for 75%.  The competition for "Robot" is perhaps the iOS operating system developed for Apple products.  But, as it turned out, it accounts for only 15% of devices.  This ‚Äúaxis‚Äù is currently developing quite actively, because it provides the opportunity to work not only with smartphones and tablets.  The versatility of the system allows you to install it on electronic photo frames, players, media systems in cars and many others. </p><p>  Android is being developed by the Open Handset Alliance, also created by Google.  It is interesting to note that specifically for this "OS" was created an original font family called "Droid", and each new system released has the name of a dessert.  But these names are not chosen randomly.  Each new version of the "dessert" is called with English letters, which are arranged in alphabetical order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the "Robot" </h2><p>  So, what is the charm of this operating system, what is included in the ‚Äústandard set‚Äù of a novice user, and what features did the platform like? </p><p>  With the installation of this OS, any device turns into a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù gadget.  The first and most important function is access to the Internet.  Without it, it would be difficult for you to use the gadget running Android.  And the point is not that there would be no opportunity to download various applications for ease of use or viewing important content.  The operating system simply could not receive updates, and they are very important for the smooth and proper operation of the system.  At the same time, thanks to Android and your modern device, you can read books, watch videos or movies and download them to your gadget, chat with friends, listen to music and perform many other functions that you previously did on your computer. </p><p>  The first thing that the gadget on "Android" represents is the online service from Google.  These include Gmail, Navigator, the GOOGLE + social network, Google Talk chat, Goggles voice and visual search, calendar, browser, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You cannot find such functions as, for example, a calculator, a voice recorder, or even simple games on the Android device, but the manufacturers of devices are already directly installing such standard applications.  And if you need something additional - there is nothing easier than downloading the necessary software, games, music, books, widgets and many other useful ‚Äústuffings‚Äù in the Google Play store. </p><p>  But that is not all.  The hidden features of Android can surprise any user, but we will talk about them a little later.  10 hidden features - not all that your device can surprise you with. </p>

    <h2>  How to start using an Android device? </h2><p>  It is advisable to start using the device with an Internet connection.  Whenever possible, it is better to use a 3G or Wi-Fi network.  You can use simple mobile Internet, however, its speed leaves much to be desired, and you run the risk of spending a lot on traffic usage. </p><p>  Then you will need a Google account.  If you still haven‚Äôt gotten it like that, it‚Äôs not at all difficult to do this.  You need to go through a small registration: enter the mail (it should be Gmail) and come up with a password.  After checking this data, you must specify the payment data.  You don‚Äôt have to worry about the safety of your money.  The form you fill out will indicate that funds will only be debited from the account in the event of a purchase.  Without your direct consent, nobody will touch the money on the card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After you sign up for a Google account, the online services mentioned earlier will be available to you.  If you do not take into account even the hidden functions of Android, the system is perfectly synchronized with many third-party resources, such as social networks or email services. </p>

    <p>  Features of "Android" allow you to change the gadget's interface completely at your discretion.  It is possible to change the virtual keyboard, add various widgets to the screen, or completely change the appearance of the screen using special programs, launchers. </p><p>  But in general, the variety of functions, additions and applications of Android makes the gadget indispensable in almost any life situation.  With the help of social networking applications, you can always stay in touch with friends and share with them a piece of your life, wherever you are.  Payment system applications allow you to quickly and reliably transfer money, pay bills, top up your mobile phone account and many other tasks.  In order not to get lost in a strange city and quickly call a taxi, Google‚Äôs mobile applications will also help you with this. </p><h2>  Hidden features of Android </h2><p>  In addition to the above charms and opportunities, ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is also equipped with special secret features, which few people know about.  Hidden Android functions are some of the ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù from the developers.  They will make using your device even easier and more interesting.  Articles typically list about 10 hidden Android features, but in fact there are many more.  Many experienced users have long been familiar with them, and with each release of the new version of the "Robot" and every year these opportunities become more and more.  So, here are a few of the 10 hidden features of Android 2016. </p>

    <h2>  A small game that was hidden from users </h2><p>  Ever since the release of Android 2.3, developers have hidden certain Easter eggs in their product.  For example, the hidden functions of "Android 4.4.2" and others allow you to find these "eggs".  What is it, you ask?  ‚ÄúEaster eggs‚Äù are interesting and hidden features of the system.  In order to reach them, the user must perform a certain series of actions that are not obvious.  At the beginning of the article, we talked about the fact that the name of any version of Android is assigned in honor of some kind of sweetness.  So, the "Easter eggs" are also associated with the treat in whose honor this or that system is named. </p><p>  So, the hidden functions of ‚ÄúAndroid 5.0‚Äù allow you to play an outstanding secret game.  By its nature, the game strongly resembles the game of the same name Flappy Bird, only instead of a bird you control a small ‚Äúandroid‚Äù, and instead of pipes to be circumvented, there are lollipops, because this operating system is called Lollipop.  The hidden functions of ‚ÄúAndroid 5.1‚Äù also provide the opportunity to play a similar game.  Surely all users wondered how to launch such a toy on their device? </p><p>  To do this, you will need to go to "Settings" and select "About phone".  Then we‚Äôll find the ‚ÄúAndroid Version‚Äù section, you will need to quickly click on it several times.  A large bright lollipop will appear on the screen, if you click on it, it will change color, and if you press and do not quickly release it, the game will appear on the screen.  Great activity when it is boring and there is no access to the Internet, for example. </p>

    <h2>  Remote Gadget Management </h2><p>  A quite useful function, for some reason hidden very far away.  It is especially good if the phone or other device is lost and needs to be found and blocked.  Hidden functions of "Android 4.2.2" and higher allow you to track the gadget.  To find this opportunity, you need to go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù, select the ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù parameter there, and then click ‚ÄúDevice Administrators‚Äù in ‚ÄúRemote Android Control‚Äù.  You need to put a checkmark next to ‚ÄúRemote device search‚Äù and ‚ÄúRemote lock‚Äù.  When the checkmark is in the right place, many users are surprised and ask what to do next? </p><p>  Further, if you lose your device, you can remotely erase all data, change the lock or lock the screen (even the time how long you want to lock, you can choose yourself).  You can do this from google.com/android/devicemanager.  You can also download a special application for remote control "Android".  If you do not manage to encrypt the device, then through the same Google service you can restore all the data that you deleted. </p><p>  But in order to encrypt an object, you need to select the option ‚ÄúEncryption‚Äù in ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù and ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù.  Even if attackers gain access to your device, they will not have access to data if they do not recognize your decryption password.  But think carefully before encrypting your gadget.  Firstly, this process will take a rather long time (more than an hour), and secondly, every time after unlocking the screen you will have to enter your password.  And the last: if the password is lost, you will not be able to access your data.  All that remains is to restore the factory settings, and at the same time destroy all the files that you so carefully encrypted from strangers. </p><p>  The hidden functions of Android do not end there.  Move on. </p><h2>  Safe mode </h2><p>  For any person who is more or less "friendly" with computers, the concept of "safe mode" is familiar.  This mode allows you to log in to the system and run only important programs and files.  This allows you to identify a problem with the operating system and fix the basic errors.  Now such a function is also available for Android users.  They will be able to run their device in safe mode and all third-party applications will not work.  If they are incompatible with the system, infected with viruses, or simply downloaded by mistake, you can get rid of them. </p><p>  How to run this mode on your gadget?  Very simple.  To do this, hold down the screen lock button, as you did to turn off the device.  On the ‚ÄúTurn off the power‚Äù section, you need to hold your finger and then the screen will ask you to switch to safe mode.  Confirm it and wait for a reboot.  The interface will be changed, the icons will turn gray, but do not worry, after loading in normal mode everything will return to its place. </p>

    <h2>  Turn off notifications </h2><p>  Many Android OS users are familiar with how various games and applications can spam.  They send notifications over and over, terribly annoying the user.  The hidden functions of Android allow you to disable these notifications and system messages sent by one of the third-party applications.  To do this, we again need to turn to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù and find the ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù parameter there.  Then in the list you should find the very annoying application that constantly ‚Äúspam‚Äù and uncheck the box next to ‚ÄúEnable notifications‚Äù.  The problem is resolved.  You can disconnect this function both from one application, and from all at once (‚ÄúBlock all‚Äù). </p><h2>  Traffic control </h2><p>  Now mobile Internet traffic can be monitored.  For many, this feature will seem completely unnecessary.  However, this is not at all true.  Recently, many mobile operators offer packages with limited traffic, for example, a certain number of megabytes per day.  With the help <span>of traffic control,</span> you will know how much you have already used, it also shows which application and how much it consumed.  If you do not want to go beyond the established norm, but constantly monitor how much has been spent completely not rationally, you can set a traffic limit.  Upon reaching the set digit, the data transfer will automatically be turned off. </p>

The reasons can be completely different, but the most common of them is that someone really annoys you with calls, and you don‚Äôt want this to continue.  There is no specific Black List function for annoying subscribers in the Android OS.  But there is one small trick.  In "Editing contacts" there is one small parameter "Only voicemail".  Click the checkmark and this way you block calls from a specific number. </p><h2>  You can expand the internal memory of the device </h2><p>  Hidden functions of ‚ÄúAndroid 6‚Äù allow you to expand the internal memory of your gadget.  The memory card has always remained an external medium.  Even though the applications can be transferred from the device to the card and vice versa, it did not save the situation and the internal memory was sorely lacking.  The hidden functions of Android 6.0, finally, made it possible to use the USB flash drive as an internal drive.  After you insert the memory card into a special slot, you will have a choice of two ways to use it.  The hidden functions of Android 6.0.1 also allow you to expand the internal memory. </p><p>  This is not a complete list of all the features of the system.  We have described 7 hidden functions of Android, but in reality there are much more.  For example, the face recognition function to <span>lock the screen</span> or the ability to send photos to the "cloud", from where they can easily be restored if you delete it by mistake.  Also, on the latest versions of this "OS", you can delete or suspend the work of preinstalled applications that simply clog up the memory and are of no value to the owner. </p><p>  Discover this operating system in a new way.  We hope this article will help you in this matter. </p>
