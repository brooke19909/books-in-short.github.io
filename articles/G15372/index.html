Among them there are both familiar light sensors, a bluetooth transmitter and a gyroscope, as well as quite exotic things like the unlock option on the face.  There is a special technology in the phone - NFC.  What is it and how to use it?  We will definitely tell you about this very useful option.  Let's start with its description and history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techterms.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nfc on the phone what is it how to use" class="if uuid-3004775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3004775.jpg"></div><h2>  What is NFC? </h2><p>  The abbreviation NFC came from English.  This is short for Near Field Communication.  Literally, this translates as "near contactless communication."  This technology allows devices to exchange data at higher speeds.  But only within 10 centimeters. </p><p>  Currently, this technology is mainly used for contactless payments.  There are special terminals that can work with such things.  NFC chips are installed exclusively on flagships and mid-range smartphones.  Budget devices are rarely equipped with such chips. </p><p>  For the first time, it was in the iPhone that NFC appeared.  How to use it, did not know even the most advanced users.  But soon, manufacturers published detailed instructions.  However, consider other features of NFC technology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trendnet.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use nfc in the phone to pay" class="if uuid-3004776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3004776.jpg"></div><h2>  The advantages of this technology </h2><p>  Like everything around, this technology has its advantages and disadvantages.  The ratio of these indicators demonstrates how advanced one or another function is considered.  And in the case of NFC, there are far more advantages than disadvantages. </p><p>  Here they are: </p><ul><li>  high speed data transmission; </li><li>  the ability to save smartphone settings in NFC tags and their automated and instant use; </li><li>  the possibility of contactless payment; </li><li>  option to store all payment receipts in electronic form; </li><li>  the ability to use an NFC card as a business card or postcard; </li><li>  transferring data between two devices using the P2P protocol; </li><li>  quick setup of the NFC chip with system options; </li><li>  the ability to use NFC even if there is no chip in the smartphone (with some restrictions). </li></ul><p>  In fact, NFC has a lot of advantages.  But not one of the smartphones can use this technology "to the full."  In "iPhones" it is generally used exclusively for contactless payment.  How to use the NFC system on the phone?  We will answer this question, but first we will consider the disadvantages of this technology.  There are much fewer than advantages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use nfc system on the phone" class="if uuid-3004795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3004795.jpg"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Do not think that the disadvantages of this technology at least somehow affect security or create problems when using it.  Just under certain circumstances they are possible.  But the chance to run into them is extremely small. </p><p>  Here is a list of known issues with NFC technology: </p><ul><li>  the maximum distance during data transmission is strictly regulated and extremely small; </li><li>  it is possible to access data during transmission by intercepting a signal (but for this you need to be at a distance of a meter from the smartphone); </li><li>  you can interrupt the transmission using the usual "jammers" of cellular communications (such cases are extremely rare). </li></ul><p>  That's all.  There are no more flaws.  And now it's time to consider how to use NFC on your phone for payment.  Examples will be considered with specific models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidauthority.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use nfc in samsung phone" class="if uuid-3004792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3004792.jpg"></div><h2>  Use on Samsung smartphones </h2><p>  These devices were among the first to be equipped with an NFC chip.  However, there is this miracle only in flagships and devices of the middle price category.  But you need to know everything about how to use NFC on a Samsung phone.  This can certainly come in handy for everyday use.  Consider using a chip to transfer data between two smartphones.  Everything is extremely simple here: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  First you need to open the file you want to transfer. </li><li>  Now you need to combine the two devices almost flush.  Back covers.  Moreover, the transmitting device should be on top. </li><li>  It will take some time to determine the connected smartphone.  After the operation is completed, a notification will appear. </li><li>  To start the transfer, just click on the screen. </li><li>  Upon completion of the process, a sound notification will be applied. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  This is the answer to the question of how to use NFC on a Samsung phone.  For contactless payment using this chip, you will first have to bind the card to the phone.  In this regard, in any device there are corresponding instructions.  Now consider other smartphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use nfc on a huawei phone" class="if uuid-3004777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3004777.jpg"></div><h2>  Use on Huawei smartphones </h2><p>  In Huawei devices, this option is not very common.  It is equipped mainly with flagships.  But you still need to know how to use NFC on your Huawei phone.  In principle, there is nothing complicated about this.  The algorithm is similar to that used in Samsung devices.  You just need to first enable this same NFC. </p><p>  This can be done using the following algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Open the "Settings" menu using the corresponding icon on the desktop of your smartphone. </li><li>  We move to the wireless settings block. </li><li>  There, click on the item "More". </li><li>  Check the box "Allow data exchange when combining a smartphone with another device." </li><li>  Next, turn on Android Beam by setting the appropriate checkmark. </li><li>  Getting down to data transfer. </li></ol><p>  Now NFC is successfully activated.  As for the process of transmitting data on Huawei phones, it is exactly the same as on Samsung phones.  Therefore, you can use the previous instruction. </p><p>  Let's move on to the features of other smartphones and NFC in the phone.  What is it, how to use it and why is it needed on other devices? </p><div class="photo" data-original="rastinsystem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use nfc in honor phone" class="if uuid-3004778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3004778.jpg"></div><h2>  Use on Honor smartphones </h2><p>  In these budget devices, the NFC chip is present exclusively for contactless payment and tagging.  Files cannot be transferred on Honor devices.  Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to examine the question of how to use NFC in a Honor phone. </p><p>  NFC tags are specific stickers with an embedded NFC chip that contains certain settings.  With their help, you can automate some actions on your smartphone: give out Wi-Fi, turn on the alarm, turn off the sound, and so on.  But first, the label needs to be programmed.  This will help the special applications that are in the "Market" on the "Android". </p><p>  So, the algorithm of actions for carrying out the work of a smartphone with a label is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Open Market and download the tag programming application. </li><li>  We get the label itself. </li><li>  We bring the smartphone to the tag and program it using the instructions provided by the application. </li><li>  Stick the label to any convenient place. </li><li>  If you need to use it, simply bring the device to the mark. </li></ol><p>  That‚Äôs all wisdom.  Thus, you can fully automate the routine actions of managing a smartphone.  Very convenient thing. </p><p>  However, there are other smartphones.  From a well-known company that unrealistically inflates the price of their products.  What about NFC on the phone?  What is it and how to use it in the understanding of Apple?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gimbal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use nfc in samsung phone" class="if uuid-3004794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3004794.jpg"></div><h2>  Use on Apple smartphones </h2><p>  Here, in principle, there is nothing to tell.  The fact is that the guys from Apple artificially limited the capabilities of the NFC chip in their smartphones.  In "iPhones" it can be used exclusively for contactless payments.  No tagging.  No option to exchange data between smartphones. </p><p>  Owners of smartphones on Android have been using all the features of this technology for a long time, and only devoted fans of iPhone suffer from infringement of their rights.  Be that as it may, if a person wants to use all the features of NFC technology, then "apple" smartphones are categorically not suitable for this.  Better to look for something on the Andoid.  And on the use of the chip for Apple Pay, the owners of iPhones have detailed instructions.  Considering it here makes no sense. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we took apart the NFC option in the phone.  What is it, how to use this technology is already clear.  Now the thing is small - to purchase a smartphone with an integrated chip.  Only then will it be possible to use this technology to the fullest.  And those who already have such devices will definitely appreciate the advantages of this method of data transfer and automation of routine actions on a smartphone.  Setting the option does not take much time. </p>
