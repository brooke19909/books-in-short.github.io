Like human destinies, they are also unique, and their paths are mysterious.  Today, the cloisters are being restored and growing, and several decades ago they were desecrated, burned, and closed.  Holy Cross Jerusalem <span>convent is</span> no exception.  Its history, like other monasteries, is filled with various events. </p><h2>  Stavropegial monastery - what does it mean? </h2><p>  Before turning to the history of the Holy Cross Monastery, it is necessary to find out the meaning of the word "stavropegy", which is present in the names of some of them.  It can be literally translated from Greek as erecting, the establishment of the cross.  Actually, it is this rite that takes place before the construction of the temple begins, and in the canons of the church is called "stavropegy."  Then the cross is established on the spot where the throne will be located.  This rank can be carried out by the bishop himself or, with his blessing, a priest or future priest.  If the Holy One carries out the hoisting, the future temple is given a special, higher status.  In this case, the temple is directly subordinate to the Patriarch himself.  That is, the life of the monastery is governed not by the local diocese, but by His Holiness.  Moreover, he has the right to appoint a governor.  The Holy Cross Exaltation Stavropegial <span>Convent is</span> headed by the Mother Superior.  Convents that have received this status are granted privileges that relate mainly to worship. </p><h2>  Holy Cross Jerusalem Monastery Stavropegic </h2><p>  You can find this monastery in the <span>village of Lukino,</span> Domodedovo district of the Moscow region.  The place of the current location of the monastery is known for the fact that earlier there was a estate of N.A. Golovina.  The landowner, following the advice of St. Philaret (Drozdov), in 1869 presented her entire Lukin estate to the Floro-Lavra community.  Then in the village there was a church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, from which the community adopted a new name and began to be called the Holy Cross Exaltation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The fact that the monastery is also called Jerusalem also has its own history.  It is associated with the icon of the Mother of God, which was donated by Saint Filaret.  The list from the ancient Jerusalem icon became the occasion for the consecration of the church of the same name, which is also located on its territory.  Later it was called the Holy Cross Monastery of Jerusalem. </p><h2>  The history of the monastery: the pre-revolutionary period </h2><p>  It was approved in 1865 on the basis of the Frolo Lavra almshouse, which existed before that with the church of the same name in the village of Old Yam.  After some time, the created women's community was transferred to the village of Lukino and converted into a monastery. </p>

    <p>  From the seventies of the XIX century begins the heyday of the monastery.  The small stone church of the Exaltation of the Cross was significantly expanded.  With the money of the sponsors, a two-story cell building, a guest house, a refectory, a bell tower, and household courtyards were built.  Later, a church was added to the cell building, which in 1873 was consecrated in honor of the Jerusalem Icon of the Mother of God. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the nineties, the territory now occupied by the Holy Cross Exaltation of Jerusalem Women's Monastery (stauropegial) was replenished with another beautiful temple.  According to the project of architect S.V.  Krygina was erected here the most beautiful creation in its architecture - Ascension Cathedral.  It is he who is now the so-called visiting card of the monastery. </p><h2>  Post-revolutionary period </h2><p>  After the revolution died down, the life of the monastery changed.  It began to be called, like others, the source of corruption of morality of society and in 1919 was subject to closure. </p><p>  For some time, an agricultural artel was located on its territory, which in the thirties ceased to exist and gave way to a trade union rest house.  All this time, the services of the Holy Cross Exaltation Church did not stop, but in 1935 it was still closed.  The priest who served in him, the holy martyr Cosmas Korotkikh, was arrested and after two years of investigation and torture shot.  Later, dormitories, hotels, and a tobacco factory were located at different times in the churches and buildings of the monastery.  During the war years there was a hospital, then a sanatorium, which in 1970 became a rehabilitation center for children.  Everything that was created for so long and bit by bit by the natives of the monastery and its benefactors was either destroyed or desecrated. </p><h2>  The modern life of the monastery </h2><p>  In 1991, the monastery was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church.  Having restored its former status, it became known as the Holy Cross Exaltation Jerusalem Jerusalem Convent.  From that moment a different life began here.  Its cloisters were replenished again by natives, before the images of the saints, lamps were lit, unceasing monastic prayer sounded, divine services resumed.  Later, the <span>Jerusalem Church</span> was also restored <span>.</span>  In 2001, the church was consecrated by His Holiness Alexy II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Today, the Holy Cross Exaltation of Jerusalem Women's Monastery (stauropegial) is actively being restored.  Nuns do social work.  At the monastery there is a Sunday school in which children study the Holy Scriptures, the ethical foundations of Orthodoxy, the structure of the church, and much more.  The temple community organizes pilgrimage trips to shrines, holds holiday concerts, and helps orphanages and boarding schools. </p><h2>  Holy Cross Monastery (Nizhny Novgorod): foundation history </h2><p>  The radiance of the crosses and the ringing of the bells of this monastery sanctifies Nizhny Novgorod, one of the most beautiful ancient cities of the Russian land.  Finding a cloister behind huge faceless buildings is not so simple.  It is as if someone wants to hide this treasure from people's eyes, which, in addition to its architectural and historical value, has a special spiritual significance.  However, it is quite possible to find a monastery among the buildings: crosses will help this, which will lead the guest from the town square directly to the gates of the monastery. </p><p>  The ancient Holy Cross Monastery (Nizhny Novgorod), as well as other architectural and spiritual values ‚Äã‚Äãlocated here, has its own history.  It began in the middle of the fourteenth century and is associated with the name of the Monk Theodora of Nizhny Novgorod (in the world Anastasia Ivanovna).  She is the founder of the monastery.  A few years after the death of her husband, Suzdal Prince Andrei Konstantinovich, who accepted the schema with the name Dionysius, Anastasia handed out all her property, accepted monasticism, called her Vassa, and entered the Zachatievsky monastery.  Later, having already accepted the schema, she became Theodora.  It should be noted that this monastery was erected during the lifetime of Andrei Konstantinovich and was located at the very foot of the <span>Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin</span> on the Volga coast. </p><h2>  Brief annals of the monastery </h2><p>  The wooden walls of the monastery burned to the ground more than once.  Another problem was the increased humidity (the buildings were located on the banks of the Volga), which also contributed to the destruction of the buildings.  That is why in 1812 the abbess of the monastery of Dorotheus turned to the local authorities with a request to transfer the monastery to the southern outskirts of the city.  There, over time, the Voskresenskaya and Origin convents were moved. </p><p>  By 1820, a huge wasteland near the cemetery was decorated with a beautiful monastery cathedral.  Its architectural feature is an interesting form - the building was built in the form of an equilateral cross. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the cathedral, eight buildings were erected here, a hospital, a guest yard.  Later, in 1838, a school was opened for orphans, who were taught reading, spelling, needlework.  The monastery was visited by famous and imperial persons, travelers.  After the revolution, the monastery was closed, and its buildings were used for a variety of needs, sometimes the worst.  There is even a version that for several years there was a Soviet concentration camp for political prisoners.  Later, the monastery premises were warehouses, factory floors, waste storage facilities, etc. </p><p>  Finally, in 1995 justice was restored, the restoration of the Holy Cross Church began, which was almost completely destroyed.  Already in 1999, services began in it, and in 2005 it received its current name - Holy Cross Exaltation of the Convent. </p>

    <p>  Today the monastery‚Äôs temple is open to visitors.  There is a medical center where worldly people can turn for help.  Novice and nunnery of the monastery help orphanages, large and poor families of the city and region. </p><h2>  Holy Cross Monastery in Poltava: the history of creation </h2><p>  It was founded in 1650 as <span>a monastery.</span>  The initiator of its creation is called Martyn Pushkar, who was supported by Cossacks and residents of Poltava.  The first buildings were built of wood, easily damaged.  At the end of the seventeenth century, it was decided to build a stone cathedral with money provided by Vasily Kochubey, who was then a Cossack judge.  In 1708 he was executed, and his son V.V. had a chance to complete what had begun.  Kochubey. </p><p>  The end date for the construction of the cathedral is unknown.  Those times were very turbulent.  The monastery has repeatedly been devastated and almost completely destroyed.  In 1695, it was ruined by the Crimean Tatars, in 1709, after restoration, it was again destroyed, this time by the Swedish troops. </p><p>  Coverage of the Exaltation of the Cross Monastery took place only in 1756.  From this date begins its heyday: the construction of new buildings, auxiliary facilities.  This period was marked by the appearance of new temples and bell towers.  At the end of the eighteenth century, the monastery became a kind of center of culture.  The opening of the Slavic seminary led to these blessed walls, in addition to talented students, many famous people of that time. </p>

    <p>  After the revolution, difficult times for the monastery began.  In the end, in 1923 it was closed.  For some time the children‚Äôs colony for street children was located in the monastery‚Äôs premises, later a student dormitory and canteens were placed in the buildings.  The monastery returned to its true purpose only in 1942, when the community of nuns petitioned for its restoration as a convent.  Temples and buildings were badly damaged by German bombing, however, novice forces were gradually restored in the post-war era.  In the sixties the monastery was again closed.  In 1991, the monastery opened its doors to the female community. </p><h2>  National treasure of Ukraine </h2><p>  This beautiful monastery is one of the most valuable architectural monuments.  The Poltava Holy Cross Monastery includes several churches and a bell tower.  Built on an elevation, it is clearly visible from all sides and does not have a main facade - all sides of this architectural ensemble are equivalent. </p>

    <p>  The value of the Holy Cross Monastery is also the fact that it is a rare example of Ukrainian baroque.  From far away you can see its three components. </p><ol><li>  The highest bell tower, the style of which resembles similar structures on the territory of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.  It was erected in 1786. </li><li>  The seven-domed Holy Cross Exaltation Cathedral, located in the central part of the monastery.  In general, by its architectural tradition, it is close to other cathedrals of Ukraine, however, there are a number of details that distinguish this temple from other similar ones. </li><li>  Trinity Church, which is a single-domed stone structure, which for some time served as a refectory, but in the second half of the XIX century it was rebuilt and consecrated. </li></ol><p>  Despite the fact that all the buildings were created at different times, together they form a complete architectural ensemble, being a true decoration of the Poltava region. </p>
