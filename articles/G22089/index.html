An excellent option is located very close at hand - fifty-three kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  Meet: Sorochany Golf Hotel.  The hotel received its name in honor of the mountain, which is equipped with ski slopes.  And this place is popular not only in snowy winters.  The second word in the name of the hotel - ‚Äúgolf‚Äù - implies that the hotel has a field with holes for practicing this sport.  Also within walking distance, or rather, fifty meters away is a beautiful lake with a sandy beach - the property of the hotel.  And, of course, as a bonus, all the charms of the Moscow Region: berries, flowers, mushrooms.  So the hotel "Sorochany" is ready to accept tourists at any time of the year.  And to become his guest, any occasion is suitable: a fun weekend with friends, weddings, corporate parties, skiing, swimming in the lake.  And the family on vacation will also feel great.  Let's look at the amenities of this hotel more carefully, based on the feedback of those who have visited it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golf hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1193308.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  The hotel‚Äôs full address is: Moscow Region, Dmitrovsky District, Kurovo Village, 69. But it will be easier for motorists to remember that on the fifty-fourth kilometer of Dmitrovsky Highway, after you pass the Iksha village, you need to turn right to the sign for Yaroslavl.  After passing the bridge, turn left.  After another ten kilometers, in the village of Ilyinskoye, you should turn left again at the T-junction.  After two kilometers from it you will see the hotel "Sorochany".  Now we will give advice to travelers who want to get to the golf hotel by train.  Trains in this direction leave from <span>Savelovsky station.</span>  By train, get to the Yakhroma station.  Then you need to take bus number 42 to the village of Kurovo.  This settlement is located only seven kilometers from the district center, the city of Dmitrov.  Yakhroma Train Station is 5 km away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dmitrovsky district" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1193317.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is the Sorochany Golf Hotel </h2><p>  The hotel provides accommodation in beautiful wooden cottages.  They look very beautiful, especially in the evening, with backlight.  The cottage has four rooms.  They all have a separate entrance.  If you call in a large company and rent the whole house, you can turn the entire space into one huge room by opening the doors.  The hotel area is small but very well maintained.  In the garden there is a barbecue for self-cooking barbecue.  A lake with a beach - fifty meters.  Towels are provided free of charge at the hotel.  For winter guests, no less pleasant information: Mount Sorochany is also located nearby.  Reviews say ski lifts can be sent directly to the <span>ski boots.</span>  But for those who are lazy, the hotel administration has launched a free ski bass.  Ski passes can be bought at the hotel reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golf Hotel Corrupted Accommodation" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1193321.jpg" width="600"></div>

Literally all the reviews mention that the rooms in the cottages are unusual - two-level.  On the ground floor there is an entrance hall with a living room, and on the second floor there is a bedroom with a bathroom.  The rooms are divided into three categories.  The first, as in most hotels, is called "Standard".  The living room has a dining table with chairs, a sofa, a flat-screen TV.  The bedrooms are very comfortable.  You can book a room with two single beds or one shared.  Two more expensive categories of rooms ‚Äî Suite and Deluxe ‚Äî made a special impression on vacationers.  You can order a room with a kitchen or sauna.  Experienced tourists give such advice to travelers.  In the summer, the bath is not such a temptation.  But in winter, after a day spent on the slope, it would be nice to warm the bones.  These rooms are very spacious.  Even the one that has its own sauna offers a small set of dishes, as well as an electric kettle.  Well, the kitchen provides everything you need for self-cooking: a gas stove, microwave, refrigerator, pots and pans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Golf hotel sorochany" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1193315.jpg" width="600"></div>
