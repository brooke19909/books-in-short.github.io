He lived an interesting and eventful life, completely dedicated to his career.  He wrote a number of works that are very popular abroad. </p><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Froyanov Igor Yakovlevich was born in the summer of 1936.  His father was a Kuban Cossack and a major in the Red Army (repressed in 1937).  In his youth, he was accused of counter-revolutionary activity and sentenced to death, which was replaced by ten years of work in a forced labor camp.  In 1957, Yakov Froyanov was rehabilitated.  He decided not to return to the family for personal reasons, therefore Igor Yakovlevich did not recognize his second parent: he was brought up by one mother. </p>

    <h2>  Career </h2><p>  Since 1955, Igor Yakovlevich spent three years in military service.  After that, he decided to enter the <span>Stavropol Pedagogical Institute</span> at the Faculty of History.  At the university, professor V. Romanovsky became its supervisor.  Studying was easy for him, because the subject itself was to his liking.  After graduation, Igor decides to go to graduate school in the capital of Russia.  Most of all, he wanted to get into the group of Professor <span>A. Zimin,</span> who was a specialist in the field of Medieval Russia.  A small number of free places in the group contributed to the fact that Froyanov left to enter Leningrad.  In 1963, Igor Yakovlevich entered the Leningrad State University.  Three years later, he successfully defended his dissertation on the topic of dependent people in Ancient Russia.  In 1973, he was already writing a doctoral dissertation on the topic of social and political features of Kievan Rus.  But this work was not as successful as the first.  It was published only three years later, when the certification committee approved the work.  In 1976, Froyanov became a doctor of historical sciences, and already in 1979 he received the title of professor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Igor Yakovlevich Froyanov" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1638565.jpg" width="600"></div>

The times of the dean were difficult for the historian.  His books were published long enough, sometimes this process lasted for years.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Froyanov‚Äôs political views were finally formed: he supported the Communist Party. </p><h2>  Basic books, public reaction </h2><p>  In two of his basic works, the historian set forth his own view of Soviet and Russian political history (October 17th. Looking from the Present, Immersion into the Abyss).  The appearance of books on store shelves caused a stir among the public, because no one had written such a thing yet.  Froyanov's concept, which interprets the reasons for the October Revolution, has many opponents and followers who zealously defend their point of view.  Supporters of the author are sure that it was the scoring of such thoughts that led to the emergence of the ‚Äúanti-Froyan campaign‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  The concept of ancient Russia </h2><p>  What did Froyanov Igor Yakovlevich write about?  History was not only his work, but also a hobby, so he devoted all his works to an in-depth study of specific issues.  In books, he substantiates the communal and pre-class system of Ancient Russia.  He refuted the claim of Soviet historians about class and feudalism in Kievan Rus, showing that private ownership of land grew at the expense of only slaves (and not at the expense of those dependent on feudal lords).  Moreover, it was too weak and underdeveloped.  It is an interesting fact that in the first book devoted to this topic (1974) he refused a concrete statement, only prompting the reader to think.  In the book ‚ÄúKievan Rus.  Essays on socio-political history ‚Äù(1980), he had already openly stated that Old Russian society had a prefeudal character. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The concept of I. Froyanov is based on the assertion that people in Ancient Russia were free, they took an active part in managing different areas through the veche.  Issues of power, election and expulsion of princes belonged to the territorial community.  The main conclusion of the historian is that the Old Russian state was formed before the start of class division. </p><h2>  Criticism of historical views </h2><p>  Froyanov Igor Yakovlevich, whose books provoked a controversial public reaction, also received a lot of professional criticism.  The concept of the historian Froyanov was a new and harsh word in historiography.  She denied the official Soviet doctrine of the emergence of the state.  At first, his work was simply ignored, but after that a storm of criticism fell upon him.  As dean, Igor Yakovlevich continued to write.  It was impossible to ignore him, therefore, opponents of his views brought him a number of charges (misunderstanding of Old Russian texts, moving away from the "official road", ignoring Marxism).  Due to such a storm of protests, the third book on this topic was published only in 1990.  Among the ardent critics of the historian, S. Tikhvinsky, B. Rybakov, V. Pashuto, and Yu. Limonov can be noted. </p>

    <h2>  Criticism of Political Activity </h2><p>  Froyanov Igor Yakovlevich, whose biography was full of sharp criticism, caused the same controversy because of his political views.  In 2001, 137 scientists published a document stating that Froyanov‚Äôs work at the department led to a deep crisis.  Also, attention was focused on the fact that Igor Yakovlevich Froyanov retains his power by dismissing workers who retaliate with him.  In 2003, he was relieved of his post as head of the department of history.  It is also known that the dissertation commission was liquidated under his leadership (60 votes supported the decision of the administration, 37 votes were against and 8 abstained).  The professors were also accused of completely isolating the faculty, which entailed the focus of its power.  The text of the appeal had another weighty accusation that the teaching and training of Igor Froyanov was veiled by harsh political propaganda.  At the same time, Professor M. Florinsky said that a scientist was obviously being persecuted, and the Union of Writers of Russia asked the university administration to change the decision to dismiss Igor Yakovlevich from the post of head.  They argued that the historian deliberately survived from the collective "Westerners and liberal intellectuals." </p><h2>  Froyanov Igor Yakovlevich: proceedings </h2><p>  Igor Froyanov wrote many works.  We will list only the most basic of them: ‚ÄúKievan Rus.  Essays on socio-economic history ‚Äù,‚Äú Kievan Rus.  Essays on socio-political history ‚Äù,‚Äú Kievan Rus.  Essays on Russian historiography ‚Äù,‚Äú Kievan Rus.  The main features of the socio-economic system "," October seventeenth "," The beginning of Christianity in Russia "," The mystery of the baptism of Russia "and others. </p>

    <h2>  Present </h2><p>  Today, Professor Froyanov Igor Yakovlevich works as a teacher and continues active scientific and social activities.  In 2013, he supported the idea that the painting by I. Repin should not be in the gallery: it had to be transferred to the general fund.  It was believed that the picture reinforces the falsity of Russian history and captures this slander.  However, <span>I. Lebedeva</span> (director of the gallery) did not support this movement, saying that the painting "Ivan the Terrible ..." will continue to be in the gallery. </p>

    <p>  Summing up the article, it should be said that only a specialist can judge the activities of the historian Froyanov.  To understand how you feel about his ideas, it‚Äôs enough to read the main works on the formation of law and order in ancient Russia.  After that, you will become a supporter of the ideas of Igor Yakovlevich or completely reject his concept.  In any case, his opinion, supported by facts and arguments, has every right to exist.  It should be remembered that sharp criticism can be caused not only by a sharp rejection of information, but also by a blinding truth that satisfies few. </p>
