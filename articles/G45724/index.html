    <p>  In the complex for a fee you can take advantage of additional services: fax and telephone, Internet, medical procedures, laundry, hairdresser, car rental, dry cleaning.  Parking is included in the price, although this is unlikely to please our tourists, this convenience is more likely to interest the residents of Turkey themselves who have come to rest. </p><h2>  Leisure campers </h2><p>  What can the Labada Beach Hotel 5 * (Turkey) offer for leisure to its guests?  It offers vacationers several pools.  One of them is open, and the second is indoor heated, it will delight guests in cooler times.

Both of them are pebble, quite clean, and only guests of Asdem Labada Beach Hotel 5 * rest on them.  Reviews about the coast among vacationers are only positive.  People even believe that the beach is the biggest advantage of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asdem labada beach hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1379264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the sea, it is always clean, which undoubtedly pleases guests.  There is enough space on the shore, the beaches are spacious.  There are never any problems with sun loungers.  Whenever you leave the hotel, you can always sit comfortably on the beach. </p><h2>  Labada Beach Hotel 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Having described everything that the hotel can offer you, I want to go to the reviews.  Recently, the practice of providing false information by tour operators has been increasingly observed.  Choosing a place to spend a vacation, we naturally want to get the best possible conditions for the amount that we are able to pay.  As a rule, all hotels position themselves from the best side.  And you can learn about the true state of affairs only by reading the reviews of those people who managed to visit this place.  Although they can not be relied on one hundred percent, because the perception of all people is different.  Some like everything, while others do not like the best complex. </p><p>  Well, the integrity of tour operators can also not be relied on.  Selling you a ticket, they know what the conditions are in the place where you plan to go, but they will not tell you the whole truth.  After all, their ultimate goal is the sale of tickets at any cost.  Therefore, choosing a tour operator for yourself, nevertheless, turn to trusted organizations that your friends can recommend to you. </p><p>  And now back to the Labada <span>Beach Hotel 5 * (Turkey, Kemer).</span>  Reviews about this hotel are extremely contradictory.  The indisputable advantage of the complex, according to tourists, is its excellent location and the beach.  These two points should still be supplemented with a clean and warm sea.  Probably due to these advantages, many tourists visit Turkey every year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="labada beach hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1379267.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But as for nutrition, here the opinions of vacationers vary widely.  Many emphasize a very meager and monotonous menu.  For example, eggs and rice are usually practiced for breakfast.  Things are not very good with meat, except chicken, almost nothing happens.  Not everyone likes the kids menu.  Of course, no one remains hungry, but vacationers express their wishes to diversify the dishes.  Tourists advise you to arrive early for dinner, breakfast and lunch, because the most delicious food can not be found.  They don‚Äôt offer it again. </p><p>  Oddly enough, but some vacationers are quite happy with the food, emphasizing that the food in the hotel is much better than in domestic resorts.  Apparently, the intelligibility of some people is affected here. </p><h2>  Hotel Service </h2><p>  I would also like to dwell on the staff of the complex and the service of vacationers.  Paradoxically, but regarding this point, tourists write diametrically opposed reviews.  Perhaps the staff is changing - not everyone was lucky to encounter the best representatives.  Some guests complain about the rudeness of workers and unwillingness to solve problems.  This is especially true of the reception, where there are frequent problems with rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="labada beach hotel 5 turkey kemer" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1379268.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But some vacationers were quite satisfied with the service staff.  As for cleaning, it is really done daily.  But with all this, in many rooms, according to the guests, there is mold in the bathrooms.  But this is rather the fault of the administration.  Although the hotel was recently renovated, some of the furniture still needs to be replaced, since not everything is working properly in the apartments.  In general, the rooms are very nice and bright.  People note the presence of large windows, which, no doubt, pleases. </p><p>  The hotel area is quite spacious, but not all neat and tidy.  According to tourists, not enough staff. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  I would like to note that the hotel is aimed at couples with children.  Since there are complaints that adult animation is practically absent, it should be concluded that those who are looking for a vibrant nightlife should better look for some other hotel where the emphasis is on nightly entertainment programs.  The complex has a nightly disco every evening, which invites all guests to foam parties and theme nights.  For those who actively spend time in the daytime by the sea, this is quite enough. </p><p>  In the daytime, children's animators are engaged in children, arranging various entertainment programs.  So even the smallest guests are not left without attention.  There is also a children's pool with slides. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, the hotel is in a very picturesque location.  Sea, beach ... What else is needed for a long-awaited vacation?  Of course, positive emotions!  If you are already bored of the beach, then you can go on excursions or walks, and even in the mountains.  Outdoor activities will benefit everyone.  In addition, do not forget about all kinds of water sports and entertainment that can deliver a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpleasant experiences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="labada beach hotel 5 turkey" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1379270.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <p>  Special attention deserves the spa center of the complex.  Vacationers appreciate his services very well.  Friendly staff are especially pleased.  Leaving the children in the play area, you can relax in the Turkish bath and enjoy the rest. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you are planning a vacation in Turkey, then Labada Beach Hotel 5 * can be a pretty acceptable option, because it, according to reviews, combines price and quality.  And its location near the sea is an indisputable advantage.  Not all complexes can boast of such a location.  If the key to you is the beach and the sea, then you may well have a good time at this hotel. </p>
