It is surrounded in the north by <span>the</span> MKAD <span>allotment strip</span> , in the west by the streets of Bolshoy Cheryomushkinskaya and Krzhizhanovsky.  In the south, partly by the Kotlovka River and Nakhimovsky Avenue.  And in the east it borders on a pomological nursery. </p><h2>  District History </h2><p>  On the banks of the river Kotlovka in the XIV century there was a grand-princely village.  In the 18th century, the Cheryomushki-Znamenskoye park ensemble appeared in the region.  Over the past 200 years, almost all the ancient buildings have disappeared, residential buildings and industrial facilities have appeared.  All that remains is the Znamenskaya Church and the main building of the former Horse Courtyard.  But the modern area has several green corners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Pines" class="if uuid-2313725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2313725.jpg"></div><h2>  Green islet of Kotlovka </h2><p>  Sosenki Park got its name due to the fact that centuries-old trees have been preserved here, and the smell of needles attracts all the inhabitants of the area here.  On the territory of the park area, holidays and social events are regularly held. </p><p>  There are always many children with their parents.  Kids are happy to collect cones and feed protein.  There are many mothers in the park with strollers, because it is here that you can hide from the city bustle, noise and dust. </p><p>  The park has: </p><ul><li>  Two playgrounds for children, where they like to play and make new friends. </li><li>  30 shops for rest, which are very popular among older vacationers. </li><li>  Playground for volleyball and futsal. </li><li>  Dog training ground where you can practice with your pet. </li><li>  For the winter, a skating rink is poured and ski slopes are laid, that is, all the conditions for a comfortable rest after a working day and on weekends. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flower beds of the park" class="if uuid-2313729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2313729.jpg"></div><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Sosenki Park is a small <span>green area</span> with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã5 hectares.  On one side, the park adjoins the valley of the Kotlovka River.  Further along the channel, the reservoir is hidden in the collectors, it flows underground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the near future, the creation of a landscape reserve "Kotlovka River Valley" at this place. </p><p>  There are 1375 trees, 916 of which are conifers.  55 square meters are occupied under flower beds, there are neatly trimmed bushes.  Under the lawns, half of the entire area is occupied. </p><p>  Back in the 80s of the last century, there was a wooden dwelling on the territory of the park, which, on a municipal basis, was assigned to the village of Lenino.  In the 90s, they began to create a park complex, demolished all the outbuildings and began to form a green zone and paths for pedestrians.  In 2007, reconstruction was carried out, the alleys were updated, new trees were planted and benches were installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="um.mos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park in winter" class="if uuid-2313731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2313731.jpg"></div><h2>  Cleanliness and ecology </h2><p>  It is nice that not only utilities, but also visitors themselves monitor the cleanliness of the territory.  In this green corner of the capital, it is not customary to leave garbage around a bench or throw it along the route, for this garbage bins have been installed, which are available in sufficient quantities. </p><p>  Very often subbotniks take place in the park, to which many residents of the microdistrict come, referring to the process as a kind of rest. </p><p>  Such parks are very important for the districts of the capital, which are categorized with a tense environmental situation.  The Moscow region of Kotlovka was included in this list, and only 27% of all city districts in this category.  This suggests that in the South-Western Administrative District there are chemical pollution in the atmosphere, mainly due to the high transport load. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gazetauzao.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Playground" class="if uuid-2313746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2313746.jpg"></div><h2>  On the other side of the river </h2><p>  Opposite the Sosenki park, through the mouth of Kotlovka, there is a pomological nursery.  This garden is over 130 years old.  Around 1880, a certain owner of the plant with the surname Korobkov laid in these places an orchard with fairly rare varieties of trees.  After some 40 years, by order of Lenin V.I., the garden was drawn to the problem of nutrition in orphanages, and from there fresh fruit began to arrive at children's tables.  Later, a pomological nursery appears here and scientific work is actively carried out, then the garden was attached to the Butovo state farm. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.6688987" data-lng="37.59665150000001" data-type="hybrid" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/1/6/1316.png"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The address of Sosenki Park is Nakhimovsky Prospekt, 10. To the nearest station of the same name, 1 kilometer, you need to move towards Sevastopol Avenue. </p><p>  You can get here by tram (38, 26).  The bus service is well established, many routes run past the park, these are numbers 41, 119, 317, 826 and others.  For motorists, there is a small parking lot near the entrance to Sosenki Park. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The park zone is a place where it seems that you find yourself in a fairy tale, the main characters of which are giant pines.  Sosenki Park in Moscow is an opportunity to gain strength, breathe fresh air, go in for sports and just sit on a bench with your loved one. </p>
