There are a lot of beautiful corners that are great for creating original and memorable photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zaeltsovsky Bor" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/35027.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Zaeltsovsky Bor - a unique forest of the city with its stunning emerald expanses untouched by civilization, receives up to 80 percent of citizens on weekends.  Its area is thirty-five hectares of plantations with picturesque glades, bizarre paths, secluded places, relict pines. </p><p>  And although Zaeltsovsky Park is considered suburban, you can reach it by car from the city center in just five minutes.  At the entrance there is free very large parking. </p><p>  There is <span>a railway for children</span> on the territory <span>,</span> starting with a very beautiful station, which the newlyweds often use as decoration for a photo shoot.  There is also a bike rental and roller rental service in the summer months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, Zaeltsovsky Park offers a lot of entertainment: this is a cinema, where movies are watched in a car, and horseback riding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Parks of Novosibirsk" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/35026.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The entire territory is segmented into zones that differ in their design, but united by one theme of the railway.  This idea begins to be tracked already from the design of the main entrance.  Zaeltsovsky park is literally dotted with stylized elements of railway tracks, road barriers, bridge spans, steam locomotives - samples of the military period, expositions from details of earlier times.  Trains and steam locomotives in various designs are a distinctive feature of the park.  Attention is also drawn to forged sculptures that perfectly convey the railway theme. </p><p>  A huge number of gazebos and playgrounds, which Zaltsovsky Park offers for relaxation, make it possible to choose a corner for an intimate conversation or organize some kind of event on a real stage. </p><p>  For those who like active pastime, there are rope tracks, paintball, mini-golf and roller-skating courts, and various attractions.  In winter, those who are not afraid of the frost come to Zaeltsovsky Park to go ice-skating and skiing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zaeltsrvsky park" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/35028.jpg" width="249"></div>

    <p>  The history of this resting place is inextricably linked with the history of the city itself.  Since 1926, when Novonikolaevsk was renamed to Novosibirsk, the appearance of the <span>capital of Siberia</span> began to gradually change.  Particular attention was paid to the issue of landscaping the city.  There was even an idea to turn it into a garden city. </p><p>  However, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of greenery in Novosibirsk at that time: there were only a few gardens and groves - Trukhanovskaya, Svoboda, Starokladbischenskaya, Sosnovka and Alhambra.  But beyond the Yeltsovsky district there was an excellent forest, which in 1930 was decided to be turned into a resting place for the townspeople.  So there was Zaeltsovsky park.  Initially, it was supposed to build one-day holiday cottages, a water stadium, an exhibition center, etc.  Even a competition for the planning of the territory was announced. </p><p>  The park opened in June 1932, and after three decades, two truly grandiose projects were launched here - a children's railway and a zoo. </p>
