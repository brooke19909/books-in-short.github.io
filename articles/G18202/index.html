However, many people choose Theodosius, a city located in the east of the peninsula.  Vacationers often visit this resort very often.  And due to its popularity, not least the opportunity to rent inexpensive housing. </p><h2>  Private Sector: Features </h2><p>  A relaxing family vacation is something that, according to many tourists, is best suited by Theodosius.  The private sector of this resort offers its guests mostly rooms designed for 2-4 people.  But of course, you can find in Feodosia a room for one guest or a large company.  The climate in this city, as in any other seaside village, is hot and quite humid.  Therefore, indoors in the summer can be quite stuffy here.  For the convenience of tourists, the rooms of almost all local hotels are equipped with air conditioning or, in extreme cases, fans. </p>

    <p>  The service in mini-hotels of the private sector of Feodosia is not very diverse for vacationers.  After all, living in such hotels is relatively inexpensive.  But in any case, the owners of budget guest houses do everything possible so that the guests feel comfortable with them.  The yards of almost all mini-hotels are well landscaped.  Tourists can use here pools, parking lots, as well as barbecue facilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, the private sector (Feodosia) offers tourists a fairly convenient and inexpensive vacation.  Without intermediaries, housing will be cheaper.  However, it will be difficult for tourists to rent rooms this way these days.  In most cases, <span>hotels in Feodosia</span> work through operators.  But if you want, you can find the phone of a particular complex on the Internet and phone with its owners yourself. </p><h2>  Where to rent a house </h2><p>  If necessary, guests of Feodosia can rent rooms both in old houses in its historical part, as well as in modern, well-equipped cottages built in new areas.  Housing is rented here not only in the city itself, but also in neighboring villages. </p>

    <p>  The latter are popular with tourists, mainly because renting rooms of the same level here is cheaper than in Feodosia itself.  For example, the resort villages of Beregovoye and Primorsky enjoy great popularity among guests. </p><h2>  Tourist areas of the city </h2><p>  The area is not too big city is Feodosia.  The private sector hosting tourists in this village is concentrated mainly in several areas: </p><ul><li>  At the station "Aivazovskaya".  Hotels here are usually located close to the sea.  The peculiarity of the district is the presence of many various entertainment facilities. </li><li>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cinema "Ukraine".  In this part of Feodosia, among other things, there is a park recreation area.  Closest to local hotels are central city beaches. </li></ul>

The advantage of this area is the presence of a market and a large number of shops.  There are very few entertainment facilities in the Dynamo area, so it is most suitable for tourists with children. </li><li>  In the central area.  A huge number of both adult entertainment centers and children's centers are concentrated here.  Tourism infrastructure is best developed in this part of the city. </li></ul><h2>  What determines the prices of the private sector of Feodosia </h2><p>  Of course, the cost of rooms in any hotel in this resort is determined primarily by the level of service provided to tourists.  But other factors can also affect room rental prices.  First of all, this, of course, is seasonality.  In May, June, September and October, renting a house in this resort is cheaper than in July and August.  Many tourists, of course, are looking for a private sector by the sea in the city of Feodosia.  Hotel prices in such areas are slightly higher than those remote from the coastal zone.  At the height of the season, tourists will have to pay a lot for such housing.  But in May or September, coastal hotels usually offer rental rooms at not too high cost. </p><h2>  Price categories of hotels </h2><p>  The low cost of housing is what distinguishes the resort of Feodosia.  The private sector in this city offers tourists not only budget rooms, but also quite expensive. </p>

    <p>  In the cheapest hotels in the city, renting rooms can cost, depending on the season, in the region of 350-600 rubles per person per night.  In more expensive hotels located closer to the sea, accommodation usually costs tourists 400-400 rubles.  If the hotel is located almost on the coast, a stay in it will cost 500-1500 rubles. </p><h2>  What you should know about </h2><p>  Of course, there are some nuances of rental housing in the Crimea, including in a city such as Feodosia.  The private sector at this resort offers relatively inexpensive rooms.  However, renting rooms in high season immediately upon arrival is usually very difficult.  Therefore, taking care of the place of nights for tourists who want to relax in Feodosia, is in advance.  Booking a room at one of the hotels in this resort is the easiest, of course, via the Internet.  A similar service is offered by the sites of many travel companies. </p>

    <p>  Of course, before renting a room in a particular complex, you should first make sure of its good reputation.  Otherwise, rest in Feodosia can be seriously ruined.  The private sector is represented by a variety of hotels.  And reviews about them can be both good and not very good.  You can usually get acquainted with the opinion of former guests about a particular complex on the same travel agency sites on which reservations are made. </p>
