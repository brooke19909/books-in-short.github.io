The developed infrastructure of modern microdistricts allows you to use all the benefits of civilization, which distinguishes new buildings from other housing options. </p><p>  The developer of Uralstroyinvest CJSC, which is specialized in the construction and sale of housing in the Yekaterinburg region, offers to turn the above dream into reality.  This, in particular, is about the LCD Malevich.  It is considered the first conceptual project in the capital of the Urals.  All residential buildings represented in it will have a unique, colorful design (in terms of architecture), but together they will make up a single concept of style called Suprematism.  From the windows of the new building, the city is visible at a glance, since the Malevich residential complex is located in the very center of the metropolis (Kirovsky district, intersection of Tramvaynoy lane and Mayakovsky street). </p>

    <p>  The apartments belong to comfort class housing: they are spacious, have an improved layout and high ceilings, and are also equipped with large balconies. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The degree of improvement of the territory is pleasantly striking in the complex "Malevich" (LCD).  Apartments here should be purchased primarily because of the infrastructure.  All houses have a closed territory, and in the courtyard all conditions for a comfortable stay are created.  There are sports and playgrounds, and cars do not drive.  A separate zone is provided for them, where there are multi-tier parking lots for vehicle owners and a massive parking area for guests.  The microdistrict is guarded around the clock by security officers, which minimizes the risk of criminal incidents.  On the first floors of the houses put into operation, there are commercial facilities: pharmacies, hairdressers, bank branches, etc. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The average cost of a one-room apartment of 43 square meters.  m is 3,500,000 rubles.  For a two-room apartment in the residential complex "Malevich" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã64 squares, the buyer will have to pay about 4,500,000 rubles. </p>

    <p>  Three-room mansions of 94 square meters.  m are about 6,400,000 rubles.  Of course, housing in the Malevich residential complex will cost a lot.  Prices are not acceptable.  But the developer compensates for this shortcoming through special promotions. </p><h2>  Acquisition Methods </h2><p>  There are several options for buying an apartment in the residential complex "Malevich".  You can purchase housing in interest-free installments, making payments in several stages. </p><p>  It is also possible to use mortgage lending programs that are offered by VTB-24, Gazprombank, and Sberbank. </p><p>  In addition, you can exchange secondary housing for a new apartment in the residential complex "Malevich" (Trade-in service). </p><p>  If the buyer pays the entire amount at once, then he is given a favorable discount. </p>

    <p>  Finally, you can acquire an apartment in a new microdistrict with the help of maternity capital. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Of course, there are both pros and cons in the question of whether or not to buy apartments in the Malevich residential complex.  Feedback on this project comes down to the following. </p><p>  Many are fascinated by the unique architectural design of houses, the design of which is being carried out by Uralstroyinvest CJSC.  The layout of apartments and the development of infrastructure in the microdistrict also bribes.  But you can not keep silent about the minuses of the LCD "Malevich".  For example, some believe that the developer sells housing at high prices.  Others are unhappy with the fact that not far from the microdistrict there is an industrial zone and an interchange of railway tracks. </p>
