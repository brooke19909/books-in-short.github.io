Millions of tourists from all over the world come here every day to see the best attractions, as well as enjoy the unique southern atmosphere.  Tel Aviv is modern and dynamic, it retains the old traditions and at the same time unhinderedly opens up to new trends.  In the picturesque heart of Israel, tourists will find many different restaurants and hundreds of trendy places. </p><h2>  Basic information about the city </h2><p>  Tel Aviv is a united city municipality.  Located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  About four hundred thousand people live in the city itself, but if you count the suburbs where most of the citizens live, about four million will come out. </p><p>  The village was founded relatively recently.  In 1950, the merger of young Tel Aviv with the ancient city of Jaffa, which was previously used as a port, from where ships with pilgrims departed to Jerusalem. </p><p>  Initially, this territory was called Akhuzat-Bait and began to exist in 1909.  It was considered the Jewish quarter of the city of Jaffa.  In 1910, the name was changed to Tel Aviv, the decision was made at a public meeting of the residents of this quarter.  Soon the quarter grew and became a small city, where the bulk of the population were Jews arriving in Palestine. </p><p>  Currently, Tel Aviv is one of the most popular cities on the coast, in addition, it is expanding as a business and cultural center of the country.  In addition to the beautiful beaches, the heart of Israel can offer tourists a rich excursion program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is no secret that Tel Aviv is full of ancient attractions, and this is what attracts many travelers from around the world.  Everyone should see this city, if there is such an opportunity.  There are not many settlements with such an interesting history all over the world.  Below we will tell you more about what to see in Tel Aviv from the sights. </p><h2>  Jaffa Old Town (Jaffa) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old city" class="if uuid-2459337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2459337.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned above, Jaffa is considered one of the oldest cities in the world.  The first settlements existed here as far back as the seventeenth century BC.  Jaffa received the greatest flowering in the period of antiquity.  But when there was a <span>Jewish war,</span> they destroyed it.  The restoration took place under the <span>emperor Vespasian.</span>  During the reign of the Arabs, the city developed quite seriously, since it was a major port.  In modern times, mainly the Arabic-speaking population lives here. </p><p>  The city is divided into two parts.  It includes the Old and New City.  Most of the tourists are attracted by the Old Town, since it is here that you can admire the historical monuments, see the famous galleries, as well as take a stroll through the city shops.  The west of Jephetes Street is of most interest.  It is located on a hill.  The new part of the city is located in the eastern part. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also worth noting the fact that in the nineties of the 20th century, large-scale reconstruction of many buildings was carried out here.  These were forced measures, because in the medieval years Jaffa was constantly subjected to invasions, in addition, there were erratic wars. </p><p>  Feedback on excursions in Tel Aviv to this attraction is very positive.  Many tourists are impressed by this particular part of the city, since it is the oldest. </p><h2>  White City </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sandiegoreader.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White City" class="if uuid-2459314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2459314.jpg"></div><p>  The White City is a group of districts located in the central part of Tel Aviv.  Most of the houses in these neighborhoods are snow-white.  For this reason, this place in the city was called so.  It is considered a popular attraction in Tel Aviv. </p><p>  The main buildings on this territory were made in the middle of the twentieth century.  The area is made in the international <span>style of the Bauhaus.</span>  He was quite popular in the postwar years. </p><p>  More than four thousand structures made in this style are located in Tel Aviv.  They can still be seen in the city center.  As you know, this particular locality has the greatest concentration of such structures in the whole world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An interesting fact is that since 2003 the White City has been under the protection of UNESCO and is included in the world register of cultural monuments.  This area is considered an example of urban development, as well as architecture of the twentieth century.  That is what the UNESCO statement says. </p><p>  After the Nazis came to power, a fairly large number of Jewish refugees began to arrive here.  Among them there were a lot of qualified specialists, and it was these people who studied at the Bauhaus architectural school, which had a huge impact on the formation of this area in the future. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tel Aviv Beach" class="if uuid-2459310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2459310.jpg"></div><p>  Tel Aviv in modern times is not only the cultural, but also the economic center of the country.  As mentioned above, this locality is considered quite a popular place among vacationers from around the world. </p><p>  The western part of the city is a continuous sand strip.  For many travelers, the fact that the beaches are clean enough in Tel Aviv seems amazing, but it is.  Most of the sea places in Tel Aviv look quite attractive and unusually beautiful.  Judging by the reviews, the beaches are notable for their convenience and cleanliness. </p><p>  It is rather difficult to single out the best of them in this city, since they are all very good.  All have developed infrastructure, well equipped.  In general, the beaches are alike.  Here you can play absolutely any beach game (badminton, volleyball, football, etc.).  On the territory of each there are sports grounds.  In addition, it is worth noting the presence of a fairly large number of cafes and restaurants where you can buy delicious salads at affordable prices.  In addition, lifeguards on all beaches are well aware of their work.  Most of them are well aware of Russian-speaking travelers, which is also a huge plus.  The beaches in Tel Aviv are equipped with changing rooms, a toilet and showers, which for many tourists is a priority when choosing.  The impressions that will remain after a vacation on these shores will be uniquely positive. </p><h2>  Old Port of Tel Aviv </h2><p>  The old port is located in the northern part of the city.  To be more precise, it is located near the Yakon River, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="logindejavu-001-site6.dtempurl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old port tel aviv" class="if uuid-2464009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2464009.jpg"></div><p>  Previously, this place was a port, but now it is one of the busiest areas in all of Tel Aviv.  There are a lot of <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> as well as nightclubs.  It is here that tourists come, as well as locals in order to relax and have fun. </p><p>  The seaport was built in the mid-thirties of the twentieth century.  Then it was the time of the British Mandate.  The port was built in connection with the attacks of the Arabs, as well as the blocking of cargo supplies in the Jaffa port during the riots. </p><p>  The first cargo arriving at this port was a bag of cement, and now it is stored in one of the Tel Aviv Museum. </p><p>  The last ship arrived at this port in 1956, after which the port was closed.  For thirty years, the place was considered abandoned.  It gained a second life only in the nineties of the twentieth century, it was then that this territory turned into a tourist center. </p><h2>  Skyscraper complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mezuzahscrolls.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three skyscrapers" class="if uuid-2459336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2459336.jpg"></div><p>  The famous center of Azrieli was built in 1999.  In addition to three huge buildings, it includes a large shopping center. </p><p>  This attraction of Tel Aviv is located in the central part of the city, to be more precise, near the famous Ayalon highway.  It is mainly called Highway 20.  It is considered the most famous Israeli highway. </p><p>  The complex is named after the initiator of this project, David Azrieli. </p><p>  Each of these three skyscrapers has its own name, as well as a short story: </p><ul><li>  The round tower is considered the highest in the entire complex.  There are forty nine floors.  The construction of the round tower began in 1996, and was completed in 1999.  At the time of construction, this building had the status of one of the tallest buildings in all of Israel. </li><li>  The triangular tower has a height of 169 meters.  There are forty-six floors.  It was built in the same period as the round tower. </li><li>  The square tower is the lowest building of the three.  There are only forty two floors.  The construction of this facility began in 1998, but ended only by 2006, since there were some disagreements at the city hall.  On the lower floors of the architectural building is a popular business-class hotel. </li></ul><p>  This complex also has an observation deck, it is located on the forty-ninth floor of one of the buildings.  From this place, a beautiful view of Tel Aviv.  Paid entrance.  There are discounts for senior citizens, children, and military personnel. </p><h2>  Church of the Apostle Peter </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Apostle Peter" class="if uuid-2459338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2459338.jpg"></div><p>  This is an Orthodox church in the southern part of Tel Aviv.  It is under the jurisdiction of the Russian Spiritual Mission (Moscow Patriarchate). </p><p>  A temple was built in this place in the nineteenth century.  Even before the construction was completed, a house was built on the purchased land for Orthodox pilgrims. </p><p>  Grand Dukes Sergey and Pavel Aleksandrovich took part in the construction of the temple.  In addition, Italian craftsmen worked here, as well as local residents.  Icons for the church were painted by artist A.Z.  Ledakov. </p><p>  By the end of the twentieth century, the temple was dilapidated and restoration work in this place began in 1995 and continued for five years. </p><p>  Of the interesting facts, it is worth noting that some time ago, excavations were carried out here and the tomb of the righteous Tabitha (a New Testament biblical character) was found.  In addition, a mosaic of the Byzantine era of the 5-6th century was found here.  Later, a chapel was built over the tomb. </p><h2>  Pagoda House </h2><p>  Another popular attraction.  Tel Aviv Pagoda House was built in 1925.  It combines several architectural styles.  The author of the project of this attraction of Tel Aviv is a wealthy city dweller M. Bloch.  A very interesting curious story is associated with the creation of this building.  As you know, initially Bloch rejected the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãLevy and turned for help to an American architect, whose name, unfortunately, is unknown.  When creating the project, he did not take into account such a factor as the style of the city, so his idea was rejected. </p><p>  Bloch decided to turn again to Levi for help, as a result of which they together came to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmixing styles. </p><h2>  Hanging orange tree </h2><p>  This attraction is considered one of the symbols of Israel.  A suspended orange tree in Tel Aviv is a pot suspended on ropes, inside of which, in fact, is the plant. </p><p>  As you know, after Israel formed a separate state, it began to intensively export oranges, and this is what helped the country gain quite impressive revenues.  Thus, many economic problems were resolved. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  Tel Aviv embankment is considered a place of concentration of entertainment places.  Even on most Jewish holidays, when you can‚Äôt work, you can see working cafes, restaurants or clubs here. </p><p>  In the afternoon, most guests of this place, judging by the reviews, love to sunbathe on a beautiful comfortable beach.  In the evening there are a lot of tourists walking along the promenade. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lachapellestudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Art Museum" class="if uuid-2459339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2459339.jpg"></div><p>  A popular place among tourists.  The Tel Aviv Museum of Fine Arts exhibits quite a few exhibits.  These are mainly paintings, photographs, as well as sculptures. </p><p>  Some compositions are devoted to design as well as architecture.  This museum was created in 1932, and today it is a full-fledged museum complex, where there are several pavilions. </p>
