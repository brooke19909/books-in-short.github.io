    <p>  <span>A distinctive feature of the complex are panoramic windows that provide the building with excellent heat and sound insulation properties.</span>  <span>They are in harmony with the facade of each building, creating its unique appearance.</span> </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Vernadsky Avenue is the center of New Moscow, surrounded by the most prestigious universities of the capital, the largest shopping and entertainment centers, restaurants and cinemas.  The opportunity to experience the delights of country life and enjoy the unity with nature is provided by the famous Troparevsky Forest Park, located within walking distance from the complex.  It can boast of its landscaped area, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã16 hectares, on which there is an excellent park, a clean lake and even a zoo, causing real delight among the youngest residents of the complex. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  <span>There are no roads and noisy highways: only walking, pedestrian and bicycle paths.</span>  <span>For residents with a personal car, an underground parking for 1200 cars is provided.</span>  <span>And for the cleanliness and freshness of the air from Troparevsky Park, a centralized exhaust ventilation system of European production is responsible.</span>  <span>Residents of the complex, who were among the first to receive the keys to their apartments, claim that they finally managed to find a complex that combines the charms of modern city life and the most relaxed suburban life.</span>  <span>There is a complete sense of isolation from a noisy, dusty and gas-polluted Moscow, while all infrastructure facilities are at hand - you could not even dream of such a gift.</span> </p>
