By such decisions, the companies wanted to attract a large audience to purchases, although often it turned out quite the opposite.  Technological and design solutions of some models may seem strange, at least.  About such phones will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  Game device </h2><p>  Among the most unusual phones, it is worth noting a sample from Nokia of the N-Gage model.  This smartphone since 2003 was focused entirely on digital entertainment lovers.  For gamers, a console with side buttons was designed.  Its main advantage was a remote game, which could be played by connecting via a mobile network or Bluetooth.  The problem was that the combination of functions greatly affected the quality.  Using such a phone was too inconvenient.  Its format was lost to home consoles, and no one bought it for games.  It was inconvenient to send messages and make calls because of the side keys, and therefore this project opens the rating of the strangest smartphones of all time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pastemagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual phones" class="if uuid-2396023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2396023.jpg"></div><h2>  Another experiment </h2><p>  Unusual phone wallpapers are now fairly easy to pick up, but the strange device Nokia 7600 is only possible in the thematic collection.  In 2003, this company was the flagship in the release of cellular communications.  In order to deter customers, a wide variety of design solutions were applied, experiments were carried out quite often.  The above model is a product of one of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First of all, the case design, similar to a drop, made in a minimalist style, catches the eye.  The phone was much smaller than the standard samples of those times.  His main problem was the use of functionality.  The side keys were unusually small, and therefore it was too hard for people to learn how to use them at the beginning of the 21st century.  The design helped to experience some superiority, because there were very few such unusual phones.  It is pleasant to carry it with you, but at the time of use, people wanted to return to the standard massive models.  Due to such a controversial decision by manufacturers, the smartphone goes to ninth place in the ranking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual wallpaper for your phone" class="if uuid-2395629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2395629.jpg"></div><h2>  Custom Control Model </h2><p>  Among unusual phones, the eighth place in the ranking goes to the Samsung Serene model, which was born in 2005.  The Korean company at that time decided to create a product that will be able to impress users on all fronts.  They connected one unknown company to the development, which specialized in the production of expensive things for the upper strata of society. </p><p>  The result of the joint work was a telephone, which was almost immediately called too strange for a typical cellular device.  It turned out to be small in size, the lid automatically opened and closed back after use.  Instead of a typical keyboard, a spinning wheel was used, which was difficult to get used to.  From an aesthetic point of view, everything was at a high level, but the functionality was too inconvenient.  Products could be sold in a large circulation among fans of unusual ideas, if not for the price.  For a similar smartphone of those times, the price was set at $ 1,275.  This put the final cross on this model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most unusual phones" class="if uuid-2395631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2395631.jpg"></div><h2>  Two compact samples </h2><p>  Seventh place in the list of the most unusual phones is Toshiba products.  In 2008, this manufacturer of various equipment decided to try their luck in the cellular market.  He produces a specialized model that resembled a compact remote control from the TV.  The keys were arranged in two circles, a small screen was placed above them.  The main feature was that the phone can be used instead of a modem to access the Internet through a computer.  He connected via the USB port, and using mobile communications gave access to the network. </p><p>  The <span>Nokia 7280</span> phone is somewhat similar in design <span>.</span> Even more unusual, for which it gets a well-deserved sixth place.  The company again decided to surprise customers, this time with a rectangular smartphone with no keyboard.  At the time of 2004, the decision was truly revolutionary.  The text had to be typed with a special wheel, and the screen turned off replaced the mirror.  The case was assembled using metal, suede and even rubber.  Its appearance pushed buyers, and the model sold poorly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual phone screensavers" class="if uuid-2395633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2395633.jpg"></div><h2>  Black square </h2><p>  Unusual screensavers on the phone, ringtones, games and the like can now be seen with each user.  However, most models do not differ much in appearance.  In 2014, BlackBerry decided to make a bit of variety with the release of the Passport model.  The appearance of this sample on the market was awaited by many, especially fans of this company.  The manufacturer is known for never making an entertainment tool out of phones.  Their models are always as convenient as possible, have great functionality for work. </p><p>  But in 2014, the company took an unexpected step.  They presented the world with a black square phone.  The classic design has been changed, there are a variety of new technological capabilities.  In various nominations, the smartphone became the winner, but for users it did not play a role.  At that time, compact devices with touch controls already appeared.  This sample was perceived ambiguously, for many people it remained a black large square, and even its capabilities did not play a role. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsfirst.lk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual mobile phones" class="if uuid-2395635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2395635.jpg"></div><h2>  Bronze medalist </h2><p>  Unusual ringtones on the phone in 2006 appeared along with non-standard cellular devices.  In this regard, CEC Corp distinguished itself, which was one of the first to decide to create a smart watch.  The attempt failed for several good reasons, one of the main was the design.  The bulky design with a wire to the earphone on the middle finger was perceived rather coldly.  Chinese manufacturers have tried to add to their creation the most ‚Äúsmart‚Äù technological stuffing.  The result was $ 1,111; people were not prepared to pay that price. </p><p>  The bronze rating is received by the Haier P7 Pen, which is a phone and pen at the same time.  At the beginning of the XXI century, manufacturers tried to diversify the design and functionality of devices by combining objects.  This model turned out to be inconvenient in all directions.  The pen from it was too big, and calling and sending messages required effort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual ringtones on your phone" class="if uuid-2395638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2395638.jpg"></div><h2>  Silver ranking and device out of competition </h2><p>  Even the most unusual phone calls will not be as surprising as a glance at the Monohm Runcible.  This device was immediately called the opposite of smartphones because of its appearance.  In 2015, people were already accustomed to touch devices with different screen sizes.  The appearance of this model aroused admiration in some people and surprise in others.  The round case made of wood immediately became a reason for comparison with an antique watch or compass.  The view really gave cause, although the technological characteristics of this phone were at the highest level and the functionality did not lose to the best models of this year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="team2soft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual phone calls" class="if uuid-2395644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2395644.jpg"></div><h2>  First place </h2><p>  The leader in the top of unusual mobile phones is a model called the Golden Buddha.  Chinese manufacturers have created a model in the form of a female folding cosmetic bag.  A gold case with precious stones attracts attention instantly.  The bet in the name and design was placed on the fact that the device will demonstrate unearthly luxury.  It turned out a little differently, because with a focus on design, manufacturers forgot about design.  The phone turned out to be too bulky and looked disgusting in gentle ladies' hands.  Using the functionality was also rather strange, and also a decent weight added a negative impression.  The result is the strangest phone in the world. </p><p>  Outside of all ratings is a model of a cellular device that causes more fear and disgust, rather than surprise.  This is the Japanese Elfoid phone, which is made in the form of a doll.  The manufacturer claimed that the design will bring together the sensations of a conversation with a living person, but no one wanted to have such a device. </p>
