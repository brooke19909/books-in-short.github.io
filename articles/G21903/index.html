One of these resorts is Bordighera.  We will tell you more about it! </p><h2>  Bordighera, Italy: A Short Excursion </h2><p>  Bordighera is not only the most popular resort, the city is one of the oldest in the whole country.  It was founded in the fourth century BC - just think about how long it was!  The founders of Bordighera were ligurs - it is in Liguria that the city is located.  At first it was a small fishing village, but over time, it gradually began to grow and mutate.  From the end of the 17th century until the beginning of the next century, the city was considered the capital of a small republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hellomonaco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bordighera Streets" class="if uuid-2953852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2953852.jpg"></div><p>  Today Bordighera is a wonderful resort, which is famous for its magnificent climate, beaches, hotels and attractions.  The weather in Bordighera, Italy, is excellent: the average annual temperature is +17 <sup></sup> , which makes staying in this sunny city comfortable any time.  The city consists of two parts - the old, historical one, on Cape San Ampelio, where you can walk and admire the buildings that have been preserved from the past, and the new one, where all the hotels and villas are located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to live </h2><p>  Before choosing a place to live in Bordighera, you need to remember: there are relatively fewer options for accommodation here than in neighboring resorts, because the city is quite small.  Therefore, if you want to live in Bordighera, you need to take care of rental housing as soon as possible, otherwise you can stay with your nose! </p><p>  There are in Italy, Bordighera, villas, there are hotels.  So, for example, a pretty good three-star hotel called Astoria is considered the most budget option, located in a cozy quiet area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  Importantly, a rich villa was located in the hotel building in the century before last, so that accommodation will be shrouded in a romantic atmosphere of antiquity.  Near the hotel there is a beautiful shady garden with windows;  Own parking is nearby, so there will be no parking problems.  On the territory there is an outdoor terrace, bar, lounge area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blumenriviera.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Walking in the Bordighera" class="if uuid-2953884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2953884.jpg"></div><p>  Another good hotel in Bordighera (Italy) is the three-star Della Punta.  It is good because it is a family type hotel.  Just a stone's throw from the beach, the hotel has free Wi-Fi. </p><p>  We can recommend the La Scoliere Hotel with a parking, a terrace, a garden and a private beach area.  This hotel also has three stars, like most in Bordighera.  However, for those who cannot afford hotels, there is economy-class housing - for example, the one-star hotel "Elandra", which offers its guests single and double rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  Below we will tell you in detail about those places in Bordighera that you should definitely include in the list of mast visits to any vacationer in this cozy resort town.  And believe me, they will not leave anyone indifferent! </p><h2>  Corso italy </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of the Italian Bordighera is the main street of the town.  It is called Corso Italia and simply replete with signs of shops, inviting tourists to themselves.  The things that are sold there are one hundred percent Italian, the assortment is huge, so Bordighera can compete in shopping even with Milan, the recognized capital of fashion.  Corso Italia is open daily, in addition, lovers of shopping can visit the local market, but keep in mind that it is closed on Sunday. </p><h2>  City wall </h2><p>  In the historical part of Bordighera in Italy there is a city wall - another attraction of the resort town.  It has three gates and the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene, erected in the XVIII century.  He is famous for the fact that the remains of St. Ampelio are stored in it - it will be described later. </p><h2>  Chapel of St. Ampelio </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Bordighera in Italy (photo below) is the San Ampelio Chapel, located on a small rocky cape of the same name. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.sygic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chapel of St. Ampelio" class="if uuid-2955286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2955286.jpg"></div><p>  From it you can view the eastern part of Bordighera.  Saint Ampelio is the patron saint of Bordighera.  According to legend, he arrived in the city in the V century, and the church of his name arose six centuries later.  It was partially restored in the century before last, and partially - it was rebuilt (facade and bell tower).  Near the altar in the church stands a sculpture of St. Ampelio of the XVII century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  City Hall </h2><p>  In 1870, the city hall was erected on <span>Piazza del Popolo</span> .  This building in all its splendor has survived to this day and continues to attract tourists to this day.  It was built by the famous French architect of the XIX century Charles Garnier (he is also the creator of the Paris Opera).  Nearby is another attraction of Bordighera in Italy - the oratorio of the Apostle Bartholomew, built in the XV century. </p><h2>  Garden of exotic plants </h2><p>  The garden, founded by Giacomo Pallanca at the very beginning of the last century, is located on a steep rocky slope with magnificent sea views.  More than three thousand exotic plants from around the world await lovers of flora here.  One of the ‚Äúoldest‚Äù exhibits is Spearhead Cactus, whose homeland is Chile.  The cactus is more than three hundred years old.  In general, there are a lot of cacti in the Pallanca Garden collection, and the most incredible ones! </p><h2>  Garden Winter </h2><p>  A huge collection of Mediterranean flora is presented in another stunning Bordighera garden in Italy - the Winter Garden. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liguriaheritage.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garden Winter" class="if uuid-2953867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2953867.jpg"></div><p>  There are incredibly many different citrus trees - and, walking slowly along the alleys of the garden, you can enjoy freshly picked orange.  In this garden there are a lot of palm trees, olive trees and other no less beautiful plants, in the shade of which it is very pleasant to sit on a fine day. </p><h2>  And also ... </h2><p>  These, of course, are far from all the main attractions of the Italian Bordighera.  The whole historic city is one big attraction: you can walk all day long on the streets that make up the old days and enjoy the atmosphere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.italyrivieralps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa Garnier" class="if uuid-2953871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2953871.jpg"></div><p>  Be sure to see the Villa Garnier, the Church of Terrasant, the villa of Margarita of Savoy, the embankment of Argentina - the longest on the entire Ligurian coast, the length of which is two kilometers.  Perhaps one day to walk around Bordighera and admire its views will not be enough! </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is most convenient to get to Bordighera from Genoa or from Milan, located relatively in the neighborhood.  Flights to Russia are constantly flying to these cities. </p><p>  A train departs from Genoa to Bordighera from a station called Piazza Principle - a journey of 150 kilometers will take approximately two hours.  Conveniently, trains run every hour, starting at five in the morning.  You can use a car - rent it and go to Bordighera on your own.  The road runs through picturesque places and passes by such Italian cities as Savona, Finale Ligure, Alassio, Empire. </p><p>  You can also get from Milan by train - the journey takes almost four hours.
