Increasingly, domestic tourists choose the country of "morning freshness", abandoning the bored Egypt, Greece and Bulgaria.  Often visit beaches, ski resorts and the capital itself - Seoul.  However, it should be noted that Korea is an exotic that not everyone can afford.  The same expensive countries can be called Japan, Australia and the Philippines.  Most travelers, choosing among the listed states, still prefer South Korea.  What attracts Russian-speaking tourists?  Bullfights, many varieties of tangerines, skyscrapers, toilets, controlled by special remotes, open Internet access points and sauerkraut, which has long become a national dish.  All this can be found on the territory of an interesting and diverse Korea.  Do not be afraid of all of the above.  The state is open to any tourists who can choose a recreation area for themselves: monasteries, pagodas, slopes, beaches.  Holidays in South Korea, reviews of which are excellent, will appeal to many, if not all. </p><h2>  Tourists in Korea </h2><p>  For a long time, South Korea has been ranked as one of the safest countries in the world.  However, as they say, the medal has two sides.  The republic took the first place among all states in the number of deaths as a result of car accidents.  That is why tourists should be as careful as possible.  In addition, even with the fact that the country is calm, it is not recommended to walk alone in the parks at night or in the alleys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Locals treat tourists well.  However, there can be some problems with understanding (communication), since not everyone knows English. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in South Korea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1720339.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping in the country of morning freshness </h2><p>  The largest stores are open from 10:30 to 20 pm.  Smaller outlets start their day much earlier and end late in the night.  Korea has all the necessary conditions for shopping.  There are specialized areas, many markets, arcades, department stores and centers, duty-free shops are open.  When spending holidays in South Korea, it is definitely necessary to visit popular retail outlets. </p><p>  As the most common souvenirs can be called paintings, various products made of wood, dolls, fans and so on.  Quite a lot of interesting items decorated with mother of pearl can be found in stores.  Since we have already talked about shells and other things, it should be said that Korea is the only state on Earth where only women are engaged in the extraction of valuable objects from the bottom of the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="south korea sea vacation" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1720345.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  South sea </h2><p>  Traveling to a state such as South Korea is considered popular.  Holidays at sea is one of the most common activities. </p><p>  The best beach in Korea is considered to be Haeundae.  In summer, it is so full of both locals and foreigners that it is difficult to find a free place.  But you should not be upset because of this.  The south coast is rich in islands, which you can quickly reach and have a good rest.  One of these must be called Jeju.  It is popular due to the interesting and picturesque view, which will allow you to have a good vacation in South Korea.  The water is emerald in color, there are black rocks, sand of different colors.  And near the beach you can find a cave, near which exotic plants sprouted.  There is also a waterfall and a botanical garden.  You can visit the village, which has traditional houses.  The coast on Jeju is more suitable for those who prefer an active holiday.  This is due to the fact that the sea is turbulent, and the waves are rather big. </p><h2>  East Sea </h2><p>  The east coast is in great demand among tourists, as it offers beautiful and picturesque views.  Many travelers offer their preference for Sokcho Beach.  It has become popular due to the fact that it is located on the coast of the East Sea, which has clear waters.  Nearby is a pine forest, and the sand covering the surface of the earth is snow-white.  Not far from the beach is Seoraksan Park, in the territory of which there are mountains.  You can also go to Chodo.  This island is popular with fishermen.  In general, holidays in South Korea on the sea, reviews of which are very good, are the most popular.  Especially on the east coast. </p><h2>  Sanho Beach </h2><p>  This beach is also popular among Koreans.  Located on the island of Udo Sanho makes you feel like in Hawaii.  The sand is white, the water is turquoise.  Such a place is suitable for holding a wedding or just a romantic getaway in South Korea.  At sea, prices are much higher than in the city, so you should purchase all the accessories (towels, bathing suits) in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="south korea beach vacation" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1720388.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sejong </h2><p>  Busan has its own beach.  It is considered to be as calm as possible during rush hour (in summer).  The fact is that the beach is located far from the city center, so it is not in great demand among the local population.  However, tourists are not uncommon.  After all, everyone likes to relax in a country such as South Korea.  Holidays at sea will give a lot of sensations. </p><p>  You can get to the beach either by bus or by taxi.  It will also be easy to walk. </p><h2>  Gangalli </h2><p>  Another beach located in Busan.  It will allow you to have a good rest in South Korea.  In terms of size, it takes second place in the city.  It offers a beautiful view of the bridge connecting Busan to another island.  You can get to it using the subway. </p><p>  The sand on the beach is shallow, the climate is favorable.  Near it you can find theaters, exhibitions, museums.  The fact is that the beach is located in the cultural center of the village.  Of course, there are cafes and restaurants nearby.  There are bars, night clubs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in south korea at sea reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1720400.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Korean wave" </h2><p>  <span>Holidays in South</span> Korea means getting to know the local culture.  The ‚ÄúKorean wave" was called the spread of local musical traditions to the territory of other countries of the world.  K-pop has gained the most popularity in Southeast Asia.  Previously, only music referred to such art and the ‚Äúwave‚Äù, but now cinema, cuisine, and so on are reckoned to it.  A sufficient number of local actors have long been removed abroad, mainly in America, which indicates success.  Some were able to break into Hollywood.  It is safe to say that Korea clearly has someone to show and be proud of. </p><h2>  Cost of food </h2><p>  Any tourist will want to eat while spending holidays in South Korea.  We will consider the prices further.  In inexpensive cafes, the average cost per dish is about the same: from 7 to 12 thousand won.  If you buy food in the parks, you have to pay a little more.  The cost is fully justified, because the dishes are usually large, have special snacks.  Water is not sold in cafes; it is issued for free.  Coffee will cost 5 thousand won, the same amount will have to pay for various rolls, cakes or burgers. </p><p>  You can buy sweets in Mendon (one of <span>Seoul's districts)</span> .  For example, ice cream will cost about 2 thousand won, cotton candy - the same. </p><h2>  Entertainment cost </h2><p>  If you need to get to any attraction, you can always use the subway.  If you wish, you are allowed to buy a one-time ticket, although it will be more profitable - a transport card.  It is sold for 2 thousand won.  If you buy it at the airport - it will be a little more expensive, about 4 thousand. </p><p>  The fare depends on the travel distance.  Average prices: for a child with a transport card you will have to pay 450 won, for an adult - 1 thousand won.  Holidays in South Korea at sea, the prices of which are high, even despite considerable expenses will bring a lot of impressions. </p>
