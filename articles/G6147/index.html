  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conflict Resolution Techniques</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern world with its own rhythm of life cannot do without conflicts of interest, and the ability to adequately resolve them should become mandatory for every person.  Conflict is a confrontation between parties that are aware of the difference in their goals.  Such an understanding is very important, judging from the point of view of modern methods of solving problem situations that tend to non-violence.  Non-violent methods of conflict resolution lead to an agreement between the opposing parties, taking into account the interests of each of them. </p><p>  In the 70s, scientists paid more attention to the problems of management, regulation and content of conflicts of interest, but modernity requires giving greater importance to prevention and resolution technologies. </p><p>  What conflict resolution methods exist </p><p>  Today, there are many ways to solve problem situations, we will consider the main ones.  <span>Conflict management</span> methods <span>,</span> as a rule, are associated with the concept of impact (regulation), while an approach involving cooperation and a compromise is associated with the concept of resolution. </p><p>  If the regulatory method is chosen, the result of the confrontation between the parties is a situation in which each of them remains with personal interests, forcing the opposite to act against their own.  The result of such a confrontation can only be the loss of one of the parties, sometimes both of them.  The coercion associated with the regulatory method leads to the fact that the parties involved in the clash cannot continue the relationship. </p><p>  Such forceful <span>conflict resolution</span> methods have disadvantages in any situation, whether it is a win-lose or a lose-lose scheme.  When choosing a specific scheme, opponents also choose where the energy will be directed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the win-lose scheme, the energy is directed not against the conflict as such, but against each other.  When choosing a ‚Äúlose-lose‚Äù scheme, problems are either avoided or they are tried to solve it by compromise. <br><strong></strong></p><p>  Collaborative conflict resolution methods allow ending the confrontation through direct interaction of the parties, or through the participation of a third party.  The participants analyze the reasons and content of the disagreements, striving to maximize the convergence of positions and reach an agreement taking into account all interests.  Such a method is preferable, as in the end, none of the parties gets any advantages, and their relationship can continue to develop on a solid basis. </p><p>  This method is based on negotiations.  In fact, preparation for these very negotiations is already a partial resolution of the conflict, it includes: </p><ul><li>  preparation of a plan; </li><li>  implementation of the planned program; </li><li>  implementation by both parties of the accepted agreements. </li></ul><p>  Each stage of this process involves solving specific problems, the combination of which leads to the successful solution of the problem. </p><p>  How to learn to resolve conflicts </p><p>  Any difficult situation can be resolved with minimal losses for all interested parties.  A special training in conflict resolution will be of great help in this.  Its purpose is to teach effective ways of adequate personal behavior. </p><p>  Training will help you understand that conflict is normal.  The whole abnormality of any conflict of interest lies in the fact that its solution is left to chance.  The practice of the training will allow participants to understand what signs of conflict exist: verbal disagreement, lack of open communication, maintaining distance, negative thoughts about the opponent, suspicion and distrust. </p><p>  There are some methods to deal with problem situations: </p><ul><li>  emotional discharge; </li><li>  way out of conflict without winners and losers; </li><li>  benefit from the situation and others. </li></ul><p>  Having attended the training, you can get a picture of how to correctly resolve any conflicts that cannot be avoided with the modern rhythm of life. </p>
