The financial institution has developed several proposals for the purchase of a car or motorcycle.  To buy used and new cars, you can use the "BuyBack" car loan.  His secret is in deferring the main debt, so that the monthly payment can be half as much as usual. </p><p>  During the entire loan term, you have to pay only part of the cost of the car and interest on the loan, which will be about a third of the main debt.  The balance is paid at the end of the loan term when you decide to keep the car for yourself.  Otherwise, you can return the car to the salon at a residual price and leave for a new one.  Either use this offer again, or extend the loan for a new term, or sell the car yourself, pay the balance, while also earning. </p><p>  The loan is issued without down payment in the amount of one hundred thousand to 2.8 million rubles.  Duration - from 2 to 6 years.  The rate of 12.9% per annum when purchasing a new car, 16.9% - when buying a used car. </p><p>  Car loan "Real car enthusiast" is issued in cash for the purchase of a used car.  At the same time, it is possible to complete a deal with an individual without intermediaries in the form of a car dealership.  Money is paid in cash, so the seller does not have to open a bank account.  At the same time, specialists of a financial organization will check the legal purity of the car you are purchasing, help you prepare the necessary documents, and provide a comfortable platform for negotiations. </p><p>  The loan is provided without down payment.  The amount and term of the loan are the same as in the previous version, the rate is 16.9%. </p><p>  Finally, the True Rider loan is a special lending program for those who want to buy an ATV, motorcycle, snowmobile or water equipment.  The loan amount is from one hundred thousand to two million rubles, the loan term is five years, by agreement, it can be increased by one more year.  In the presence of collateral, the rate is 19%, without collateral 20.5%. </p><h2>  Consumer loan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ddc-lab.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank loans Orange" class="if uuid-2962250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2962250.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of Orange Bank, consumer loans are preferred by many customers.  In a financial institution, there are two types of such loans - ‚ÄúTarget‚Äù and ‚ÄúInstallment‚Äù. </p><p>  Credit "Target" is provided for a specific purchase, so that the client can realize his old dream.  At the same time, he has the opportunity to independently construct the conditions of the loan, choose the most convenient parameters. </p><p>  A loan is granted in the amount of one hundred thousand to two million rubles, for a period of up to five years.  The rate from the moment the money is issued until the first payment is 30%, then it is reduced to 19%, and if the borrower is financially protected, it will be up to 17%. </p><p>  It is important that the bid can be reduced: </p><ul><li>  5% if the property has real estate that remains as a pledge; </li><li>  2% upon down payment in the amount of more than half of the cost of purchased goods; </li><li>  by 1% - in case of insurance of the borrower; </li><li>  by 1% - upon registration of a pledge for an acquired vehicle or car owned. </li></ul><p>  Installment loan exists due to cooperation between the bank and your seller.  Its essence lies in the fact that you have to pay in installments only the cost of the goods without the cost of using borrowed funds.  In fact, this is an interest-free loan, which can be obtained as quickly and simply as possible. </p><p>  Its amount is from 30 to 700 thousand rubles.  Loan term - up to 2 years. </p><h2>  Credit card </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit cards" class="if uuid-2962254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2962254.jpg"></div><p>  It is possible to get one of the most demanded banking products in the country at this financial institution - a credit card.  Orange Bank offers a grace period of 65 days. </p><p>  65 days is the period during which the client can use credit funds without paying any interest.  This is the most convenient financial product that allows you to quickly borrow money from the bank on favorable terms.  The only thing you should be absolutely financially disciplined person. </p><p>  When applying for this card, you get a credit limit of up to one million rubles, which you can use for 65 days for free.  Its validity is two years.  In case of non-payment of debts after the expiration of the grace period, the loan rate will be 28%. </p><h2>  Impressions of workers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank employees Orange" class="if uuid-2962247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2962247.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews by an employee of Orange Bank, one can get an impression of the atmosphere in this organization and whether it is worth getting a job here. </p><p>  It is worth recognizing that most of these opinions are negative.  They pay as low a salary as possible, while hiring do not pay any attention to education, as recently there has been a serious shortage of personnel. </p><p>  One of the main complaints made by employees in their reviews of Orange Bank is that only 80% of the salary is paid clean, and the rest can be obtained only depending on the financial performance of the company.  That is, you can easily stay in one of the months without a fifth of the income. </p><h2>  Customer Opinions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ddc-lab.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank Loans Orange" class="if uuid-2962251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2962251.jpg"></div><p>  In reviews of Orange Bank in Moscow, customers note that they are satisfied with the developed credit card with a grace period.  65 days of an interest-free period is a very good offer, since most other financial institutions are limited to 50 days.  But just two months is enough for most customers to solve the arising financial difficulties.  This is noted in the reviews about the bank "Orange" by most users. </p><p>  As a rule, positive service reviews are related to servicing legal entities.  Employees treat them as carefully and politely as possible, promptly answer all questions and provide any assistance. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.makemymoney.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank loan processing Orange" class="if uuid-2962248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2962248.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth recognizing that there are a lot of negative reviews about the Orange Bank in St. Petersburg.  Most often, they are found when using credit products.  The most popular reviews are about car loans at Orange Bank.  In particular, a financial institution is often accused of conspiring with a car dealer. </p><p>  When contacting a car dealership, the client is initially promised a rate in the region of 9%, but then it turns out that only this bank can approve the loan, and at almost 16%.  In this case, additional services are imposed.  Such an attitude towards customers leads to a large number of negative reviews about loans at Orange Bank. </p><p>  In other cases, the rate rises from 12.5 to almost 24 percent.  At the same time, the dealership begins to threaten that in case of refusal to sign a loan agreement, the client will lose his down payment made for the car.  At the same time, the amount of additional services is constantly changing, in some cases it reaches tens of thousands of rubles that are sent to the account of certain individual entrepreneurs.  It is worth noting that this is a regular situation that one has to face in reviews of car loans at Orange Bank. </p><p>  Recently, the number of users associated with this organization has increased significantly.  This is due to the fact that after Aymanibank revoked the license, Orange Bank bought their auto loan portfolio worth about a quarter of a billion rubles.  The service of all these clients was automatically transferred to this financial institution. </p><p>  These people should be especially careful and careful.  Customer reviews of loans at Orange Bank should alert many.  Users emphasize that they have to pay an average of one and a half times for a car.  Almost everyone who issues car loans related to this financial organization is faced with fraud when buying a car. </p><p>  In reviews of Bank Orange LLC, many are faced with imposed road map insurance, which has nothing to do with the bank itself, but at the same time the amount for its payment is happy to be included in the full cost of the loan.  At the same time, customers are always promised that they will be able to refuse this service without problems, in practice this is practically impossible. </p><p>  Summarizing the reviews of loans at Orange Bank, we have to conclude that this financial institution is not at all oriented towards offering favorable conditions for its customers.  All actions of managers and developed loan products are aimed only at maximizing the interest rates on loans, imposing all kinds of additional services. </p>
