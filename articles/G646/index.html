Super Zero is one of them.  We will try to understand why it attracts its customers so much, as well as what connection methods exist.  In fact, this option is very beneficial for those whose surroundings also use this mobile operator.

    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  In general, there are different tariffs for MTS.  "Super Zero" is the one that is suitable for phone lovers, as already mentioned, within this cellular network.  That is, if you and your environment prefer MTS, then you can safely switch to this tariff plan.  Why?  Now we will figure it out. </p><p>  The thing is that you will receive 100 free minutes per month for conversations with other MTS subscribers.  True, now the conditions, like the name of the tariff, have changed a bit.  It is now called Super MTS, and when you use it, you get 30 minutes of free calls per day. </p><p>  Honestly, there is no <span>monthly fee</span> in this tariff <span>.</span>  But there is one small condition that is missing from MTS.  "Super Zero" (unlimited tariff) requires a deposit of more than 100 rubles.  Only then all of his pleasant surprises will work.  And to "meet" with the replenishment will have a week.  Let‚Äôs see what customers think about it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About calls </h2><p>  Already, a lot of different opinions have gathered about MTS tariffs.  Super Zero, to be honest, gets relatively good reviews.  But it is worth adding more specifics to this topic. </p><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is how the tariff works.  When replenishing the balance during the week by more than 100 rubles, you get 30 minutes of free calls per day for 30 days.  This feature applies only to MTS subscribers.  With other mobile operators, you will pay 1 ruble for a call.  Not so much as it might seem at first glance.  After all, the same "Megaphone" asks 1.2 rubles.  A trifle, but nevertheless even she may someday come out sideways to you. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the quality of communication pleases all customers.  With the exception of one small feature - today's mobile operator very often undergoes a variety of communications checks.  And they can cause inconvenience for a while.  Nevertheless, even this is nothing compared to what MTS tariffs can offer.  "Super Zero" is what a modern client can only require. </p><h2>  In Russia and abroad </h2><p>  Another point worth mentioning is calls all over the world.  If everything is clear within your region, then here it‚Äôs not at all.  And that is why now we have to figure out what customers think about calls in Russia and around the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thing is that outside of our country, calls will cost 50 rubles.  At the same time, you will also be calling in Russia for free, but only for 30 minutes a day and only to MTS.  City numbers, as well as other mobile operators cost 10 rubles per minute.  These are the favorable MTS tariffs.  "Super Zero" is something that will help to stay in touch even to the most sociable customer. </p><p>  Regarding the quality of communication outside Russia, one can also rejoice.  The thing is that here there are no cliffs, as, for example, at Beeline.  Thus, this tariff plan is what suits the traveler.  Anyway, to any modern customer, as many buyers say.  But this is far from all.  Let's try to figure it out with you in another area.  What else can be important for a modern person when choosing a tariff? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff mts super mts 3d zero" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873571.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Of course, modern customers can not do without the Internet.  And it is precisely with this poet that the ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù tariff ‚ÄúSuper MTS‚Äù (‚Äú3d Zero‚Äù - its ‚Äúpopular‚Äù name) offers us an excellent opportunity for unlimited Internet connection.  And all this, as a rule, with excellent speed.  And without a monthly fee. </p><p>  As many customers note, the Internet is one of the most powerful places in our current mobile operator.  You can always watch a movie, surf the Internet, chat with friends (even via Skype), and all this at a good speed.  3 GB of traffic load very quickly, and then the speed drops slightly.  However, this does not scare customers.  Rather, many do not even notice this phenomenon. </p><p>  True, in the evening in some regions there are minor interruptions in communication.  They usually pass very quickly.  And you can again comfortably work with the Internet.  Thus, here too everything is more than satisfactory.  If you are not afraid of small and rare network failures, then you can hope that Super Zero is what you need. </p><h2>  What do they think in general </h2><p>  But what reviews does Super Zero (MTS tariff) collect among customers in general?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews super zero tariff pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873570.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that there is no unequivocal opinion.  Why?  All due to the fact that some are not satisfied with the Internet, as well as the conditions for providing free minutes.  There used to be a bit more.  Plus, the tariff in question quite often raises doubts about the effect of free minutes.  After all, in a week you will have to top up your account by more than 100 rubles.  And only after that you will receive a notification that you have accrued minutes of conversation.  But sometimes the text does not spell ‚Äú30 days,‚Äù but ‚Äúmonth.‚Äù  This is what confuses customers. </p><p>  Nevertheless, in general, the reviews are quite positive.  The tariff can be called anti-crisis and beneficial for communication.  True, only for calls.  SMS messages will cost you 1.5 rubles per ‚Äúletter‚Äù.  And this is the average cost for any operator.  So, it's time to take stock of today's dialogue. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Well, let's look at the current picture as a whole.  Actually, the tariff offered to us today is one of the most successful offers that can only be found.  The main thing is to understand all the conditions that you have to comply. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS super zero tariff unlimited" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/873569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, it‚Äôs already impossible to activate this tariff.  More precisely, there is already no <span>tariff plan</span> with that name (Super Zero).  Now it is called "Super MTS".  As a rule, the easiest way is to buy a SIM card with this package.  In addition, you can use the SMS request sent to number 1, or call the operator at 0890. That's all, the problems have been resolved.  As you can see, there are also very favorable MTS tariffs.  ‚ÄúSuper Zero‚Äù receives positive reviews from many customers.  True, from those who really know what he is dealing with. </p>
