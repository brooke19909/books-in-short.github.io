Once it was the largest port in the province of Languedoc-Roussillon.  Previously, it was famous for its powerful military fort, although at that time this settlement was a small, wonderful and quiet fishing town. </p><p>  Still in Collioure (Collioure France) is an <span>impregnable fortress,</span> erected in the VII century.  The citadel served as a defense of the city and its environs for many centuries, therefore it was constantly improved and strengthened, up to the 17th century. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.52675199999999" data-lng="3.084630999999945" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/5/1/7/10517.png"></div><h2>  Pearls of France </h2><p>  This amazingly beautiful area is located near the Spanish border, in the province of Languedoc-Roussillon.  Since January 2016, it has become part of the Occitania region (the main city of Montpellier).  The cities of France, Collioure and Perpignan, are called the pearls of the French Purple (or Scarlet) coast.  They are rightly recognized as the most picturesque towns of the south of France. </p><p>  Despite their small size, these cities accommodate a huge number of attractions.  According to many who have visited both towns, Perpignan is more fascinated by its historical sights, and Collioure is more modern and brilliant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General information about Collioure </h2><p>  The attraction of France is the whole town.  It is located on the Mediterranean coast of Vermilion.  This amazingly picturesque city leaves no one indifferent. </p><p>  The population is only about 3,000 inhabitants.  But the city is very rich in cultural and historical sights and events.  Many famous artists have immortalized this fabulous town on their canvases. </p><p>  The architecture of the town and its environs can be divided into religious and military structures - castles, fortresses and forts.  Fans of culture and art can please numerous small museums, salons and galleries.  The artistic reputation of this small town remains today.  Here, in the old fishing quarter of Le More, there are more than 30 workshops and galleries.  Many street artists, sitting on the city promenade, paint portraits of tourists. </p><p>  Collioure (France) has hosted many attractions on its territory, some of which are briefly described in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankment Collioura" class="if uuid-2914767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2914767.jpg"></div><h2>  The main city event </h2><p>  Every year from August 14 to 18, Collioure hosts the medieval feast of St. Vincent.  The main event of this event is the procession at sea, which takes place on August 16.  This holiday takes its beginning in 1701. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These celebrations were held annually before the law on the separation of the church from the state (1905), but since 2001 this procession has revived in connection with the centenary of the holiday. </p><h2>  Royal Castle of Collioura </h2><p>  Many castles in France attract the attention of tourists around the world, and this is no exception.  It was built in the 7th century on the seashore and was rebuilt several times during the 13th-17th centuries.  Historians attribute its foundation to the year 672.  At the beginning of the XIII century, the Chateau Royal was thoroughly fortified and rebuilt by the famous knights of the Knights Templar.  After them, the kings of Mallorca rebuilt it.  But to whoever the castle of Collioure passed over all the time of its history, it always performed defense functions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the Royal Castle" class="if uuid-2914772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2914772.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that when buying a ticket to visit the castle, a building plan is issued with brief information about it (including in Russian).  There is even a special venue for classical music concerts. </p><h2>  Church Eglise Notre-Dame-des-Anges </h2><p>  This building, erected in the years 1684-1691, can also be called a symbol of the town.  The church is located in the sea harbor of Collioure. </p><p>  Initially (the end of the 17th century), it served as a lighthouse, but by order of Marshal of France Vauban its similar function was abolished. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.purefrance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eglise Notre-Dame-des-Anges" class="if uuid-2914787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2914787.jpg"></div><h2>  Chapel of Notre Dame des Angers </h2><p>  On the coast near the Royal Castle is the main attraction of Collioure (France) - the chapel of the church of Notre Dame des Angers. </p><p>  Today, she was given the role of a lighthouse located in the city's bay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle chapel" class="if uuid-2914811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2914811.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  You can swim in that very small bay near the chapel.  The beach is practically not equipped and covered with small pebbles, but the water in this place is surprisingly clear, only a little colder than off the coast. </p><p>  Fans of diving, using masks, can admire the magnificence of the underwater kingdom, in which sea urchins live in large numbers, as well as a wide variety of beautiful fish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homeexchange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collioura Bay" class="if uuid-2914818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2914818.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Collioure (France) is a very compact and small city.  Nevertheless, all tourists find it quite cozy and beautiful.  When you are in it, you forget about time. </p><p>  This is a very romantic place.  Memories of him remain for a long time in memory, and subsequently there remains a desire to return to this amazingly beautiful and fabulous town again. </p><h2>  About climatic conditions </h2><p>  In October in France, the weather no longer reminds of the past summer.  This is the first real autumn month in almost all regions of the country.  However, serious rains here begin only in the second half of October.  A positive aspect of this season is the sharply reduced number of tourists and relatively cheap tickets for transport and museum entrances.  And shopping in numerous boutiques at this time without queues, which can also be attributed to the advantages of this period of the year.  There are no frosts at this time.  In short, a vacation in Collioure can be quite successful if you have the necessary warm clothes. </p><p>  It should be noted that climatic conditions in different regions of France are different.  The main reason is the simultaneous influence of the Mediterranean, continental, alpine and Atlantic zones.  Each of them has its own animal and plant world, as well as its unique natural landscapes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homeexchange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picturesque town" class="if uuid-2914820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2914820.jpg"></div><p>  June is one of the most favorable months for spending holidays in France.  Closer to September there is a gradual decrease in air temperature.  This is the time when the holiday season ends. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  A visa to France is necessary for the Russians.  When entering this state, tourists and travelers, representatives of any business, as well as persons seconded to work and arriving at the invitation of relatives, must necessarily apply for a Schengen visa to legally visit the country. </p><p>  This picturesque fishing area on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea would have lived its own isolated life (winemaking and anchovy fishing), preserved in its own fabulous beauty, if it had not been discovered at the beginning of the 20th century by famous artists.  This place is chosen by Henri Matisse, Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, Andre Derain and many others.  other </p>
