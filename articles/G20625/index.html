This is a huge planet, inhabited by billions of people of different faiths, skin colors and nations.  Fortunately, they all coexist peacefully on Earth.  Probably everyone wants to travel.  After all, a trip to another country is a new and incredibly useful experience that teaches people to communicate, accept the culture and traditions of others. </p><p>  Typically, tourists from Russia and the CIS countries travel to Europe, less often to Asia and America.  The southern hemisphere remains mysterious and unknown.  It is worth remembering that there are many countries with a completely different value system, for example, the state of New Zealand, which is one of the most favorable for life.  Today we will talk about the city of Auckland, which is part of this country.  We have to figure out the sights, food, hotels.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  History and location of the town of Auckland </h2><p>  So, for starters, we will talk about the history of the city of Auckland in New Zealand. </p><p>  Auckland is the largest and most highly urbanized community in the country, with more than 32% of the population.  The city is located on the North Island of New Zealand on a huge plateau.  Auckland is surrounded by several mountain ranges, three sea bays and a huge number of islands.  The town is located on the territory of the Auckland volcanic region, there are 49 extinct volcanoes, which last erupted more than 100 thousand years ago. </p><p>  The first people appeared here more than 800 years ago.  They were called Maori.  This territory was suitable for life, therefore, at the peak of development, about 20,000 people lived here, but by the time the Europeans arrived, the number of Maori was small.  The recession was due to numerous tribal wars and migrations.  Auckland City (New Zealand) - pictured below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.backpackerguide.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auckland City" class="if uuid-3151912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85188/3151912.jpg"></div><p>  The first European visited here in 1769, his name was James Cook.  The city was formed in 1840 by captain William Hobson after the signing of the Waitangi agreement.  Auckland began to develop rapidly, since it was through him that the migratory flow of people from the UK and Australia passed. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the largest naval base in England was located on the territory of the city. </p><h2>  Weather in Auckland </h2><p>  Next, we will talk about the climate in Auckland (New Zealand). </p><p>  The city is located in the zone of subtropical oceanic climate, which is characterized by warm, humid summers and cool rainy winters.  It is worth saying that Auckland is the warmest and sunniest city in all of New Zealand.  The minimum air temperature that was recorded here is -0.5 degrees.  The absolute maximum in the city is approximately +31 degrees.  It rains all year round, peak in winter.  137 rainy days are recorded here annually.  This weather is due to the proximity to the ocean.  Snow is a rare occurrence for Auckland that happens once every 50-100 years.  The last time he fell out in 2011, but melted right in flight. </p><p>  You can always come to town.  The best time, of course, is December-March, when summer comes here.  There is almost no rain at this time, and the sun shines incredibly bright. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to stay in Auckland?
