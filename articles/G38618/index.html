    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the format of this article, we will talk briefly about the foundation of Krasnoyarsk, as well as the richness of the natural landscape and the stunning beauty of these places.  The city was founded on the banks of the great Siberian river Yenisei, currently it is located on both banks.  Its geographical location can be defined as the contact of the borders of the Sayan Mountains, the West Siberian Plain and the Central Siberian Plateau.  He lies in the northern spurs of the Sayan Mountains, which form a basin here. </p><p>  Since it is customary to divide the territory of Siberia into Western and Eastern along the Yenisei, one part of the city is located in Eastern Siberia, and the other in Western.  To avoid confusion, Krasnoyarsk is conditionally classified as Eastern Siberia; as a result, it is the center of the East Siberian region.  The extreme range of the Sayan Mountains entered the city‚Äôs borders. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  City relief </h2><p>  Modern Krasnoyarsk, founded in such a place, has a complex hilly relief.  The districts of the city are located on its various formations.  The Akademgorodok district lies on the Sayan Range, the railway station area is in the lowlands, Oktyabrsky, as well as the Soviet regions are in the hills, Sverdlovsky is in the foothills. </p><h2>  The origin of the name of the city </h2><p>  In the earliest documents, the future city of Krasnoyarsk was called the New Kachinsky prison, this name was given along the Kache River - the left tributary of the Yenisei, where it was located.  This gave rise to the assumption that Kachinsky prison existed before him.  Most likely, it was founded as a collection point for yasak or it was just a winter hut, the estimated date of the founding of Krasnoyarsk, taking into account these circumstances, is 1608. </p><p>  The local Kachin people called this place Khizil Char, which translated into Russian meant Krasny Yar (coast, cliff).  In Russian, the word "red" meant beautiful.  Indeed, the place that was chosen as a prison has charming Siberian beauty.  After the settlement was given the status of a city, it became known as Krasnoyarsk. </p>

    <h2>  History until the 16th century </h2><p>  The history of the foundation of Krasnoyarsk is amazing and full of important events for Russia.  He played a key role in the development of Siberia.  This is the largest of the ancient <span>Siberian cities.</span>  The history of the development of these places, as well as the city itself began long before the appearance of Krasnoyarsk.  The convenient location for living contributed to the fact that in ancient times many peoples passed through it.  Excavations carried out in the vicinity of the city speak of ancient settlements, as a result of which ancient settlements with rich finds that speak of a developed civilization were found. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Excavations of the Neolithic period were found on the territory of the city.  Scientists were able to establish that the settlements were built 35 thousand years ago.  Two thousand years ago, tribes of keto-speaking peoples lived here.  The territory of the <span>Krasnoyarsk Territory is</span> surprising in that it was inhabited by many peoples that make up tribes, unions, primitive states.  Nothing is known about many of them. </p><h2>  Land development </h2><p>  The territory has radically changed after its accession to Russia.  The year of foundation of the city of Krasnoyarsk is called into question by many historians.  There is reason to believe that the first Russians appeared in these lands at the turn of the end of the 16th, beginning of the 17th centuries, but they did not linger here due to their small numbers and great remoteness from the prison, where administrative power and small detachments of archers and Cossacks were concentrated.  The foundation of Krasnoyarsk became possible only after the construction of the Mangazeysky prison, located on the Siberian river Taz, which opened the way to further east. </p><p>  These lands, in fact, were ownerless, practically not populated.  Different tribes roamed along them, statehood was absent.  The formation of settlements in Siberia dates back to earlier periods of time, at the time of the appearance of Russian pioneers in these regions, these lands were part of the principality of Ezersky nomadic tribes of the Yenisei Kyrgyz.  These places, rich in animals, in particular fur, fish, forest, berries, pine nuts, mushrooms, attracted Russian hunters and hunters here.  They appeared in these parts presumably at the end of the 16th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rumor about the riches of this region reached the Russian tsars.  Cossacks expeditions were outfitted for the Urals; in educated prison camps, the interests of the state were represented by the voivode sent here with squads of archers.  Their goal here was to approve Russian laws, collect taxes and tributes, the so-called yasak. </p>

    <h2>  The role of the Orthodox Church in the development of Siberia </h2><p>  The Russian Orthodox Church also played a large role in the <span>development of Siberia</span> .  Priests, monks walked with the troops of the Cossacks.  When the prison was founded, churches were immediately built in which services were held.  The church pursued two goals.  The first is the spread of Orthodoxy to the east, the second is a connection with the Motherland, with native roots, spiritual support. </p><p>  It was true faith that helped the pioneers to endure all hardships and hardships, strengthened them spiritually, making it clear that their hardships were not in vain.  The foundation of the city of Krasnoyarsk was no exception.  In each newly formed prison, a church was built.  During the development of Siberia, wild, almost uninhabited lands were crushed by monasteries.  Monastery settlements were built, which gradually grew into people who, voluntarily or by the will of fate, found themselves in these severe collapses. </p><p>  When developing Siberia, an indispensable law was in effect, under which a settlement with several houses should have a chapel, a village - a church, a city - a monastery.  It was the Orthodox ministers who marched with the first detachments of the Cossacks who helped to organize a motley flow of people moving through the Urals.  These were sovereign servants, explorers, immigrants, fugitive convicts, criminals, peasants fleeing serfdom and despair.  Having crossed the Urals, they felt free to understand permissiveness.  Only one thing united them and made them one people - faith in God. </p>

    <h2>  History.  Century XVII </h2><p>  In 1623, the Yenisei voivode Y. Khripunov sent his handler, nobleman A. Dubensky, to the places where Krasnoyarsk is now located, and at that time there were settlements of Cossacks who came here from Ketsky Ostrog, who were disturbed by the raids of local tribes.  They turned to the Yenisei governor for help.  Dubensky was instructed to choose a place for the construction of a prison, which would protect the lands of the Cossacks.  He chose a place, drew up a plan, according to which Krasnoyarsk was founded, and left for Moscow to approve it. </p><p>  Upon returning from Moscow with an approved plan, Dubensky led an expedition of three hundred Cossacks and went to the chosen place, where on the left bank of the Kachi River a prison was laid, called the Red Yar.  This place was below modern Krasnoyarsk, opposite Tatyshev Island, now part of the city.  Since then, it is customary to consider 1628 - the year of foundation of Krasnoyarsk. </p><p>  Ostrog Krasny Yar in 1631 became a county center.  After 28 years, a large prison was built, the purpose of which is to collect yasak.  Local peoples, consisting of nomadic tribes of Kyshtyms and Yenisei Kyrgyz, have already paid tribute to the Mongolian state of Altan Khan.  Therefore, they refused to pay the Russians.  But these lands were already on the territory of Russia, and by law they were required to pay tax to the treasury. </p><p>  Dissatisfied with this situation and instigated by the Mongols, units of the Kyrgyz khan Irenek besieged the prison twice in 1667 and 1679.  Already in 1690 the prison was granted the status of a city and its current name.  The foundation of the city of Krasnoyarsk is fraught with great difficulties and trials, nevertheless, it becomes the center of advancement of Russian explorers further to the east. </p>

    <h2>  From the history of the XVIII century </h2><p>  At the beginning of the century, 850 people lived in the city.  These were mainly Cossack families.  The foundation of Krasnoyarsk and its importance in the development of Siberia is great.  Its development was predetermined by the laying of the <span>Siberian tract, which</span> connected the city with Cannes, Achinsk and further with other cities of the country.  Despite the fact that its population increased to two thousand people, it remained a city of county significance. </p><p>  The city developed, enterprises appeared, in particular the Vasilyevsky iron smelter, schools and a public library were opened.  Big changes have occurred since the founding of Krasnoyarsk.  The year 1784 was marked by a strong fire.  He burned almost the whole city, only 30 houses remained.  The sent sergeant surveyor P. Moiseyev drew up a new linear layout of the city, St. Petersburg was taken as the basis.  Modern Krasnoyarsk begins with it. </p>

    <h2>  19th Century Gold Rush </h2><p>  Gold found on the Sukhoi Berikul River (Kemerovo Region) stirred up the whole of Siberia.  After the mines of merchants A. Ya. And F.I. Popov on the rivers Sukhoi Berikul, Wet Berikul and the small tributaries of Kiya began to give 16 pounds a year, prospectors pulled into the taiga.  By the way, gold mining is not a cheap pleasure at all.  Merchants of Popov spent more than 2 million rubles on just one exploration of deposits, money unprecedented at that time. </p><p>  Gold-bearing areas were almost the entire territory of Western and Eastern Siberia.  Gold was searched everywhere.  Krasnoyarsk was no exception.  He was washed on the Bugache River, Mount Athos, near the railway station, on the Pillars.  Krasnoyarsk shone with luxury at the show, incredible revelry, fights, theft and maps.  Nevertheless, gold mining gave good income to hundreds of people.  The levied taxes made it possible to develop the social sphere and infrastructure of the city.  But most of the capital left Krasnoyarsk. </p><p>  In addition to gold mining, the railroad played a huge role in the development of the city.  Rails for her were purchased in England.  From Scotland through the Arctic Ocean, the Kara Sea, they were delivered to Krasnoyarsk.  In 1913, the first power station was built in Krasnoyarsk, and a water supply system was installed.  The city was reputed to be the most beautiful and comfortable in Siberia. </p>

    <h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  During the Soviet Union, Krasnoyarsk was one of the largest cities in Siberia and the whole country.  In 1931, it becomes the center of the Krasnoyarsk Territory.  Schools, institutes, technical schools, hospitals, kindergartens, stadiums are being built and opened.  Much attention is paid to housing construction.  During the Great Patriotic War, many enterprises from central Russia were evacuated here.  They will serve as the basis for the development of industry of the region. </p><p>  For the most part, this is engineering and metalworking, the chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, mining, woodworking, the food industry, the production of building materials, and light industry.  In Krasnoyarsk there are 29 higher educational institutions, dozens of various schools, technical schools and colleges.  Nine research institutes of the <span>Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences,</span> 11 research institutes of other departments. </p>

    <h2>  Present </h2><p>  Post-Soviet times are characterized by a reduction in industrial production and the development of trade and services.  Hundreds of shops and supermarkets are being built and operate in the city; here you can buy almost everything, including orthopedic bases.  Krasnoyarsk noticeably changed and became more beautiful.  In recent years, new buildings, cultural and entertainment facilities have been built.  Hundreds of cafes and restaurants are open. </p><p>  But it is still a hard worker city.  And Krasnoyarsk is a city of students, there are more than 150 thousand of them, 124 thousand schoolchildren should be added to them.  There are all types of transport in the city: rail, road (P 255 Sibir, M 54 Yenisei, P 409 Yenisei Trakt), water, air (Emelyanovo, Cheremshanka airports), metro. </p>
