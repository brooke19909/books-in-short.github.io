    <h2>  Method number 1: playing cards </h2><p>  Our grandfathers and grandmothers knew well about how to learn dates from history, literally in a few evenings.  To do this, they cut out rectangles from paper, somewhat similar to playing cards.  On one side they wrote the key date, and on the other - the events that accompanied it.  It is noteworthy that already at the stage of preparation, our brain begins to remember selected historical dates and events, as it unconsciously draws its attention to them. </p><p>  As for the rectangles themselves, they are laid out on any convenient surface with the numbers facing up.  When everything is ready, you should begin to study the material written on them.  To do this, take the card and read aloud the text indicated on its reverse side.  Then put it in place, only this time with the letters up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This procedure is repeated until all the cards are upside down.  Then you need to rest for several hours, and then again start processing the material.  After 5-6 repetitions, the dates will be fully fixed in the human mind, and with them the events that were attached to them. </p><h2>  Method number 2: mind games </h2><p>  Psychologists know how to learn history as accurately as possible.  They have a special technique called The Mind Game.  Its essence lies in the fact that a person creates in his head stable images and pictures associated with the material he studies.  Simply put, fantasizes on a given topic. </p><p>  Suppose you need to remember the key points of the blockade of Leningrad.  To do this, <span>imagine yourself</span> as an ordinary soldier, surrounded by invaders.  Try to survive all those emotions that the Soviet military experienced at that difficult time.  What orders did the authorities receive from him?  How long did his squad wait for reinforcements?  How rejoiced that the enemy‚Äôs ring was broken? </p><p>  This technique will tie your memories, even false ones, to real dates and numbers, which will later help you remember all of them.  True, to implement this technique you need a good fantasy, which, unfortunately, not all are endowed with. </p>

    <h2>  Method number 3: visualization </h2><p>  However, then the question arises of how to learn history for those who cannot create believable images in their heads.  In this case, you can take advantage of those fantasies that already exist in the real world.  That is, open a browser and look for documentaries on history, archival photos, drawings, and so on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Looking through them, a person will begin to gradually remember the material that they contain in themselves.  Indeed, vision is one of the best mechanisms for absorbing information from the environment.  Especially when this process occurs in complete solitude and concentration. </p><h2>  Method number 4: reference point </h2><p>  Studying dates, you need to follow the order of calculus.  That is, it is impossible to learn the chronology of events, jumping on it like crazy.  Therefore, before you begin to study the material, find a common reference point for all events.  Then slowly ‚Äúgo‚Äù up the years, counting in your head how much time has passed from the ‚Äúplace‚Äù of dispatch. </p><p>  However, this method is only good in situations where you need to study a specific time period.  When it comes to an entire era, here the reference point is unlikely to help synchronize all events. </p>

    <h2>  Method number 5: own history book </h2><p>  How much can you learn the history of the whole world?  A month, two, a year or more?  In truth, it is impossible to learn absolutely all historical events.  And one will have to come to terms with this, as the nature of man is to blame.  However, remembering the key dates and events of world history is quite possible. </p><p>  To do this, you need to have a special notebook, preferably 96 sheets.  It will need to make brief historical notes for each individual era.  Over time, you will have your own history book, revealing the formation of the world order.  At the same time, it will be written in a language that is understandable to you, which subsequently will help to study it from cover to cover. </p>
