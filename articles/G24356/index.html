    <p>  Riyadh (Riyadh, pictured above) is a modern city, whose name translates as "gardens".  It was founded on the site of a settlement captured by ibn Saud.  30 km from Riyadh is Diraya, the first capital of the kingdom.  This is the most important place of the country from an archaeological point of view.  Diraya was founded back in 1446.  At the end of the 17th century, it reached the peak of its development, and in 1818 it was destroyed.  Today, there are many ruins that are actively being restored.  Among them, you can see the following <span>attractions of Saudi Arabia:</span> several mosques, palaces, as well as the old city wall. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  East region </h2><p>  The eastern region of the state lies along the coast of the Persian Gulf.  Within its borders, there are cities such as Al Khobar, Dahran (Ez Zahran), Al Jubail and Al Hofuf.  It was in the eastern part of the country that oil was first discovered, which today plays a very important role in the state‚Äôs economy.  This happened in the 1930s.  The cities of Al Khobar and Dammam were just small fishing villages before the oil riot began.  Dahran was completely absent. </p><h2>  Dammam </h2>

The main attractions of the city are a modern business center, as well as an impressive coastal cliff.  The latter in Saudi Arabia is called the Cornish ("cornice"). </p><h2>  Al Khobar </h2><p>  The city of Al Khobar also appeared on the map thanks to oil.

    <p>  In the center of Mecca is the Kaaba (photo of it is presented above).  This is a cube-shaped building located in the heart of the Sanctuary Mosque, the most visited in the world.  The Kaaba is shrouded in a black veil and centuries-old history.  According to the Qur'an, this is one of the main places where pilgrims should gather during the Hajj.  The Qur'an also states that this is the first building that people built to worship God.  It should be said that the Kaaba is a very unusual building.  Every pilgrim seeks to take a photo of her.  But this building is not only remarkable for its appearance.  In one of its corners is mounted the Black Stone, which, according to Muslim tradition, was once in paradise. </p><p>  Above Mecca, in the mountains, at an altitude of about 2 thousand meters above sea level, is located at Taif.  This is the summer <span>capital of Saudi Arabia,</span> where there is free access for non-Muslims. </p><h2>  Medina </h2><p>  Medina - the "brilliant" or "enlightened city" - is located 950 km west of Riyadh and 490 km northeast of Mecca.  Medina is the second holy city for Muslims and the first of those that followed the precepts of the prophet.  It attracts many pilgrims.  Unfortunately, this city is currently closed to non-Gentiles. </p>

    <p>  Masjid al-Nabawi (its other name is the Mosque of the Prophet) is a very famous and beautiful <span>mosque in Medina.</span>  It is the second shrine in Islam after the Forbidden Mosque located in Mecca.  Masjid al-Nabawi is the burial place of Muhammad.  During his lifetime, the first mosque was built here.  Subsequent rulers decorated and expanded the shrine.  Under the Dome of the Prophet (Green Dome) is the grave of Muhammad.  The exact date of its construction is unknown, however, the description of this dome is found in manuscripts of the early 12th century. </p><h2>  Jeddah </h2><p>  Jeddah is the most important industrial, commercial and political center of the region.  In addition, it is the main port of the Red Sea.  Jeddah is the gateway for many pilgrims, the most cosmopolitan city in Saudi Arabia.  In Obir, 50 km north of it, there is a good water resort.  The complexes Sheraton Abhur, Sands, Al Nakheel Village, Crystal Resort, Durrat Al-Arus are known not only for their high level, but also because of the significant contribution they made to the conservation of fauna and flora of the Red Sea, especially coral reefs. </p><h2>  Red sea </h2>

    <p>  The Red Sea itself is a true paradise for lovers of water recreation.  It houses one of the largest coral reef systems in the world, including approximately 200 species of coral.  At the same time, they are not so popular with divers as resorts in Egypt located on the opposite bank, so you will remember for a long time the rest in Saudi Arabia.  In Jeddah, as well as in the resort towns of the coast, all components of the tourist infrastructure are well developed.  There are many hotels and retail outlets.  The abundance of excursions and unforgettable experiences offers tourists Saudi Arabia.  The sea is one of the reasons why you should visit this country. </p><h2>  Southwest region </h2><p>  This area is also known as Asir.  It got its name from the mountains located here (Asir).  The southwest of the kingdom belongs to the Rift Valley.  This is a very interesting geological formation, there are many high mountains.  Near the city of Abha, the capital of the region, is Mount Jebel Sauda, ‚Äã‚Äãthe highest point of the southwest (3133 m).  In Asira there are also many gorges and tectonic hollows, a large amount of greenery, which is facilitated by the temperature, somewhat lower compared to other regions.  Even Aelius Gallus mentioned these lands in his Roman chronicles (25 BC) as the Land of Incense.  By the way, the Romans failed to capture her.  Yes, and Saudi Arabia, these lands entered only in 1922, up to this period remaining an independent kingdom. </p><p>  These territories are quite different from the rest of the state in terms of architecture and customs, which is explained by their proximity to Yemen.  The cornice is the most characteristic detail of the local buildings, preventing the erosion of the clay walls of houses during rains.  This element of architecture is simply unthinkable for dry Saudi Arabia. </p><h2>  Abha </h2><p>  The capital of Asira is Abha.  It is the coolest city in Saudi Arabia.  Thanks to the beautiful scenery and the abundance of greenery, it has become a popular resort.  The Shad Palace, which was built in 1927 as the residence of King Abdel Aziz, has been preserved here.  Abha was reopened in 1987 after recovery.  Today it is a regional museum, which is open from Saturday to Thursday, admission is free. </p><h2>  Al soda </h2><p>  East of Abha, 45 kilometers away, the magnificent landscapes of Al Soda begin.  These are sheer mountains, narrow gorges, huge cliffs, green peaks and turquoise waters of the sea.  A little south is Asir National Park, which is one of the best in the state. </p><h2>  Farasan </h2><p>  Modern Saudi Arabia is not only a desert with camels, historical buildings, Islamic shrines and beach vacations.  Nature lovers will surely appreciate several national parks.  In the very southwest of Saudi Arabia, 40 km west of Jizan, there is a <span>group of</span> Farasan <span>islands</span> .  This archipelago consists of 84 coral and sand islands.  Farasan was chosen by the birds that chose it for breeding.  Here live seabirds (approximately 87 species), dugongs, gazelles, as well as sea turtles.
