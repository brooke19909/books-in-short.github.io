It has been made since pagan times, so today traditions are practically not respected.  Some modern girls still make a doll with their own hands.  It is very easy to do. </p><h2>  Amulets history </h2><p>  To understand how to make a diaper doll and use it correctly, you need to know the manufacturing rules and other important nuances.  First, let's look at the history of this amulet. </p>

    <p>  Some sources say that the oldest woman in the family used to twist the chrysalis when the family was informed about the pregnancy.  Like all amulets, it was done without a face, so that the evil spirit would not inspire. </p><p>  According to another version, the expectant mother did the twisting at the very end of pregnancy.  First, the chrysalis was left next to the woman in childbirth in order to facilitate the birth of the child.  After the diaper was transferred to the cradle so that it warms the newborn and protects it from the evil eye.  For the most part this concerned children with birth injuries.  With the advent of Christianity, the amulet began to be cleaned immediately after baptism and stored next to the baptismal shirt.  So the doll continued to protect the baby. </p><p>  There was another rite in which the diaper participated.  She was put on her knees to a young wife who moved after her wedding to her husband's house.  It was believed that this way a girl receives maternal strength.  They also used a diaper doll if the baby did not appear in the house for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How was the diaper made? </h2><p>  For twisting, they took fabric from old sheets and clothes of the mother or father of the child.  It was believed that the worn materials had a special tribal force, which was transmitted to the baby.  Therefore, nothing new was used for amulets. </p>

    <p>  The size of the pupa should be so small that it fits in the handle of the newborn.  In the manufacture of the amulet, the craftswomen reproduced three components of man.  This is the head, body and navel, which is the vital center.  The same is recommended to be repeated in their modern crafts. </p><p>  In ethnographic museums there are variants of amulets made of fabric, wood, straw and bones.  That is, you could take any natural material as a basis, and then dress it like a baby. </p><h2>  When to make a talisman? </h2><p>  There are several important things to keep in mind when creating a diaper.  The doll needs to be done with the right attitude, because not only the details of the amulet are wound, but also the fate of the creator, his loved ones.  It is also necessary to form an image and set a goal.  That is, you should decide what the doll will help its owner, what tasks it should solve (cure, reconcile, bring good luck and so on). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To create a diaper, it is important to choose the right day.  To protect family well-being, it‚Äôs better to wind the doll on the full moon.  To turn away from problems and diseases, the amulets are made during the waning moon.  At the same time, you cannot make a chrysalis on Friday, when Makosh reigns, and on Sunday, the day of Rod. </p>

    <h2>  Rules for creating swaddling clothes </h2><p>  It is believed that the best charm-motanka is one that is made by one's own hands.  Use only natural materials (fabrics and threads).  Ideally, it is better to take pieces of old but beloved clothing of older relatives.  This may be the outfit of mom, dad, grandfather or grandmother, in which something significant and good happened to them. </p><p>  Begin and end the swaddling doll must be on the same day.  Otherwise, the protection will be interrupted, instead of a talisman, a negatively charged little thing will turn out. </p><p>  It is important to carry out motanka without any knots (except for the navel area).  It is believed that this is a symbol of birth, a place bandaged for a future life.  Making it, the creator of the doll must make a cherished desire by speaking it out loud.  Nodules on the hands are allowed, but only if they are made separately and only then screwed to the body. </p><p>  In the process of winding, no cutting or stabbing tools should be used.  Otherwise, you can make a hole or cut off fate.  For this reason, the dolls did all the decor on skirts and aprons in advance. </p>

    <h2>  Materials for the doll </h2><p>  The pelenashka is the first chrysalis and a talisman for man, so it must be done with great care.  Next, we present a master class "DIY doll diaper".  Consider what is needed for its manufacture: </p><ol><li>  White fabric (25 to 25 centimeters). </li><li>  A piece of bright cloth (20 to 20 centimeters) for a diaper. </li><li>  Colored material (15 by 15 centimeters) for the scarf. </li><li>  A narrow satin ribbon with a length of about 30-40 centimeters. </li><li>  The red thread (it should be exactly red, the red color has always been considered protective, therefore such a thread carries protective power and is able to protect; in Russia, all elements were connected with natural red thread in ritual dolls). </li><li>  Foam rubber or cotton wool to fill the head (optional). </li></ol><h2>  Swaddle doll: master class </h2><p>  Consider the manufacturing process of this amulet. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with the base for the chrysalis.  To do this, simply fold the white cloth into a tube.  Some needlewomen recommend stuffing it with rammed cotton so that the body has a more solid form.  Or you can fold a white canvas into a triangle twice.  After that, you need to determine the center (the crown of the doll's head) and stuff it with cotton or foam rubber. </p>

    <p>  Wrap the finished roll with red thread, but do not cut. </p><p>  Now take care of the scarf.  Fold the colored fabric in half diagonally to make a triangle.  Tie it on your head and tie it with a thread.  Correct the ends of the canvas, forming a figure.  Fasten everything with a thread and bite it. </p><p>  Wrap the doll‚Äôs body in a diaper.  Tips the fabric so that they do not peek out.  Tie it with a ribbon, making a knot in the middle.  Be sure to hide the tips.  That's all, a diaper doll made by yourself! </p><p>  Some craftswomen in the process of making a talisman wrap a walnut in their heads, and in the middle put three grains of buckwheat.  So the chrysalis becomes a three-jingle (rattle), which drives away evil spirits with its noise. </p><h2>  Embroidery Making </h2><p>  Do not forget that outfits are also a kind of amulet.  Therefore, great attention should be paid to embroidery, which will decorate the apron or skirt of a motanka.  Each pattern has its own meaning: </p>
