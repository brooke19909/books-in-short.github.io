Moscow met this establishment very well.  It is not surprising that in a relatively short period, the restaurant topped the metropolitan lists of the best complexes.  More information about this club can be found in the material. </p><h2>  Road idea </h2><p>  The unique establishment began its work in late 2007.  Famous in Moscow restaurateur Dmitry Gaude worked on this project.  The wealthy and businessmen Dan Rapoport and Dominic Gualtier have invested.  From the beginning of construction, the authors were assigned one task - to create a stylish, luxurious and atmospheric establishment that people with a refined taste would like. </p>

    <p>  In order to bring the idea to life, an abandoned metropolitan factory was chosen.  Thus, the Soho club (Moscow) appeared.  The address of this complex: Savvinskaya embankment, house 12. </p><p>  It should be noted that the owners managed to make the place a unique place.  When world-famous stars tour in the Russian capital, they very often stop at this establishment.  In particular, among the guests of the club at one time were Hollywood actors Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Vin Diesel and other celebrities.  Therefore, one should not be very surprised if a world star will rest near your table in the club. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stylized areas </h2><p>  The first thing that strikes the imagination of visitors is the exclusive interior.  Only the most expensive types of wood, marble and stucco molding were chosen for decoration.  The pride of the place is a handmade chandelier decorated <span>with Swarovski stones.</span>  It is located on the ground floor. </p><p>  Many people who hear about this institution for the first time are sure that Soho is a club.  Moscow is known for more than one disco.  But, besides the fact that you can dance in this complex, they also provide delicious food and offer an interesting, vibrant program. </p><p>  The highlight of the institution is that the room is divided into 5 sites, each of which with its own style and character.  Each zone functions separately. </p><p>  It can be noted that it welcomes visitors to the Bar Room.  This part is located on the ground floor.  It always plays light, international music (as noted by customers).  In this room, staff will accommodate up to 50 people.  You can relax at a comfortable mirror table, near which there are large soft armchairs in the British style.  Visitors note that while relaxing in this zone, you are transported from Russia to England of the <span>Victorian era.</span> </p>

    <h2>  A corner for everyone </h2><p>  Soho has a lot to offer (the club).  Moscow and the inhabitants of the capital are accustomed to chic and wealth.  The second and third tier is called the Dining Room.  It can immediately accommodate more than 150 customers.  This area is chosen for large banquets.  A sophisticated English atmosphere reigns here.  There is a library and a fireplace. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next zone is the night club itself.  The site is equipped with the latest technology.  Therefore, music is always high-quality and clean.  Another feature of the fourth floor is the stage.  If necessary, it turns into a platform for a show or a track for defile.  Business people say that at this level you can hold both parties and corporate meetings. </p><p>  Pool Terrace is the roof of the building.  It is covered with a dome, therefore summer reigns in this territory all year round.  There is a pool.  On each side there is a magnificent view of the capital.  The interior is complemented by light <span>wicker chairs,</span> wide sofas and tropical plants. </p>

    <h2>  Audience Features </h2><p>  Soho is a <span>club (Moscow),</span> which positions itself as an expensive institution for wealthy and prestigious clients.  However, many visitors to this restaurant declare that the staff treats all people the same way, regardless of the amount of money in a bank account.  As the guests of the complex advise, the main thing is to arrive in a decent form. </p><p>  At the entrance there is a very harsh security that does not let ladies and gentlemen drunk and poorly dressed.  Men are better off wearing classic trousers, a shirt, and a jacket.  Women - in modest beautiful dresses.  Therefore, both business persons and ordinary students can have a good rest and have fun in this institution.  So say visitors. </p><p>  However, there is one nuance that anyone who plans to visit the Soho club (Moscow) should know about.  Prices in the institution are quite high.  In addition, the order must be at least 4000 rubles.  They can relax in the restaurant, but drunk and inadequate customers are asked to leave the institution.  Therefore, as guests say, the audience here is always normal. </p>

    <h2>  Professionalism of staff </h2><p>  In addition to the unique interior and exceptional atmosphere, visitors are impressed by the variety of cuisine.  You can order here Japanese, Russian, Chinese and European dishes.  Guests love the fact that they will bring both red caviar and king prawns with sauce.  The kitchen has some of the best chefs in the capital.  Prices are adequate for this type of institution.  For example, Caesar Chicken salad costs about 550 rubles. </p><p>  Of the minuses that the exclusive guests found, a small parking lot can be highlighted.  When a world-class star arrives with a concert, it is almost impossible to leave the car in the parking lot. </p><p>  Very pleasantly stands out among other expensive institutions "Soho" (club).  Moscow and its wealthy guests are accustomed to high, professional service.  This complex also boasts.  Almost all visitors note that employees are very attentive, but not intrusive.  Security cope with obligations perfectly and does not allow yourself rudeness in relation to customers. </p><h2>  Minor flaws </h2><p>  Visitors are especially pleased with the fact that the institution is not pathos.  Both a simple student and a world star can feel like a necessary and welcome guest.  Politicians, businessmen and foreigners often relax in the club.  In addition to entertainment, it can provide the club and the necessary acquaintances. </p><p>  <span>Opening hours</span> : daily from 12:00 until the last client.  On certain days, some floors are closed for general cleaning.  Therefore, the room is always clean and fresh. </p><p>  Of course, there are people who are sure that the restaurant should open earlier.  However, a big plus is that breakfast is served in the institution regardless of the time of day. </p>
