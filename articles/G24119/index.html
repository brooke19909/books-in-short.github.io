Where to spend the night on the M4 highway</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The condition of roads in Russia is a separate topic that is familiar to all motorists.  Somewhere they are better, somewhere worse, but overall the picture is not too bright.  However, there are some sections that are simply created in order to rush with the breeze.  One of these is the federal <span>highway M4 Moscow</span> - Voronezh.  This greatly facilitates the movement between cities, which means that the number of motorists on it will always be quite large.  And since the distances have to be covered very decent, night rest becomes relevant.  Therefore, motels are located along the entire length of the route.  The M4 is a busy freeway, especially familiar to travelers. </p><h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><p>  It is impossible to list all hotels and pensions; more than 1540 km is the length of the M4 highway.  Motels are located every few kilometers, so travelers will not have a problem with an overnight stay.  To reduce the number of frames to one article, as well as give the traveler real guidance, we will limit the choice to the following criteria: availability of parking, free cancellation option, proximity to the highway and comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="motels m4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1941733.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Moscow region </h2><p>  We will consider it in separate sections, due to the enormous length of the M4.  We begin to consider the motels directly from the capital.  And the first on our list is the Yamskoy Hotel.  It is located in the village of Yam, st.  Postal, d.17, Domodedovo.  Of the benefits include spacious rooms and free parking.  In addition, the location itself is very convenient for the traveler.  He stands right on the M4 highway.  Motels are also more distant from it, but they are not very convenient for a person who is tired of the road. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another plus is the location near the airport, so it is perfect for air travelers.  Of the minuses - the rooms are quite noisy, this can easily be explained by the proximity of a busy highway. </p><h2>  Hotel Don </h2><p>  This cozy hotel is located 13 km from MKAD.  The hotel is located on the third floor of the road service complex.  The building is equipped with an elevator, so you do not have to lift personal belongings manually.  All rooms are equipped with modern furniture, household appliances, always have a bathroom.  Rooms include double, triple and quadruple rooms.  The cost of living starts from 2500 rubles.  Hotel Don provides round-the-clock room reservation service, which is very convenient.  On the ground floor there is a cafe.  In addition, the complex includes a car service, which is extremely convenient for those traveling by car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="falcon deserts" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1941732.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pension "Sokolova Deserts" </h2><p>  And we move on.  Stupino is 79 km from Domodedovo Airport.  When you reach it, you can relax in a great place.  This is not just a hotel, but a recreation center amidst a pine grove.  In addition to comfortable rooms, guests are also offered ski equipment, so you will have something to do in your spare time.  It offers wooden cottages and cozy rooms with a fridge, satellite TV and a private bathroom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sokolova Pustyn offers its guests to visit a cozy dining room and bar, as well as a mini market.  There is a games room with billiards, table tennis and darts.  On-site activities include fishing and hiking.  The cost of living is from 2200 per day. </p><h2>  Tula region </h2><p>  And we continue to consider roadside hotels and move further along the highway.  At the 143 kilometer you will find the Slavyansky Motel.  The cost of living is from 2500 rubles per day.  Convenient conditions for parents with children.  Toddlers under 7 years stay free of charge without a separate bed.  True, if you book not a full house, but a separate room, you will have to use the toilet in the hallway.  Of the benefits, tourists note the courtesy of the staff.  The cost of living can be reduced due to the lack of hot water and other inconveniences. </p><h2>  Hotel Ryabinushka </h2><p>  At 238 km of the highway is another cozy roadside hotel in the suburbs of Boroditsk.  The cozy complex includes 15 rooms with all amenities.  Each of them is equipped with modern furniture and high-quality plumbing, a TV.  The hotel has a very good cafe where visitors can order a full meal.  Truckers stop here quite often.  They are attracted by low prices and excellent food quality.  In addition, there is a car wash and laundry, shower and tire service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="motel glade" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1941727.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Motels on the M4 in the Voronezh region </h2><p>  Even a novice driver can easily drive 300 km in a day, so let's move a little further along the highway, up to 518 km.  Here is a small hotel "Maximum".  It is located just 20 meters from the motorway, but the perfect soundproofing allows you to relax in your room.  It offers individually decorated rooms with air conditioning and a large TV.  All apartments have a private bathroom.  Free parking is provided, as well as laundry and ironing services. </p><h2>  Grand hotel </h2><p>  The cost of living is from 3100 per day.  Looking at the motels on the M4, I really want to highlight this small and comfortable hotel.  It is designed for only 10 rooms.  And the choice here is from the simplest to the most luxurious, which is surprising for such a tiny hotel.  Private parking is available and free Wi-Fi is available throughout.  The furniture is very good, the plumbing is new.  Reception is open 24 hours a day.  Of the minuses - the lack of breakfast, you need to look for where to eat.  Given this point, the price may seem quite high.  But the service is at its best. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roadside hotels" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1941726.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel "At Mikhalych" </h2><p>  And also the second one, called ‚ÄúAt Mikhalych 2‚Äù, is the motels on the M4 highway, which are located very close by.  Both of them are located at 520 km.

    <h2>  Hotel "Okolitsa" </h2><p>  It is located at 524 km, in the village of Podkletnoye, on Solnechnaya street, house 1B.  There are 11 rooms in total, each of which can become a home for you for one or two days.  They are equipped with air conditioning and a TV, as well as cozy furniture.  The attentive attitude of the staff and comfortable booking conditions complete the picture.  Only 30 minutes separates the hotel from the center of Voronezh, but here you will not be bothered by the bustle of a large metropolis. </p><p>  Be sure to pay attention to this hotel if you are traveling on <span>the M4 motorway.</span>  <span>Motels, hotels</span> are there at every step, but not everyone is ready to provide the same conditions.  It has its own laundry room, well equipped.  Rooms are cleaned daily and smoking is not allowed on site.  The cafe will delight you with an abundance of traditional, Russian dishes and a varied menu.  You can purchase ready-made meals on the road. </p><h2>  Rostov region </h2><p>  Motels of the M4 highway are a topic for the whole treatise, since there are really a lot of them.  Even strict selection will not allow them to be reduced to an amount that can fit in the size of the article.  Next on the list is the ‚ÄúEurasian Business Center‚Äù, which is located 2 km from Ostrovsky Park.  It features a restaurant and free parking. </p><p>  The cost starts from 600 rubles per day, the reception is open around the clock.

A huge park, which is located very close, offers opportunities for walking. </p><h2>  Meridian South </h2><p>  It is located at 1040 km of the M4-Don highway.  The motel offers its guests to stay in comfortable rooms, one-room or two-room.  The cost of 3900 rubles per day.  But if you take into account the tourist orientation of this regional center, then the price is quite reasonable.  The entire territory is under video surveillance, there is a large area with landscaping for walking and recreation. </p><p>  The cafe offers its guests a wide selection of dishes of European and Russian cuisine.  The cafe is open daily from 06:00 to 02:00.  Guests are served delicious breakfast.  In summer, there is an open veranda.  Children under 4 years old are accommodated for free, and up to 6 years old with an extra charge of 300 rubles.  Of the minuses can be noted underfloor heating.

    <h2>  Hotel Rodina </h2><p>  At 1076 km, 10 km from Rostov-on-Don, in the vicinity of the Aksai district, this hotel is located.  To visit it, you need to drive off about 100 m away from the highway.  Elegant, three-story building with natural stone trim, made in the German style, it attracts attention from afar.

    <h2>  Hotel Triumph </h2><p>  There is free parking here, and you do not need to reserve a place in advance.  Children under 12 years old can sleep for free with you.  The hotel stands very close to the highway, but the feeling that you are far beyond the city.  It features a free bath and a pool.  Of the minuses - brunch, poor internet and little space in the dining room may not be enough.  The hotel is not for living, but from the category spent the night and left.  However, the price is not too high, from 2700 rubles. </p><p>  Barbecue facilities, a sauna and a hammam are at guests' disposal, as well as a restaurant.  Free private parking is available on site.

And with the end of the warm season, the influx of cars does not drop too much.  Therefore, the hotel business is booming.  Today we examined only a small part of the motels and boarding houses that are ready to provide travelers with an overnight stay.
