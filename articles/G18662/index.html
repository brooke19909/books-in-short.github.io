    <h2>  We call the operator </h2><p>  So, how to disable the "Highway" service?  Beeline offers its subscribers some fairly simple options that are sure to please.  For example, a universal approach to solving a problem is to call the operator. </p><p>  What do you have to do?  Regardless of which "Highway" you have connected, just dial 0611 on the phone and wait for an answer.  The main thing is that you communicate with a live operator, and not with a robot voice.  As soon as they answer you, let us know that you would like to refuse "Highway" and give the phone number.  Please note that you may be asked for passport data.  They are needed for identification. </p><p>  After the operator makes sure that you are not a scammer, he will form a request and inform you about it.  You can say goodbye and wait until a message arrives informing you of the successful rejection of services.  Nothing difficult, right?  Now we know the first way to turn off the Highway service.  Beeline, however, can offer many more solutions.  They depend, of course, on your specific tariff plan.  That is, what kind of package you have connected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Week free </h2><p>  For example, let‚Äôs start with you when ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù, when buying a tariff plan, allows you to use the Internet for free for a week.  And with all this, we have daily billing.  To refuse services in our case at the moment it is worth paying attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the highway beeline service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126285.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How to disable the "Highway 1GB (weekly free)" service?  In fact, it‚Äôs not so difficult to bring the idea to life.  You just have to form a small request and ‚Äúcall‚Äù it.  Dial 7770 on your mobile device and click on the "Call" button.  A couple of minutes of waiting - and you will see a message in which they write something like "Request made. Expect SMS with the result."  As soon as you receive the next letter, you can rejoice at your achievements. </p><h2>  Highway Standard </h2><p>  We move on.  How to disable the "Highway" service with daily billing?  This is a standard package for 1 GB of Internet traffic.  In this case, no matter how strange it may sound, the actions are slightly different. </p><p>  If you use the simplest and smallest Highway package, you should dial 0674117410 and call after this for this combination.  Internet will turn off.  In addition, each subscriber is able to use the USSD request.  It looks like this: * 115 * 030 #.  We send a request and wait for a response. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Monthly fee </h2><p>  Please note that Beeline offers its subscribers a fee that is debited once a month.  Honestly, in this case, to abandon the "Highway 1 GB" is also very easy.  There are two tricks that will help in the implementation of the task. </p><p>  Firstly, as in the previous case, you can call 0674117410. After this action, the Internet will turn off.  But there is also a USSD command.  She is not the same as she was the last time.  Now, to reject the Highway package on Beeline with a volume of 1 GB with a monthly payment, you must write * 115 * 040 # and click on the call button.  Not so difficult as it might seem at first glance.  By the way, disconnecting from Beeline services is a free process.  You won‚Äôt be charged. </p><h2>  Highway 3 GB </h2><p>  Another package that can be connected is the 3 GB Highway.  More precisely, already by 4. Recently, Beeline has increased the volume of traffic on this service.  Thus, if you are interested in how to disable the "Highway 3GB" service, the answer cannot be found.  But the rejection of a package of 4 gigabytes is possible. </p><p>  What can be done for this?  First, call the numbers we already know.  We are talking about the operator number or combination 0674117410. By the way, it is also used in all other Internet packages of the Highway line.  There are also so-called USSD commands. </p>

    <p>  Pay attention to what specific tariff you are staying at.  If the <span>monthly fee is</span> debited from the account daily, then you must dial * 115 * 060 #.  Otherwise, you will have to generate a request of the form * 115 * 050 #.  After that, click on the call button and wait for the message with the result.  Easy and simple. </p><h2>  Golden mean </h2><p>  The next option is an 8 GB Highway.  It is this volume that is now provided to the owners of the third type of package of the Internet line from Beeline.  Some users are still interested in how to disable the 5 GB Highway service.  But the answer is never found.  And that is understandable.  After all, now we are talking not about 5 gigabytes of traffic, but about 8. As already mentioned, Beeline has increased the limit recently. </p><p>  Well, as in all the above examples, you can use either a special team, or the phone numbers already known to us.  On "Highway 8 GB" * 115 * 070 # is dialed to refuse the use of services.  The peculiarity of this tariff is the absence of any division in the writing off of a monthly fee.  And this fact pleases many. </p><h2>  More and more </h2><p>  There are two more tariff plans related to the Highway line.  For example, especially active subscribers connect themselves with an option with 12 GB of traffic.  But what if you have to refuse the offer?  <span>How to disable the Internet</span> service "Highway" for 12 GB of traffic with a high-speed connection? </p>

    <p>  For this, the USSD combination is suitable.  And, of course, the action can be carried out by dialing 0611, as well as 0674117410. Please note that when connecting "Highway 12 GB", you, too, as in the case of 8 gigabytes of traffic, use only one combination to independently refuse the Internet package .  This is * 115 * 080 #.  We dial it, click on the subscriber‚Äôs call button and wait for an SMS notification from the operator with the result of your actions. </p><h2>  To the maximum </h2><p>  So we have studied almost all the methods that will help answer how to disconnect the Highway service from the Beeline company.  As you can see, there is nothing special about them.  Just USSD requests and calls to the operator for certain combinations.  The last option that can only be offered to subscribers is the Highway 20 GB package.  It also lacks the choice of charging a monthly fee.  So, we will be offered only one request for the implementation of the task set today. </p><p>  What to do if you need to abandon the "Highway 20 GB" tariff plan?  To do this, dial on your mobile device a combination of the type * 115 * 090 # and click on "Call".  A couple of minutes of waiting - and all problems are resolved. </p><p>  In principle, these are all options that you can imagine.  Nevertheless, some subscribers advise a couple more tricks.  For example, a personal visit to the Beeline office.  You can say that you want to disable "Highway" on a specific number, prove that the SIM card is issued for you, and then wait a while.  An office employee will fill out an application and ask you to wait for a message with the result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the 3gb highway service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126290.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition, some claim that it is quite convenient to use the Internet to implement our task.  Go to the official Beeline website, log in to your Personal Account and find the Services there.  In the "Internet" section, select the "Disable" function opposite the "Highway".  Enter the confirmation code in the appropriate window (it will arrive on your mobile device in the form of SMS messages) and expect the result of processing the operation.  Perhaps this is all.  Now we know how to disable the Highway service on Beeline in all ways. </p>
