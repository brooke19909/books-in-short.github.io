Buyers can choose for themselves an option not only suitable for the functionality, but also for the budget.  Of course, the larger the assortment, the more difficult it is to make a choice. </p><p>  It often happens that the equipment has served its purpose and requires immediate replacement.  Then the buyer does not have time to monitor manufacturers and models.  The consumer is trying to find an alternative that could last as long as possible.  In this situation, many prefer long-established manufacturers who have proven themselves in the market on the positive side.  Bosch is one such company.  And although the technology of this company is considered not a budget option, there are some models that are quite suitable for an average wallet.  A striking representative is the Bosch KGV36VW13R refrigerator. </p><h2>  A few words about the manufacturer </h2><p>  Surprisingly, at the beginning of 1886 no one could have thought that an ordinary engineer Robert Bosch would be able to create an empire for the production of refrigeration equipment and a number of other electronic devices.  The main distinguishing feature of the German company, which was born in Stuttgart, is the use of quality materials.  Today, Bosch is one of the sought-after and popular manufacturers, which is chosen for service by many consumers around the world. </p>

    <h2>  Key Features of the Bosch KGV36VW13R Model </h2><p>  In the photo there is a roomy, silent with convenient functionality representative of a popular manufacturer's company.  It is quite simple to operate, because it does not have a complicated setup.  The standard size of 60 x 60 x 180 allows you to install it in a small area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the refrigerator belongs to group A by the type of electricity consumption, this is a fairly economical option.  The Bosch KGV36VW13R refrigerator consumes no more than 350 kW per year. </p><p>  The total volume of 318 liters, of which 223 liters were allocated to the refrigerator compartment, and 95 liters were allocated to the freezer.  As for the freezer in <span>Bosch KGV36VW13R,</span> user <span>reviews</span> indicate its spaciousness.  In fact, few models with similar dimensions have such a useful volume.  For ease of storage, the space is divided into three compartments.  One of them is a shelf, and the other two are drawers.  The temperature is constant - 18 degrees.  It cannot be regulated.  It is possible to set only the ‚ÄúSuper Freeze‚Äù mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge bosch kgv36vw13r" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/1886408.jpg"></div>

Yes, this does not have to do.  The Bosch KGV36VW13R model uses a drip defrosting system with the new Low Frost technology, so that no ice crust is formed on the walls and the products are not ventilated.  Every 8-12 months, it is recommended to completely turn off and defrost the refrigerator. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Since this model is considered an economical option for home use, we can say that there are not a huge number of additional features.  However, for those who often freeze berries, greens, vegetables, meat or fish for long-term storage, there is superfrost.  The maximum freezing temperature is -24 degrees, so you can not worry about maintaining the quality of products in the Bosch KGV36VW13R refrigerator. </p><p>  User reviews also indicate the convenience of drawers in the freezer.  If necessary, you can completely get them (which is provided in the models of not every manufacturer).  This is quite convenient when loading a large number of products. </p><p>  Most experts as the main feature of the model note the fast freezing of products in both chambers, which is extremely important for perishable products. </p><p>  The Bosch KGV36VW13R model is ergonomic and has many additional compartments for arranging the entire storage system. </p><p>  It should be noted that with the doors closed and without power (in the event of an emergency shutdown), the model is able to retain accumulated cold for a long time.  Simplicity and quality are its main characteristics. </p><h2>  The presence or absence of the ability to change the location of the shelves </h2><p>  First of all, it is important to note that each shelf is made of shockproof glass, therefore it is able to withstand considerable weight.  According to user reviews, the Bosch KGV36VW13R refrigerator is ideal for those who like to store workpieces in small glass jars on the upper shelves of the refrigerator.  The upper compartment is just fit for this.  The distance between the shelf and the top wall of the refrigerator is the height of a 700 gram can.  In any case, all shelves of the refrigerator compartment can be changed if necessary. </p>

When the Bosch KGV36VW13R <span>refrigerator is</span> correctly <span>installed</span> during operation, it is practically inaudible.  This is a significant plus, especially for small apartments. </li><li>  The ability to rearrange the shelves of the refrigerator.  Thanks to this, a 3-liter jar or 5-liter pan can easily be placed on the lower shelf. </li><li>  Refrigerator "without handles."  For these purposes, recesses are provided on the doors.  This simplifies operation and eliminates the possible repair of replacing handles. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  High-quality plastic from which boxes and shelves are made.  This is a significant advantage, which allows you to save money on replacing drawers in the freezer (for example, like the Indesit or Ariston refrigerators). </li></ul><h2>  Model flaws </h2><p>  Some consumers note the following disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  If the refrigerator is not loaded uniformly during operation, a ‚Äúroar‚Äù may be heard.  But this problem is solved by the competent distribution of products in the chamber.  It is worth noting that such a problem is far from every consumer. </li><li>  The absence of the No Frost system indicates the need to defrost the freezer from time to time, as frost slowly settles on the walls of the unit, forming ice.  As a rule, it is recommended to defrost the refrigerator at least several times a year. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summarizing the above, we can conclude that this is a practical model of the refrigerator, which qualitatively performs the basic functions of food storage and quick freezing.  In addition, the average price for it is 20-25 thousand rubles.  This is quite acceptable for many Russian families. </p>
