    <h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2><p>  So let's take a closer look at the beautiful city of Saki.  Where is it located?  This settlement is located on the Crimean peninsula, on the shore of the Kalamitsky Gulf.  The city of Saki is one of the oldest resorts on the Black Sea coast.  It got its name from three settlements - Tatar, Russian and German.  Today, the city is world famous for the treatment of various diseases with mud and water treatments. </p><h2>  Weather features </h2><p>  Saki is a resort town where tourists can experience the pleasure of a wonderful climate, consisting of sea and steppe.  The weather here is mostly sunny, there are very few rainy days.  <span>It is hot in summer,</span> but thanks to the winds from the sea, there is no stuffiness.  And the winter in this city is mild with rare frosts.  In addition, the air in Saki is saturated with fumes from the sea, mineral springs and <span>Saki Lake.</span>  Locals are proud of the above thermal springs, salt pond and arboretum park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="saki resort" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1354866.jpg" width="600"></div>

The most important and popular is the Saki complex.
