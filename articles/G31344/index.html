Tasks in mathematics, chronological tables on history ... But in vain.  After all, we ourselves have children who often ask for an answer to a seemingly insoluble question.  For example, a son or daughter will pester you and ask you to say what was the name of the city where the Franks defeated the Arabs.  Grade 6, the history of the Middle Ages is the first thing that comes to our mind.  After all, we were taught something similar.  But what about the details?  What is this place really and how was it?  Was the battle really there?  What is the significance of this event and why is it so popular that it got into crosswords and textbooks?  This story and other facts are summarized below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The city where the Franks defeated the Arabs 6 class" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/682845.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  A city in which the Franks defeated the Arabs.  6 letters in its name or 3? </h2><p>  The battle that occurred in 732 is called differently in monographs and historical chronicles.  School books often talk about the <span>Battle of Poitiers.</span>  What is the name of the city where the Franks defeated the Arabs (6 letters)?  This question is often found in crosswords on a historical topic.  In this case, we are also talking about Poitiers.  But if we look at historical sources, we will see that quite often this battle is called the Battle of Tours.  But the Arab chroniclers generally call it "the battle of the cohort of martyrs."  The exact location of the battle is not recorded in any document. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The name of the city whose Franks defeated the Arabs" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/682850.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The time is known.  What about the place? </h2><p>  Western European and Arab chroniclers claim that on October 10, 732, a battle took place between the forces of the Franks, led by Australian Mayor Karl Martell, and the Arabs from the Umayyad Caliphate.  The latter were led by the Governor-General of Al-Andalus Abdurrahman ibn Abdallah.  As you know, the Franks won this battle.  An Arab warlord was killed.  And Karl Martell became a very influential land owner in <span>Southern Europe.</span>  But what was the name of the city where the Franks defeated the Arabs?  Not a single chronicle gives us an exact answer to this question.  Let's understand it in more detail. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The Arab dynasty of Umawi, or Umayyads, possessed one of the most powerful armies in the world.  It was actually a huge empire, the lands of which stretched from the territory of modern Pakistan to the <span>Iberian Peninsula.</span>  Their main opponent in Europe was the kingdom of the Franks, which combined the lands of present-day Northern and Central France, parts of Germany and Holland.  Their leader Karl Martell dreamed of uniting the whole of Europe under his rule and turning it into an empire like Rome.  Between him and the Arabs was the independent duchy of Aquitaine.  Both forces tried to capture him and subjugate themselves, thereby changing the current balance in their favor.  Many historians believe that the city where the Franks defeated the Arabs became a battlefield, which determined the fate of all of Europe and even Christianity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The city where the Franks defeated the Arabs" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/682851.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The battlefield and its course </h2><p>  When the Umayyad troops began to invade southern Europe, the duke of Aquitaine, Ed, or Eudon, tried to deal with them on his own, but could not.  Then he turned to Carl Martell for help.  He agreed to help, but only on the condition that Aquitaine recognizes the supremacy of the Franks.  The Arabs did not pay attention to this.  Their commander believed that the Franks were wild <span>Germanic tribes</span> who did not know how to fight.  They underestimated the strength of the enemy, and this was one of the reasons for their defeat. </p><p>  The battlefield was chosen by Karl Martell himself.  He wanted his troops to stand on a hill covered with forest, and the Arabs would be the first to attack.  And he succeeded.  Therefore, the city from which the Franks defeated the Arabs was chosen by the mayor of Australia.  This area was halfway between Tours and Poitiers.  That is why historians call the battle by the name of one or the other city.  Winter was approaching, to which the Arabs were not ready.  <span>Karl Martell</span> waited a week to force them to attack on terms favorable to him, and at that time reinforcements approached him.  Therefore, when the Arabian cavalry began to tear up the forest area, its advantage was reduced to zero.  In addition, Karl managed by various rumors to sow panic in the ranks of the enemy, force many riders to retreat, surround the enemy commander and kill him.  So the battle of Tours (or Poitiers) was won. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The city in which the Franks defeated the Arabs 6 letters" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/682878.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Value </h2><p>  Traditionally, many historians believed that the city in which the Franks defeated the Arabs became iconic.  They believed that the battle of Poitiers reversed the history of Europe.  If Karl Martell had not stopped the Arabs, then Europe would have become Muslim, and there would have been no <span>Charlemagne empire</span> or modern civilization.  Another group of historians argues that the significance of this battle is overrated.  For example, Muslim chroniclers, although they recognize the defeat of their troops at Tours, nevertheless present this battle as an insignificant clash that did not particularly affect the further alignment of forces. </p><p>  Some modern historians believe that the Arab commander only wanted to plunder the rich monastery in Tours, and he had no far-reaching plans.  Therefore, the assertion that this battle saved Christian Europe is at least an exaggeration.  In any case, not a single chronicle brought to us the exact name of the city in which the Franks defeated the Arabs.  The only thing we know is that the battle took place at the confluence of two rivers, among forests and hills, between two cities. </p>
