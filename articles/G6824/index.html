    <h2>  Creative way </h2><p>  The party leadership did not see in this actress special reasons for pride.  Her heroines are deprived of the ideological propaganda that was necessary for the Soviet Union.  For example, the film "Ivan the Terrible", where she played, was marked by management.  All of his actors received awards.  Attention deprived only Lyudmila.  They say that Stalin himself crossed out her name from the list of applicants for the award. </p><p>  But she was not very worried about such problems Tselikovskaya Lyudmila Vasilievna.  The bibliography of this woman indicates that the awards for her were in second place.  First of all, she appreciated the opinion of the audience.  And the audience adored this lovely beauty. </p><p>  The paintings ‚ÄúGemini‚Äù, ‚ÄúJumper‚Äù, ‚ÄúForest‚Äù, ‚ÄúRestless Farm‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe Have Met Somewhere‚Äù with her in the lead role immediately became hits.  But throughout her life, the actress dreamed of a deep dramatic image, which she never managed to play.  The only tragic character is the nurse Zina from the picture "The Tale of a Real Man."  But this role was small, although touching. </p><p>  In total, the actress starred in 23 films.  Because of the comic characters that were offered to Lucy, she preferred the theater.  Therefore, in the last years of life, it was shot a little. </p>

    <h2>  Last hobby </h2><p>  Again she did not go to the registry office.  However, she lived in a civil marriage with her longtime friend Yuri Lyubimov.  The lovers studied together, and then played in the theater. </p><p>  When her successes were noted even at foreign festivals, Lyudmila Vasilievna Tselikovskaya received official recognition in her homeland.  The awards were crowned with the title of People's Artist.  It happened in 1963. </p><p>  Luda was very talented.  She independently studied English and was engaged in the translation of plays.

She herself staged productions and actively participated in the birth of the Taganka Theater. </p><p>  In 1975, the couple broke up.  Later, Lucy admitted that living with such a talented person was not easy for her. </p><p>  In the late 80s, a woman was found to have cancer.  The great actress died at 72.  Her life ended on July 4, 1992. </p><p>  Even a terrible disease, which the doctors did not report to her for a long time, did not break the woman.  She remained cheerful, kind and friendly to everyone.  And not because she didn‚Äôt want to upset her family, but because she did not know how to give up and be sad. </p><p>  Especially it opened to the audience on the stage.  Here she played both the main character of Shakespeare, the incomparable Juliet, and one of the most striking characters of Pushkin from the play "The Stone Guest" - the beautiful Laura.  In the play, which has a television version, the woman owned the image of Beatrice from the comedy ‚ÄúMuch Ado About Nothing‚Äù. </p>

She played Ksenia Lvovna in the film "Tutor". </p><p>  Today, her son Alexander declares that he is very similar to his mother, but her lightness and elevation are not inherent in him.  She often sang, so a festive atmosphere always reigned in their apartment.  Many guests sat at the table.  Tselikovskaya Lyudmila Vasilievna loved to cook.  Her varied dishes were delicious.  A woman was happy as a child when her friends gladly praised her food. </p><p>  But on the road and during the filming of films in the field, the actress was not capricious when she was served tea in an iron mug and unleavened porridge ‚ÄúHercules‚Äù. </p><p>  The woman was very simple in everyday life.  She, like her heroines, is good-natured and childishly naive.  She always dressed modestly.  She was completely deprived of aristocratic pride because of her popularity.  The artist liked to walk through the woods, pick mushrooms and berries. </p><p>  It was a special actress Tselikovskaya Lyudmila Vasilievna.  The filmography of this woman will inspire and please even modern viewers. </p>
