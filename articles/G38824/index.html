We will consider the sights of this settlement a bit later.  First you need to say a few words about his story.  In place of the modern city, a Bashkir village with the similar name Chelyaba was once located.  This settlement received the status of a city in 1787.  For a long time, few people knew about him, since it was quiet and calm.  This continued until a gold mine was found in these areas.  At the end of World War II, the city was renamed Tankograd.  Its original name was returned to the city after the collapse of the USSR.  Now it is a beautiful and attractive village with many interesting places and structures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chelyabinsk attractions" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/229280.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What to see first of all, having arrived <span>in Chelyabinsk?</span>  The sights of the city are, first of all, historical architectural monuments, temples and monasteries, among which the ancient settlement Arkaim is the first in the list.  This monument of Andronovo culture is a fortified settlement with a burial ground, discovered in 1987.  Today it is one of the wonders of Russia.  The majestic building is the church of the Icon of the Mother of God.  The foundation of this building was laid in 2001, and its construction was completed in 2004. The church contains icons painted by Palekh and Minsk craftsmen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Continuing to consider the <span>interesting places</span> that Chelyabinsk is famous for and the sights, one can note the church of Alexander Nevsky.  Its foundation was laid in 1907 on the site of the Alexander Chapel.  It is a one-story building with a basement, built of red brick and has 13 chapters.  The inside is painted.  In 1922 the church was closed.  Subsequently, a printing house, a planetarium, and a gallery were placed here.  In 1980, the building housed the Philharmonic, and seven years later an organ was installed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chelyabinsk attractions photo" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/229278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What else to see when arriving <span>in Chelyabinsk?</span>  Attractions include the pedestrian street Kirovka, which is considered the pride and decoration of the city.  It is also called the Chelyabinsk Arbat.  There are 19 decorative bronze sculptures on the street.  The figures are made in full size.  Here you can see a Lefty with a <span>savvy flea, a</span> beggar, a city man.  It was on this street that Zero Verst was installed.  The distance to other Russian cities is counted from it.  In addition, one cannot fail to notice the office building-skyscraper "Chelyabinsk City". <br><br>  After inspecting the architectural structures, you can relax in the Central Park, which was chosen not only by the residents of the city, but also by those who came on an excursion to Chelyabinsk.  Sights, photos of which show all their grandeur and beauty, convey the atmosphere and spirit of the city.  So, for example, this park with its paths, attractions, fountains, concert venues in combination with fresh air, thick crowns of trees, the blue surface of the ponds creates a feeling of peace of mind.  From here you can get into the pine forest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/229277.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Continuing to visit the sights of Chelyabinsk, you can visit the Chelyabinsk Zoo, which contains more than a hundred species of birds and animals.  In addition, the city has many museums, each of which is interesting in its own way.  The most visited museum of local lore is considered.  Here is a magnificent collection of objects belonging to previous settlements of the Southern Urals, dating back to the early Iron Age.  The history of the city can be observed in the monumental works of Soviet sculpture, among which the monument "Eaglet", installed on the Scarlet Field.  And not far from the cinema "Kinomax" is a romantic sculptural composition "Sphere of Love." </p>
