Pattern and photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This accessory is used not only as a decoration or hats for workers during repairs.  There are even special exhibitions at which contestants compete in who got Napoleon's hat more original.  Historical museums carry out imitations of a real battle of 1812, in which participants themselves sew the semblance of military suits of those times.  And there are always a lot of Napoleons with their unique hats. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Many people wonder what the name of Napoleon's hat is called correctly.  It has two different names.  In the war years of 1812, it was called the "Triangle" or "Two-cornered".  Indeed, this headpiece resembles a large triangle, which is located on the head as a hat. </p><p>  As history reports, the two-cornered appeared in the 18th century, replacing its predecessor.  The hat with three angles was uncomfortable to wear on the head, and a gentle headgear with two fell to everyone's liking. </p><p>  Usually, the great commander of the French army, Napoleon Bonaparte, is associated with this hat.  He constantly wore various variations of this headgear.  Thanks to this, Napoleon‚Äôs name was attached to the hat. </p><p>  After many successes of the commander in wars, he appeared both envious and admirers.  The latter, in turn, tried to become like their idol, and therefore ordered the same clothes.  Headgear was his main distinguishing feature.  That‚Äôs how the fashion went for making Napoleon‚Äôs hat with his own hands.  So you can show all your creativity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="happyjasminelu.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon Bonoparte" class="if uuid-2583372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95348/2583372.jpg"></div><h2>  What is it used for? </h2><p>  Everyone who wants to make such a hat has different goals.  Children want to be like a French commander.  Collectors collect expensive items for sale or museums.  Builders use Napoleon's hat from the newspaper to not stain hair with paint.  For each purpose, you need to choose different materials, spend more or less time on work. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  The hat can be made from a wide variety of materials.  Builders use plain paper or newspapers. </p><p>  But, if you approach the issue more carefully, and make your own copy of the hat, you need to take dense materials.  Such as cardboard, felt, drape, leather.  Each of them will have its own patterns and creation technologies. </p><p>  In the manufacture of do-it-yourself Napoleon hats from paper, you will need such materials: </p><ul><li>  a sheet of paper in black or blue; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  a variety of buttons or ribbons for decoration. </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  Having prepared the necessary materials for the manufacture of Napoleon's hat from paper, you can begin a detailed study of the pattern.  Do not try to fold the product yourself, otherwise it may turn out crookedly and messy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.naergilien.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper pattern" class="if uuid-2583318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95348/2583318.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Step 1. Take the black paper.  We draw a square on it.  Cut it out. </li><li>  Step 2. Using scissors, round the corners of the cut square. </li><li>  Step 3. Take a white sheet.  Bend. </li><li>  Step 4. Cut the white sheet.  We cut the ends, turning them into a kind of fringe.  Twist. </li><li>  Step 5. We attach the resulting strips around the perimeter of the black circle. </li><li>  Step 6. On a black circle with a fringe, three points should be noted. </li><li>  Step 7. Make bends to the points.  It looks like an equilateral triangle. </li><li>  Step 8. Feathers, skulls, and other ornaments can be cut out of white paper.  From need to stick to the hat.  We make holes and insert the gum.  The product is ready! </li></ul><p>  In addition to paper, you can use leather material.  In this case, the instruction will look like this: </p><ul><li>  Step 1. Since the material is quite expensive, the approach should be appropriate.  Skin should be taken soft.  Be sure to measure the volume of the head with a centimeter. </li><li>  Step 2. Cut a large square from the skin.  Round the edges.  Cut a small one inside a large circle, backing off about 30 centimeters.  It will look like a bagel. </li><li>  Step 3. Sew a small circle and bagel. </li><li>  Step 4. Put the stitched blank on a pan or plate. </li><li>  Step 5. In the fields of the hat mark three points.  Bend and sew them.  Get a hat. </li><li>  Step 6. Decorate the hat with feathers or ribbons.  Done! </li></ul><p>  Another option is to make Napoleon's felt cap.  The material will be soft, but at the same time, keep the shape well. </p><ul><li>  Step 1. Take the black felt.  Cut a square out of it.  Make an even circle out of it. </li><li>  Step 2. From this circle cut a small one.  Then you should get one small circle and the second with a hole inside. </li><li>  Step 3. Sew two circles.  Pull the product onto the appropriate sized utensils. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="imgkid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Workpiece blanks" class="if uuid-2583371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95348/2583371.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Step 4. Wrap the edges of the hat to get the desired shape. </li><li>  Step 5. Decorate the product.  Done. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="pizzabytheslice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Product Example" class="if uuid-2583369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95348/2583369.jpg"></div><h2>  Manufacturing secrets </h2><p>  The main secret of success in the manufacture of any product is attention to detail.  It is necessary not only to study the pattern in detail, but also to select the appropriate materials.  In no case should you take hard leather or felt, otherwise you just can not bend the edges of the hat. </p><p>  Do not use liquid glue to decorate the hat.  For these purposes, you need another.  Ideally, super-glue.  Then nothing will surely fall off. </p><p>  Glue stick is suitable for paper.  It will firm the paper well and prevent it from getting wet. </p><p>  When working with felt and leather, it is better to take a thick needle so that it can easily pierce the material.  This is necessary in order to avoid problems with stitching the product. </p><p>  Before work, it is better to measure the volume of the head so that the hat does not turn out to be small or too large. </p><p>  When choosing paper, give preference to one that is painted on both sides.  This is necessary so that on the bends Napoleon's hat remains the same color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pizzabytheslice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Product Example" class="if uuid-2583370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95348/2583370.jpg"></div><h2>  Beginner Mistakes </h2><p>  The most common mistake can be called the inability to choose materials.  There are many bends in this product that cannot be accurately made with hard leather or felt.  In the manufacture of such a hat, it is not necessary to use patterns.  It is best to visually learn how to make Napoleon's hat.  Photos may well help in this matter. </p><p>  Do not immediately start working with complex materials.  Although they look more presentable, the first attempts to do it on paper are better.  So you can understand your strengths and weaknesses in the process of working on the product.  And paper is much cheaper than leather, for example.  It will not be a pity to spoil it.  Yes, and you can always try again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ehow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finished cocked hat" class="if uuid-2583375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95348/2583375.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  For needlewomen, the question of the funds that will need to be invested in a particular product is always an acute one.  Materials for applied art are expensive, and for certain crafts they require a large number. </p><p>  Napoleon's hat can be made of plain colored paper.  About 30-50 rubles per package will need to be spent on it.  Felt is also not very overpriced.  One square of such material can be bought for 70-100 rubles.  With the skin, everything is more complicated.  This material is expensive and requires special manufacturing skills. </p><p>  Before you begin, you need to evaluate your budget and what purpose you are going to make the craft. </p>
