The English king Edward the Leggy is no exception.  Contemporaries give us a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe appearance of this monarch - a strong, tall man with long arms and legs (hence the nickname).  What role did <span>King</span> Edward the Leggy play in history? </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Edward the Longfoot was the eldest son and heir to Henry III.  He was born in June 1239 and from an early age established himself as a flexible and far-sighted politician.  The conflict that erupted between his father and the barons showed that trusting the young heir should not be trusted - at first Edward fought on the side of the rebel barons, but after the allies began to lose, he turned to the king. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Edward the Leggy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1276288.jpg" width="524"></div>

    <p>  This happened during a long confrontation between Simon de Molfort and King Henry III.  In 1263, at the Battle of Lewis, Edward voluntarily sided with his father and was captured along with other supporters of the monarch.  He managed to escape, and eventually - to push the rebel forces far to the North.  In 1265, the Baron rebellion ended, and Edward 1 the Leggy began to rule the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Personal qualities </h2><p>  In the early years, the future monarch received the title of ruler of Gascony.  He managed to achieve a profitable marriage and became the husband of a representative of one of the richest royal courts in Europe.  Eleanor of Castile was a welcome bride for many - the heirs of Navarre and Provence sought her hands.  The marriage was extremely successful - Eleanor brought her husband 16 children.  It is a pity that only six of them survived to adulthood. </p><h2>  Edward the Longfoot and Arthur </h2><p>  King Edward was raised on the legends and traditions of ancient England.  He was delighted with the legends of <span>King Arthur</span> and searched among his close prototypes for the <span>Knights of the Round Table.</span>  The ruler tried to imitate his idol in words and in deed.  When the son of Eduard the Leggy was born into the royal family in 1283, the happy father threw a celebration in the spirit of an ancient hero - with feasts, celebrations and knightly fights. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="king edward the leggy" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1276292.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  By 1280, a lasting peace reigned in England.  Therefore, Edward I, along with his wife and retinue, went on a campaign in the Holy Land.  This event did not bring him much money, but enriched folk legends with tales of the exploits of the English king.  Taking part in the siege of Acre, the king was wounded and decided to return home.  The news of the death of his father, Henry III, found Edward in the Kingdom of Sicily.  He was in no hurry home.  Returning to England, the ruler traveled all the royal houses of Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Return of the King </h2><p>  King Edward 1 the Leggy was only able to return to England in 1274.  With indignation and anger, he discovered that the royal treasury was empty, and that the power in the state was mired in abuse and corruption.  In order to restore his reputation, the king ordered a poll to be conducted, during which representatives of the propertied sections of the population had to answer many questions in writing.  The answers were depressing - all branches of government were thoroughly corrupt.  It was necessary to take decisive measures in order to restore order in their own country. </p><h2>  Decisive transformation </h2><p>  Few people know that Edward the Longfoot received another historical nickname.  He was called the English Justinian for re-reforming and strengthening the power system in his own country.  The ruler systematized Roman law and adapted its basic norms to English realities.  This helped put in place a coherent and transparent system of laws that has been effective for centuries. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="edward 1 leggy" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1274576.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, the king took up the issue of justice.  He personally participated in many investigations into abuses.  For example, he declared guilty of abusing his own treasurer, who, over the years of service, managed to amass a fortune of fifty thousand pounds sterling - money inconceivable at the time.  Meanwhile, the official salary of this official was only eight pence per day. </p><h2>  Welsh Uprising </h2><p>  The reign of Edward I coincided with the intensification of the Welsh struggle for their independence.  The first performances of the Celts were accompanied by victories, but later luck passed to the British side.  In 1282, the royal army crushed the defenses of the last of Wales' rightful heirs - Llewelyn. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="son of edward the leggy" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1276309.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  As a result of the victory, Edward I appropriated the ancient Welsh lands, having received in addition the title of Lord of Wales.  From now on, all the heirs of the royal house of England on the male side from the moment of birth took the title of Prince of Wales.  Such a tradition exists even in our time. </p><h2>  Castles from the time of Edward the Leggy </h2><p>  A series of castles preserved on the ancient English-Welsh border is still amazing.  Harlech, Carnarvon, Bomaris and other similar structures were built according to one pattern - a large courtyard in the center, surrounded by high stone walls.  A pond was arranged in the Ruddlan building, a place for fights was equipped with visual benches, and the ladies had to sit in a separate, fenced place. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="edward the first leggy king of england" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1276316.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Rare loopholes were cut through powerful walls, from where it was possible to shell the enemy with long bows.  The tops of the castle walls adorned the towers for observation and control over the terrain.  I wonder how much the owners cost the maintenance of such stone monsters? </p><h2>  Queen's death </h2><p>  Until 1290, the life of Edward the Leggy could be considered successful.  He took place as a warrior and a successful ruler of his own lands, showed himself on the battlefield, and in the judicial chair.  But in 1290, Eleanor of Castile dies.  Edward the Leggy sincerely mourned the loss of his wife.  He ordered the erection of twelve crosses that accompanied the Queen's last motorcade to the burial place.  One of these crosses - Chering Cross - has survived to our times.  Repeated Eduard the Longfoot got married only after nine years and only for political reasons.  An alliance with the sister of the French king strengthened the unity of the two most influential royal houses in Europe. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="king of england edward the leggy historical reference" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1276317.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In recent years, Edward the Longfoot has led long bloody wars with the Scots.  Having received several painful defeats from the ruler of the highlanders - Robert Bruce, the king again and again went to storm the units of the rebellious Scots.  There, on the approach to the harsh Scottish cliffs, in 1307 he was overtaken by death.  The last wish of Edward I was parting words to his own son to continue the struggle with Scotland. </p><h2>  Board Results </h2><p>  Edward the First Leggy, king of England, from 1265 until his death was a worthy son of his time.  His cruelty, stubbornness were significant shortcomings of his character.  But love for his own country, for law and order was above all for him.  None of his critics can belittle the merits of Edward I to his own country.  It is not surprising that in folk tales he remained a true ruler, a wise commander and a national hero. </p>
