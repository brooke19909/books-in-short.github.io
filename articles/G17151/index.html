Sharks igrostroy laughed at such impossible plans, and they forgot.  But the young and ambitious team Gaydzinov knew what he was doing - a huge work was sawn into pieces.  Thus, when the War Thunder project came to fruition, it was a regular aviation simulator. </p><h2>  Tanks </h2>

    <p>  Everything changed when the tank battle mode appeared.  The first public demonstration of this latest in industry regime took place at IgroMir.  Moreover, the demonstration was held on an open stand - anyone could personally control an iron combat vehicle. </p><h2>  What is the difficulty? </h2><p>  It may seem to a person not familiar with game development that there is no difficulty here, and the development company is simply drawn as if by a lot of work.  In fact, everything is really complicated.  Judge for yourself: when you rush on a fast plane, you do not care about the outside world.  There is only heaven, your plane and the enemy in sight.  The game engine in this mode does not make sense to load with detailed elements of houses, fields, grass, trees - because you still will not have time to consider them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the new War Thunder mode, tanks will play together with airplanes, which means that it will be necessary to solve the problem of working out the terrain on the map.  After all, a tank is never in a hurry - the user has plenty of time to consider all the details of the world around him. </p><h2>  Graphic performance </h2>

    <p>  The modern gamer no longer accepts projects with poor graphics elaboration, such as the well-known shooting game Tanki-Online.  Play War Thunder as a project will be long only if the final picture is juicy.  Gaijin developers understood this at the earliest stages.  Players are offered a beautiful, juicy picture, where everything is drawn clearly and in detail.  An interesting feature is that not new tank models participate in the battles, but battered combat vehicles that are all completely covered with battle scars, and in some places rust.  The small details of all models are meticulously drawn, and the textures are of unprecedented quality.  Hooks, cables, tools, lights - all these small dots are so realistic that the tank is perceived as alive.  In battle, all this pleases - beautiful tanks in War Thunder!  How to play with all this grandeur in a beta test, we will tell a bit later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The tank damage model deserves special mention.  There are no hit points in the game - tanks are destroyed from hits.  For example, once in an ammunition depot, you can provoke a colorful explosion.  And from getting into the engine, a flame gradually enveloping the machine appears. </p><h2>  How to get to the promised land? </h2>

    <p>  Since the Gaijins launched a closed beta test of ground battles, millions of players have become interested in only one problem in the whole world: "How to play tanks in War Thunder?"  If you are one of them, then you can begin to rejoice, for now everyone will tell you in a detailed way. </p><p>  Let's start, as usual, first.  On the very legendary day that the development company announced the start of a closed beta test, enrollment began.  Organized, everything was easier than ever: just need to go into the game and, after playing a bit beyond measure, get your invite code.  This was one of the most interesting and sought-after in-game promotions for the entire existence of the game, as flocks of happy crayfish rushed to play tanks in War Thunder.  This happiness lasted three weeks.  But then suddenly the following nuisance surfaced: what should we do to those tank crews whom they cradle in the sky?  Well, a person does not want to write out dead loops - give him two hundred millimeters of armor!  Breaking people through the knee is bad, especially in games with the free-to-play model.  Therefore, the General Staff decided to take radical measures, namely, to introduce combat packages with equipment. </p><h2>  Second stage of testing </h2>

    <p>  All the soldiers of the couch army were offered the aforementioned packages.  In the variety of these offers, each tank general can choose how to play tanks in War Thunder.  In total, four packages have entered the game; do you want to consider them in more detail?  What a question, of course! </p><ul><li>  The legendary T-34.  Well, what is in this package, it becomes clear from the name.  After the T-34 was discussed by all the developers of computer games, it is already difficult to call it legendary ... Rather, pop.  In addition to the tank, you will receive two thousand golden eagle heads for the account and a couple of cool stickers so that everyone knows who is who. </li><li>  Gaijins have prepared a wonderful bag with ... Panicercaput lovers ... What would you think?  Captured American (!) M4A2 Sherman tank.  Of course, this brave bucket does not go alone, but complete with a couple of stickers and three thousand eagles. </li><li>  Well, for true lovers of leisurely iron pokatushki, those who want to decide how to play tanks in War Thunder, the development company has prepared a super-uber package that includes both previous tanks, the title "Tank Pioneer" and ... All.  Slightly poor for a wholesale purchase, isn't it? </li></ul>
