The "City of the New World" (this is the official Brisbane nickname) may compete with New York in the number of skyscrapers, and tourists will also enjoy the unique nature.  Welcome to the hospitable Brisbane! </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The international airport is located twenty kilometers from the city.  From Russia you can fly with Aeroflot, JAL or Qantas with one change in Tokyo, Emirates airline via Dubai, Korean airlines via Seoul, the capital of South Korea.  With a change in Singapore, a flight with Singapore Airlines is possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gammaeducationtraining.edu.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãlandscape" class="if uuid-2542625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2542625.jpg"></div><p>  The city is located in the east of the continent, on the shores of the Pacific Morton Bay and the Brisbane River.  It is easily accessible by domestic flights.  Convenient and stable air service is established with the <span>largest cities in Australia.</span> </p><p>  An Air Train runs from the airport to the city and between the terminals every fifteen to thirty minutes.  The fare is four dollars (approximately 320 rubles), and those who transfer between domestic flights can use the transport for free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city can also be reached using the Air Train.  A train leaves the international terminal every fifteen minutes.  On the way to Brisbane city center, the Air Train makes four stops.  The fare is $ 17.5 (almost 1,100 rubles).  Travel time is only twenty minutes. </p><p>  You can arrive in the city by train, but rather, it is a pleasure for lovers of railways.  The train from Sydney, Australia's largest and oldest city, takes about fourteen hours, and from Cairns, which is located in the northeast of the state, as many as twenty-five. </p><div class="photo" data-original="insiderguides.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brisbane australia" class="if uuid-2542624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2542624.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  There are enough hotels in the city.  The budget option is the three-star Carseldine Palms Motel.  The rooms have a small kitchen, so you can save on food and enjoy the usual dishes.  According to tourists, the motel staff is very courteous, polite, maids and administrators are not visible, but there is always someone who can help if necessary.  The hotel has free Wi-Fi and parking, a pool that works even at night, a restaurant for those who do not like to cook, and dry cleaning.  The rooms are air-conditioned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="central cosmo hotel" class="if uuid-2542639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2542639.jpg"></div><p>  Option more expensive - Central Cosmo apartments.

The urban agglomeration produces about 9% of the country's GDP.  It is not surprising that this is a paradise for shopaholics.  There are especially many boutiques of fashionable Australian fashion designers. </p><p>  Be sure to visit the megamall Queen Street Mall, which is located in the very center - the main attraction of Brisbane for shopaholics.  This is a pedestrian alley that extends about 500 meters from George Street to Edward Street.  On this territory there are six large shopping centers and many small boutiques.  More than 26 million visitors visit the shopping district annually. </p><div class="photo" data-original="parkmyvan.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="trading quarter" class="if uuid-2542635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2542635.jpg"></div><p>  Next door is Elizabeth Arcade, which houses boutiques of fashionable Australian designers.  Here you can find very unusual wardrobe items.  There are also several trading arteries on the South Bank where you can buy mostly vintage items.  Tourists note the quality of products from Australian wool (at the same time at an attractive price) and advise buying edible souvenirs: wine, sweets, chocolate, cheeses. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe garden, the attractions of Brisbane, is 52 hectares.  It was founded in 1970, but the official opening took place only in 1976.  In the Brisbane Botanical Garden you can admire a large number of plants from different countries, a huge collection of cacti, a Japanese garden, a bamboo grove. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  People come here on excursions or just relax with their families.  For children there are playgrounds in the fresh air, which are built surrounded by the real tropical forest.  Children really like the park complex, as little explorers can stroll through the jungle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stufftodoinbrisbane.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brisbane botanical garden" class="if uuid-2542628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2542628.jpg"></div><p>  From September to March, the park is open every day from eight in the morning until half past five in the evening, and in the summer (from April to August) - from eight to seventeen.  Admission to Brisbane Garden is free. </p><h2>  Crocodile Nursery </h2><p>  Crocodile nursery founded by Steve Irwin and the Australian zoo are in great demand.  It is located not in Brisbane itself, but not far from the city - in Birwa.  It was in this place that the tortoise Garietta lived for 175 years, which was studied by Charles Darwin himself.  And the zoo is the winner of the tourist award "The main attraction of Australia." </p><p>  The Africa Pavilion was opened in 2001.  Zebras, rhinos and giraffes live here, and in the future lemurs and turtles will appear.  You can look at the artificial island of Madagascar.  The Tiger Temple is home to Bengal and Sumatran tigers, as well as four cheetahs.  These animals love to swim, and visitors have a unique opportunity to observe the underwater zone. </p><p>  Four Asian elephants live in the ‚ÄúElephant Fantasy‚Äù, for which a pool with a fountain and a tropical garden are arranged right there.  Visitors can even feed the elephants themselves!  The pavilion dedicated to the nature of Southeast Asia features small pandas, dark tiger pythons, Komodo lizards, eastern otters and other animals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.city-discovery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocodile park" class="if uuid-2542630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2542630.jpg"></div><p>  "Rain Forest" is a bird aviary.  About 150 species of birds are represented, mainly those that live in Australia.  Of interest is Krokosey - a stadium for 5 thousand people, where crocodiles, birds and snakes perform simultaneously.  The park was founded by Bob and Lynn Irvins, their son Irwin from childhood helped parents, especially with crocodiles.  After the tragic death of Steve, the widow of Terry became the owner of the zoo. </p><h2>  Lone Pine Koala </h2><p>  Koala Park is Australia‚Äôs largest koala reserve.

The structure was designed by the same architect who developed the design of the bridge in Sydney.  This is one of Brisbane's main attractions.  The city is recognizable precisely by the silhouette of this steel bridge.
