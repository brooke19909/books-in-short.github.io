    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The main <span>reasons for decolonization</span> include: </p><ul><li>  The defeat in the Second World War of Germany, Japan, Italy. </li><li>  The weakening of control by the metropolises (especially France and Holland) over the colonies, strengthening the influence and potential of dependent territories. </li><li>  The beginning of a massive (in many countries armed) national liberation movement. </li><li>  The cold war. </li></ul><h2>  First stage </h2><p>  It falls on 1943-1956.  During this period, decolonization of Asia and North African territories was actively taking place.  European states abandon mandates to rule Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.  The fate of the Japanese and Italian mandated territories and colonies was also decided. </p><p>  In 1947, England granted independence to India, which was divided into 2 countries: in fact, India and Pakistan.  Two years earlier, Indonesia and Vietnam declared sovereignty.  These countries had to defend their independence with arms in their hands.  In 1946, the United States ceased control of the Philippines.  In 1953, France recognized the sovereignty of Laos and Cambodia.  After the Franco-British aggression against Egypt failed, France recognized the sovereignty of Morocco and Tunisia, and Britain recognized Sudan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decolonization process" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2092971.jpg"></div>

Sovereignty was recognized only for those countries whose retention of dependence was no longer possible.  But after 1956, Britain and 1958 France gradually began to abandon controlled territories. </p><h2>  Second phase </h2><p>  It falls on the end of the 50-60s.  last century.  During this period, decolonization spread mainly to African countries. </p><p>  Ghana and Malaysia became independent from Britain in 1957, and Guinea in 1958.  1960 is considered a turning point. It was even called the "Year of Africa."  In 1960, 17 states gained independence, including Togo, Somalia, Gabon, Chad, Nigeria, Somalia, etc. </p><p>  Over the following years, countries in East Africa gained sovereignty.  Among them, for example, the Gambia, Zanzibar, Uganda, etc. As a result, by the mid-60s.  most countries in Africa went through <span>decolonization.</span>  <span>This</span> has significantly changed the geopolitical situation in the world. </p><h2>  Final stages </h2><p>  The <span>decolonization of Latin America</span> began in the 70s.  The first after a long confrontation, sovereignty was given to Guinea-Bissau.  This happened in 1973. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="causes of decolonization" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2092972.jpg"></div>

At the same time, China regained sovereignty over Macau and Hong Kong. </p><h2>  Effects </h2><p>  The main result of <span>decolonization is</span> political independence.  Meanwhile, having become sovereign, the new countries did not become economically independent.  The key problem of the former colonies was developmental backwardness.  Most states cannot cope with it.  Territorial and ethnic problems, epidemics, famines, wars, financial debts became familiar phenomena. </p><h2>  The specifics of the development of former colonies </h2><p>  During the Second World Metropolis, they significantly weakened, and the potential of their colonies, on the contrary, increased significantly.  This contributed to the expansion of the <span>national liberation movement</span> throughout the world. </p><p>  Against the backdrop of the rapid development of the USSR and the USA, the role of European countries has lost its significance.

    <p>  The largest controlled territories ‚Äî Indonesia, Pakistan, and India ‚Äî were the first to proclaim their independence.  The metropolis, of course, sought to maintain power by any means.  However, the inevitability of the collapse of the colonial system became apparent after the end of the war between Britain and France with Egypt. </p><p>  The point in the era of French colonialism was set by Charles de Gaulle.  England followed the example of an ally and granted independence to its controlled states. </p><h2>  The impact of the cold war </h2><p>  The events of that period provided favorable conditions for the fall of colonialism.  <span>Dependent states</span> maneuvered between large countries, not wanting to follow superpowers without looking back.  The thirst for independence is the most important factor that contributed to the weakening of the bipolar world system and, consequently, the end of the Cold War. </p><h2>  Economic dependence </h2><p>  Despite the recognition of political sovereignty of the former colonies, the metropolis continued to set prices for food and raw materials.  This situation was the result of economic backwardness. </p><p>  Asian, Latin American, African countries continued to be raw appendages.  They depended on the supply of equipment, external investment.  Economic backwardness was also supported by the prevalence of the traditional way of life, the illiteracy of most people, and the underdevelopment of communications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decolonization stages" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2092974.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Population explosion </h2><p>  He reinforced the problem of economic backwardness.  The population explosion came at a time when the transformation of traditional socio-economic institutions had just begun.  Agricultural overpopulation in some regions caused a real catastrophe.  Due to the use of all free land suitable for agricultural activities, deforestation, depletion of fresh water reservoirs, the problem of urbanization has arisen. </p><p>  Between 1950 and 1980  More than 300 million rural residents have moved to cities or to the areas that surround large megacities.  The high population growth rate has deepened the problem of economic backwardness.  In some countries, per capita income has become less than it was during the colonial period. </p><p>  Due to the high birth rate, more than half of the state‚Äôs population began to be children under 15 years old.  To solve the problem of backwardness, it was necessary to increase the level of literacy of people.  But with such a huge number of teenagers, a large amount of funds had to be allocated for education.  Another negative consequence of the high birth rate was unemployment.  It forms the prerequisites for maintaining low earnings and does not stimulate the development of innovations, slows down technological progress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decolonization of latin america" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2093023.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The population explosion, government policies aimed at modernizing society - all this led to the destruction of the traditional way of life.  New relationships overlap with old ones.  The economic system has become multistructural.  Most people found themselves in a kind of transitional state.  All this led to socio-economic instability in society.  Revolutions, coups, riots, interstate conflicts, civil wars began. </p><h2>  Import Substitution Industrialization </h2><p>  For many countries, it was not feasible due to low domestic consumption.  About 40% of countries are located on less than 100 thousand square meters.  km and have a population of less than 3 million. </p><p>  Widespread industrialization has led to financial debt of countries.  The burden of its repayment was passed on to the population. </p>
