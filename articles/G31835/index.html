  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Metamorphoses of the elite real estate market in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Over the past decade, the situation on the elite real estate market in Moscow has changed dramatically.  Most of all, this affected geography - if 10 years ago Rublevka and the Golden Mile were actively built up, now there are practically no land plots in these territories.  Now high-quality elite real estate can be purchased in almost every district of Moscow and the Moscow region.  In Zamoskvorechye, Yakimanka and Plyushchikha, several club houses and elite residential complexes were built, as well as in most parts of the west of Moscow.  And deluxe class country cottages can now be purchased in New Riga and near the Yakhroma ski resort. </p><p>  The changes also affected the policy of choosing an apartment or house by the buyer.  If earlier the investor always sought to get at his disposal a new elite housing, now many people buy such cottages or apartments for themselves, so they prefer secondary options - no one wants to live in the middle of a construction project for years, because usually such houses are built by complexes, and new cottage villages are constantly being built up and expand.  In the 2000s, most apartments and houses went on sale in a "draft form" - without repair.  Today, almost all luxury real estate is put on the market with a finished finish. </p><p>  Previously, a key criterion for real estate elite was considered its location.  Even if the mansion on Rublevka did not meet any of the European standards, its cost could be several times higher than the price of a much more spacious and high-quality cottage located in a less prestigious area.  Now, the very attitude of clients towards real estate has changed, as a result of which the overly populated Ostozhenka has ceased to be so popular, while the Patriarch Ponds have soared to the peak - peace and ecology are much more important than life in the very center of Moscow. </p><p>  Ruble, despite a similar problem, still does not lose the first position in the ranking of the most prestigious destinations.  But it is also gradually losing popularity: in particular, the construction of deluxe class cottages is now taking place in the direction of New Riga, where the infrastructure is just as well developed and property prices are not too high. </p><p>  The more choice is provided in the elite real estate market, the more demanding the client becomes.  Today, buyers care about everything from location and ecology to home-made materials and infrastructure. </p></div></article>
