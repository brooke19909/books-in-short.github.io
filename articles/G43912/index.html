    <p>  So what is Tinkoff Credit Systems bank?  It was founded by Oleg Tinkov, and it happened in 2006.  The bank has no offices, branches or points of sale.  Credit cards are issued remotely.  In other words, you communicate with bank employees via a toll-free telephone line or via the Internet. </p><p>  The bank has a full range of remote controls: Internet Bank and Mobile Bank.  Using them you can get information about the status of your account, track the history of transactions, make transfers, payments and much more. </p><p>  All agreements and credit cards are delivered to you by courier or Russian post.  For registration you will need only one document - your passport.  Income certificates are not required.  This is confirmed by reviews of the Tinkoff credit card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff credit card reviews" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11061/42461.jpg" width="275"></div>

They are sent by e-mail or by mail to Russia.  Give preference to the second option, it is more reliable. </p><p>  There are four loan offers.  The first of these is Platinum, a Tinkoff credit card.  Reviews say this is the most popular offer.  Its limit is 300 thousand rubles.  55 days are given for deferment of interest payment - but only if you make purchases on the card itself without withdrawing cash.  Pay attention to this. </p><p>  The second offer is an All Airlines card.  The same interest-free period is given here.  With this card you can insure your trip for free.  But you need to pay about two thousand rubles for its maintenance. </p><p>  The third sentence is the World of the Book, a Tinkoff gold credit card.  Reviews about her are not so common.  It is linked to the World of the Book site.  For the first order, a discount of 300 rubles and a permanent discount of 10% are given when making purchases in the Book World store.  The maximum limit is 300 thousand rubles. </p><p>  And the last offer is ‚ÄúOdnoklassniki Tinkoff Credit Card‚Äù, reviews of which can be found on the popular Odnoklassniki website.  This card is connected with him.  It has an individual design, and when it is used, OK-i accumulate (the monetary unit of Odnoklassniki). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff credit card reviews" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11061/42483.jpg" width="297"></div>

    <p>  You probably already noticed that the <span>interest rate is</span> not indicated anywhere <span>.</span>  The fact is that it and the size of the initial limit are determined individually for each client.  How does this happen? </p><p>  You fill out the form.  In it indicate your age, the size of your income and so on.  The bank reviews this data and your credit history.  It is taken from a common base for all your past loans.  It is on these grounds that the <span>interest</span> rate and the tariff plan are <span>calculated</span> . </p><p>  Turn to the reviews.  If you urgently need a large sum of money, then a Tinkoff credit card may disappoint you.  Reviews about this filled all the thematic forums. </p><p>  What's happening?  For example, you applied for 100 thousand rubles, but in the end you receive a card with an initial limit of 10 thousand.  And here you can‚Äôt do anything, the bank has such a policy. </p><p>  A small limit is given, the bank watches how you work with the card, and only then it begins to increase your limit and offer more favorable conditions.  There are many dissatisfied people about this.  There is only one way out.  If you are not sure about your credit history, and your income is not so high, and you need a large amount, then it is better to contact another bank. </p><p>  Specifying false information does not make sense.  The bank will carefully check them.  Calls are made in several directions.  First of all, a call will be made to the accounting department at the place of your employment.  And do not forget that paying is more profitable with the card itself.  For cash withdrawals you will have to pay a commission. </p>
