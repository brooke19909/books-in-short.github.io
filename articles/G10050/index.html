This process is so addictive that hundreds and thousands of people go fishing.  Even in winter and even at night.  The bream belongs to the species of <span>deep-sea fish</span> wintering at the bottom of submarine pits, hollows, and edgelines (sharp drops forming a step).  Therefore, <span>fishing</span> in the winter begins with determining the bottom relief using a depth gauge, which you can buy or make yourself. </p><p>  After finding a suitable place in the ice, several holes are drilled, and their bait begins.  To do this, a little (about 50 grams) bloodworms are poured into each hole.  In exceptional cases, bread products are used instead.  The bite does not begin immediately, but after about half an hour.  At first, the bream acts actively, but then it becomes more careful, slightly touching the nozzle.  At this point, it is recommended to move away from the hole so that the fish can calm down.  In about ten to fifteen minutes the bite will resume with the same force.  And then you can start direct fishing. </p><p>  The bream is fearful fish, and in order to lure it from a favorite place, you need a good nozzle.  Usually, bream fishing in winter is usually successful when fresh and lively bloodworms, maggots or small worms are used.  Moreover, it is desirable to attach them to the hook in an amount of at least five pieces.  The diameter of the fishing line is small (up to 0.12 mm), but its length on the reel should not be less than 20 meters.  The nodding plate also has a considerable length - at least 6 centimeters. </p><p>  The choice of mormyshka depends not only on the preferences of the fisherman.  Its color, if fishing is conducted during the day, does not play a big role.  However, <span>night fishing for</span> bream in winter dictates its conditions - the mormyshka should be light and shiny.  The elongated form is considered the best, but the size is preferable to take the average.  For small depths, mormyshka can be single-component - lead, or made of two materials (copper and silver foil).  For significant depths, heavy alloys are selected. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the bream is shy, it is advisable to twitch it smoothly while narrowing the mormyshka, and keep the wiring calm and slow.  So, if the fisherman has the ability to quickly respond to bite, he will have to stop - fishing for bream in the winter does not endure fuss.  The bream, which was hooked, behaves quite calmly in the depths, and only going up to the surface itself begins to twitch, breaking off the tackle.  In principle, the specified length and diameter of the fishing line can withstand any tricks of the fish, if its weight does not exceed 300 grams, but for specimens exceeding this size, the cutting technique requires special care. </p><p>  When a bream is large, the fishing process is very slow: with constant stops, and sometimes a weakening of the fishing line tension, which is passed between the fingers of the right hand.  With his left hand, the fisherman secures the process of drawing the fish, and sometimes slows it down.  A curious moment, which is known for catching a bream in the winter, is a false letting go of a bream and handing over several meters of fishing line in order to make it easier to hook a fish soothed by its victory. </p><p>  Very often, young fishermen, following the released fishing line, look into the hole, as if trying to examine the bream in it, although they should focus on tackle to prevent mistakes.  But, in general, large bream is caught, as a rule, at night, in the region between 23 hours of the previous day and the current hour of the night. </p><p>  Fishing a bream in winter at night requires lighting holes.  Each fisherman uses his own lighting for these purposes.  Some set candles in caps from under cut plastic bottles.  Others use various portable lanterns, and there are those who believe that the best lighting device is a miner's lantern mounted in a hat. </p>
