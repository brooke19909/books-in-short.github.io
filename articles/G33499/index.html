Several scene modes are available, including Beach, Snow, and Portrait, as well as digital image stabilization, which creates a composite photo and reduces blur, making it easier to shoot in difficult conditions such as low light or moving subjects. </p><p>  The Canon Digital IXUS 145 digital camera allows you to shoot HD-video and is equipped with an eco mode that reduces energy consumption. </p>

    <h2>  Starter Camera </h2><p>  Despite the fact that IXUS 145 features are entry-level, the camera helps the novice user switch from taking photos in a fully automatic mode to choosing settings independently.  The model supports the Live Mode function, which allows owners to adjust brightness, saturation and contrast, observing changes on the screen, set white balance, exposure compensation and metering method. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Competing with the <span>Nikon Coolpix S3600</span> and Panasonic Lumix DMC-SZ8 cameras, the IXUS 145 will be cheaper, but keep in mind that the camera also has less functionality. </p><p>  The model is available in silver, red, purple and black.  Most likely, it will appeal to beginner amateurs and those who do not like to mess with the settings. </p>

    <h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  The lack of a handle on the Canon Digital IXUS 145 is not considered by owners to be a drawback, since the camera is very easy to hold, as it is thin and light even with a battery inserted.  Since there are no protrusions, it easily slides into a narrow pocket of jeans or a coat.  The case is durable, without convex plastic parts.  The only serious problem that users face is the battery cover, which is sometimes difficult to open. </p><p>  Given its price, it is not surprising that Canon does not offer a touch screen, but the 2.7 ‚ÄùLCD is large and easy to understand, and the menu system is very simple. </p><p>  The buttons are larger than some previous IXUS cameras (for example, 255 HS), as well as the distance between them, which should be a pleasant change for owners of big hands.  However, this extra space is limited because the screen has been reduced from 3 "to 2.7" to make the space between the controls wider. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The Canon Digital IXUS 145 standard menu system is called relatively simple, especially for those who are already familiar with the manufacturer‚Äôs cameras.  Most commonly used functions are now available through FUNC / SET in the center of the navigation keys.  The rest of the control panel now houses the flash, ECO, display settings, and mode buttons.  The latter is confusing with the designation Auto.  Settings such as macros, exposure compensation and a timer, which previously had direct access, can now be found in the function menu, which complicates their choice, since you can get to them only through a few menus. </p><p>  A new help button has appeared on the back of the IXUS 145, which brings up brief tips and information about the screen the user is on, which should help novice photographers learn about the functionality.  Play and record keys are located above the control panel.  The switch, shutter button, and zoom control are located on the upper side on the right, and the flash is on the left, away from fingers that could accidentally interfere with it. </p><h2>  Image quality </h2><p>  The Canon Digital IXUS 145 is praised by users for its amazingly true, vibrant colors and ease of use.  It focuses quickly and instantly processes pictures, which is always welcomed in a compact camera.  Most exposures are well balanced and appear to be correctly measured.  Although there are some overexposures in portrait shooting on a bright background, but this can be corrected by exposure compensation. </p><p>  Macro mode works very well, allowing you to get closer to the photographed object without casting a shadow of a zoom lens on it.  At the edges, the frame is a bit blurry, but there is nothing that would look out of place. </p>

    <p>  Several white balance modes are available, but you have to use them infrequently, since the automatic white balance does an excellent job with most scenes, except for cloudy ones that make the colors colder than they really are.  Switching to a cloud-based white balance corrects the situation. </p><p>  The sensitivity of the model varies in the range of ISO 100-3200 (manual tuning is limited to 1600).  Pictures taken at ISO 1600 and above show noise.  Shooting in good light at ISO 800 or lower should minimize noise if you don't view the full size image.  Also, some noise is present at ISO 400 in low light, but it's still pretty good performance. </p><p>  Filters are standard for IXUS, but each model brings something different.  Each of them is displayed on the screen before shooting, which is useful since the camera does not offer any editing or post-processing options. </p><p>  On some Canon Digital IXUS 145 photos, the reviews show slight chromatic aberration, but it is unlikely that this would be noticeable when printing photos of A4 size or smaller.  Optics does not produce noticeable distortion or fringing. </p><p>  The screen is crisp, bright and easy to see at most angles, although it becomes mirrored when extreme tilted, making viewing difficult, and the colors displayed on the display become a little muted in bright sunlight. </p><p>  Zoom performance is generally good, especially when using 8x optical zoom.  And although the digital zoom can reach 32x, at maximum the image is quite noisy, so it‚Äôs better to stick to 16x or lower. </p><h2>  <span>Canon IXUS 145:</span> disadvantages and advantages </h2><p>  According to user reviews, they are impressed by the quality of the series, and the 145th model did not disappoint them.  The camera has a limited set of functions, but what the camera can do, it does very well, creating clear, bright, sharp images.  However, it would be nice to see more innovation.  The manufacturer has excellent technologies, and it would be nice to see them in a budget compact - for example, the ability to upload to social networks or the touch screen. </p>

    <p>  Customer reviews of the Canon Digital IXUS 145 indicate that the manufacturer has once again released a great compact in every way: easy to use, take great photos and fit into your pocket.  Although it is always nice to see other functions - a panoramic mode or the possibility of post-processing, the low price does not allow to make a claim.  The IXUS 145 delivers quality photos in a wide range of shooting conditions. </p><p>  If you need something better, for a small surcharge you can consider buying options for the Nikon Coolpix S3600, which offers 20 megapixels, as well as camera retouching, and the Panasonic SZ8 boasts Wi-Fi, a wider LCD screen and large optical zoom. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Canon Digital IXUS 145 reviews are called the ideal camera for a beginner amateur photographer.  Its menu system is easy to use, the automatic mode works well, and the price is very attractive.  The image quality is also undeniable, and the dimensions and weight of the camera allow you to always take it with you, regardless of the situation. </p>
