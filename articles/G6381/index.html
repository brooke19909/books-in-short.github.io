    <h2>  <span>How to get a</span> car <span>loan</span> </h2><p>  Today, there are three ways to purchase a car on credit.  Car programs: </p><p>  <em>Basic.</em>  Such a program is akin to ordinary consumer lending.  It allows you to purchase for use both a new and a used car, and it does not matter whether it is domestic or foreign.  From the moment of receipt of funds, the borrower is given no more than 90 days to choose and purchase a vehicle.  After the purchase, the car becomes a bank deposit.  The amount of such a <span>targeted loan</span> can reach up to 5 million rubles, and the interest rate can reach 20%.  Money under the basic car loan program can be obtained for up to 5 years. </p><p>  <em>Affiliate.</em>  This option almost completely repeats the basic auto-subsidization with the only difference that the interest rate on the loan can be slightly reduced if you buy a car in the salon that is a partner of the creditor bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preferential car loan program car list" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/746831.jpg" width="550"></div>  This program has several disadvantages:

Registration term - no more than 3 years.  The essence of the program of preferential car loans is that part of the interest on the loan is repaid by the state for you, which significantly reduces the interest rate for the borrower.  The rate for this type of subsidization is completely dependent on the Central Bank's refinancing rate, so in each case it may turn out to be different. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The preferential car loan program was first tested in the Russian Federation during the 2009 crisis.  This decision, together with the recycling program for old cars, helped domestic automakers to stay afloat and significantly update the Russian fleet.  However, the first program of preferential car loans had several disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  Initially, it was designed to support the AvtoVAZ enterprise, since the average <span>cost of a car of</span> this brand did not exceed 350 thousand rubles. </li><li>  The lineup approved by the Ministry of Industry and Trade for the implementation of the program amounted to only 10 items, so consumers did not have much choice. </li><li>  Another negative side of the issue was the rather high down payment - at least 30% of the cost of the car.  Not everyone could afford to lay out such a lump sum. </li></ol>

Today it is safe to say that a preferential car loan program is the most popular way to purchase a personal car.  Nevertheless, at different times, the auto-subsidy program either ceased, then resumed, and on the eve of 2015 there was a heated debate about whether to continue it in the future.

After making simple calculations, you can independently find out how much you will have to overpay in each case.  To do this, use a simple formula: </p><p>  Ps = Ds - 2/3 x Ref, where: </p><ul><li>  Ps - annual percentage; </li><li>  Ds - the interest rate applicable at the time of issuing a loan according to the standard lending scheme; </li><li>  Ref -% refinancing adopted by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation at the time of conclusion of the contract. </li></ul><p>  As of April 1, 2015, the refinancing rate is 14%, which means that its recoverable part is 9.33%.  Thus, if you contacted a bank offering a car loan at 20% per annum, then, using the state preferential program, you will pay only 10.67% per annum.  Of course, the base rates in all banks are different, so in each case the calculation result will be different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the essence of preferential car loans" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/746835.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <h2>  Basic conditions for obtaining a car loan </h2><p>  To receive a car loan under a preferential program, the borrower does not have any special requirements.  Of course, each bank has its own rules and conditions may vary slightly, but the average portrait of a borrower looks like this: </p><ul><li>  a citizen of the Russian Federation at the age of not younger than 21 and not older than 60 years; </li><li>  Has a permanent job at least for the past 6 months; </li><li>  registered and permanently resides in the service area of ‚Äã‚Äãa particular bank; </li><li>  able to confirm that there is a steady income sufficient to cover the monthly payment. </li></ul><p>  Based on practice, we can say that there are only 2 parameters by which a preferential car loan can be refused: it is a bad credit history and the presence of children under the age of six months (for women). </p><h2>  Additional requirements </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the preferential car loan program in all banking institutions looks almost the same, some criteria may still vary slightly: </p><ul><li>  basic lending rate (the one from which the subsidy will be deducted); </li><li>  the shortest period for which a loan is issued; </li><li>  requirements for the borrower regarding work experience and salary; </li><li>  the need for additional collateral or the involvement of a guarantor; </li><li>  minimum loan amount; </li><li>  the need for registration (registration) of the debtor in the region where the loan is issued. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preferential car loan programs for Russians" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/746836.jpg" width="360"></div></h2><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  In general, a preferential car loan program assumes that the borrower has the following documents: </p><ul><li>  the civil passport of the borrower himself, as well as his spouse (spouse), if the debtor is married; </li><li>  written consent of the second spouse to transfer the vehicle as a pledge to the bank; </li><li>  driver's license (if any); </li><li>  certificate 2-PIT (on income); </li><li>  extract from the work book, officially certified at the last place of work; </li><li>  contract of sale or reference account from the salon, confirming the cost of the car. </li></ul><p>  As each organization conducts its own credit policy, the list of required documents can vary significantly.  Nevertheless, an unwritten rule states: the shorter the loan term and the longer the down payment, the less documents the bank will require. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is a preferential car loan program?" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/747530.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to get such a loan? </h2><p>  So, what is a preferential car loan program, more or less clear, but where can I get such a loan?  To date, the full list of Russian banking institutions offering to use this kind of services has not yet been determined, therefore, in each case, it is necessary to clarify whether it is possible to receive state subsidies.  However, it is safe to say that this list is quite long and, as of the end of 2014, amounted to more than 130 organizations.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  "VTB 24". </li><li>  URALSIB. </li><li>  Gazprombank. </li><li>  "UniCredit Bank". </li><li>  Bank "Saint-Petersburg". </li><li>  Bank "Soviet". </li><li>  AK BARS BANK; </li><li>  JSCB ‚ÄúBTA-Kazan‚Äù and many others. </li></ul><p>  So finding the right option and taking advantage of the preferential car loan program in Russia in 2015 will not be difficult. </p>
