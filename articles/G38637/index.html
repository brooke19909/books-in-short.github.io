A huge number of tourists come to the island annually.  As a rule, people are interested in the question of how to get to Phuket from Bangkok.  This is not surprising, because most flights from other countries land in the capital of this beautiful country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelquotidiano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand phuket" class="if uuid-2856364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2856364.jpg"></div><p>  There are several options for how to get from Bangkok to Phuket on your own.  The choice of this or that method depends on the tourist‚Äôs budget and the time that he is willing to spend on the road. </p><p>  The distance between the capital and the island of paradise is 691 km in a straight line.  You can overcome it by plane, car or scooter, regular bus, by train with a transfer to the bus and even by taxi. </p><h2>  Airplane </h2><p>  The fastest and most comfortable way to overcome the distance Bangkok - Phuket is the plane.  However, this method is also the most expensive.  Travel time ranges from 80 to 120 minutes.  The cost of the flight depends on the airline serving the flight and the class of service chosen by the passenger.  Between the two points, several airlines fly, for example, Thai Airways, Air Asia and Bangkok airway, Lion Air, NOK air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.enac.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bangkok Phuket Airplane" class="if uuid-2856357" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2856357.jpg"></div><p>  The cheapest flight can be made from <span>Don Mueang</span> International <span>Airport</span> by Lion Air.  The cost of a flight ticket from Bangkok to Phuket is about 1000 baht (2045 rubles).  Flight time - 2 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Faster is a Thai Airways flight from Suvarnabhumi International Airport.  The journey to the destination takes 1 hour 20 minutes.  The cost of tickets is approximately double compared to Lion Air airlines. </p><p>  You can fly from Bangkok to Phuket at any time of the day; air traffic to the island is very well developed.  Most flights depart in the morning and evening. </p><p>  Tourists are advised to book plane tickets in advance at special rates.  If you buy a ticket immediately before departure, you can overpay a decent amount of money up to 5000 baht (10,200 p.). </p><h2>  Bus </h2><p>  Most tourists are interested in the question of how to get cheap from Bangkok to Phuket.  The cheapest way to get to the island is by bus. </p><p>  From the capital, buses to Phuket leave from the station in the northern part of Mor Chit or from the southern station Sai Tai Mai. </p><div class="photo" data-original="asiagreentravel.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus Transfer" class="if uuid-2856359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2856359.jpg"></div><p>  Bus Bangkok - Phuket travels the required distance in 12 hours.  The ticket costs from 500 baht to 1100 baht (1020-2250 p.). </p><p>  You can use the TransportcCo VIP class bus, which leaves daily from the south station of the city.  The cost of the trip is 970 baht (1980 p.). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Moving can be done on a first class bus.  It will be less comfortable, the cost of the ticket will be approximately 780 baht (1600 p.). </p><p>  During the trip, the bus stops every three hours, on some flights food and water are supplied. </p><p>  There are a lot of buses running, so a tourist will not have much difficulty getting to Phuket.  Night crossings are most popular, but there are some advantages to a day trip: you can watch amazing views of Thailand from the window. </p><p>  All buses arrive at the new Phuket Town bus station over the bridge.  From the station to the beach or the selected hotel, you will have to get a taxi at a cost of about $ 15 (1000 p.) Or local transport or transfer provided by the hotel. </p><h2>  Private buses </h2><p>  In addition to regular buses, a large number of private flights run on a given route.  However, using them is not recommended due to poor reviews and a bad reputation.  Often during trips on these buses there were cases of theft of things from tourists from the luggage compartment.  Very often, instead of the claimed direct flight from Bangkok to Phuket, tourists had to make a large number of transfers and endure various inconveniences. </p><h2>  A train </h2><p>  Consider another option, how to get to Phuket from Bangkok.  A train ride is not the most convenient option, since most of the journey, about 5 hours, will still have to be done by bus.  The fact is that there is no direct rail link between the capital and the island. </p><p>  The nearest train station is on mainland Thailand in Surat Thani.  A large number of trains leave from Bangkok to Surat Thani daily.  The most convenient option is a night train, as you can get a good night's sleep during the trip.  It is not possible to buy electronic train tickets in Thailand in advance.  They are purchased directly at the station or at a travel agency in Bangkok, but with an extra charge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.railwaygazette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train in thailand" class="if uuid-2856360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2856360.jpg"></div><h2>  Characteristics of classes of service </h2><p>  It is customary to classify cars as classes.  Allocate the first class, which includes single and double coupes.  In the second class there are both reserved seats and soft chairs.  In the third grade are soft and hard benches.  It should be noted that air conditioners are only in first-class cars.  The ticket price also depends on the selected class of carriage.  So, the cheapest ticket can be taken for 107 baht (220 rubles), a ticket to the second class will cost 250 baht (510 rubles) and for the first class - 520 baht (1070 rubles). </p><p>  After arriving at the railway station of the city of Surat Thani, the tourist must decide on a trip to Phuket.  As a rule, this does not cause problems, since the train always meets a large number of carriers offering to take a bus ride to Phuket costing from 250 baht (510 rubles). </p><h2>  Taxi </h2><p>  Tourists who have comfort in the first place, but the monetary side of the issue does not bother them much, can get a taxi to answer the question of how to get to Phuket from Bangkok.  The distance from <span>Suvarnabhumi Airport,</span> which receives most flights from Russia to Phuket, is 900 km on the highway.  A trip by car with a capacity of up to 3 passengers will cost an average of 12 thousand baht (24,500 p.).  For a minibus that seats up to 13 passengers, you will have to pay around 25 thousand baht (51,000 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="reallifephuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Taxi in Thailand" class="if uuid-2856361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2856361.jpg"></div><p>  The undoubted advantages of a taxi trip is the lack of the need to move between the airport and the bus station, as well as the possibility of independent choice of departure time.  You can order a long-distance taxi in advance via the Internet or at the airport, contacting staff near special racks for help. </p><h2>  Scooter or car rental </h2><p>  For those who do not want to depend on anyone and feel confident behind the wheel of a car with left-hand traffic, it is recommended to rent a scooter or car.  This option is the most interesting, since on the way to Phuket you can see a large number of attractions of the country.  So, you can visit several national parks, the royal health resort, see the mystical mountain in the vicinity of Cha-Am, visit rice fields and even meet an elephant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.findawayphotography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scooter rental" class="if uuid-2856363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2856363.jpg"></div><p>  To rent a car or scooter in Bangkok, an international driver‚Äôs license and passport are required.  There are offices at the international airport where you can rent a vehicle. </p><p>  The price for car rental starts from 900 baht (1850 p.) Per day. </p><h2>  Transfer </h2><p>  Tourists who are interested in how to get to Phuket from Bangkok can pre-book a transfer with a professional driver.  You can be met by a driver either in a passenger car or in a minibus.  The cost of the trip is approximately the same and is $ 350 (23,250 p.).  If you order a minibus for a company of seven people, then the cost of one will be only $ 50 (3300 p.), Which is quite a bit for the maintenance of such a high level.  The transfer service includes a meeting of tourists at the airport or hotel with a nameplate and delivery to a specified destination. </p>
