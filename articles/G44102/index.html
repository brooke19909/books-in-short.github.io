    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The state capital is Richmond.  Its population is only 200 thousand people.  But the largest city is Virginia Beach, about half a million inhabitants live there.  By the way, this is a resort city where thousands of tourists come annually to enjoy the waves of the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> and the bright sun.  There are a huge number of hotels and beaches, so there is where to relax.  Interestingly, in the eastern part of the state, the terrain is very boggy.  On the western side, this is not observed, since it is on that side that the Appalachian mountains are located - they stretch for two thousand kilometers!  By the way, Virginia is on the 12th place in terms of population density (out of 51).  In total, more than eight million people live there.  An interesting fact is that quite a lot of Germans live in this state - more than 12%.  About 20% are African-Americans, about 11% are British, 10% are Irish, and only 11.5% are Americans.  At the same time, the percentage of <span>Native Americans</span> living is less than one!  Although, if we turn to history, we can find out that originally <span>Indian</span> states lived on the territory of the state <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  It is always interesting to find out various facts about a particular place.  So, for example, Virginia was nicknamed the ‚Äúmother of presidents‚Äù, and all because eight US presidents were born here.  Among them, by the way, is the world famous <span>George Washington.</span>  Another funny fact about the Pentagon (it is known to be located in Virginia) is that it has too many toilets, twice as many as needed.  And all because the building was built in 1940 - then the toilets for black and bright people had to be separate.  And more recently, in 2011, in the summer, the state of Virginia suffered an earthquake.  Such a cataclysm first occurred on the <span>east coast of America.</span>  And indeed, I must say, earthquakes here are rare.  However, on that August day, people watched the walls of houses shake.  There were no victims, fortunately.  And another interesting fact: Virginia is a state with a half-naked girl on its flag. </p>

    <h2>  Not without oddities </h2><p>  Each country or city has its own laws, its own characteristics, which visitors may not understand.  Sometimes something seems even ridiculous, strange and completely unusual.  The state of Virginia is no exception.  Quite strange laws apply on its territory.  So, for example, recently the situation was canceled, the essence of which was that they didn‚Äôt sell salad on Sundays, but it was safe to buy beer or wine.  By the way, on this day of the week it is strictly forbidden to work.  Even in the state, radar detectors are prohibited, and when overtaking cars it is necessary to give a signal.  One of the most ridiculous laws is that it is forbidden to tickle girls and push their wife out of bed.  Spit in sea gulls or on the sidewalk is also impossible (quite an interesting combination).  A man can be imprisoned for two months if he slapped a girl on the back.  And finally, another absurd situation - a woman has the right to drive a car along the main street only when her husband is in front of the car, adjusting her movement with a red flag.  As you can see, the state of Virginia (USA) does not lag behind other cities where rather strange positions apply - for example, in India you cannot lose weight to a person who weighs less than 110 kg. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Places for rest </h2><p>  Virginia is a place where you can really rest nicely.  And for everyone there is an occupation.  For example, Virginia Beach (a city included in the Guinness Book of Records as a resort with the longest beach in the world) is a place for outdoor enthusiasts.  The sea, the sun, parties, clubs, shopping centers - all this is here.  Or you can go to Norfolk - a port city.  And fans of a quiet pastime will like Hampton.  In general, a vacation in Virginia is designed for those people who want to escape from the daily rush and enjoy the tranquility. </p>

    <h2>  Main attraction </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, in these places there is something to see.  There really is a mass of interesting sights, but the most important is the great gloomy swamp (Virginia, USA).  This is a wetland located in the southeastern part of the state on the plain.  It is safe to say that this small corner is one of the last in all of America that people have not touched.  This is a <span>national park</span> that covers almost 500 km of dense forests and water.  The Great Gloomy Swamp (Virginia, USA) has a completely unique ecosystem.  Unlimited <span>water resources,</span> rich flora and fauna, diverse nature, mysterious atmosphere - all this attracts the attention of tourists and local residents.  By the way, the Great Swamp is included in the list of unique places in the USA.  Scientists have a version that it was formed due to the last shift of the continental plume.  But this is only one of the opinions, since there are a huge number of them. </p>
