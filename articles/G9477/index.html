Features, price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Produced in 1973, 2 kopecks have several varieties.  The difference, as with many coins of that time, is only in the image of the coat of arms and some small details.  It is precisely on them that the price of this money in the numismatics market depends.  Some will be valued in rubles, while others have a price tag of about 200 rubles.  Today we will try to understand the varieties and features of these coins.  Why are some worth more, while others can simply be put in a box and not try to earn an insignificant couple of rubles per coin? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allnumis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2 penny coin" class="if uuid-3159028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3159028.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The coin is minted from an alloy of zinc and copper.  It has no magnetic properties.  In many ways, 2 kopeks in 1973 are very reminiscent of coins produced in the Soviet Union in 1961.  It weighs about two grams.  Released by the Leningrad Mint. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The upper central part of the coin is taken by the number 2. Then comes the inscription ‚Äúpenny‚Äù and already lower - the year of manufacture.  A branch of oak leaves, from which wheat ears come out, frames the image.  At the very bottom of the coin, exactly in the center, where the parts of the oak wreath meet, is a shell. </p><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  Just above the center is the image of planet Earth.  Above is a sickle and hammer display.  The earth is heated by the rays of the sun, which is only half depicted.  Long and short rays emerge from the upper part of the star.  They practically touch the Earth.  The composition is framed by a wreath consisting of wheat ears.  They are tied with a magnificent ribbon.  Only fifteen turns, which symbolizes the number of republics of the Union. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.icollector.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2 kopeks 1973" class="if uuid-3159054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3159054.jpg"></div><p>  On coins of 2 kopeks in 1973, the emblem pattern is called simplified, there is no text on the ribbon on it.  At the bottom of the coin is the inscription "USSR", and at the very top, where the ears meet, there is a star with five ends. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  The pattern on the coin may differ: </p><ol><li>  Star with rounded ends.  On such a coin, 2 kopeks in 1973, a star is quite unclearly minted.  Its ends are too rounded and smooth.  This is noticeable even with the naked eye, especially if there is a sample of a different type nearby for comparison.  Ears differ.  In rows 4, 5, 6, they are too weakly drawn, the edges are rounded and are too close to each other. </li><li>  The star is clear, but spike the ears to the side.  The next 2 kopeks in 1973 will differ from their monetary ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù in that the awns are located very far from each other.  If you compare two coins, the contrast will be noticeable clearly.  The figure on the reverse will also be located slightly higher.  But the star is bright, even, the ends are narrow and long, even pointed. </li><li>  The star is clear, but the spines have different lengths.  In this variety, the star, as in the second case, has very clear boundaries at the ends.  They are pointed, narrow, clearly drawn.  The spikes of spikes on the right are close to each other, but have different lengths. </li></ol><h2>  Cost </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 2 kopeks 1973" class="if uuid-3159059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3159059.jpg"></div><p>  For the manufacture of coins of 2 kopeks in 1973, two types of stamps were used.  For the first (rarer and more expensive) they took a print at number 2.5.  On such coins, the relief of the rays on the star appears more clearly and vividly, and the tips of the ears are also more pronounced.  The price of such money will vary from two hundred rubles and above.  The cost increases if the coins are in almost perfect condition. </p><p>  Coins that have features in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwheat ears will be cheaper.  They are already much cheaper, they were stamped with the number 2.2.  The price varies from 27 to 76 rubles. </p><p>  The presence or absence of a ledge to the right of the star is another minting defect, which can be found in coins of 2 kopeks in 1973. If there is a ledge, then the coins increase in price.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if the edges of the star are smooth or pronounced.  If the ledge of the ears is not available, then such a coin will cost from two rubles.  Of course, prices are inaccurate, they will vary depending on various reasons. </p>
