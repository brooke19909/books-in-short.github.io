  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best smartphone up to 7000 rubles - review and specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many domestic consumers do not set out to purchase a sophisticated gadget.  Some do not need all of these AMOLED screens, high performance in games, fingerprint sensors and other technological surroundings. </p><p>  In the budget sector, the situation with the buyer is always unambiguous: one is sorry, the other does not need all this advanced tinsel, and the third simply can not afford an advanced device from the mid-price segment.  Despite the skepticism of cheap gadgets, decent options still come across here.  We‚Äôll just talk about them.  As a critical mark, we take the average budget threshold of 7,000 rubles. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention the <span>best smartphones</span> within 7000 rubles, which distinguished themselves by their quality component and very good reviews from users.  The list will be presented in the form of a rating.  All the models described below can be found both in offline and in online stores, so there should be no problems with ‚Äúsee‚Äù and ‚Äútouch‚Äù. </p><p>  <span>The rating of the best smartphones</span> up to 7000 rubles is as follows: </p><ol><li>  "Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A." </li><li>  Xiaomi Redmi 5A. </li><li>  Meise M6. </li><li>  DOOGEE X30. </li><li>  "Huawei Y5 (2017)." </li></ol><p>  Consider the participants in more detail. </p><h2>  Huawei Y5 2017 </h2><p>  This is one of the best smartphones up to 7,000 rubles, which for some reason turned out to be an underestimated domestic consumer.  His sales are so hot, but here, apparently, a flaw in the marketing of the Huawei company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.takealot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="huavei y5" class="if uuid-2603744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2603744.jpg"></div><p>  The model boasts an attractive appearance, as well as workmanship, where metal competently combines with plastic.  Despite its price tag, the device received a rather nimble set of chipsets: the MKT 6737T quad-core processor, which works in tandem with the Mali graphics accelerator of the T720 series and 2 GB of RAM. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also worth noting is a very good IPS-matrix with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels and an 8-megapixel good camera.  Smartphones up to 7000 rubles do not always have similar bonuses.  Manufacturers do not scatter such offers, and here it is very rare.  The screen has a good supply of brightness and contrast, as well as a competent light sensor.  The viewing angles of the matrix are almost maximum, but only on a fine sunny day it fades, so you have to look for a shadow or constantly cover the gadget with your palm. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The model received 16 GB of internal memory, but if it turns out to be small, then SD cards (up to 64 GB) will come to the rescue.  Batteries with a capacity of 3000 mAh are enough for almost the whole day under mixed loads, well, the model will serve as a dialer and music player for all three days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sanook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="huavei u5 for 7000" class="if uuid-2603748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2603748.jpg"></div><p>  The disadvantages include the lack of the ability to install third-party applications on a memory card, as well as an easily scratched screen.  In the first case, the installation of amateur firmware will be a panacea, in the second - a reliable film with a case. </p><p>  Users mostly respond positively about the model and its capabilities.  Everything that an ordinary smartphone should have is here and it works quite tolerably.  The case is strong, the screen is good, there is sound, applications are launched, and you don‚Äôt seem to expect more from a budget model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Estimated cost of the smartphone is about 6900 rubles. </p><h2>  DOOGEE X30 </h2><p>  This is a pretty good smartphone up to 7000 rubles.  Some users complain about the too simple exterior of the model, but the classic has always been universal and does not go out of style.  The 5.5-inch screen on the IPS-matrix boasts a full scan of 1280 by 720 pixels without a hint of pixelation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="webstar-electro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee x30" class="if uuid-2603743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2603743.jpg"></div><p>  For the performance of one of the best smartphones up to 7,000 rubles, the Mediatek MT6580 series quad-core processor is working, paired with the Mali-400 graphics accelerator.  2 GB of RAM is enough not only for stable operation of the interface, but also for launching a good half of gaming applications. </p><p>  It will be useful to note that the model uses a 32-bit processor.  Yes, he will pull most of the toys, but not all, and for some specific needs, like working with synthetic tests, he is not suitable.  So be sure to pay special attention at this point before buying a smartphone. </p><h2>  Distinctive features </h2><p>  Also, the model was distinguished by an intelligent camera of 8 megapixels and a capacious 3360 mAh battery.  Own memory of 16 GB is enough for everyday needs, in addition, the volume can be increased with the help of third-party drives up to 64 GB.  The only negative that owners sometimes complain is the creaking of the device, but this effect is manifested only with a few exceptions, so the defect cannot be called critical.  In addition, the cost of the gadget does not imply any serious claims. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Users respond ambiguously about the smartphone and its capabilities, but all the roughness is smoothed out by more than an attractive price tag.  It is simply impossible to demand anything more from the gadget for more than five thousand rubles. </p><p>  Estimated price of the model is about 5500 rubles. </p><h2>  Meizu M6 </h2><p>  This is one of the best smartphones up to 7000 rubles.  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that the younger modification of the M6 ‚Äã‚Äãwith 16 GB of internal memory on board falls into this framework, while more advanced versions can cost up to 10 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kimovil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="meise m6" class="if uuid-2603749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2603749.jpg"></div><p>  The model will please the user with a high-quality 5.2-inch screen on an IPS-matrix with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels, a relatively powerful MT675 processor from Mediatek and an intelligent video accelerator Mali-T860.  Helps them all digest RAM in the amount of 3 GB, which is enough for normal operation. </p><p>  Powerful and demanding toys, a set of chipsets may pull, but graphic presets will have to be reset to average, and sometimes to minimum values.  As for the interface, everything is just fine here: no brakes, friezes and other lags were noticed.  All icons are responsive and quickly open on the first tap, tables turn over just as quickly, and the load of these does not affect the performance. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  There are no complaints about the build quality of one of the best smartphones up to 7000 rubles: there are no cracks, nothing creaks, it does not play and does not crunch.  The only fly in the ointment that consumers complain about is the abundance of "left" software, and removing it is not so simple.  Although the problem is solved by flashing it, for the majority it is, again, money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.directd.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m6 16" class="if uuid-2603745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2603745.jpg"></div><p>  Users mostly respond positively about the model.  The M6 ‚Äã‚Äãseries turned out to be the most successful among other budget smartphones of the brand.  There is everything you need for work and entertainment, so it‚Äôs a sin to complain. </p><p>  The estimated price of a smartphone is about 7,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 5A </h2><p>  This is a great smartphone up to 7000 rubles with a good camera.  The 13-megapixel matrix can quite compete with similar gadget cameras from the mid-price and even premium segments, the only possibility of HDR shooting and advanced autofocus are worth it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bukalapak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 5a" class="if uuid-2603746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2603746.jpg"></div><p>  Also, the 5-inch model boasts a bright and high-quality screen on the IPS-matrix with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels and loud speakers.  And the latter take the tracks not only in decibels, but also in depth. </p><p>  A rather impressive set of chipsets is responsible for the gadget‚Äôs performance: the Snapdragon processor, MSM8917 series, the Adreno 308 video accelerator, and fast RAM.  In the basic configuration, in which the model is the best smartphone up to 7000 rubles, 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage are installed. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the device </h2><p>  Both the first and the second are enough not only for the hassle-free operation of the interface, but also for launching modern applications.  In especially "heavy" games, however, you have to reset the visual settings to the minimum values, but other programs go without problems and with a more than playable frame rate. </p><p>  In addition, the device works in high-quality 4G networks of the new generation, which means that there should not be any problems with the Internet.  Due to the presence on board of intelligent software responsible for energy saving, the model boasts a long battery life.  The battery capacity of 3000 mAh is enough for the whole day with a mixed load. </p><p>  If you do not get involved in video and serious gaming applications, then the battery life can be increased to two days.  The only negative, which is difficult to call critical, is a very long battery charge.  Therefore, it is best to leave this process overnight. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the phone is about 6800 rubles. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 5A </h2><p>  Another representative of Xiaomi, which can be called <span>the best smartphone</span> up to 7000 rubles.  Here we are talking about, again, the basic modification of the series with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory.  In other cases, the price tag can reach up to 10 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bionic.com.cy" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi laptop 5a" class="if uuid-2603747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2603747.jpg"></div><p>  The model boasts an attractive appearance, a pleasant to the touch body made of aluminum alloy mixed with plastic, as well as a rather quick set of chipsets.  The latter is equipped, as a rule, with models of the mid-price and not the budget sectors. </p><p>  Responsible for the performance is the aforementioned and well-proven Snapdragon processor, MSM8917 series, working in tandem with the Adreno 308 video accelerator.  As in the previous case, there are no problems with launching applications, but sometimes you have to reset the visual settings to average or minimum values. </p><p>  For the visual component, a large 5.5-inch display with an IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãresponsible, fully revealing a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels.  The pixel per inch indicator ranges from 260, so the pixelation is not visible here, even if you look at the screen with all the attention. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  They didn‚Äôt let us down on the smartphone and camera.  The main 13-megapixel shoots a very good photo and video.  There is sensible autofocus, which works as it should, and is made not for show, and in the presence of full support for HDR mode.  The front camera received a 5 megapixel matrix and is quite suitable for communicating by video messengers and selfies. </p><p>  The model is equipped with a 3080 mAh battery.  As in the previous case, the platform has smart software responsible for energy saving, so in mixed modes the smartphone is enough for almost the whole day. </p><p>  Users leave completely positive reviews about the smartphone.  Despite its modest cost, the model can plug venerable premium gadgets from the premium segment (hi to Samsung and Sony).  So the device fulfills its cost to the fullest. </p><p>  Estimated price of the model is about 7000 rubles. </p>
