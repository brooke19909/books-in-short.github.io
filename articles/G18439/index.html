But this is not entirely true, in the capital of Russia there are many other interesting objects available for visiting, for example, architectural ones.  And this is not only about old mansions, not all tourists know, for example, about the Bohdan Khmelnitsky bridge.  What is this attraction and how is it interesting for visitors? </p><h2>  Krasnoluzhsky bridge in Moscow </h2>

In 1907, all work was completed, and the new design was solemnly commissioned.  The bridge was called Krasnoluzhsky and for many years was included in the railway network.  During the construction of the Third Transport Ring, a significant reconstruction of the structure was carried out, or rather, its almost complete reconstruction.  In the course of the work, the main supporting structure, the arch, was dismantled and moved along the river to the Kievsky station area.  That is how the landmark of the beginning of the 20th century was saved in the capital and a new pedestrian bridge appeared - the Bohdan Khmelnitsky bridge.

The arch of 1907, which was designed by L. D. Proskuryakov, was used as the basis of this design.  The supporting structure weighs about 1,400 tons and has a length of 135 meters.  Initially, the bridge was called Kiev, as it is located in close proximity to the station of the same name.  The arched structure is fully covered with a glass dome and has wide panoramic windows.  Finalization was carried out and the supporting structure.  The modern bridge has reinforced concrete foundations laid out in the riverbed, which in width exceed the arch.  The updated design is designed in yellow-green colors.  Its modern name was given to Bogdan Khmelnitsky Bridge in 2004.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bogdan Khmelnitsky bridge how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1196408.jpg"></div>  The new pedestrian bridge during its existence has already been loved by many residents and guests of the capital.  The very presence of a glass dome allows you to enjoy picturesque views in any weather.  This solution is also useful from a practical point of view.  In rain or snow, it is much more pleasant to travel on a covered bridge.  The interior is simple, but the object looks incredibly stylish and modern.  A competent combination of metal and glass elements can significantly enhance the effect of the tunnel.  Some elements also deserve attention - for example, round shades that illuminate the pedestrian gallery at night.  Inside the pedestrian bridge of Bogdan Khmelnitsky is equipped with benches for relaxation.  In recent years, various shopping stalls have appeared here, which, according to many Muscovites, only spoil the appearance of the attraction.  Also, the bridge boasts open balconies for admiring the picturesque panoramas and creating spectacular photographs, and you can exit them from the main interior through special doors.

The bridge is often removed in all kinds of modern films, commercials and music videos.  Professional and amateur photo shoots are also constantly held here.  Meanwhile, the bridge of Bogdan Khmelnitsky has a rich and interesting history.  In 1977, Marta Petersen, an employee of the CIA who was about to equip the hiding place, was detained on it (the Krasnoluga Bridge at that time).  In 2002, an interesting event was held in this place - 2226 couples in love were kissing here at the same time.  And this figure has become a new world record in its category.  Today, many believe that if you kiss with your partner on this bridge, you can hope for a long and unbreakable love union.  What is curious: the tradition itself is borrowed.  In St. Petersburg there is a Bridge of Kisses, built during the time of Peter the Great, after a kiss on which, according to legend, a romantic couple will never part. </p><h2>  Where is the Bogdan Khmelnitsky bridge in Moscow? </h2>

The nearest metro station is Kievskaya.  To get to this original attraction is not difficult.  You can get on the subway and at the station "Kievskaya" go towards the river.  What is especially convenient - the bridge is visible from afar, and you will not be able to miss such an attraction.

This truly ingenious decision is to preserve a historical monument of architecture and give it a new life.  The discontent of many Muscovites is caused by the number of mini-shops inside such a stylish and modern gallery.  However, those who came to this interesting place for the first time usually do not pay attention to such trifles.  The bridge is a great place for photo shoots.  Often even newlyweds specially come here to take pictures here on their wedding day.  If you walk somewhere nearby, be sure to visit the Bohdan Khmelnitsky bridge.  How to get to this attraction, you already know, the main thing - do not forget to pre-charge the camera.
