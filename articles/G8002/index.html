    <p>  Making this type of loan will be advisable in the following cases: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The lack of a loan opportunity from friends. </li><li>  Emergency situations. </li><li>  Purchasing goods in a store when there is not enough money. </li><li>  Lack of access to classic banking services. </li><li>  Correction of bad credit history. </li><li>  No time to get a regular loan. </li><li>  When it is unprofitable to issue a standard loan, for example, a very small amount is required. </li></ol><p>  It is dangerous to get this type of loan if you can‚Äôt give it away in the near future.  Long term leads to higher rates.  But if you get a small amount for a short time, then the overpayment will be small. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Where to get a microloan?  To do this, you need to contact the MFI, although many banks provide it.  The features of the service include: </p><ol><li>  Different maturities.  MFIs do not limit the time period for refunds. </li><li>  Distribution in Russia.  Now in the country there are many organizations that offer these services.  Everyone can contact the institution that provides favorable conditions. </li><li>  You can borrow money with a bad credit history.  Now even those who previously had difficulty paying a loan are able to arrange loans. </li></ol><p>  The main disadvantage is high rates.  For a day it can be charged within 1.5‚Äì2.5%, and for a month - 44-73%. </p><h2>  Difference from a loan </h2><p>  <span>A microloan is different from a loan.</span>  In addition to the main differences, there are also the following: </p><ol><li>  Loans are issued by banking organizations that have permission to conduct this activity.  It is issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  Macro loans are provided by MFIs and private individuals. </li><li>  With a loan, a large amount is issued at a low interest, but it is often forbidden to pay debt ahead of schedule.  Microloans can be repaid at any time without sanction. </li><li>  To obtain a loan, you need to provide a lot of documents, among which there should be a certificate of income.  Microloans are provided by passport. </li></ol><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  Depending on the method of transferring funds, microloans are of the following types: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  To map.  You can quickly get a microloan on the card.  This type of service is very convenient, because it allows you to use the money without leaving your home.  If the application is approved, you must enter a card account, after which the money will be transferred.  MFIs provide bank card loans with the Visa and MasterCard logos. </li><li>  Microloans in cash.  This is a less common service.  The disadvantages of this method include the need to visit the office.  But some organizations make cooperation with customers comfortable.  For example, Home Money and MigCredit companies draw up a plastic card with the first appeal. </li><li>  To an electronic wallet.  This method of receiving money is also convenient, but a fee is charged for transferring funds to cards.  In addition, systems may have a limit on the amount. </li></ol><h2>  Moneyman </h2><p>  How to get a <span>microloan without failure?</span>  You must contact MoneyMan, where the decision is made in 15 minutes.  For registration is not required to leave the house, collect documents.  It is only necessary to fill out a questionnaire, wait for an answer and receive funds on the card. </p>

    <h2>  Redemption </h2><p>  Debt payment in each company is carried out differently.  Many accept cards, so customers can, without leaving home, transfer funds to company details.

If there is a risk that the selected company is a fraudster, then you should refuse to complete the service. </p>
