Any citizen will be able to bring the idea to life.  The main thing is to act correctly in a particular case. </p><p>  Let's start with the most convenient method for solving the problem - sending an SMS request.  In this case, the driver must write a letter of the established format and send it to a short number.  After the first payment, the user will automatically receive a parking bill.  It will be used for parking operations in the future. </p><p>  It should be noted that depositing money for parking via SMS has several advantages.  It is not only quick and easy, but also convenient.  15 minutes before the end of the parking time, the driver will receive a message with a proposal to extend the parking! </p><h2>  Step-by-step instructions for payment via SMS </h2><p>  How to pay for parking in the center of Moscow?  The instructions below will help you bring the idea to life in a few minutes.  The formation of an SMS request does not require any special knowledge and skills from a person. </p><p>  Accordingly, all actions are reduced to the following steps: </p><ol><li>  To park in the parking lot. </li><li>  Form a message of one type or another on the mobile device and send it for processing. </li><li>  Confirm parking. </li></ol><p>  This is where all the actions end.  How to pay parking via SMS?  A huge role here is played by the formation of the message sent for processing.  With its help, you can not only deposit funds for the parking, but also interrupt / extend the parking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="instructions for paying parking via SMS" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1883444.jpg"></div>

Moscow residents need to focus on the following teams: </p><ul><li>  official parking number * state identifier of the car (number) * hours - payment for parking; </li><li>  X hours - service renewal; </li><li>  S or C - early termination of parking. </li></ul><p>  All SMS must be sent to number 7757. Money for unused parking time will be returned to the driver‚Äôs parking account.  But initially they will be deducted from the balance of the mobile device. </p><h2>  Flat parking </h2><p>  Payment for Moscow parking via SMS can be done differently.  For example, when it comes to flat parking.  In this case, you have to act with some changes. </p><p>  Flat parking in the center of the capital of Russia can be paid by sending an SMS command.  This will require: </p><ol><li>  Park and take a parking ticket. </li><li>  Write a message and send it to a special number. </li><li>  Wait for notification of successful request processing. </li></ol><p>  In this case, the letter format will be as follows: parking ticket number * car number * time (hours). </p><p>  Now the tariff for a flat-type parking in Moscow is 100 rubles per hour.  Depending on the length of time your car was parked, this or that amount of money will be deducted from the account on the citizen‚Äôs mobile phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to pay for parking via SMS" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1883445.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  application </h2><p>  Instructions for paying for parking via SMS are already known.  But quite often, drivers use other options for depositing funds for parking in the capital.  For example, you can download a special mobile program called "Moscow Parking" to your phone and use your Internet connection to implement an idea. </p><p>  The process of transferring money through this application is reduced to the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Download and install on your mobile "Moscow Parking". </li><li>  Register with a unique identifier in it.  To do this, you need to send a message with the text "pin" (without quotes) to the number 7757. </li><li>  Log in to the utility.  In the field "login" write the phone number of the driver, in the "password" - the sent password. </li><li>  Deposit money into your new account. </li><li>  Click on the "Park" button. </li><li>  Indicate the parking place and confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  It may seem that everything is quite confusing.  But this is not so.  This method is in special demand among the population.  Money is not debited from the mobile device, but from the current parking account.  Similarly paid flat parking.  To do this, the program will need to enter the number of the parking ticket, which you receive at the entrance to the parking lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of Moscow parking via sms" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1883446.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Using site </h2><p>  How to pay for parking?  We have already written through SMS, but there are other ways to solve this problem.  Active Internet users can be offered to use the "Personal Account" on a special site in Moscow parking.  With its help, it will be possible not only to pay for the car left in the parking lot, but also to buy a subscription. </p><p>  In such circumstances, it is necessary to act as follows: </p><ol><li>  Go to parking.mos.ru. </li><li>  Click on "My Account" in the upper right corner of the page. </li><li>  Log in to the service. </li><li>  Top up your new account balance.  For example, a bank card. </li><li>  Indicate parking and car details.  This can be done using an interactive map. </li><li>  Confirm the operation by specifying the number of parking hours. </li></ol><p>  We found out how to pay for parking via SMS and the Internet.  All these are quite simple methods that are in great demand among the modern population. </p><h2>  Bank card </h2><p>  But you can do otherwise.  A credit card is also allowed to pay for parking in the capital, as well as St. Petersburg.  To do this in the main city of the Russian Federation: </p><ol><li>  Go to the parking meter and click on the "Pay for parking" button. </li><li>  Confirm parking zone number. </li><li>  Select "Bank Card". </li><li>  Attach the card to a special validator and wait for the operation to be processed. </li></ol><p>  Pretty comfortable.  You can act in a similar way if a person has a parking subscription card. </p><h2>  About replenishment </h2><p>  Now, how to pay for parking via SMS is not a secret.  This is far from the most difficult operation.  Many drivers are faced with ignorance of ways to replenish parking accounts.  This leads to some problems when depositing funds for parking. </p><p>  Drivers can replenish parking accounts with the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Sending "SMS" to number 7757 with the text Y, where Y is the amount of replenishment in rubles. </li><li>  In the "My Account" through the "Moscow Parking".  You can replenish your account with a credit card, through payment systems and using your mobile phone. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pay parking in the center of Moscow instructions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1883447.jpg"></div></li><li>  Through payment terminals "Eleksnet". </li><li>  In the Euroset and Svyaznoy stores. </li><li>  Sketch Cards.  To do this, you need to remove the protective coating and send the number written on the card to number 7757. </li><li>  Using the mobile program "Moscow Parking". </li></ol><p>  Perhaps now it‚Äôs clear how the payment for Moscow parking via SMS is done.  Each driver will be able to cope with this task without much difficulty! </p>
