We have an idea about this fabulously beautiful country on the basis of soap operas "The Rich Also Cry," and various similar to this non-life series.  But the world opening behind the walls of the cinematic "hacienda" is much more incredible and exotic than any film.  What is she - this mysterious Mexico?  The recall of tourists who have already been there will allow us to figure this out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mexico tourist review" class="if" height="491" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/233135.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ancient <span>Mayan</span> and Aztec <span>pyramids</span> framed by the lush greenery of the jungle, colonial palaces among palm trees, <span>Catholic cathedrals,</span> formidable volcanoes, snow-white beaches, paradises of unspoiled nature, huge megacities - all this is Mexico.  The recall of tourists tells us that the country is full of contrasts, and with the splendor of the well-protected rich neighborhoods, the poverty of slums adjoins.  But does Russia, with its Moscow Rublevka and unheated PGT in the winter somewhere in Siberia, not represent the same country of contrasts?  In that case, is it worth it to go to Mexico?  Yes, it is necessary to observe some caution, however, as in any other region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first thing you meet upon arrival in Mexico is the intimidation of guides.  Say, in the country there is not a single ATM issuing the local currency peso.  It‚Äôs better not to go to the city ‚Äúto the locals‚Äù for reasons of preserving life and wallet even in the afternoon.  Do not buy fruit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mexico Cancun Travel Reviews" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/233137.jpg" width="345"></div>  Outside the hotel there is no.  Do not believe it!  Not so scary, this Mexico.  The recall of tourists claims that it is inhabited by a completely friendly and friendly people, and the country is by no means circumvented by civilization.  The only thing that credit card holders (especially Sberbank) need to do is to warn their branch about the trip so that the account is not blocked when trying to withdraw money.

    <p>  The local cuisine is very original, and it‚Äôs just a crime not to try it.  Tequila and mezcal, fried cactus fruits, taco <span>corn tortillas</span> , nachos and toastados stuffed pastries, Olya Prida‚Äôs meat dish, and baked chayote fruit are <span>hallmarks of</span> Mexico's gastronomy.  Do not be afraid to dine in local taverns: unusual taste, hospitality and color are guaranteed.  Here it is customary to tip in the amount of 10% of the order amount.  As for unscrupulous <span>hotel</span> workers <span>, Mexico</span> (the recall of tourists at this point is unambiguous) is not a completely prosperous country.  Valuable things are best hidden in a safe, and if not, grab a small lock on the trip and lock it in your suitcase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mexico riviera maya reviews" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/233138.jpg" width="600"></div>  What is the best place to go?  The most famous resort that Mexico is rightly proud of is Cancun.  Reviews of tourists say that it is a chain of hotels stretching along the Caribbean Sea for 140 km.  Its location near the Mayan sights makes even independent day trips possible.  Also near Cancun there is a network of <span>karst sinot lakes</span> where you can swim.  You can go to "Crocotown" - a reserve with Yucatan crocodiles, and children can be taken to the water park "Wet and Wild."  Fans of outdoor activities will be satisfied with the conditions of diving, and those who can not dive can enjoy the inhabitants of coral reefs from the porthole of a submarine.  Another resort that all of Mexico knows about, the Riviera Maya, is what tourists say as an oasis of clubs and casinos.  It is located fifty kilometers from Cancun and is called Playa del Carmen and Playar.
