Matrona Temple in Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Domes of Moscow are</span> sung in dozens of poems.  White-stone, golden-headed, "Holy Russia and the heart, and the head!"  - this is most often called the capital.  The temples of Moscow are both the heart of Russia and the sights of a unique city.  The center of the Orthodox and Russian worlds, it should burn "like heat with golden crosses." </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow temples" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/542251.jpg" width="350"></div>  The abundance of religious buildings </h2><p>  <span>Churches, cathedrals,</span> monasteries of the capital are known throughout the world.  Many <span>churches in Moscow</span> are under the protection of UNESCO.  There are a lot of religious constructions in this city - temples and chapels in the Moscow diocese 894. Moreover, there are prayer rooms where services are systematically - 383. What is a temple?  The temple is a house dedicated to God, <span>it is a church</span> where ceremonies are performed, the sanctuary of the Lord.  This is the place where there is an altar where the Eucharist is celebrated (thanksgiving, or the essence of the life of the Church).  In a broad sense, a temple is a place of worship for high thoughts.  From which we can conclude the breadth of the concept of the word "temple". </p><h2>  Symbol of the Russian faith </h2><p>  Moscow churches continue to be restored and built.  This is a need of time.  Very often churches are being built with donations from Orthodox communities.  There is a program of "200 temples."  Such energetic construction is connected with the general revival of the Church after the era of prohibitions and persecutions and the physical destruction of religious buildings.  The most striking example is the <span>Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow.</span>  It was built in the 19th century, blown up in the 20th century, and restored again in all its glory in the 21st century.  But many of the destroyed churches are still waiting for their turn - for example, the churches of Alexander Nevsky in Volgograd and Simferopol.  But the capital is the capital, so that everything here is carried out in the first place.  In addition, the residence of the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia is located here, and this obliges a lot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The best of the best </h2>

There are different lists of the most popular Moscow churches - according to a five-star system, which includes many indicators, by attendance, by beauty, by significance in history.  Of course, there are pearls that meet all the needs and requirements, serve as a decoration of the planet and enter the world treasury.  These primarily include St. <span>Basil‚Äôs Cathedral</span> and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow - the main church of Red Square and the center of Orthodoxy.  In addition to the extraordinary beauty and uniqueness of both religious buildings, they are united by the fact that both of them are cenotaph temples, that is, collective tombstones that do not contain the remains of warriors.

In addition, the names of Russian officers who defended Russia at the cost of their lives in companies of 1797-1806 and 1814-1815 were embossed on its walls.  How could this be blown up?  It‚Äôs scary to imagine not even that we had abused the memory of our ancestors, but that this vandalism was sincerely approved by the majority of Soviet people.

Kikin about erecting in Moscow a temple that burnt into the Napoleonic campaign a monument to the national spirit that saved the country.  A failed attempt to create a temple was made under the victorious king Alexander I - the first stone was laid on October 17, 1815, and upon the accession to the throne of hard Nicholas I, construction managers were seated for embezzlement.  But the tsar did not refuse the idea to erect a new Temple of the Savior in Moscow.  He independently chose a site for construction, a project and appointed an executor.  Money was allocated only from the state fund. </p><h2>  Second attempt </h2>

The construction was carried out under the supervision of the king himself.  Large-scale work related to the construction was done - the Catherine Canal was dug, which connected the Moscow River with the Volga.  The cenotaph of 44 years was under construction - it was consecrated only on May 26, 1883.  At first, the construction was directed by the author of the project, K. A. Ton, then the work was continued by his student, academician A. I. Rezanov.  The best sculptors and artists of that time took part in the construction of the temple.  After the opening of the Cathedral of Christ in Moscow (abbreviation - HHS) quickly took a prominent place in the social and cultural life of Russia.

    <h2>  Goodbye, keeper of Russian glory ... </h2><p>  The huge cathedral itself caused complaints from famous artists who considered K. Ton a mediocre architect.  And yet, the new cathedral quickly became one of the symbols of Moscow.  Within its walls, music of outstanding composers sounded, the best singers of Russia performed.  But for the new government, which came after 1917 and declared atheism state policy, there were no authorities.  Guided by the words of the anthem "... we will destroy the whole world of violence to the ground ...", revolutionaries destroyed much of what has been the glory of Russia for centuries.  The conceived Palace of Soviets, under the construction of which the temple-monument was demolished, was never built.  Not for centuries have opened and the pool "Moscow".  The tragic fate of the Temple excited many artists also because the HHS was not just a religious building, not just the main church, which had to be destroyed demonstratively.  It was a monument to the defenders of the Fatherland. </p><h2>  Repentance </h2><p>  Conscientious contemporaries resented what had happened.  In each article about the blown up temple there are lines of the poet N. Arnold.  In 1931 he wrote the holy words - ‚Äú... there is nothing sacred to us!  And is it not a shame that a hat of cast gold fell on the chopping block under an ax ... ‚Äù  And, of course, there are references to the amazing prophetic picture of the artist V. Balabanov ‚ÄúSwimmer‚Äù, in which the author foresaw that the abused temple would be restored.  In the 90s, a movement for the reconstruction of the cathedral could not fail.  The driving force was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrepentance.  In 1990, a stone was installed on the site of the blown up temple, and in 1992 a fund was created, the funds of which were to go to restore the HHS.  Architects M. M. Posokhin and A. M. Denisov created a project for the revival of the temple.  The times were troubled, something must have been done wrong, you can find fault with a lot, nevertheless the truth has triumphed.  And now stands in Moscow a resurrected beautiful monument of tragic Russian history.  Big, central, significant, great.  It differs somewhat from its prototype - both in the color of the walls and in the material from which individual parts are made, for example, medallions.  But he lives his own life, he is the property of our time. </p><h2>  One of the most revered saints </h2>

    <p>  From year to year, the popularity of the old woman is growing.  Therefore, under the "Program +200" in the northern district of the capital, the largest Matrona temple in Moscow is being built.  Construction should be completed in 2015.  At the initiative of the Orthodox community, which has existed here since 2008, it was decided to devote the new church to the blessed Matrona.  Parishioners abandoned the standard project and wanted to build a unique church - it will be a five-domed church with a separate bell tower, a large vestibule will also be crowned with two domes (7 in total).  The temple is designed for 500 parishioners.  Obviously, he will be no less visited than the Intercession Church with the relics of the saint. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Matrona Church in Moscow" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/542260.jpg" width="300"></div>  People from all over Russia go to Moscow to bow to the relics of Matronushka, as they affectionately called her among the people.  Near the temple under construction there is a temporary, always crowded chapel.  88,000 people live in the Dmitrovsky district.  The Matrona Church of Moscow in Moscow is the first religious building dedicated to the blessed old woman.  The need for it is long overdue.  Since the day of death in 1952, her fame has become All-Russian.  She was canonized as a locally revered saint in 1999, general church canonization took place in 2004.
