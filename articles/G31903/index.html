  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The establishment of the Senate in Russia and its features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Senate in Russia replaced the <span>Boyar Duma.</span>  It was created as the highest government body, endowed with broad powers, up to the adoption of laws.  Emperor <span>Peter the Great,</span> as you know, very often left the capital, transferring at that time the administration of the country to some faithful associates, who were supposed to solve issues of national importance in his absence.  Traveling, the king became acquainted with the traditions of European countries in the conduct of domestic politics, the management of foreign monarchs by their states.  The establishment of the Senate was another of his attempts to bring Russia closer to Europe.  Moreover, such a body was very useful for governing the country.  The date of its establishment is considered to be February 22, 1711. </p><p>  Initially, the Senate was created as the supreme governing body of the state during the absence of the emperor.  All persons included in it were appointed by Peter himself.  These were, as a rule, his close associates: <span>Prince Golitsyn,</span> Count Musin-Pushkin, Prince Dolgoruky.  The Emperor appointed Anisim Shchukin as the Secretary-General of the Senate, whose duties now included managing the Imperial Chancellery and overseeing the order during the Senate meetings.  Over time, a system of subordinate institutions was created around the Senate.  The role of mediator between the dominant governing body and the provinces of the country was performed by commissioners (two people from each).  Their duties included monitoring the implementation of decrees adopted by the Senate, as well as the execution of his instructions directly on the ground. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the establishment of the Senate was originally a temporary measure of government, after the termination of the constant absence of the emperor from the country, the role of this body not only did not decrease, but also increased significantly. </p><p>  The activity of the Senate itself extended to all spheres of life of the country's population.  From now on, he could appoint all civilian and military posts, manage the military estate, keep records of persons hiding from <span>military service,</span> and recruit recruits to the Russian army.  In 1722, a new post was established under the Senate to conduct the affairs of the service class - the herald-master.  A special role in the main state body was assigned to the so-called fiscals, whose responsibility was to supervise everything that happens on the territory of the country, solve crimes and expose their perpetrators in court. </p><p>  The establishment of the Senate envisaged the creation of a single full-fledged body of state power, which is in charge of all the country's <span>internal politics</span> .  Its creation was an important step towards the emergence of a new legal process in Russia.  So, in 1722, the Prosecutor's Office was established under the Senate.  The activities of this institution went far beyond its scope and extended to all central and local judicial and administrative institutions.  The highest position at the Prosecutor's Office belonged to the Prosecutor General, his assistant was the Chief Prosecutor.  If earlier unjust actions of senators could be appealed by contacting the sovereign himself, then from 1714, such complaints began to be punished by the death penalty.  Thus, the establishment of the Senate contributed to the formation of a separate institution of power, capable of making important decisions for the country without the presence of the emperor. </p><p>  Moscow remained the main place of residence of the senators for several years, and since 1714 this governing body moved to Petersburg, which was recently built on the banks of the Neva, which becomes its main location and activity. </p><p>  The creation of the Senate was only the first step in organizing the emperor‚Äôs powerful apparatus for governing the country.  This was followed by the formation of colleges, the introduction of the post of prosecutor general at the court, the establishment of the famous Table of Ranks, the publication of a <span>decree on uniform inheritance</span> , etc. </p>
