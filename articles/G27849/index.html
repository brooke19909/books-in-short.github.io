    <p>  There are three types of rewards: </p><p>  - The first contains the phrase "For Valiant Labor".  More than 11000000 such awards have been issued. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - The second option has the words "For military valor."  Of these copies made 2,000,000. </p><p>  - The third option contains no entries.  This type of medal was awarded to foreign persons - members of foreign delegations.  As mentioned above, about five thousand of these awards were presented. </p><p>  The medal was introduced by a resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on 11/05/1969. In total, about eleven million people were awarded, including: working citizens, including 9,000,000, military - 2,000,000, foreigners - 5,000. </p><h2>  Nowadays </h2><p>  Today, the medal "For Military Valor" is awarded to Russian servicemen: </p><p>  - distinguished in military preparations; </p><p>  - distinguished during service, in exercises; </p><p>  - selfless and courageous while serving. </p><p>  - providing public peace and relative security. </p><h2>  Medal 1 and 2 degrees </h2><p>  Awarding the awards is the representative of the Russian defense.  The medal is presented in two degrees.  First, the Military Valor medal is awarded 2 degrees, then - 1. However, if there are other awards, a soldier can immediately receive the first prize.  For the second time, the medal ‚ÄúFor Military Valor‚Äù is not received. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medal for military valor" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39017/1031036.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  The first side has the image ‚Äúheraldic sign - emblem‚Äù, around it there is a laurel wreath with a ribbon.  On the other hand, a signature.  Today, as before, a rectangular base with a 2.4 cm wide speckled cloth comes with the medal.  The award of the first degree differs from the 2nd degree in that in the middle of the ribbon the highest award has one white strip 2 mm wide, and the secondary medal has two stripes 1 mm wide, between them 2 mm. </p><p>  To make the medal, they used topmak (for 2 degrees), nickel silver (for 1 degree).  It is worn on the left side under the heart.  In terms of rating, it is located after state awards.  At first it was made of two components: the medal itself and the standard fastened with rivets.  The standard quickly wore out.  Modern medals are presented in one piece, the color of the standard is covered with one enamel, in connection with which productivity has improved.  The medal is considered the departmental insignia of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medal military valor 2 degrees" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39017/1027461.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lump sum payments </h2><p>  In 2010, the Order of the Minister of Defense No. 500 was issued, according to which, along with the medal for contract servicemen, a one-time payment was equal to 75% of the monthly salary.  According to the third paragraph of this order, monetary compensation is paid on the basis of the order of the chief, for example, a military unit.  This order is issued within three days after the issuance of a higher order from the Ministry of Russia.  True, the order was valid until the end of 2014. </p>
