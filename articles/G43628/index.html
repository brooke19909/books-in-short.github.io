However, even after more than 200 years, it leaves us with a lot of discussion issues.  This is especially true for individuals.  Some of them managed to act as leaders, and perhaps even executioners of the revolution, and its victims.  The most striking example in the list of such personalities remains Maximilian Robespierre.  The article describes the path to Robespierre‚Äôs power, as well as the history of his political collapse, which ended on the guillotine.  When was Robespierre executed?  The date will also become known to you in the process of reading the article. </p><h2>  Maximilian Robespierre before the revolution and at its beginning </h2><p>  The life history of Robespierre until 1789 cannot be called a road to power.  France was then an absolute monarchy, and no one could seriously count on minimal access to power.  Robespierre was born in 1758, and at the time the revolution began, he was 31 years old.  At this point, he received a law degree in one of the most prestigious universities in Europe - the Sorbonne.  He later joined the French Bar.  Before the revolution began, he sided with the Third Estate and, as a qualified expert, had to draw up a normative document that would give this estate equal rights.  That is why he became a member of the <span>General States</span> in 1789, and a few months later the revolution began. </p><p>  During the years 1790-1791 he took part in various debates, in the formation of the National Guard, in the drafting of the Declaration of Human Rights.  By the way, at the beginning of the revolution, the political Jacobin Club was created, and by 1790 Robespierre became its leader. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1940398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/1940398.jpg?1562873435"></div><h2>  Rise to power </h2><p>  In 1792, the monarchy fell in France, and King <span>Louis XVI</span> was executed the following year.  After the overthrow of the king, a new state body was formed - the National Convention.  Initially, Maximilian Robespierre and his club performed in alliance with the Girondins, but opinions began to diverge dramatically.  A curious moment happened already at the end of 1792, when French newspapers began to submit reports from Robespierre's speeches at the Jacobin club as if this organization had already become a national body.  In his speeches, Robespierre repeatedly declared his desire to continue the revolution, clear the country of traitors, including in the army.  In addition, the Girondins began to pay great attention to the province, which, according to Robespierre, could threaten the country with tendencies towards separatism.  In May 1793, the Girondins expelled the Jacobin Marat from the Convention, and several more were arrested.  This caused a scandal and statements about the betrayal of the interests of the revolution by the Girondins.  In response, Robespierre staged a coup, removing all Girondins from power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1940394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/1940394.jpg?1562873435"></div><h2>  Terror </h2><p>  In June 1793, a friend and ally of Maximilian Robespierre Marat was killed.  This was not only a personal insult to the leader of the Jacobins, but also an occasion to respond with violence to violence.  A Committee for Public Safety was formed.  This form of organization of power was called ‚Äútyranny of freedom‚Äù, supposedly before the victory of the revolution it is necessary to tolerate and eliminate undesirable elements, for example, the enemies of France, traitors and deserters.  The period from September 1793 to July 1794 is called the era of terror, or the Jacobin dictatorship.  A key place in these events was played by leader Maximilian Robespierre.  During this period, about 40 thousand people were executed, among them many well-known politicians, generals and even scientists, for example, the founder of modern chemistry, Lavoisier. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1940393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/1940393.jpg?1562873435"></div><h2>  Reforms of Maximilian Robespierre </h2><p>  In addition to organizing terror, Robespierre made several major changes: </p><ol><li>  Peasant reform.  Since the Jacobins relied on the lower classes, they began the redistribution of land. </li><li>  New Constitution.  According to it, France became a republic, but until the end of the terror, Robespierre was in power, who actually became a dictator. </li><li>  "Suspicious Act."  Allowed the relevant services to arrest anyone who could be suspected of betraying the interests of France. </li><li>  Attempt to introduce the Cult of the Supreme Being.  Thus, Maximilian Robespierre tried to take a step to reduce the role of the church, and possibly even to create a new faith. </li></ol><h2>  Arrest and investigation </h2><p>  In 1794, terror became widespread, and even members of the Jacobin club ceased to understand its necessity.  A split was brewing in the organization, and many understood that Robespierre must be removed to end the regime.  On July 27, 1794, at a meeting of the Convention, a brawl began, at night it came to a shootout, during which Robespierre was wounded in the jaw.  He was seized and sent to the body that he himself created - the Committee of Public Salvation.  The surgeon had an operation on him, and the Committee sentenced him to death. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1940396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/1940396.jpg?1562873435"></div><h2>  The execution of Robespierre.  Headless Revolution </h2><p>  When did the execution of the sentence take place?  The execution of Robespierre and his supporters took place in the morning of July 28.  He was put in a wagon and taken to Revolution Square.  By the way, the wagon was driving near Robespierre‚Äôs house, which by that time had already been completely searched, the window was boarded up, and someone even doused it with red paint. </p><p>  Together with Maximilian Robespierre, his younger brother was executed.  The instrument was chosen classic for that time - the guillotine.  It was M. Robespierre who made it massive.  The execution (year - 1794th) was the logical conclusion of his activities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1940391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/1940391.jpg?1562873435"></div><h2>  Memory in culture </h2><p>  After the execution, Robespierre (year 1794) was not forgotten.  His figure for a long time all over the world frightened and attracted cultural figures.  It was they who made a lot of efforts to attract public interest in this historical figure.  So, the classics of French literature wrote works about this figure, for example, Roland put on a play named after him, and Robespierre is present as a character in Hugo‚Äôs novel ‚ÄúThe 93rd Year‚Äù. </p><p>  In the movie, the image of Robespierre appeared after 1938, in the film "Marie Antoinette."  In 2016, the third part of the film ‚ÄúAliens‚Äù was shot, in which Robespierre appears as one of the characters. </p><h2>  Robespierre and various names </h2><p>  Today, a metro station in Paris, a college and a school in France are named after Robespierre.  Until 2014, there was <span>Robespierre embankment</span> in St. Petersburg <span>.</span>  In France, since the 1960s, discussions have been ongoing about renaming one of the streets of Paris in honor of the leader of the Jacobins.  In addition, during World War II, he was named after one of the partisan anti-Nazi groups in France.  By the way, the image of Robespierre was used during the last elections in France: his face was placed next to the inscription "No corruption." </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1940389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/1940389.jpg?1562873435"></div><h2>  Journalistic activity </h2><p>  In addition to his political career, Maximilian Robespierre also engaged in journalistic activities, for example, wrote articles in newspapers.  For the first time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpublishing his works arose in France.  In the years 1912-1914 several volumes were printed.  Already in the 1950s, the idea arose to translate into Russian and publish in Moscow.  The fact is that in Soviet times there was very great admiration for this person, he was considered one of the main creators of the Great French Revolution.  In 1959, the book "Revolutionary Law and Justice" was published, and already in 1965 a collection of his works in three volumes was published.  It included not only his articles, but also speeches at various meetings.  By the way, the French edition today has more than 11 volumes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1940385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41738/1940385.jpg?1562873435"></div><h2>  Score in history </h2><p>  Robespierre is a very controversial person, not only on the scale of the French Revolution, but also on the scale of world history.  On the one hand, it was the peak of the revolution in France, complicated by international intervention, and Robespierre could really see people who did not act in the interests of the French people.  However, later the terror for Robespierre turned into an instrument of struggle against the opposition, in the elimination of objectionable individuals.  Ultimately, Maximilian wanted to ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù France and possibly return the republic, but as a result he became a victim of his own regime, not completing his business, which adds to the discussion about this historical figure. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that already in the 20th century he became a role model for many dictators.  His thoughts about continuing the revolution, bringing it to a victorious end and the struggle with its enemies were repeated practically word for word by Stalin. </p>
