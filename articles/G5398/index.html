Often, users begin to delve into such details, because some devices from this company do not allow to reflash them.  It is also inconvenient that when buying a phone directly from China, the consumer will not be able in the future to change the OS to a Russified or other localized system due to closed access to the bootloader. </p><p>  Of course, a logical question immediately arises: "Why does the manufacturer not support the use of its technology in all corners of the Earth?"  Or is he trying to introduce the Chinese language to a wider application?  Of course, this is not so.  This is due to the fact that it has become popular to fake phones and official firmware from "Hiomi".  The fact is that the software can contain a huge number of viruses that can collect data from the phone.  That is why all official devices do not allow changing firmware.  In the article, we will consider how to unlock the Xiaomi bootloader. </p>

    <h2>  Another reason the bootloader is locked </h2><p>  There is another significant reason why the Chinese manufacturer prefers to block access to the bootloader.  If suddenly the phone is stolen from the consumer or he loses it, then due to blocking, the new owner of the device will not be able to reflash it and receive data, personal information.  Moreover, each gadget has its own Mi-account.  Although it’s worth admitting that fraudsters often ask themselves how to unlock the Xiaomi bootloader.  And, most likely, they possess the necessary skills.  In the latest versions of the original software, you may notice new options.  One of them has a function that allows you to locate the phone or tablet.  The second is responsible for sending absolutely any text to the device’s home screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to determine if the bootloader is locked via PC? </h2><p>  Most often, users encounter this problem when working with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro phone.  Unlocking the bootloader will be easy.  However, this process will take from a week to a month. </p><p>  In order to find out whether the bootloader is unlocked or not on any phone of the Chinese manufacturer “Hiomi”, you need to go into a mode called fastboot.  First you need to connect the device to the computer.  After that, you need to write the word "run" in the Start menu.  Using it, we go to the command line.  We enter the letters adb and there we write a special phrase.  As a rule, each phone has the same one and looks like this: fastboot oem device-info.  After that, one of the inscriptions will appear on the screen: true or false.  The first option indicates that the bootloader is activated, and the second is not unlocked. </p><p>  If it does not work, then you must immediately say that it will be difficult to obtain Root rights, even if they had already been activated previously.  The fact is that if the initial version of the firmware does not have a locked bootloader, it may become one after updating the software.  In order to accomplish this, you will have to use the special program PC Suite.  Moreover, the update process will not work through Mi Flash.  Therefore, to use the usual functionality, you will have to return everything to its original position.  This article describes how to unlock Xiaomi bootloader. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Indication of reasons for unlocking? </h2><p>  This statement must be written as fully and openly as possible.
