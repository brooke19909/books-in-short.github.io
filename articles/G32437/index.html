    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  So, it was said that the Grand Park Lara 5 hotel offers a luxurious stay at fairly low prices.  And indeed it is.  So, for example, a standard double room with a wide comfortable double bed, with a TV, air conditioning and all the amenities included will cost 28 thousand rubles for seven nights.  Thus, for an unforgettable luxury vacation, everyone will give only 14 thousand.  When compared with other eminent hotel complexes, where some give this amount for one night spent at the hotel, we can confidently say that this is really a very economical option.  Or, for example, a deluxe family room.  Balcony with a gorgeous view, bathroom, furniture, air conditioning, TV, and everything else - for four it will cost about 49,000 rubles for the same 8 days and 7 nights.  A little more than 12 thousand rubles from each vacationer.  Looking at these prices, you can understand why the Grand Park Lara 5 is so popular among visitors.  It is for this reason that it is recommended to reserve apartments at least a month before check-in, because there may not be any free places.  This is because everyone wants to relax on a five-star system, but at a low cost. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  I must say that even if a person is tired of beach activities and wants to stay at the hotel, it will be possible to have a great time without going beyond his threshold.  Spa, sauna, Turkish bath, fitness room, billiards, free Internet access, evening shows, a kids mini club, pool, table tennis, darts - all this and much more the hotel offers its customers.  In general, each guest will find an occupation that he will like. </p>
