It has a rich and eventful history, as well as beautiful temple architecture.  About datsan, the history of its creation, its features and much more will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Tamchinsky datsan is located in the village of <span>Gusinoe Ozero,</span> belonging to the Selenginsky district of the Republic of Buryatia in Russia.  It was founded in 1741 by Lama Lubsan-Zhimba on the banks of the Temnik River.  Initially, the datsan was a simple yurt made of felt.  A little later, he was transferred to his current place, on one of the shores of Goose Lake, to Mount Tsogto Khongor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="asiarussia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Datsan buildings in the 19th century" class="if uuid-2625163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2625163.jpg"></div><p>  A new place for construction was indicated by the Shireete Lama (cathedral, patronal) of the Tsugol datsan Damba-Darzhey. </p><p>  The Tamchinsky datsan was built in 1750.  It is worth noting that this was the first building of this type in the Russian Empire, built of wood. </p><p>  After 33 years, Gusinoozersky and four more datsans, located on the left bank of the Selenga River, are separated from the main Buddhist monastery in the village of Tsugol.  In fact, the Tamchinsky datsan becomes the residence of the highest ranks of the Buddhists of Siberia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Datsan in the XIX-XX centuries </h2><p>  In 1848, the monastery complex includes already 17 temples.  In the period from 1858 to 1870, the Buryat Buddhist clergy enlisted the support of the leadership of Eastern Siberia and erected the main temple - Tsogchen (general assembly house) made of stone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="admselenga.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Main temple" class="if uuid-2625160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2625160.jpg"></div><p>  In 1861, a religious philosophical school was opened at datsan to prepare the future Buddhist clergy.  This contributed to the emergence of a large number of Buddhist scholars of a very high level. </p><p>  The Tamchinsky datsan in Buryatia was the religious center of Buddhists until 1930.  However, when the anti-religious campaign reached its peak, in 1938 the datsan had to be closed.  Three years later, a prison for political prisoners was located in its buildings, and an anti-religious museum was opened in one of its buildings. </p><h2>  The second half of the XX century </h2><p>  In 1957, the government of the Buryat Autonomy issued a decree that recognized the recognition of the Tamchinsky datsan as a monument of history and architecture.  In 1960, large-scale restoration work began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="selorodnoe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deer stone" class="if uuid-2625166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2625166.jpg"></div><p>  In 1973, some relics from the datsan were transferred to the <span>Ethnographic Museum of the Transbaikal Peoples,</span> which is located in Ulan-Ude. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In mid-September 1989, at the foundation level of one of the dilapidated buildings of the datsan, the monks discovered the deer stone, which was split into six parts.  Such stones were installed next to the graves or directly on them.  They are attributed to the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age.  To restore it, they invited masters from the Hermitage.  A year later, the stove was completely restored, and then installed in front of the main building of the datsan. </p><p>  In 1990, the Tamchinsky datsan was transferred to the Central Buddhist clergy of the USSR.  And a year later he was visited by the Dalai Lama XIV. </p><h2>  Datsan description </h2><p>  Datsan is a fairly large village, which has the correct grid of streets.  In the central part of the rectangular village (130 x 150 meters), the main datsan temple was created, consisting of three floors - Tsogchen (general meeting house).  Around it were seven smaller churches (dugans, sumies). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Datsan buildings" class="if uuid-2625167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2625167.jpg"></div><p>  Among small temples, the Maidari Temple stands out, which has two tiers.  It contains a twelve-meter statue of the Bodhisattva Maidari (Buddha of the coming time).  It was created by Buryat cabinetmakers and covered with a layer of gilding. </p><p>  In one of the buildings of the Tamchinsky datsan there was a printing house that printed books in Mongolian and Tibetan languages. </p><h2>  The main temple of datsan </h2><p>  The project of Tsogchen - the main temple of the datsan - was created by the architect of the monastery, and then signed by the supreme lama.  The lower floor of the datsan, made of stone, reached a height of five meters and had an almost square shape around the perimeter.  There are 30 columns inside the first floor, and a six-column portico adjoins it.  All lamas and monks gathered in this hall during various ceremonies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buddha in the main temple" class="if uuid-2625164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2625164.jpg"></div><p>  In the northern part of the hall are various Buddha statues, which are located on special pedestals, and altars are installed next to them.  On the other walls are images of the Buddha, as well as jewelry from various fabrics. </p><p>  The second floor of the main temple was created from logs, and then sheathed with a board.  A graceful roof crowns it, each corner of which is bent up.  The temple reaches a height of about 19 meters and looks pretty impressive.  Currently, in the Tamchinsky datsan, the llama racer (Budaev) is constantly located in the temple;  some pilgrims manage to communicate with him, which is considered a great success. </p><p>  The main temple of the datsan is a vivid example of the Buryat temple architecture of the XIX century and is considered to be an architectural monument. </p><h2>  Tamchinsky datsan: how to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.12146109999999" data-lng="106.26554480000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/6/1/2/5612.png"></div><p>  Datsan is located 150 km from Ulan-Ude, which previously made the path there long enough.  However, in November 2015, a new highway was built, which allows you to get to datsan in comfort.  You cannot get from Ulan-Ude, however you can get to Gusinoozersk.  To do this, at the bus station "Selenga" you need to catch a bus following the route: Ulan-Ude - Kyakhta.  After an hour and a half you will reach Gusinoozersk.  In order to get to the datsan himself, you have to get on the way. </p><p>  Many get to the Tamchinsky datsan by taxi.  The journey from the bus station in Ulan-Ude will cost 800 rubles. </p><p>  Arriving in Ulan-Ude and getting acquainted with its many attractions and stunning nature, you should definitely visit the Tamchinsky datsan, which has preserved the original and interesting culture of Buryatia. </p>
