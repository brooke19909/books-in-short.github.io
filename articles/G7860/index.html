This damage can easily get an ASUS device and a Samsung tablet.  Screen replacement in this case is possible.  Often, to fix the problem, contact the service centers, but you can try to fix the problem yourself.  These devices have strong glass, which is even difficult to scratch.  You can check this if you take the already broken screen and draw it with a knife.  Another case is to sit on a gadget, then the glass breaks easily.  Replacing the screen on an ASUS tablet is a waste of money, time and effort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Touch Screen Replacement </h2><p>  In some models, you can change the touch screen separately from the display itself, it most often crashes or malfunctions.  This replacement is difficult in that it is necessary to separate the display and the sensor, and this is very difficult to do, since they are tightly connected.  Changing the glass on the tablet is much easier than on the phone, of course, this is due to the size of the device.  Do not forget that before undertaking to replace the screen, you must have basic knowledge of computer repair.  Otherwise, you can only do harm, which subsequently entails a big waste of money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet repair screen replacement" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1185209.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Before buying a screen, you need to inspect its brocade number.  If you change and buy a touch screen yourself, then be sure to look at its number.  In some devices, "Samsung" and ASUS - different screens.  They may be similar in appearance and fit in size, but if they are interchanged, then your device will not work.  Of course, there are variations of the touch screen, which will suit many devices, but this must first be learned from the manufacturers. </p><h2>  Resolving Touch Screen Issues </h2><p>  The touch screen of the required version is difficult to find.  If you are going to change it to a screen of a similar model, you will need to flash the digitizer.  This is an additional waste of money, time and effort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you have a device with built-in 3G, then the digitizer will be different from a regular board, since the SIM card slot is located inside. </p><p>  If you changed the touch screen, but it does not work, contact the service center, as you did something wrong.  In this case, a specialist will inspect your device and take the necessary actions.  You will not be able to bring the device back to life, only a professional using his tablet with special programs will restore the touch screen. </p><p>  Replacing the screen on a tablet is not an easy process.  If you have not encountered this before, it is very difficult to do everything without errors.  Useful tips to help you when installing a new touch screen: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Replacing the screen on the tablet is a rather painstaking process, when installing a new glass, be careful not to get dust and dirt.  That is why it is not necessary to peel off the glass from the matrix ahead of time.  So you save time and will not clean the tablet in the future. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Before replacing the screen, inspect the glass for damage and scratches.  After that, bring it to the tablet and check if it fits in size.  All this must be done, as you may come across defective glass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung tablet screen replacement" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1185211.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tablet matrix </h2><p>  Replacing the screen on the tablet is not only installing a new touch screen, there are many more malfunctions, but they are less common.  A tablet with a broken matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmore difficult to meet, since it is not so sensitive and it is quite difficult to damage it if the <span>glass is</span> not <span>broken.</span>  In this case, the replacement procedure will not differ from the installation of the touch screen.  You need to order a new matrix, peel off the sensor and stick to another part of the screen. </p><p>  Replacing the screen on the tablet, namely the matrix itself, is more expensive than changing the touch screen.  But there are other differences.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãeasier to find, since you can pick it up from another model.  The only thing is that you need to distinguish between the mounts themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="screen replacement on asus tablet" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41225/1185208.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Replacing the screen on a tablet is a painstaking, expensive and complicated process.  To change the glass on the device, you just need to disassemble the case, this should not be a problem.  Examine the mounts, see the code of the components that you will change.  As we have already found out, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe most expensive part of the screen and you need to be especially careful with it.  In many models, the battery is connected to the device body, it must be removed very carefully.  If you need to replace the screen in an expensive model, then it is better to contact specialists so that then the repair does not come out much more expensive.  If glass is damaged in cheap <span>Chinese tablets,</span> it‚Äôs better not to risk it, but to buy a new gadget.  Replacing the screen in them will cost almost like a new device. </p>
