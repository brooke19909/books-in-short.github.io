    <p>  A small hotel complex is located almost on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in the territory of a small village called Konakli.  It is worth noting that many people will like this location, since from here you can quickly get to the famous resort city of Alanya (Alanya).  Mirabell Hotel 4 is located just three kilometers away.  From here it is easy to get to the busy city center, as public transport is constantly running. </p><p>  But the nearest airport is far away - the distance to Antalya is 130 kilometers.  But, again, for an additional fee, hotel staff will help to book a transfer to the airport, although it will take a long time to go. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that next to the hotel there is not only the sea - on the one hand it is surrounded by mountains, which creates a beautiful panorama.  There is a highway between the sea shore and the hotel territory, but the traffic here is not so busy, so the noise of cars is unlikely to bother you. </p><h2>  Short hotel description </h2><p>  The hotel complex Mirabell Hotel 4 (see photo above) consists of three buildings - this is one small three-story building and two six-story buildings.  The main building has a spacious lobby and reception. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the hotel cannot boast of spacious territory, since almost the entire area is occupied by residential buildings, catering establishments and a large swimming pool.  Nevertheless, even such a small piece of land stands out with its elegant design - palm trees and exotic plants grow everywhere, it‚Äôs nice to walk along neatly laid paths, and you can always relax on a comfortable bench in the shade of trees. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel was built in 1993.  But the last thorough reconstruction was carried out not so long ago - in 2007.  Therefore, it is not worth worrying about the quality of repairs and the availability of modern devices. </p><h2>  Description of hotel rooms </h2>

Of course, the apartments are furnished according to all international standards, so you will find a soft bed and a full set of necessary furniture.  There is even a large desk that will appeal to people who need to work. </p><p>  The bathroom will also appreciate modern equipment.  A large bathtub to relax in is available only in deluxe rooms.

Bed linen is changed according to the hotel schedule - twice a week. </p><p>  Most of the rooms have access to a small private balcony.  And depending on the location of your room, the windows will open a view of the sea, mountains or the courtyard of the hotel. </p><p>  Room service is charged separately, but it works around the clock.  By the way, the hotel offers a free service "alarm clock". </p><h2>  The food scheme in the hotel complex </h2>

    <p>  Naturally, travelers who go on vacation are primarily interested in questions about whether the hotel has its own beach and at what distance it is located.  Fortunately, the Club Hotel Mirabell 4 has a private beach line, and it takes no more than five minutes to go to it.  By the way, a convenient and safe underground passage leads there. </p><p>  The beach is sandy and clean, as cleaning is done daily.  But most tourists complain about the not very convenient descent.  The fact is that the coast here is a rock, which is unsafe to walk along, since the surface is very slippery.  But not so long ago, a wooden pier was built on the beach, so the problem with the descent disappeared by itself.  In addition, there is a good sandy descent into the sea at the place where the stone boulder ends. </p><p>  Not far from the shore there are rows of comfortable sunbeds and wide umbrellas that protect from the sun - hotel guests can use them for free.  There is also a rental point for clean towels, but this service is paid separately, so you should prepare for the additional costs.  In addition, you can use air mattresses, but they, again, are paid.  On the beach there is a small bar in which guests of the Mirabell Hotel 4 are offered a good selection of soft drinks, including juices, lemonade, sparkling water and some alcoholic cocktails.  Rescuers also work here who monitor the behavior of vacationers and, in which case, are ready to provide first aid. </p><h2>  Is it possible to engage in water sports? </h2><p>  One can hardly imagine a beach holiday without sports, playful competitions and a drop of extreme sports.  And on the beach of Club Hotel Mirabell 4 all conditions for active pastime are created. </p><p>  There are specially designated areas where beach volleyball competitions are regularly held.  In addition, there is a range of services that are not included in the price.  In particular, you can always use the services of a diving school.  Here you will receive special training courses in scuba diving, help you choose the right equipment, and then provide an opportunity to get an unforgettable experience - to explore the underwater world of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>  In addition, on the beach for a relatively small fee you can ride a catamaran or a boat, as well as receive a dose of adrenaline from a stunning water ski or parachute ride. </p><h2>  Entertainment and wellness treatments for tourists </h2>

    <p>  Every year, Turkey is becoming increasingly attractive to foreign travelers.  After all, the tourism business and, accordingly, the services here are constantly being developed and improved.  And quite often, tour operators offer their clients a rest at the Club Hotel Mirabell 4. Reviews indicate that this hotel can really provide good living conditions. </p><p>  Of course, any hotel complex has both advantages and disadvantages.  The same applies to the Mirabell Hotel 4 <span>(Alanya, Turkey).</span>  To begin with, it is worth noting that the rooms in the hotel are really kept clean.  On the other hand, there are many paid services, including the use of a safe and a refrigerator, which is not very convenient. </p><p>  Dining at the hotel, as tourists say, is quite good.  Three times a day, guests are offered a wide selection of dishes, including various types of meat, desserts and cold dishes.  But some tourists complain of a shortage of fresh fruit.  Fortunately, not far from the residential building there are several grocery stores where you can buy everything you need. </p><p>  Perhaps the only really significant minus is the lack of discos and parties that youth like so much.  But the daily show program is at a good level, and a night club can be found in the city, where buses and taxis regularly run. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the working personnel.  Hotel service is really up to standard.  Employees are always polite and always ready to help.  But you can encounter the problem of the language barrier, since not all hotel workers speak Russian. </p><p>  To summarize, we can say that Mirabell Hotel 4 (Alanya) is intended primarily for a relaxing beach holiday.  Mostly families with children come here, elderly people, as well as those tourists who need a hotel only as an overnight stay.  On the other hand, living in this hotel is not so expensive, which is a definite plus. </p>
