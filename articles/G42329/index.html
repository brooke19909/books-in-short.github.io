The latter consists of three hotels.  Its infrastructure includes two more hotels - ‚ÄúClub‚Äù and ‚ÄúGardens‚Äù.  The hotel is quite fashionable, with a good reputation and has long hosted holidaymakers.  The reviews about it are overwhelmingly good.  In principle, they can be compared with the responses of guests who visited a similar hotel in the same line - Sea Life Resort 5 (Turkey).  Although it is often believed that the Egyptian "fives" are inferior to the "Ottoman", we can say that in this case this is not so. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea life resort 5" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/524817.jpg" width="276"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in a resort area called South Sinai.  Hotel Sea Life Resort 5, as already mentioned, stands right on the beach.  In addition, it is not only the Red Sea, but also one of the most beautiful <span>coral bays of</span> Sharm - Nabq Bay.  The hotel is not far from the airport - five kilometers, but the planes do not interfere with relaxation and rest.  From here you can reach Naama Bay.  About ten kilometers from the hotel to the center of this resort, and only five to the famous Soho Square - the most European place of Sharm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea life family resort 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/524835.jpg" width="600"></div>

But many tourists prefer to travel to the center of the village on their own to take a walk along the promenade, buy fruit, or go to a nightclub or disco.  To do this, you can use a taxi (they are not particularly expensive here) or blue minibuses that go along the highway quite regularly and make stops at each hotel at the request of passengers.  The climate in Naama Bay is fairly even.  The air temperature practically does not rise above thirty-five and does not fall below twenty-three.  Water is never colder than 22 degrees, even in winter.  However, in these places there are windy days and storms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea life resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/524819.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What do we know about this resort? </h2><p>  Sea Group hotels have always had a great location on the seashore.  And this applies not only to Sharma.  In Turkey, for example, the hotel of this chain - Sea Life Family Resort 5 - is located near one of the most beautiful bays of the Mediterranean Sea.  But our hotel will not yield to him in anything.  Nabq Bay, where the Egyptian Sea Life Hotel is located, geographically refers to Naama Bay Resort.  And this is a vacation spot, verified by many generations of tourists.  Hotels for lovers of the sea, fish and coral began to build here a very long time.  Here, restaurants, nightclubs, shops, shops and boutiques stretch for miles.  The local Eastern Bazaar is very good - the reviews of tourists about it are the most enthusiastic.  It is advised to change currency not at the hotel, but at the local banks - on the streets of Naama Bay a very favorable rate.  In general, this resort is considered the most landscaped part of Sharm El Sheikh. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this hotel complex consists of three parts - Sea Life, Club and Garden.  The latter is on the second line, and from it farthest to go to the sea.  The hotel has a good design, the buildings are made of red brick and built in the traditional Nubian style.  These are small two-three-story houses, each of which has eight to ten rooms.  There is a bank at Sea Life Resort 5 where you can exchange money for local currency.  There is a pharmacy, as well as several shops with papyrus, perfumes and other Egyptian souvenirs.  You can park the car.  It is very green, and there is where to walk.  In a word, this is a real oasis in the desert.  Everywhere flowers, trimmed bushes, palm trees.  The garden is constantly engaged, washed paths.  Since there are several hotels here, the territory is not only beautiful and tastefully decorated, but also huge.  Many fountains, bridges, arbors.  The most pleasant-looking and stylish gardens are in Sea Life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea life resort hotel 5" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/524824.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The staff at Sea Life Resort 5 Sharm are excellent, based on reviews.  Good-natured, smiling, responds to any question, almost everyone speaks good Russian.  No rudeness, no conflicts.  All problems are solved very quickly.  Placed quickly - in a few minutes.  People are very nice, friendly, serve vacationers at the highest level.  The waiters are extremely quick, the bartenders are funny and executive.  Gardeners perfectly maintain order and comfort throughout.  Good management.  The people who work here greet you by simply meeting on the paths of the hotel park in the evenings.  They are really interested in how much you and your children like it here.  They actually put their soul into what they do.  When you visit the hotel again, a fruit platter is brought to your room. </p><h2>  Restaurants and Food </h2><p>  Food at the hotel is served as a buffet in the all inclusive mode.  Every evening there is a themed dinner with cuisine from different countries.  At the same time, you can eat not only in the main restaurants of various hotels included in this complex.  Hotel Sea Life Resort 5, the reviews of which we are examining here, has four more good √† la carte establishments.  This is El Diwa, which specializes in Lebanese cuisine, Teppanyaki, where there are good Japanese dishes for lovers of the Far East, as well as Italian and French restaurants.  Three of the four above-mentioned establishments can be visited during leisure for free.  The menu is good everywhere and the atmosphere is appropriate.  If we compare the food in restaurants by appointment, for example, with the Turkish ‚Äúfive‚Äù Sea Life Family Resort 5 in Antalya, then the Egyptian version is tastier, more diverse and more interesting. </p><p>  In the pool bar, as usual, cocktails are mixed and cooling drinks are served.  You can also have a snack there.  And the Ser Francis Drake pub is still good for lovers of dance and active relaxation.  Disco parties are often held here.

A special menu is offered for children, and ice cream is served at lunchtime.  By the way, you can eat in the restaurants of all three hotels of the complex.  The food is very tasty, varied, most tourists praise it.  Good soups, stewed and fried vegetables (especially eggplant) and fish.  As always in Egypt, great pastries.  Cocktails are not only excellent, but also beautiful, many take pictures of them.  In a la carte restaurants, lamb in El Diwan was especially praised.  By the way, for dinner it is highly recommended to come not in tracksuits, shorts and T-shirts, but in some evening ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Sun, air and water </h2><p>  No wonder this hotel is called Sea Life Resort 5. Charm is really famous for its corals, fish and underwater life.  And here at your service is a huge magnificent beach - four hundred and fifty meters of sand.  The coral reef right here, you can say, at your feet.  No need to go anywhere to watch all this beauty.  A variety of beach accessories - umbrellas, sunbeds and deck chairs - enough for everyone.  There is a shallow part where children can swim.  True, deeper into the sea - strong currents, so you need to be careful.  In the windy season, swimming is allowed only after lunch.  However, fish can be seen from the pontoon at the Sea Club Hotel and even from shallow water.  By the number of fish and corals, this is one of the most beautiful places.  The complex has several pools that belong to three hotels, and in all of them you can swim living in Sea Life. </p><h2>  Let's look around - where can I go? </h2><p>  Not very far from the hotel there is a water park belonging to it, but it is paid for vacationers.  From the vicinity, it is advised to visit the Soho Square shopping and entertainment center on their own.  There you can spend the evening and the whole day, and come with children - no one will be offended, and everyone will find entertainment.  In addition, well-known bands often perform on the Soho stage, and there is always the opportunity to listen to good live music.  Animators in the evenings can take to paid discos in the city.  Of the nightclubs of Naama Bay, they recommend Le Pasha and Hard Rock Cafe.  As always, desert safaris on ATVs are very popular in <span>Egyptian resorts</span> .  Excellent sea excursions are offered by the diving center.  They are also cheaper here.  Many tourists use their stay in the South Sinai and travel to the Sea Life Resort 5 hotel not only to visit the surroundings, but also to get to know Israel and Jordan. </p><h2>  How much money do you need to relax here? </h2><p>  Of course, this is not the cheapest hotel.  The price of a tour for two for a week with a flight and an all-inclusive system starts from fifty thousand rubles (or one thousand two hundred dollars).  But if you want a good and memorable vacation, then do not regret it.  Entrance to the water park on the territory of Sea Life Resort 5 (Egypt) costs about fifteen dollars, but families with children recommend it.  Smoke a hookah in Sea Club will cost $ 10.  To go to Soho by taxi, you will pay ten dollars, and you can return by bus for seven or eight.  But there is a difference in prices.  A yacht with diving - fifty dollars at the hotel, 35 - in the center for deep sea swimming.  Therefore, many are advised to take excursions from Egyptian tour operators.  They are almost the same in comfort, service and security, but they are much cheaper.  Here is another example - an excursion to Israel with a hotel guide costs two hundred dollars, and at a local agency - one hundred. </p><h2>  Sea Life Resort 5 Reviews.  How tourists rate their vacation here </h2><p>  This hotel is highly recommended for families with children - here they pay a lot of attention.  In addition, the entrance to the water is safe for them.  Many tourists come here not for the first time and are happy to come back again.  The contingent is very diverse: Belarusians, Ukrainians, Germans, British, Italians ... This is a place where you can really relax from everyday life, everyday life and hustle, and service is simply at the highest level.  In some reviews, guests call the <span>hotel the best hotel</span> in Sharm El Sheikh.  It is very comfortable and calm, but the youth will not be bored.  For people who specifically come to Egypt to snorkel and enjoy the fish and marine life, this hotel is a true paradise.  Sea Life Resort 5, the photo of which you see as an illustration, amazed many seasoned tourists with cleanliness, homeliness and true oriental hospitality.  And his staff are people who will make your stay amazing and charge with positive emotions for the rest of the year. </p>
