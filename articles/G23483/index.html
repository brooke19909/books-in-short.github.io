Just entering the house, you notice a doll sitting on a hat shelf.  In the kitchen, a rag cook holds a jar of salt.  And in the room around the legs of the floor lamp dancer entwined.  Of course, guests will be interested in - where did the owners get such unusual interior items.  And having learned that this is the work of the mistress of the house, they will immediately be asked to repeat the masterpiece. </p><p>  Many people think that only real artists can make beautiful handmade dolls.  But think: how old is the doll!  And only one hundred and fifty years it is made in factories.  But what about before?  Moms sewed children toys themselves. </p><h2>  Ancient art </h2><p>  It seems that the dolls always accompanied the person.  Archaeologists find artifacts that are more than four thousand years old.  Not all types of this folk art have survived, but the Japanese amigurumi dolls succeeded.  Now, big-eyed knitted men are an indispensable part of kawaii fashion, which began with Japanese cartoons. </p><p>  These toys are no more than eight centimeters in height.  The head is traditionally done more than usual.  A classic example is Pok√©mon.  All amigurumi are good.  Even if it is animals or home decoration.  A smile adorns everyone, says eastern wisdom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yarnfix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese amigurumi" class="if uuid-3145015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3145015.jpg"></div><p>  To tie such beautiful dolls with your own hands, you will need thick yarn and a thin hook.  Crochet in a circle starting with three loops, rolled into a ringlet.  A knitted fabric is stuffed with synthetic winterizer and sewn with cotton threads - they are completely invisible against the background of yarn.  Now you need to give the toy a name.  And even in the case of a sale, it will remain with her - this is a feature of amigurumi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The revival of ancient art </h2><p>  In our age of technology, hand-made products are becoming more popular.  Designers include textile dolls in the decoration of the girls' room.  They don‚Äôt play such dolls - they easily break and get dirty.  But if mom herself can sew such a doll, the girl‚Äôs childhood will only become richer.  There are many textile techniques, but sewing an attic doll is the most favorite in recent years. </p><p>  The idea came from America.  You can make a beautiful doll with your own hands from improvised materials and give it the look of a long dusty in the attic.  Previously, they were sewn from scraps left over from sewing.  No synthetics - only linen and cotton.  No patterns - all inspired.  The body of the pupa is impregnated with a coffee-glue composition and baked in the oven, which makes it aroma and a beautiful tan color.  After she is dressed in a dress and panties. </p><p>  If you need a doll that stands on its own, without a stand, you can sew the Bigfoot.  She can stand on tightly packed thick legs.  This doll has a standard pattern, so all the Millipedes look like sisters.  Clothing, hair and accessories are different.  Their eyes are small, like two points.  The nose and mouth are often absent, but always rosy cheeks. </p><h2>  Tilde </h2><p>  Those who have never made toys, it is better to start by sewing Tilda.  It was invented by a Norwegian artist.  Tilda has long, thin arms and legs.  Its feature is a flat profile - this is how the pattern is conceived.  Tilde design can be almost any: girls, boys, bunnies, cubs and kittens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="zoe-paperisbliss.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tilda doll" class="if uuid-3149280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3149280.jpg"></div><p>  In courses on the manufacture of designer toys, they teach how to make a beautiful doll with their own hands.  It is important that Tilda‚Äôs arms and head use a thin body tissue.  It can be painted by yourself.  For legs and dress you will need colored chintz. </p><p>  This doll is sewn already in clothes.  If there is a desire to change her outfits, then make her half the hands, half the legs and the body of lace underwear. </p><h2>  Dolls for interior decoration </h2><p>  A special class of dolls is interior.  They serve as decoration and most often live with collectors.  These are not only knitted or fabric dolls, but also made of polymer clay.  They can be similar to figurines, but can be made in human height and sit in a chair.  Such decorate shop windows.  For example, in one of the second-hand bookshops in Moscow, Pushkin sat in a window for a long time in a chair ‚Äî a doll masterfully made especially for this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior dolls" class="if uuid-3146957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3146957.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, such beautiful dolls do not do it yourself.  But polymer clay can be used to create a figurine, and it is not difficult.  There are forms for the face, ready-made hands and legs, a lot of various details for designer dolls.  True, it costs unjustifiably big money.  A set for an author's doll reaches 800 rubles. </p><p>  Jointed dolls are the most difficult to manufacture.  You can give them any poses, and often gestures.  In training courses, you can understand the technology of creating a hinged doll, but this is not interesting for everyone: the process is long, requiring extreme accuracy and captivating only real creators. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="rHCSIZ4ZMC4" data-url="https://youtu.be/rHCSIZ4ZMC4" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/7/2/7/15727.jpg"></div><h2>  Pumpkin Head </h2><p>  These cute dolls got their name for a large head on a thin neck.  They usually have very large eyes and long hair.  It is made both on a wire frame and without it.  These dolls are quite large, so they can be put on the windowsill or on the sofa.  But there are also little girls - they are sewn with a frame inside. </p><p>  The face is painted with acrylics.  Eyes are made with large eyelashes.  They can look away.  The author can give the face of the Pumpkinhead a special expression - funny, thoughtful, the doll can smile or tighten her lips and even bite her lip.  This gives her character. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pumpkin Head Doll" class="if uuid-3145138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3145138.jpg"></div><p>  For the doll they make accessories - a book, a kitten, a handbag, a backpack.  The doll can be dressed in the form of a flight attendant, nurse, skier or tourist - all according to the author‚Äôs plan.  Such dolls are a good gift. </p><h2>  Instructions for sewing Waldorf dolls </h2><p>  This doll is traditionally handmade from natural fabrics.  A special feature is the knitted skin under which the doll‚Äôs body is pulled in a special way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Doll centipede" class="if uuid-3145088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3145088.jpg"></div><p>  Pattern dolls from fabric.  Sizes are standard: </p><ul><li>  height - 20 centimeters (of which 8 centimeters per head); </li><li>  body width - 5 centimeters; </li><li>  the width of the handles is 2.3 centimeters; </li><li>  the width of the legs is 2.5 centimeters; </li><li>  foot width - 1.7 centimeters. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Doll pattern" class="if uuid-3149032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3149032.jpg"></div><p>  Build Order: </p><ol><li>  For the head, use a skein of yarn (preferably white, so as not to fade).  It is pulled at the eye level of the doll.  Attach a ball of wool with a diameter of a centimeter to the place of the nose.  After that, a knitted pipe is put on the ball and tied so that a neck is obtained. </li><li>  According to a sewing pattern, the body is stuffed with a synthetic winterizer.  Places bend handles and legs stitch.  Fingers on the palms prostrate. </li><li>  Stitch the body and head. </li><li>  Shoes are sewn on the legs, put on and sew. </li><li>  Hair is made from yarn, sewn in a circle, braid a pigtail. </li><li>  Sew a dress and put on a chrysalis. </li><li>  Two dots are put on the face and a blush is applied. </li></ol><h2>  Professional Tips </h2><p>  Surely you had to meet ugly dolls with crooked faces.  Sometimes in a toy store, sometimes in an interior furniture store, and sometimes in a supermarket.  Such poor things were done in the stream, without investing a soul.  The artist, answering the question of how to sew a beautiful doll, will first of all pay attention to the need for love for his creation.  Then it turns out to conduct the seams more accurately, and redoing something is not difficult. </p><p>  In the manufacture of dolls, it is sometimes difficult to twist small details.  To do this, artists use the method of a cocktail tube - insert it into the part, and then turn it out with the help of a thread drawn through the tube. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dearlittledolliesltd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior dolls made of polymer clay" class="if uuid-3145105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3145105.jpg"></div><p>  In textile techniques, it is important to dye the fabric that goes to the body of the pupa.  Otherwise, it will become like a geisha.  They are painted with an aqueous solution of tea, coffee and glue.  Stand for some time and dried in the air or in the oven - it‚Äôs faster. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the house you can find many places where to settle a new doll.  These are banks with cereals - for them they make a doll a groats.  In a flower pot can live a chrysalis made of cross-linked twigs.  They are wrapped with cloth and made a skirt.  A cork from under a wine bottle is suitable for the head.  They stick a twig into the ground, and now it becomes more fun on the window. </p><p>  Make a doll from improvised materials with your own hands, and your life will become brighter and kinder. </p>
