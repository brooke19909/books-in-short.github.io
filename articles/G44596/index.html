It is necessary that all the components of the outfits of the bride and groom not only be perfectly thought out, but also remain in memory for many years.

    <ul><li>  Wedding dress on the shoulders. </li><li>  Sparkling hairpins or lovely <span>little flowers</span> in the bride's hairstyle. </li><li>  Wedding rings - together and separately (you can also put the bride’s ring in the groom’s ring). </li><li>  Shoes of the bride - and shoes of the groom (however, it is worth noting: women's shoes are beautiful even when they are alone on the grass or gravel path, but the groom’s shoes must be photographed with the lucky one). </li><li>  Wedding invitations and envelopes, beautifully laid out on a wooden table. </li><li>  Groom accessories - why not?  You can combine the aforementioned shoes in one picture (this time by themselves), a belt, tie, cufflinks, possibly glasses. </li><li>  Bridal bouquet on a chair with a back. </li><li>  Boutonniere of the groom. </li><li>  Portrait of a bride worthy of a print on the spread of a fashion magazine. </li><li>  Portraits of each of the witnesses, preferably in an informal manner. </li><li>  A black and white photo of the face of a bride hidden under a veil. </li><li>  Traditional moments, for example - the flight of a white dove released from the hands. </li></ul><h2>  To not forget anything </h2>

However, if you care about every little thing and want to keep every moment in your memory, take into account the following ideas for photos: </p><ul><li>  General picture of guests. </li><li>  Panorama of wedding decorations. </li><li>  Separate photo of marriage certificate. </li><li>  A picture capturing the chic of a festive table with an exquisite treat. </li><li>  Food photos are optional for Instagram (just to capture the delicacies served on a special day). </li><li>  The wedding cake. </li><li>  Guest musicians. </li><li>  First dance. </li><li>  Dance of the bride with her father. </li></ul><h2>  Creative approach </h2>

    <p>  Perhaps the newlyweds are tired of traditional wedding photos, repeated from year to year, from album to album.  If you lack originality and creativity and it seems that everyday grayness threatens to fill even wedding photos, the ideas of the most creative photographers will surely appeal to you: </p><ul><li>  Steps along the <span>pedestrian crossing</span> in the very center of the city: first, the bride, followed by the groom, behind the groom - friend, friend and closest guests. </li><li>  Time-Laps style jump: the groom has already “landed”, and his friends froze at different stages of the jump. </li><li>  Theme-bomb: the bride in the center plays the role of a ticking bomb, and the groom and his friends are around in the air, torn from the ground by a blast wave. </li><li>  The bride throws a bouquet - this moment is better to remove from the back or from below. </li><li>  Bride with girlfriends throws shoes into the air. </li><li>  A picture in the front row of the cinema. </li><li>  Atmospheric photos with an imitation of your favorite movies: zombies, post-apocalypse, action movie, mafia, horror in an abandoned house. </li></ul><h2>  No less creative ideas for photos </h2>

    <ul><li>  Photos on the bridge, with the closest friends. </li><li>  In the center of the picture is the sky and flying clouds. </li><li>  The groom, the bride, the friend and the friend pose in a row, and the colors of bouquets or boutonnieres (as an option - ties or jewelry for hair) are in perfect harmony with the background colors. </li><li>  A crowd of girlfriends cheerfully decorates the bride. </li><li>  A crowd of friends cheerfully dress the groom - or they all dress themselves, but in the same room. </li><li>  Playing with mirrors is the reflection of the bride in the mirror that the girlfriends are holding, or vice versa. </li><li>  Replacing bouquets and bouquets with sticks with colored candy floss. </li><li>  The “wifi” of the bride and groom. </li><li>  Staged moments: for example, the groom’s friends flee from the statue of a terrible dinosaur. </li><li>  Shots with umbrellas - unless, of course, it rains. </li><li>  Instead of bouquets, you can weave wreaths of <span>wildflowers</span> and decorate with them the hair of the bride and girlfriends. </li><li>  The bride and groom run away from the wedding party.  Perhaps you can’t find a more interesting idea for photos: here you can even lay the groom and the bride on the sidewalk and shoot the shoot in double perspective - from above (so the figures of the newlyweds will be fully visible, and witnesses and friends - only in the classical plan “from above”). </li><li>  Friends and girlfriends turn away when kissing the bride and groom (options: girls cover their faces with bouquets; everyone covers their eyes with their palms). </li><li>  Wedding party on an escalator. </li></ul><p>  If you don’t have enough idea of ​​photographing, try the popular method “frame inside the frame”: in the baguette - a photo, and in the photo - a little boy and girl hold a frame, as if everything inside it is a photo.  It’s not difficult at all, but it turns out very impressive. </p><h2>  How to add sentimentality? </h2><p>  Contact your parents first, almost literally.  Take a photo of a wedding dress against a wall, on which a portrait of the mother of the bride in her own wedding dress flaunts - on that very unforgettable day.  If the outfit is preserved, ask if it can be used for creative photos - for example, wrapping a daughter’s bouquet with a beautiful patch of dress.  Most likely, my mother will agree: today it’s unfashionable to get married in my mother’s dress, but its practical use in festive decor will add an invaluable note of sentimentality to the atmosphere of celebration.  And, of course, such a bouquet deserves a separate photo shoot. </p><h2>  Handwritten tablets </h2><p>  An interesting idea for a collage of photographs is to use pictures with handwritten tablets.  To do this, you need to prepare a few photos with the bridesmaids, as well as special cardboard tablets on sticks - you can make them yourself, or you can purchase paraphernalia in specialized stores.  For drawing inscriptions you will need fresh thoughts, chalk and colored markers.  You can write anything - from compound sentences (“A”, “here”, “and”, “lovely”, “bride”) to positive emoticons.  The figures of girlfriends cut or highlighted in graphic programs holding signboards can be successfully combined with other wedding photos.  Such photographs in the interior look especially nice.  The ideas are countless - try it! </p><h2>  Native walls </h2>

    <p>  The most sincere wedding pictures are those taken in the newlyweds' new housing.  Here you can relax, give free rein to real, not staged, feelings, and finally breathe freely.  It would be nice to leave some personal moments in the memory of photographs: the last kiss before solitude, the end of the party, the anticipation of relaxation only for two, without a crowd of guests and friends.  Original ideas for photos of the house are waiting on every corner - you just have to give free rein to unlimited imagination. </p>
