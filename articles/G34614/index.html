This question is increasingly asked by novice masters.  And all because lately, seamless knitting has become common.  It started when loose oversize sweaters (that is, several sizes larger than necessary) came into fashion.  For such a style, there is no need to tighten the model, calculate armholes and neck.  The simpler and more careless a thing looks, the better.  And it is most convenient to knit it on circular knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit on circular knitting needles" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43391/1391136.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Of course, such devices are suitable not only for <span>bulky sweaters,</span> but also for large shawls, stoles, snoods, rugs, hats and even socks.  Consider in more detail circular knitting for beginners (and not only). </p><h2>  How to choose a tool </h2><p>  Materials from which circular knitting needles are made: </p><ul><li>  Metal. </li><li>  Aluminum. </li><li>  Tree. </li><li>  Bamboo. </li><li>  Plastic. </li></ul><p>  In the process, each craftswoman chooses the material that is more convenient for her, lies better in her hand and allows the loops to easily slide on the surface of the tool. </p><p>  Between themselves, circular knitting needles are connected by a fishing line or a nylon cable.  When choosing, pay attention to the fact that the joint between the cable and the spoke is tight, there are no cracks or sharp cuts.  For such "burrs" the yarn will cling, which can damage its quality.  If you work with thick knitting needles from 4.5 mm and more, it is important that the transition from the thickness of the tool to the cable is smooth.  Otherwise, it will become difficult to transfer the loops from the cable to the spoke. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="circular knitting needles" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43391/1391126.jpg" width="600"></div>

As a rule, the recommended size is written on the packages.  But if suddenly there is no such information, or the label is lost, take the tool twice as thick as the working thread. </p><p>  The length of the fishing line or cable can be different, so focus on the size of the future product.  If it is a plaid, then the length can be maximum, but for knitting small clothes it can interfere. </p><h2>  Features of work on circular knitting needles </h2><p>  Knitting with circular knitting needles for beginners consists of several stages.  First we loop.  This is <span>not difficult</span> to <span>do.</span>  If the product does not go in a circle, then the work is performed as when knitting with straight knitting needles, that is, the working cloth needs to be turned over after each knitted row. </p><p>  If the working canvas closes in a circle, then the last knitted loop of the first row becomes the first loop of the second.  At this point, it is better to attach a plastic marker or tie a thread of contrasting color to know exactly where one row ends and another begins.  Be sure to check that the row is not twisted, and all the loops are looking up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="circular knitting for beginners" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43391/1391013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In order to prevent the ‚Äústeps‚Äù in the place where the product closes in a circle, pull the thread harder. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Magic loop </h2><p>  Magic Loop, or ‚Äúmagic loop‚Äù, is a European knitting technique for circular knitting, in which the diameter of the product is absolutely not important.  It can be a <span>hat, sock,</span> mittens or cuffs - those are the things that we are used to knitting on four to five knitting needles. </p><p>  How to knit things with a small diameter on circular knitting needles? </p><ul><li>  We start with a set of loops in the usual way. </li><li>  We divide the number of loops into two, in the middle we pass the loop from the cable and distribute the loops into two knitting needles. </li><li>  Next, pull the knitting needle in the right hand so that you can begin to knit the stitches from the left knitting needle. </li><li>  Having tied to the end of the left knitting needle, we extend the right one again and continue working in the same spirit. </li></ul><p>  This method will appeal to those who do not like to work with stocking knitting needles. </p><h2>  Knitting cap </h2><p>  We knit a hat on circular knitting needles.  This is the simplest model that even beginner needlewomen will cope with.  In the future, it can be associated with the use of volumetric braids or arana.  For a winter hat, choose wool yarn with the addition of acrylic, then the product will turn out to be warm, soft and will not irritate the skin on the forehead. </p><p>  We start by calculating the loops.  Tie a small sample, for example, 20 stitches wide and 20 rows high.  Ideally, the sample should be washed and dried, then you will know for sure whether the cap will change in size after washing.  Measure the sample, so you will know how many loops are in one centimeter. </p><p>  Measure your head circumference.  Now let's make a simple calculation: multiply the number of loops in the sample by the number of centimeters of the head circumference and divide by the data indicated in the sample.  Here are so many loops and dial. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit hat on circular knitting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43391/1391125.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <p>  How to knit a hat on circular knitting needles?  We distribute the loops on two knitting needles by stretching the loop.  Using the ‚Äúmagic loop‚Äù method, we begin work.  We knit in a circle an elastic band 2 * 2 about 20 cm in height, more or less, depending on whether you will make a lapel and what size.  After the elastic, you need to make a narrowing.  We reduce about a quarter of the available loops by knitting the two together, distributing them evenly.  For example, knitting together every seventh and eighth loop. </p><p>  We continue to work only with facial loops.  After knitting about 10 cm, we make another decrease, reducing one third of the available loops.  Choose the length of the hat arbitrary: it can tightly clasp your head, or it can be a long beanie hat.  Close another half of the loops closer to the edge of the product.  At the end, knit all the loops in two, with a hook, thread the working thread through them and tighten.  The finished hat can be decorated with a pompom. </p><h2>  How to adapt patterns to circular knitting needles </h2><p>  Often, patterns of patterns show both front and back rows.  But when knitting in a circle the wrong rows are not.  This greatly facilitates the work.  So how to knit on circular knitting needles according to patterns? </p><ul><li>  There are no <span>edge loops</span> in circular knitting <span>,</span> and on many schemes they are indicated, so keep this in mind when making calculations. </li><li>  If you are a beginner needlewoman, then it is better to choose those schemes where the odd rows need to be knitted according to the drawing.  Then over each front knit the front, over the wrong side - the wrong side. </li><li>  Keep in mind that there are patterns that are not designed for knitting in a circle.  Just replace them with others, no less beautiful and interesting. </li></ul>
