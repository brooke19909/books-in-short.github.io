There is also information that this country was sometimes called Arctida.  Many tried to find its possible location, but so far its existence has not been proved and has been confirmed by nothing but myths.  What is Hyperborea?  This is a hypothetical ancient mainland or a huge island that previously existed in the northern part of the planet near the North Pole.  In those days, Hyperborea was inhabited by a very powerful people - Hyperboreans, who had a fairly developed civilization.  Considering what Hyperborea is, it should be noted that its name means "beyond the north wind Borey."  Some researchers believe that this is the notorious Atlantis. </p><h2>  Cards </h2><p>  There is still no evidence that Hyperborea has ever existed.  <span>What is Hyperborea,</span> we can find out only from ancient Greek legends and images of this land on ancient engravings, for example, on the map of Mercator, which was published by his son back in 1595.  On it in the center is an image of this legendary mainland, and around is the coast of the Arctic Ocean with modern easily recognizable rivers and islands. </p><p>  It should be noted that this map has generated a lot of questions from researchers who also wanted to understand what Hyperborea is.  According to the descriptions of many ancient Greek chroniclers, a favorable climate prevailed on this continent, and from the sea or a large lake, which was located in the center of Hyperborea, 4 large rivers flowed out and fell into the ocean, which is why this mysterious place on the map looks like a round shield with a cross . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sunsofhyperborea.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is hyperborea" class="if uuid-2860523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45935/2860523.jpg"></div><h2>  Gods of Hyperborea </h2><p>  What else can be said about this place?  The ancient Greeks believed that the inhabitants of this continent (islands) were especially loved by the god Apollo.  On the territory of Hyperborea lived his servants and priests.  Ancient legends say that the god Apollo appeared on this territory once every 19 years. </p><p>  According to some astronomical data, one can understand the essence of the appearance of this Hyperborean deity.  The fact is that the lunar nodes in orbit return to their starting point exactly after 18.5 years.  But any celestial body in ancient times was something divine, for example, the Moon in Ancient Greece was Selena.  To the names of various Greek gods, including Apollo, as well as to famous heroes, for example, Hercules, a generalized epithet - Hyperborean - was added. </p><h2>  Hyperboreans </h2><p>  There are many different books on Hyperborea.  From them you can find out that the inhabitants of this country were Hyperboreans.  They belonged to those nations that were close to the gods.  The inhabitants of this mysterious place enjoyed joyful work with dancing, songs, prayers, feasts, as well as universal endless fun.  It was believed that the death of a hyperborean occurred only because of satiety with life and fatigue.  The ritual of interrupting life was rather simple - when the Hyperboreans were tired of their lives, they rushed into the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The wise inhabitants of this place possessed the many knowledge and secrets of Hyperborea.  The natives of these lands (the sages Arsiteus and Abaris) were considered both hypostasis and servants of Apollo.  They taught the Greek people to compose hymns and poems, and also for the first time revealed to them the secrets of the universe, philosophy and music. </p><p>  The capital of Hyperborea was considered the city of Paul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ancients-bg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hyperborea and Atlantis" class="if uuid-2860525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45935/2860525.jpg"></div><h2>  Homeland of the ancient Slavs </h2><p>  Dozens of scientists and writers have tried to localize this mysterious continent.  As mentioned earlier, there is no confirmation of the existence of Hyperborea, but there is a theory that it was from these lands that the Slavic peoples came.  That is why Hyperborea is considered to be the birthplace of the entire Russian people.  The polar North continent once connected the lands of the New World and Eurasia.  Various authors and researchers find the remains of ancient civilization in the following places: </p><ul><li>  Kola Peninsula. </li><li>  Greenland. </li><li>  Ural mountains. </li><li>  Karelia. </li><li>  Taimyr Peninsula. </li></ul><h2>  Reality or myth </h2><p>  There are many people who do not delve into history, but are interested in the question of whether there has ever been an ancient Hyperborea.  The first mention of this country appeared in ancient sources.  Hyperboreans were described by various writers and historians, beginning with Hesiod and ending with Nostradamus: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Pliny the Elder spoke of the Hyperboreans as residents of the Arctic Circle, on which the sun shone for six months. </li><li>  The poet Alkey in his hymn to Apollon spoke of the proximity of the sun god with this people, which was also confirmed by the famous historian <span>Diodorus of Sicily.</span> </li><li>  Aristotle united the Scythians-Rus and the Hyperborean peoples. </li><li>  Hekatey Abdersky, who lived in Egypt, told the legend of a small island that was in the ocean opposite the country of the Celts. </li><li>  In addition to the Romans and Greeks, the mystical lands and their inhabitants were mentioned by Indian peoples, Chinese, Persians.  There is information about them in the Germanic epics. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.hyperborea.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hyperborea is the cradle of humanity" class="if uuid-2860550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45935/2860550.jpg"></div><h2>  What do scientists say </h2><p>  The riddles of Hyperborea could not be ignored by modern scientific historians.  They both put forward and continue to put forward their versions about the inhabitants of the secret place and their culture, comparing the facts and drawing certain conclusions.  According to some historians, Arctida is the mother of all world culture, since in the past these lands were a very favorable place for prosperity and human life.  Previously, a favorable subtropical climate reigned there, which attracted the advanced people of that time.  Therefore, Hyperboreans often contacted the Romans and Greeks. </p><h2>  Where did the mysterious Hyperborea disappear </h2><p>  Surely you are wondering where Hyperborea, the cradle of humanity, has gone.  The history of this continent or island has more than one millennium.  Based on ancient writings, we can conclude that the lifestyle of this people was democratic and simple.  All people here lived as one family, settled near ponds, and their main activity in the form of crafts, art and creativity contributed to the disclosure of the spiritual qualities of man.  Currently, only the northern part of modern Russia is considered the remains of that ancient Hyperborea, which was once inhabited by the people.  But why did she disappear?  Where did it go?  Scientists suggest that the reasons why Hyperborea ceased to exist - the cradle of humanity, are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Changing of the climate.  Most likely, the peoples who inhabited this continent began to migrate south due to changes in climatic conditions.  Even Lomonosov wrote that for a very long time in Siberia and north of it it was so warm that even elephants could feel comfortable there.  Confirmation of this is the petrified remains of palm trees and magnolias found in Greenland.  The climate could change due to the displacement of the earth's axis.  Also, ice ages contributed to this.  The icing came so fast that the mammoths froze alive. </li><li>  War of Hyperborea and Atlantis.  This version is not supported by any facts or documents.  Scientists have only records of Plato.  He claimed that a civilization that had disappeared ceased to exist as a result of the destructive war that was waged between Hyperborea and Atlantis. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancientpages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hyperborea books" class="if uuid-2860538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45935/2860538.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting myths </h2><p>  Since the existence of this ancient civilization has not yet been scientifically proven, it is possible to talk about it only in theory, drawing information from various ancient sources.  There are many different legends about Antarctica.  Consider the most popular of them: </p><ol><li>  As mentioned earlier, Apollo himself made his trip to Hyperborea every 19 years. </li><li>  Another myth connects the territory of Hyperborea with modern northern peoples.  Even some of the modern studies prove that Hyperborea once existed in the north of the continent of Eurasia, and the Slavs come from it. </li><li>  The war of Hyperborea and Atlantis was fought using nuclear weapons.  Perhaps this legend can be called the most incredible. </li></ol><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  Historians concluded that ancient civilization existed about 20,000 years ago.  It was then that huge ridges (Lomonosova and Mendeleev) rose above the surface of the Arctic Ocean.  In those days there was no ice, and the water in the sea was very warm, as modern paleontologists say.  Confirm the existence of this extinct continent is only possible by experience.  This suggests that traces of the Hyperboreans, various artifacts, ancient maps, monuments should be sought.  Incredibly, such evidence is currently available. </p><p>  In 1922, a Russian expedition led by Alexander Barchenko on the Kola Peninsula found skillfully crafted stones that were oriented around the world.  Then a littered hole was found.  These findings belonged to a more ancient period than Egyptian civilization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riddles of Hyperborea" class="if uuid-2860528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45935/2860528.jpg"></div><h2>  Expedition Details </h2><p>  A purposeful search for this place has never been carried out, but at the beginning of the 20th century a scientific expedition set off to the Lovozero and Seydozero area (now they are in the Murmansk region).  Its leader was the travelers Barchenko and Kondiayn.  During research, they were engaged in geographical, ethnographic and psychophysical studies of the area. </p><p>  Once the expedition accidentally stumbled upon an unusual hole that went under the surface of the earth.  However, they failed to get into it for a rather strange reason: everyone who tried to get there was inexplicable horror.  But still, the researchers managed to photograph a strange passage into the very depths of the earth. </p><p>  When the expedition returned to Moscow, she submitted a report on the journey, but the data was immediately classified.  The most interesting thing in this story is that in the years most hungry for our country, the government quickly approved the financing and preparation of this expedition.  Most likely, she attached great importance. </p><p>  The head of the expedition, Barchenko, after returning, was repressed and then shot.  Those materials that he provided were kept secret for a long time. </p><p>  However, in the early nineties, Doctor of Philosophy Demin managed to find out about the expedition.  When he got acquainted with the results of the trip, studied in detail the traditions and legends of the peoples, he decided to independently go in search of Hyperborea. </p><p>  In 1997-1999, a scientific expedition was again organized to find the legendary territory on the Kola Peninsula.  The researchers were set the only task, which was to search for traces of this ancient cradle of mankind. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gods of Hyperborea" class="if uuid-2870613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2870613.jpg"></div><h2>  What managed to find </h2><p>  For 2 years, this expedition discovered a large number of traces of ancient civilization on the territory of the Kola Peninsula.  Here travelers found ancient petroglyphs with the image of the sun.  Similar symbolism was also found among the ancient Chinese and heptane. </p><p>  In addition, the researchers were greatly interested in artificially created labyrinths.  It was from here that they took their distribution around the world.  Modern scientists have been able to prove that these stone labyrinths are an encoded projection of the passage of a celestial body through the polar sky. </p><p>  The expedition managed to find several rock paintings in the form of a trident and a lotus.  In addition, a special interest arose in the image of a man who, according to legend, was walled up in the rock of Karnasurta. </p><p>  Of course, these findings cannot be considered direct evidence of the existence of a highly developed civilization.  However, quite often it happens that the most daring hypotheses, which venerable scientists smashed to smithereens, were later fully confirmed. </p><h2>  What is now in place of Hyperborea </h2><p>  There is still no specific data regarding the location of the island or the mainland of Hyperborea.  If we turn to modern scientific data, then there are no islands near the North Pole, but there is the underwater Lomonosov Ridge, which was named after its discoverer.  Next to it is the Mendeleev Ridge.  Both of them have sunk relatively recently. </p><p>  That is why it can be assumed that this ridge was inhabited a millennium ago, and its inhabitants could move to the neighboring continent in the regions of the Canadian Arctic archipelago, Taimyr or the Kola Peninsula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hollowplanet.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Beauty Of Hyperborea" class="if uuid-2870220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45935/2870220.jpg"></div><h2>  Books about Hyperborea </h2><p>  If you want to delve into the study of this ancient culture, then you can read books written by foreign and Russian authors: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúThe Babylonian phenomenon.  Russian language from the depths of centuries ‚Äù, author N.N.  Oreshkin. </li><li>  ‚ÄúParadise Found at the North Pole‚Äù by UF  Warren. </li><li>  "Hyperborea.  The mother of Russian culture ‚Äù, author V.N.  Demin, and other publications. </li><li>  ‚ÄúIn Search of Hyperborea‚Äù, authors V.V.  Golubev and V.V.  Tokarev. </li><li>  "Hyperborea.  The historical roots of the Russian people ‚Äù, author V.N.  Demin. </li><li>  ‚ÄúThe Arctic Homeland in the Vedas‚Äù, author B.L.  Tilak. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Currently, Hyperborea is one of the most mysterious and mythical places, the mystery of which worries humanity.  Perhaps the stories about the mainland are fiction, but many believe in its real existence. </p>
