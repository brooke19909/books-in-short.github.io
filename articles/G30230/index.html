To avoid getting fines in such situations, the Sho-Me 520 radar detector will help. </p><p>  The manufacturer of the radar detector is the Korean company Sho-Me, specializing in the production of automotive equipment and famous for its high quality and affordable product prices.  The 520th model was first launched in 2009.  Over the past time, she managed to gain appreciation and popularity among both Russian and world motorists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me 520" class="if uuid-2241854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2241854.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The radar detector is delivered in original packaging containing: </p><ul><li>  Sho-Me 520 radar detector with LEDs on the front panel. </li><li>  Car cigarette lighter adapter and power cable. </li><li>  Extra fuse. </li><li>  Fasteners with two suction cups. </li><li>  Mat with double-sided Velcro for the dashboard. </li><li>  Instructions for the radar detector Sho-Me 520. </li><li>  Warranty and additional documentation for the device. </li></ul><h2>  Technical Parameters of Radar Detector </h2><p>  The parameters of the radar detector can be roughly divided into three main groups: radio signal reception, general and laser reception. </p><ol><li>  Dimensions - 100 x 68 x 32 mm, weight - 81 grams.  The operating temperature range varies from -30 C <sup>about</sup> to +50 C <sup>about</sup> .  Available in gray and black, so the gadget fits into the interior of any car. </li><li>  The operating radar ranges are K, Ka, X, Ultra X, Ultra K. </li><li>  Records signals from VG-2 systems and laser radars. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="darom-kg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="firmware radar detector sho me 520" class="if uuid-2241829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2241829.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of radar detector </h2><p>  The Sho-Me 520 radar detector operates in four modes, each of which can be individually configured. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  In the "City" mode, it means lowering the sensitivity of the device to models of the "X" format, which reduces the number of false positives in the city. </li><li>  When driving on highways and highways, the ‚ÄúTrack‚Äù mode is optimal: it increases the sensitivity of the radar detector, which allows you to fix traffic police radars at a greater distance. </li><li>  Dimming the screen is one of the useful options used in the dark.  It allows you to lower the brightness of the LED screen of the radar detector in the absence of fixed signals from lasers and radars. </li><li>  The silent anti-radar mode allows you to keep complete silence in the car if necessary. </li></ol><p>  Among the additional functions of the device include smooth inclusion, saving user-defined settings and two ways of installing it: on the windshield or the dashboard of the vehicle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radar-expert.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me 520 reviews" class="if uuid-2241827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2241827.jpg"></div><h2>  Installation Nuances </h2><p>  To ensure correct operation, the radar detector must be correctly placed in the cabin.  In this case, certain installation requirements are taken into account: </p><ol><li>  The radar detector is installed in the middle of the windshield as low as possible. </li><li>  You can not place the gadget behind the wipers or the upper sun stripe.  Such elements are equipped with metal parts that degrade signal reception, which increases the response time of the device. </li><li>  The Sho-Me 520 radar detector must not come in contact with the windshield. </li><li>  Some synthetic coatings may affect radio reception. </li></ol><h2>  Gadget installation </h2><p>  The radar detector is mounted in the passenger compartment in two possible ways.  According to one of them, the device is mounted on the suction cups on the windshield.  To this end, suction cups are attached to the bracket, after which the bracket and bumper are mounted on the windshield. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second mounting option is to mount the radar detector on the dashboard with Velcro.  The installation location of the radar detector must first be degreased, since it is attached using double-sided tape.  <span>The serial number</span> must remain visible, otherwise the warranty will be terminated. </p><p>  After installation in the cabin, the radar detector is connected to the vehicle‚Äôs on-board network via a power cable and a cigarette lighter adapter.  The inclusion of the radar detector is carried out by scrolling clockwise the wheel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autovazzapch-ru.1gb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fault radar detector sho me 520" class="if uuid-2241838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2241838.jpg"></div><h2>  Radar Detector Testing </h2><p>  The first and subsequent starts trigger an automatic self-test cycle.  During this process, all the LEDs light up at the same time, an audio signal corresponding to a certain range and laser is emitted.  In this way, the health of the display and speakers is checked. </p><p>  According to the test results of numerous automotive publications and reviews, the Sho-Me 520 radar detector is considered one of the most effective and best devices in its price category.  The radar detector showed good performance when operating in real conditions with various stationary cameras and DPS radars.  All fixing devices are detected by the detector at a distance of 600-1000 km with a minimum number of false alarms.  The only drawback noted by experts is the lack of an indication of the silent mode. </p><h2>  Finalization and updating of the radar detector Sho-Me 520 STR </h2><p>  Many motorists modify the detector by unscrewing the two screws inside the case.  The second option of refinement is installation of a home-made mouthpiece to the standard horn, which increases the detection range and eliminates false positives.  However, radar detectors do not always record all the equipment used by the traffic police: for example, the Sho-Me 520 does not detect devices such as ‚ÄúKRIS P‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrelka-ST‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.audiocentr.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me 520 str update" class="if uuid-2241847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2241847.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages of the Sho-Me Radar Detector </h2><p>  Car owners in the reviews note the following advantages of the radar detector: </p><ul><li>  Simplicity and ease of management.  The instruction manual contains complete information necessary to resolve any problems and malfunctions of the Sho-Me 520 radar detector, which greatly simplifies the use of the radar detector. </li><li>  High quality signal reception.  The device captures mobile radars, including tripods. </li><li>  Wide range of signal reception.  The radar detects measuring devices at a distance of up to 350 meters, which allows you to reduce the speed in advance.  As you approach cameras and radars, the volume and frequency of sound alerts increase. </li><li>  Cameras located at a certain height are fixed by the gadget at a distance of 500 to 700 meters. </li><li>  Automatic shutdown of the radar detector after 6 hours of uninterrupted operation, which allows you to save battery power.  The moment of shutdown is accompanied by a sound and light signal.  Health recovery occurs after pressing the DIM key. </li><li>  Amplification of the alarm indication due to the bright color display. </li><li>  In the "city-highway" modes, the necessary filters are automatically activated. </li><li>  Availability of Sho-Me 520 radar detector firmware. </li></ul><h2>  Disadvantages of Radar Detector </h2><ul><li>  It works only with constant power supply from the on-board network. </li><li>  High frequency of false positives. </li><li>  Unreliable windshield mount with suction cups. </li><li>  In the dark, the multi-colored LED lighting negatively affects. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me 520 instruction" class="if uuid-2241828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2241828.jpg"></div><h2>  Radar Detector Cost </h2><p>  The price of Sho-Me 520, depending on the point of sale, the availability of shares and the region of the country, can vary from one and a half to two thousand seven hundred rubles.  The average cost of the radar detector is two thousand rubles, which is quite justified by the good quality and functionality of the model. </p><p>  There are a lot of reviews about the Sho-Me 520 radar detector on the Internet.  The assessment of car owners depends on expectations from the purchase, operating conditions, driver needs and many other factors.  In general, users speak of the Sho-Me radar detector as a high-quality, reliable and multi-functional device with a wide range of action.
