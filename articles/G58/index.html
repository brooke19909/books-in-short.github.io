Often they open deposits or simply leave money on the card in order to save the necessary amount for something, or so that they are just in case.  Sberbank customers are offered many services of this kind, including Piggy Bank.  Many customers use this service, but those who do not like it often have questions related to its disconnection. </p><p>  In this article, we will consider how to disable Sberbank's Piggy Bank. </p><h2>  Piggy Bank Features </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank piggy bank disable" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/1891240.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  ‚ÄúPiggy bank‚Äù is a rather convenient service that allows you to quickly and easily accumulate the necessary amount on the card without making any effort by making small deductions.  However, in some cases, the client wants to disable this service due to various reasons.  This procedure is standard for everyone. </p><p>  How to disable the ‚ÄúPiggy bank‚Äù service in Sberbank?  About it below. </p><h2>  Banking terms </h2><p>  When the ‚ÄúPiggy bank‚Äù service is activated in Sberbank, a choice of 3 options for making payments is possible, the selection of the most suitable of which is provided to the client. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When interest from transactions is deducted to Piggy Bank, the movement of money between your accounts is not taken into account. </p><p>  It very rarely happens that the client agrees to connect the option immediately during the design of the bank's product.  Most cases come down to the fact that the client is offered the design of a funded service, and if he agrees, then they already choose the best option for him.  When the option is selected, there is a discussion of additional conditions (the amount or percentage of deductions, the retention period of funds from the card) of Sberbank's Piggy Bank.  Disabling the option is quite simple. </p><h2>  Types of Piggy Banks </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the piggy bank service in a savings bank" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/1891247.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The features of this service include automatic and quick transfer of funds to your wallet.  Today, the client has the right to choose one or more from a list of options for several or the same card: </p><ul><li>  <em>Deductions of interest from expenses.</em>  The value is set as a percentage and is applied to the amount of daily expenses.  The costs in this case include the processes of withdrawing money and transfers, payment for purchases, including via the Internet.  With this option, do not take into account the payment of loans and transfers between your accounts. </li><li>  <em>The deduction of interest from credits to the card.</em>  The client sets the percentage removed after each receipt on his card.  In addition, an acceptable limit is set to prevent unforeseen cost overruns.  This option is the most convenient for salary cards, when from each payment a certain amount is sent to the deposit.  Credit transactions do not include a refund or transfer between your accounts.  There is an option of accumulation, depending on receipts to the card. </li><li>  <em>Fixed.</em>  In this case, the client sets the period for deductions.  This can be a specific day of the week or date, quarter, month, once a week, and more.  In particular, the amount to be transferred to the "wallet" must be indicated.  And then a transfer is made at the indicated date and in the indicated sizes.  It becomes possible to save a certain amount of money thanks to the ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù of Sberbank.  People want to deactivate the service in rare cases. </li></ul><h2>  Ways of registration </h2><p>  You can connect ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù in Sberbank to a deposit using several methods: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  <em>Call the contact center.</em>  To do this, you need to have a card and a passport on hand to voice the information so that the employee can remotely identify the client (without divulging the PIN code of the card).  The operator will be able to talk about the need to perform additional settings and instruct the client on choosing the most suitable type of piggy bank for the client. </li><li>  <em>Apply with a passport or card to the bank office (you will need to enter a PIN code to confirm ownership).</em>  This method is quite convenient, because it allows you to take the necessary actions immediately if they are absent: opening a deposit account, connecting a Mobile Bank.  To connect the Mobile Bank, you need to fill out an application, and to open a deposit account, sign a service and deposit management agreement and write an application. </li><li>  <em>Independently, using the Sberbank-online service</em> .  Working with the Internet Bank is quite simple, because there are a variety of tips and easy-to-use menus.  The mobile bank here is also activated in a specific section and an application is submitted for opening a deposit ‚ÄúPiggy bank‚Äù deposit card in Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  How to disable the service will be described later. </p><h2>  Accumulation Check </h2><p>  To control the balance of funds, a system of SMS alerts has been created.  Each transfer is accompanied by the receipt of information on the size of receipts on the deposit and the balance at the current moment, including the fact that any operation cannot be performed due to the limited balance on the account.  To exceed the limit, you must receive a confirmation, which will also be reported in the notification.  In the Internet bank, Piggy Bank is saved as a separate account, where you can always see the balance and evaluate the situation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="piggy bank card deposit Sberbank how to disable" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/1891245.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Settings </h2><p>  Clients noted a rather convenient location of the ‚ÄúPiggy bank‚Äù account in ‚ÄúSberbank Online‚Äù, which allows you to receive information about the amount of receipts (see statement) and about the balance.  Moreover, the option ‚ÄúInformation on deposit‚Äù allows you to change the settings so that it becomes possible to choose other options for crediting, if the one that was configured initially, for some reason did not fit. </p><h2>  Useful features </h2><p>  Customers find it very convenient that the service does not allow the card to go negative or remove the full balance from it.  In such situations, the client will be informed about the lack of an account.  If the account is not replenished within 10 days, the operation will be canceled, and if the recharge amount exceeds the limit that the client has set, he will need to send an SMS confirmation.  A person can always use his "piggy bank". </p><h2>  Service shutdown </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="piggy bank sberbank how to disconnect and return the money" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/1891244.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  So, you need to disconnect the ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù from Sberbank.  What needs to be done for this? <strong></strong></p><p>  This may be necessary if the client changes jobs.  He just doesn‚Äôt need the service of accumulating funds anymore.  It is also possible when closing the card or if the salary card no longer performs such a function.  Before disabling the service, you should review the basic rules and weigh the decision to disconnect again. </p><h2>  Instructions for disabling "piggy banks" </h2><p>  How to disable "Piggy Bank" in Sberbank via SMS?  This question is often asked.  Let's figure it out. </p><p>  Today there are several ways to disable the service: through the contact center, through Sberbank Online and through the bank branch.  The client can independently disconnect the service at any time through the Internet bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the piggy bank in sberbank via sms" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/1891243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Through Sberbank Online, proceed as follows: </p><ul><li>  We go to the item "Deposits and accounts" or the subsection "Deposits". </li><li>  We see a list of all deposits that the client has, with the balance indicated on them, the amount available for withdrawal, the percentage per annum and the validity period. </li><li>  We click on the account that we need.  In the list of functions below, select the piggy bank. </li><li>  If there are several configured piggy banks on this account, select the one you want to delete. </li><li>  Next, the settings window will open with the limit, percentage, card for deduction and frequency. </li><li>  In the corner on the left, select "Disable."  You can also edit the settings or simply pause the service by pressing the corresponding key. </li><li>  In order for the Piggy Bank service to be disabled, the client will have to confirm that this operation has been completed with the key that he will receive from the SMS message. </li></ul><p>  If the client has funds on the deposit balance, it makes sense to transfer them to the card.  This can be done through the "Payments and Transfers" section after specifying the account number, selecting it from the list and indicating the size. </p><h2>  How to disable the piggy bank deposit in Sberbank? </h2><p>  To apply to the department, you need to have documents confirming the status of the client with you: </p><ul><li>  The card to which you will need to enter the PIN code so that the bank employee understands its true affiliation to the client. </li><li>  Passport or other document with a photograph (passport, driver's license). </li></ul>

    <p>  The bank employee will need to provide the Wallet number, which should be closed.  And immediately in the department it will be possible to transfer to a card or withdraw the balance of funds. </p><h2>  How to disconnect Piggy Bank from Sberbank from the phone? </h2><p>  Instructions for disabling Sberbank's ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù via the phone are also quite simple.  You must contact the Contact Center with a request to close the deposit.  The employee will ask the client to provide him with identification data: card number, account number of ‚ÄúPiggy bank‚Äù, passport data, etc.  Therefore, it is necessary to prepare or view these data in advance, so that they can be announced later.  Also, the operator will ask you to tell him the account number for transferring the balance from the Piggy Bank, if any, to him. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  How to disable "Piggy Bank" on the Sberbank card in other ways? </p><p>  To date, options for disabling services are not provided.  In this, customers see some inconvenience after getting used to conducting basic banking operations remotely. </p><p>  However, the option whose disabling has just been considered is a convenient enough service for accumulation.  Customers talk about the benefits of the service in automating the process and the ability to change settings or withdraw money at any time. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the piggy bank on a sberbank card" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/1891241.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The bulk of reviews about the Piggy Bank service is positive.  Clients note the convenience of creating a reserve fund, which from small amounts deposited every month is formed a year later into a fairly large one.  It will already allow you to purchase any expensive goods without any loans. </p><p>  Moreover, with such a deposit it is possible to receive interest on the balance, although quite insignificant.  In addition, customers have the opportunity to change the types of "Piggy Banks" or choose several options for one or more cards with the condition of transferring to various deposits. </p><p>  We examined how to disconnect Piggy Bank from Sberbank and return the money. </p>
