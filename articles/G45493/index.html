    <p>  Nutrition is one of the important issues, because it is impossible to imagine a really pleasant vacation without delicious food.  Elihotel 4 * has its own spacious restaurant, which accepts guests three times a day.  Breakfast is organized in the form of receptions, and for lunch and dinner guests order dishes from the menu (only snacks are taken out to the common tables).  The menu here is not bad - they serve light salads, fresh fruits, delicious pastries (including sweet croissants), Italian pasta, pizza, meat and fish dishes, and seafood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, tourists themselves can choose the right food scheme.  You can pay for full three meals a day or order only breakfast.  In any case, there will be no problems with food, because there are grocery stores nearby, as well as taverns, where they feed very tasty. </p><h2>  Rest on the seashore: amenities and entertainment </h2>

    <p>  The hotel complex is located almost on the seashore - the beach can be reached in a few minutes.  The coast here is covered with small pebbles, as well as the entrance to the sea.  That is why vacationers are advised to bring special shoes with them (by the way, they can also be purchased here). </p><p>  According to reviews, the waters here are clean and calm, and the depth increases gradually.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are arranged in rows on the shore.  By the way, a pair of deckchairs is assigned to each room - you won‚Äôt have to take a seat in the morning. </p><p>  During the high season, you can rent a boat or a catamaran on the beach, ride a boat and try different kinds of water sports.  There is enough entertainment here.  Alternatively, head to one of the public beaches where fun and noise are always over the edge. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2>

    <p>  Of course, guests can count on some amenities.  Despite the fact that the territory of the hotel is small, there is still a fully equipped and round-the-clock guarded parking.  You can also rent a car or bike here.  By the way, tourists themselves say that a bike ride in the vicinity can be a real adventure. </p><p>  For an extra fee, guests can use the laundry facilities.  There are luggage storage facilities.  Throughout the territory, including facilities for recreation, there is access to high-speed Internet. </p><h2>  Facilities for children </h2><p>  For many parents going on vacation with their child, questions about comfort become top priority.  It‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that you will have to take care of organizing your child‚Äôs leisure activities on your own, as there are no entertainments or animations for small tourists.  Although the kids have a great time at the local beach. </p><p>  But you should not worry about amenities.  Upon request, a bed is delivered to the room - this is a paid service, but the cost of extra bed is not so big.  The restaurant has several high chairs.  Professional nannies also offer their services, but, again, for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Leisure and entertainment at the hotel </h2>

    <p>  Most tourists stay at the hotel, planning to spend all their time on the beach or in the city.  The hotel provides a wonderful overnight stay, but there are no special entertainments here.  The pool is absent, but in most cases it is not required, because the sea is very near.  However, the courtyard has a terrace for relaxing and sunbathing. </p><p>  There are several massage rooms on the territory, however, for such a pleasure you need to pay extra.  On the other hand, good professionals work at the hotel, who offer not only relaxing, but also therapeutic procedures. </p><p>  Animators on site work, but only in the summer months.  They regularly organize some contests and performances, albeit in Italian. </p><p>  Entertainment is worth looking outside the Elihotel 4 *.  Italy is a country with an interesting history and inimitable atmosphere, which is worth enjoying in full.  In the hotel or in the city you can buy an interesting sightseeing tour of the island - there are many places worth seeing. </p><h2>  Hotel Elihotel 4 * (Italy, Sicily): reviews of former guests </h2><p>  The official information published by the hotel is, of course, important.  But sometimes, after talking with tourists who have already visited the hotel, you can get much more useful and, most importantly, more relevant information. </p><p>  Former guests of Elihotel Sant Alessio Siculo 4 * say that this is a pretty good place for a relaxing vacation by the sea.  The rooms here are spacious, furniture and appliances are new.  A huge advantage is the availability of working Wi-Fi in all rooms - the speed here is quite decent.  All rooms are kept in perfect cleanliness. </p><p>  Nearby is a beach with new comfortable sunbeds - the shore is always calm.  By the way, Italians mainly have a rest here, but there are few tourists from other countries.  That is why employees practically do not speak foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã- this is worth preparing for. </p><p>  The food is not bad, but former guests recommend paying in advance only breakfasts at the Elihotel 4 *.  Sicily is an amazing place that is famous for its cuisine, so you should not tie yourself to the hotel for the whole day. </p><p>  The hotel is suitable for a relaxing holiday - fans of noisy beach parties and nightclubs are unlikely to do anything here. </p>
