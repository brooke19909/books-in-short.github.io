Tours to Europe by train: features and recommendations of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you conduct a survey among Russians on the topic ‚ÄúWhat type of transport do you prefer to use when traveling abroad?‚Äù, The plane will definitely lead.  It allows you to quickly get anywhere in the world, and in recent years, airfare prices have become more than affordable.  But, unfortunately, not all people tolerate even short-term flights, for example, to Europe.  This may be due to medical conditions, phobias or simply dislike for this type of travel.  What to do when you want to go on vacation, but the plane is not available?  In this case, you should consider traveling to Europe by train.  All the features of such a trip are dedicated to our article. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="By train to Europe" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1714151.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Russian Railways: trains to Europe </h2><p>  Residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg are in a better position than Russians living in other regions of the country.  After all, the latter will be much more difficult to get to Europe, but Muscovites can easily take <span>this</span> train journey.  Such routes have always existed, but in recent years they are in high demand, and in the summer season, Russians often encounter a lack of tickets to the right country. </p><p>  By train to Europe you can travel alone, as a family or in a big noisy company.  In any case, you will be provided with comfort and convenience, because there is some special charm in calm observation of the landscapes passing by under the uniform clatter of the wheels.  That is how many people imagine a perfect vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From Moscow and St. Petersburg by train to Europe you can get to many countries.  Of course, not all routes suggest a direct route from one point to another, but experienced travelers consider this a minor inconvenience.  In addition, trains travel to Europe in completely different ways.  Russians can hit the road in an unorganized way, that is, on their own, or they can buy a tour at an agency.  Since rail travel abroad is still something unfamiliar to most of our compatriots, we decided to consider these options in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Traveling with Travel Agencies </h2><p>  Almost all Russian agencies sell package tours to Europe.  Over the years, various programs have been developed that can satisfy even the most demanding tastes.  Moreover, almost all routes are in stable demand.  Travel agents in every way praise such trips, listing their advantages.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  maximum security; </li><li>  low cost; </li><li>  the opportunity for a short period of time to get acquainted with different cities; </li><li>  ease of movement between countries. </li></ul><p>  To date, tours to Europe are represented by four main programs: summer and winter holidays, combined and sightseeing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Every year, with the onset of heat, more and more of our compatriots leave for Europe by train to the sea.  Such tours allow you to get acquainted with the intermediate settlements along the route and ultimately relax for a few days in the popular European resort.  Sometimes the tour program also includes a sightseeing program.  Most often, Russians go to sea to the following countries: </p><ul><li>  Italy. </li><li>  Bulgaria </li><li>  France </li></ul><p>  The cost of such a tour ranges from one and a half thousand euros for twelve days (it should be borne in mind that you will spend about a day on the road to Europe). </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trains from St. Petersburg to Europe" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1714141.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Winter travelers to Europe </h2><p>  With the onset of the first frosts, Russians rush to European ski resorts.  Of the total number of extreme sports enthusiasts, trains send more than sixty percent to Europe by train.  And these are pretty good indicators for Russian Railways.  Mostly our compatriots go to Poland, Finland and Norway.  Some experienced tourists with transfers change to France or Spain. </p><p>  The cost of such a tour starts from six hundred euros, which is quite inexpensive for an active and comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Combined Tours </h2><p>  This is a rather difficult form of travel.  Tourists usually travel by train to Brest, and then several European cities pass by bus from there.  At the final point of travel, Russians will wait for rest for five to seven days.  Such a tour can only withstand experienced tourists who are ready to spend a long time on the road. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Train to Europe from Moscow prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1714137.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Excursion package tours </h2><p>  Such vacations are usually in demand in early spring and late autumn, when there is a certain decline in tourist activity in the main areas.  In some cases, tourists travel by train directly to their destination.  Then they can explore only one <span>European city.</span>  Another variant of such a tour resembles a combined one and has one scheme with it, the difference is that the price includes excursions in all cities of destination.  It costs a pleasure of 700 euros. </p><h2>  Independent travel to Europe by train: general description </h2><p>  If you are not afraid to plan trips yourself, then heading to Europe by train is definitely your option.  You can visit almost any European country, because here the railway system is very well developed.  It is worth noting that crossing the border, you find yourself in a special world where the most common form of transport is the train.  For a European, such movement is the most convenient, so you will enjoy comfortable and clean wagons, polite conductors and a developed infrastructure of stations. </p><p>  Train tickets to Europe are mostly bought at the box office; many of them are not sold through the Internet.  But on the official website of Russian Railways you can always see all the possible trains in the "International Routes" section, but you will have to pay for the ticket already at the station. </p><p>  In Europe, the situation with railway tickets is similar: some of them are sold only through ticket offices, and payment by card will raise the cost from five to twenty percent.  Inexperienced travelers often learn this fact from their own sad experience. </p><p>  I would like to add that both Russian and European trains are very convenient.  You do not have to shake for a day in a crowded wagon with an unpleasant odor.  Having decided on a railway trip to Europe, you will discover a completely different world. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="By sea train to Europe" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1714139.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How to get to Europe? </h2><p>  If you have never traveled abroad by train, then before buying tickets you need to find out a few nuances, without knowing which, it will be difficult to plan a trip. </p><p>  For example, <span>high-speed trains</span> to Europe from Moscow depart quite rarely.  A similar route costs Russian Railways quite expensive, so it is often canceled.  The average travel time is 20 or 30 hours. </p><p>  Which trains go to Europe most often?  This is one of the most interesting questions, because many travelers get to European countries on special direct trains, which, as they travel at different stations, get hooked up to different trains.  Thus, a passenger, even without ever stepping onto the platform, can change several trains. </p><p>  You can also go to Europe and the usual direct train, which at numerous stations makes quite long stops.  For example, in Brest a train costs six hours.  This allows tourists to walk around the city and return to the <span>railway station.</span> </p><h2>  Types of cars </h2><p>  The wagons of international trains are made according to the European standard.  They are divided into first and second grade.  The difference between them is the number of passengers.  In addition, the first class is somewhat more spacious than the second.  Also, the difference may be in the comfort of the seats.  Therefore, it is important not to confuse the class of wagons when buying train tickets at the box office. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Which trains go to Europe" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1714796.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Moscow: where can I go by train? </h2><p>  Finland, France, Czech Republic, Holland - you can visit these and many other countries if you choose the railway version of the train and buy a train ticket to Europe from Moscow.  Prices, by the way, do not always depend on the distance traveled.  For example, from Moscow to Paris you can get for 500 euros, and a trip to Helsinki will cost 100 euros. </p><p>  Many Muscovites go straight to Helsinki, and then on a ferry or other train continue their journey through Europe.  This significantly reduces the cost of travel, especially if you take care of a <span>single</span> ticket.  With it, you can travel all over Europe in a few days and save at least 200 euros on these movements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="railways trains to europe" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1714803.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  St. Petersburg: where do the trains go? </h2><p>  The choice of train from St. Petersburg to Europe is quite limited.  Now the inhabitants of the Northern capital can reach Finland, the Czech Republic and Tallinn.  The fare starts from 250 euros. </p><p>  You can drive to Tallinn in a seated carriage, this innovation appeared about a year ago.  Of course, this method of transportation is not the most comfortable, but the price is able to completely change your opinion about such trips - 1300 rubles.  Many students take such a great opportunity to get to Europe for symbolic money. </p><h2>  Rail Travel Planning: Highlights </h2><p>  So, you decided to go to Europe by train.  Where to start preparing for the trip?  What to look for and how to save on tickets?  Let's look at these issues as detailed as possible. </p><p>  First of all, you need to work out the travel route itself.  Your main goal will be to choose a place in Europe to which you will travel by train.  It will be much easier to move further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="high-speed trains to Europe from Moscow" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1714804.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <p>  Keep in mind that Russian Railways allows the purchase of tickets for 60-90 days.  At this point you can purchase the cheapest tickets.  In the future, they will be more expensive.  Before buying, pay attention to possible discounts, they are seasonal or targeted.  On some routes, the Russian Railways service allows you to book a ticket over the Internet, followed by a twelve-hour redemption at the box office. </p><p>  Once in Europe, count how often you plan to travel by train.  If there are a sufficient number of such trips, then purchase a single ticket, which is sold at any box office or on the website.  It is of three types: </p><ul><li>  for one country; </li><li>  for all European countries; </li><li>  for a certain number of days. </li></ul><p>  Keep in mind that in Europe there is no single service for buying train tickets.  Each country has its own website. </p><p>  You can buy a ticket not only through the Internet, but also at the box office, shops and special machines.  If possible, pay in cash - this significantly reduces its cost. </p><p>  When buying a ticket, carefully look at the train designation - it can be high-speed and local.  The first can drive half of Europe in a matter of hours and almost without stops, but the second will slow down at each station. </p>

    <p>  And in conclusion, I would like to tell you one small but very important secret regarding European trains: the doors to the car do not open automatically, there is a special button inside and outside for this.  Do not forget about it, otherwise you will not get on the train, and your journey through Europe will never begin. </p>
