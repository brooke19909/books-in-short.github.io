    <p>  And how to spend the day off in Moscow for the residents of the capital if they do not want to sit in front of the TV for two days, watching their favorite series from beginning to end?  For outdoor recreation, the choice is huge.  Moscow is not only one of the centers of modern civilization, but also the territory on which there are museum reserves and forest parks, including the largest in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Elk Island: even the name attracts </h2><p>  Elk Island, on the territory of which everything is provided for weekend excursions: interesting familiarization routes (44 species of mammals here), playgrounds, places for passive relaxation, food outlets - are waiting for their guests.  The vast expanses (390 ha) of the Kolomenskoye Museum-Reserve, which includes 4 zones that are a historical heritage, are immense.  These include, first of all, the very ancient village of Kolomenskoye, where some of the buildings of the Sovereign's Court, an ancient garden and park have been preserved.  In addition, the estates of Izmailovo, Lefortovo and N. A. Durasov in Lublin, which are palace and park ensembles and <span>natural complexes</span> with historical and architectural monuments.  The <span>museum of wooden architecture</span> deserves special attention <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Supply clearly exceeds demand </h2><p>  If there is such luxury in the city, how can one ask how to spend a day off in Moscow?  Most likely, the question arises due to the abundance of proposals.  It is impossible to inspect Kolomensky's reserved places quickly and quickly.  Therefore, meaningful weekend itineraries have been developed with overnight accommodation.  The Tsaritsyno Museum-Reserve is known all over the world.  Along with Peterhof, he is the pride of the palace and park heritage.  It is impossible to list all the beauties of this palace complex: musical fountains, twisted trellises, cascades of ponds and dozens of other delights surrounding the Big and Small <span>Catherine‚Äôs palaces, the</span> Bread and Opera houses.  The above is far from all that can be seen on the territory of the beautifully restored museum-reserve.  For the program "Weekend in Moscow" all the little things are provided, designed to make the stay of visitors as convenient as possible, enjoyable in all respects, and also informative. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúHow many temples, how many towers on your seven hills!‚Äù </h2>
