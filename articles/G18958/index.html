By accounting for costs and revenues, it will be possible to determine what costs are excessive.  Many things can be abandoned without prejudice to lifestyle.  A simple example: a plastic bag purchased at a supermarket.  If you do not buy it every time, but purchase a special grocery bag, you can save up to 5% of the budget per month.  The proceeds can already be left to increase revenue.  Where to invest money is another question.  It all depends on how much finance you managed to save.

    <h2>  Investment in gold </h2><p>  Those who are not seeking income here and now can consider investing in gold.  This is a fairly profitable, but long-term financial instrument.

You need to study the target audience in advance.  So, for example, in a residential area a store offering special clothing or accessories for hunting and fishing will not be popular.  But products for the home (dishes, curtains, bedding) will diverge quickly enough.

    <p>  It is necessary to think over trading tactics in advance and draw up a business plan.  Investment in land will be beneficial.  Is it possible to earn by selling goods in the rented premises?  With a correctly drawn up business plan, there will be income anyway.  However, you will be able to earn more in your own store.  In addition, if the sale does not work, the premises can be leased or sold. </p><p>  Thinking over the tactics of trading, it is worth choosing what kind of wrapping will be.  You can double the amount of goods.  At the same time, sales will be minimal.  With minimal cheating, people will often come to the store, which means that income will be higher. </p><p>  Recently, business with China has gained immense popularity.  Many people know that most goods are produced in this country.  If you find a good supplier, you will be able to sell really high-quality products with a wrapping up to 200%.  Many entrepreneurs are already successfully working in this direction. </p><p>  With the development of information technology, business opportunities have become much greater.  Today, you can sell goods not only in a real store, but also through the Internet.  Thus, income will be significantly increased.  After all, sales will go not only from buyers in one city, but also from residents of other settlements of the country. </p><p>  Before you make money on investing in your own business, you should evaluate all the advantages and disadvantages of this method.  The plus is that the investor manages his own business, optimizes all processes.  The owner of his own company or store is his own boss.  Only the state will have to answer on issues of timely payment of taxes.  In addition, for a good business project, it will be easy to find co-investors.  You can get a bank loan for development. </p><p>  The downside is that it will not be possible to competently conduct one's business without possession of basic economic knowledge and skills.  Managing your own business is hard work.  You need to be prepared for the fact that at first there will be no time for quality sleep and good rest. </p><p>  Where is it better to invest money?  There are really many tools.  It is worth evaluating your capabilities correctly so as not to lose everything. </p>
