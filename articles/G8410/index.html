    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Hotel Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * was built in the early seventies of the last century.  At that time, he was considered the most luxurious hotel complex in Tunisia.  However, after several decades, the hulls noticeably dilapidated and began to require repair.  In 2012, the hotel was closed for two years and underwent a large-scale reconstruction.  In parallel, additional buildings were erected on the territory, which significantly changed the appearance of the hotel.  For its guests Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * opened its doors only in 2015.  Since that time, in the low season, the hotel complex annually carries out repair work.  This allows you to maintain the interior of the hotel at the proper level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until 2016, Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa was called differently, so in tourist catalogs you can be offered it under a different name.  Please note that this hotel is part of a hotel chain.  All of them are located on the same territory with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfifty thousand square meters.  Vacationers are free to move from one hotel to another and use almost all infrastructure facilities.  However, guests eat strictly on the territory of their hotel.  This nuance is always clearly tracked. </p><p>  Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * is the main building and several cottages located on the territory of fifteen hectares.  Numbers are presented in the amount of three hundred seventy-six pieces.  Most of them have magnificent sea views.  Guests can choose from four categories of apartments, however the maximum number of guests in one room is limited to three adults. </p><h2>  Location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Many Russians who visited the hotel on vacation claim that it has a very convenient location.  Located Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * in Hammamet.  This resort is considered one of the most developed in Tunisia, so it is very easy to go on a trip from here to almost any part of the country. </p><p>  Most tourists are eager to visit Medina, which is why they choose Hammamet for themselves.  Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * is located just two kilometers from the city center.  This allows vacationers to explore its attractions without spending money on renting a vehicle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you consider the location of the hotel relative to its proximity to the airport, then it is worth considering those air gates that are the destination on your tickets.  For example, it will take quite a long time to get from <span>Monastir Airport</span> , because you need to overcome a distance of one hundred and fifteen kilometers.  But the Enfid airport terminal is the closest to the hotel, they are only fifty-five kilometers apart. </p><p>  The hotel complex Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * is located on the first coastline.  Therefore, from the gentle sea, its guests will be separated by some two hundred meters. </p>

    <h2>  Coast </h2><p>  Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * beach causes tourists only positive emotions.  Despite the fact that hotel guests have the opportunity to use only that part of the beach area that belongs to the hotel complex, this does not spoil their vacation at all.  After all, the beach stretches for four hundred meters, and its width is about twenty meters. </p><p>  It is worth clarifying that each of the Novostar hotels has its own piece of the coast.  Each beach area has its own distinctive features.  However, focusing on reviews of Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 *, we can say with confidence that its beach is the most quiet and calm.  Therefore, partygoers are advised to swim and sunbathe at a nearby hotel complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All tourists note that the beach is clean, and the number of sunbeds is quite enough for all vacationers.  Many take up space for themselves as early as eight in the morning, but even at a later hour you can always find a free sun lounger. </p><p>  There is a bar on the shore where guests can enjoy a wide range of drinks, including fresh and aromatic coffee.  Almost all coffee lovers enthusiastically respond to its magnificent taste. </p><p>  It is nice that the hotel took care of beach towels.  They are received without deposit and by appointment. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure facilities </h2><p>  Hotel complexes with four or five stars are usually characterized by an abundance of various infrastructure objects.  Hotel Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * is no exception.  All conditions have been created here so that guests feel comfortable. </p><p>  A lot of enthusiasm is caused by the large outdoor pool.  The hotel also has an indoor pool, but it begins to work only in the off-season, when the air temperature does not allow swimming in the fresh air. </p><p>  The front desk is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Reception staff speak several languages ‚Äã‚Äãand, as our compatriots say, they speak Russian very well. </p><p>  Near the front desk is a currency exchange, ATM and luggage storage.  For an additional fee, you can use the safety deposit boxes at the reception.  It often stores jewelry and other valuables that are dangerous to leave in your room. </p><p>  A business center is located on site.  It also includes a small banquet room where you can hold any festive event.  At the request of guests, the hotel staff will prepare a turnkey holiday.  This service is also paid separately. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is extensive parking.  Guests can leave rented vehicles here absolutely free of charge.  However, I want to note that the parking lot is empty most of the time, because in Tunisia it is not customary to move outside the tourist group. </p><p>  Throughout the hotel complex there are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants.  Each institution works according to its schedule and offers different food options.  We will talk about this in one of the following sections of the article. </p><p>  Guests can relax in the thalasso center and beauty salon.  You can also often meet guests in the shopping center.  There are quite a lot of small shops offering a wide range of inexpensive goods.  It is noteworthy that they are all of great quality. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  The high level of service in Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * distinguishes it from many other hotels in Tunisia.  Here, each guest feels the care of the hotel complex employees almost twenty-four hours a day.  At Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa, free services are on a par with paid services, so there are a lot of options for vacationers to choose from. </p><p>  All guests note that the hotel has excellent internet access.  The signal catches even on the beach, which rarely happens on vacation.  Therefore, you will be able to contact your loved ones at any moment and solve accumulated business issues. </p><p>  If necessary, tourists are invited to use the laundry and dry cleaning services.  This service needs to be paid separately, however it is very popular among guests. </p><p>  The hotel has its own doctor, so do not worry in cases where urgent medical attention is needed.  Tourists will always come to the aid of a qualified medical professional who will conduct an examination and prescribe the necessary course of treatment.  Medicines are often bought also at the hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa: hotel compliments </h2><p>  It is nice that the hotel complex provides a number of compliments to its guest.  They, of course, are few, but still they exist.  A compliment can be obtained in two cases: </p><ul><li>  birthday; </li><li>  wedding. </li></ul><p>  On the name day, a separate congratulation program is provided for children and adults.  Little guests receive a birthday cake from a team of animators in costumes of cartoon characters and congratulations to a special group on the Internet.  Adults will get a large cake with a festive decoration. </p><p>  Newlyweds who married less than two weeks ago before arriving at the hotel must notify about their celebration when booking the hotel.  At the time of settlement, they will be given champagne to create a festive atmosphere.  If you got married later than this, then notify the hotel administration.  In this case, a room will be decorated and a fruit basket will be delivered upon arrival. </p><h2>  How to have fun on vacation? </h2><p>  Those who prefer to spend time not only on sunbeds by the sea are always interested in what kind of entertainment in Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * they can provide.  I want to say that their list is extremely wide. </p><p>  Tennis fans will appreciate the opportunity to play table and tennis.  For this, several areas are equipped on the territory of the hotel complex.  Minigolf is also available for vacationers, and for an additional fee, a large golf course is located approximately six kilometers from the hotel.  Slot machines are installed in the lobby of the main building, and amateurs often spend time with them near them. </p><p>  I especially want to talk about the animation team.  From the very early morning, professionals are ready to do everything so that vacationers do not have to get bored.  They can take part in fun morning exercises, sporting events and all kinds of quests.  Often at the hotel various master classes are held.  According to tourists, the most popular are dance and cooking classes. </p><p>  Among the animators there are those who speak Russian well, so evening shows are always fun and dynamic.  Every day the program changes and something new and interesting is invented. </p>

    <h2>  Voucher cost </h2><p>  Tours in Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * are very popular, so it is best to buy a ticket in advance.  In this situation, its cost can be significantly lower than a couple of weeks before departure. </p><p>  On average, for two weeks of relaxation for two in September at this hotel with a flight from Moscow, our compatriots will have to pay about one hundred and fifty thousand rubles.  Six nights under the same conditions will cost almost eighty thousand rubles. </p><p>  Summing up, I want to say that Novostar Premium Bel Azur Thalassa 4 * is the best option to relax in an exotic country by the sea. </p>
