    <p>  As for the water in the pools, according to visitors, it is very clean and warm.  Swimming is nice.  The territory of the water park is clean and well-groomed, which is also an important factor when relaxing with children.  For those who have enjoyed the swimming, there are comfortable sunbeds for relaxation on the territory of Limpopo, there is enough space for everyone. </p><p>  He who is hungry goes to a cozy cafe of the complex, where you can have a tasty snack, taste refreshing drinks or enjoy aromatic tea with cake.  In front of the cafe there is a small playground where the guys play while their order is being prepared. </p><p>  A big plus of the water park is its small workload.  There are practically no queues here, all people relax measuredly, no one is in a hurry.  The only thing that guests are advised to take into account is the complex - in addition to paying the admission ticket, those who wish to swim will have to leave a deposit in the locker room in order to get the key to the locker.  Visitors also note that valuables should not be left unattended, because in case of their loss, the organization is not responsible. </p><p>  In general, ‚ÄúLimpopo‚Äù is a cozy and small aquacomplex, the rest of which will be remembered for a long time.  Many residents of the city are its regular guests and recommend visiting this particular water park in Tashkent. </p>
