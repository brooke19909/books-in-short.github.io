    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Until 1985, the current territory of the complex was not built up.  In the forests, near the <span>mountain of Stara Planina,</span> deer were found.  Hence the name of the resort.  The resort complex Elenite (Bulgaria) was built by specialists from Finland.  The work was completed in the eighties, but until the nineteen ninety-third year the complex was closed.  The Elenite project is in many ways similar to the famous Golden Sands resort, but at the same time it has significant differences in architecture.  The park territory of this resort is built up with low-rise villas.  This allowed to preserve the nature of these places in their original form.  Today it includes three- and four-star hotels.  They are located on the seashore.  All of them have their own well-groomed sandy beaches.  Their length is eight hundred meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria villa Elenite" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/450956.jpg" width="600"></div>

Bulgaria is known for many recreation areas, but this is perhaps the cutest and most romantic corner in the south of the country.  It is located near Burgas and Sunny Beach, near the Stara Planina Mountain.  The village is well protected from cold winds.  The climate here is mild and warm, which makes the stay here very comfortable for a relaxing and measured vacation with children and loved ones. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Many Russians have long appreciated the resort of Elenite.  Bulgaria, reviews about holidays in which it has long crossed the borders of the country, is striving to develop tourism more and more actively every year.  If you have chosen Elenite for your vacation, you should know that the climate in this place is temperate, with little Mediterranean influence.  It features a long swimming season - from May to October.  The average summer temperature is + 28-30 degrees.  Water heats up to +26 degrees.  The resort is located in a picturesque bay, in which northern winds are not terrible - it is reliably protected by the Stara Planina Mountain from the north.  A stunning combination of the purest sea air and luxurious coniferous forests magically affects the human body.  Holidays in Elenite (Bulgaria) do not wear out the sweltering heat.  This is what attracts many here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort elenite bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/450957.jpg" width="600"></div>
