A magnificent medieval monster was built in order to block the English entrance to Wales.  Fortunately, times have changed.  And the castle of Carnarvon?  What happened to him today?  What does he look like?  Do tourists like this place?  However, the "great and terrible" all the same.  He stands with his towers in the sky, remembering his "stormy youth." </p>

    <h2>  Power show </h2><p>  Imagine that you are a powerful English king in the prime of life and want to strengthen English influence in Wales, restore the feudal army, strengthen local authorities, force small traders to abide by the knightly foundations.  What actions will you take?  If you were Edward I, then you would order a ring of castles to be erected - a medieval means to force people to walk along the line. </p><p>  Edward built the stone castle of Carnarvon (Wales) in 1283 (before that it was wooden, Norman type), at about the same time as his other two ‚Äúblockbusters‚Äù - Harlich and Conwy.  The cost of this "show of power" was enormous - almost 90 percent of the country's annual income was spent on it.  A very rich and ambitious ruler wanted to be sure that his memory would survive for centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Master of architecture </h2><p>  Carnarvon - a castle in Snowdonia (a region in the north of Wales) - could not look ugly.  Edward did not hire the first architect he came across; he invited the famous military architect of that era to collaborate.  His name is Jacques de Saint-Georges d'Esp√©ranche of Savoy (department in the east of France), which is located near <span>Lake Geneva.</span>  The master‚Äôs idea was amazing: strong walls, octagonal towers ... </p>

    <p>  The Carnarvon Castle should have been decorated with alternating multi-colored stripes of limestone and sandstone, the interior should be shone with magnificent frescoes <span>(painting on raw plaster),</span> reminiscent of those that adorned the Westminster Hall and beautiful stained glass windows.  The castle was supposed to create amenities such as bathrooms, toilets, and to commission water supply. </p><p>  This is so, but it is known that one of the most famous tourist attractions in North Wales was not built in full accordance with the project.  Due to the aforementioned high construction costs, the budget ‚Äúburst‚Äù, and some of the architect‚Äôs ideas remained on paper. </p><h2>  Intimidate dissent </h2><p>  Erecting the castle of Carnarvon, whose walls resemble those of Constantinople, Edward I pursued his main goal: to impress and intimidate his subjects.  The formidable look of the colossus alone pierced the heart of everyone who dared to question the authority of a powerful ruler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main intimidation was the <span>Royal Gate: a</span> drawbridge, no less than six barriers, arrow loops, spy slots, killer holes through which deadly substances (boiling water, oil) and objects were thrown at the attackers, leaving those who were hidden unharmed behind the powerful walls of Carnarvon. </p>

    <h2>  Sold son </h2><p>  Everyone who has ever been interested in Carnarvon Castle, interesting facts from the biography of a stone monster, were amazed to hear the following story.  Edward I sold his son to the Welsh, demanding that they be given to the rulers of a man who does not know a single English word.  Not a single word?  Excellent!  And he brought them his tiny baby. </p><p>  As you understand, the Welsh were not very enthusiastic about English domination in their home country.  The birth of a son in the castle in 1284 was an excellent opportunity for Edward I to secure reliable rear areas and turn the situation in his favor. </p><h2>  Triumph was short-lived </h2><p>  Yes, a child named Edward Kernarfon became a Welshman (Wallisi - the ancient name of Wales) and was crowned as Prince of Wales in 1301.  But this was just a deliberate propaganda move.  The language of the nobility of England was still French then, was it any wonder that the child did not speak English?  Until the boy reached the age of ten, his uncle John Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, ruled the country. </p>

    <p>  In 1307, the child became King Edward II.  His reign was, by many accounts, disastrous.  Later, the ruler was overthrown from the throne by his wife Isabella, nicknamed the ‚ÄúFrench Wolf‚Äù.  The overthrow gave impetus to the feudal feuds that took place in the second half of the 15th century (the well-known War of the Scarlet and White Rose).  The unfortunate himself died while in custody at Pontefract Castle. </p><h2>  Still menacing </h2><p>  Currently, the English built-in castle is one of Wales' most valuable architectural treasures.  Already as you approach him it is easy to imagine what kind of threat he posed in medieval times.  Towering over the mouth of the Seiont River, the castle dominates the small town of Kernarfon, ‚Äúwoven‚Äù from a web of 17-18 streets surrounded by medieval stone walls. </p><p>  Once inside the castle, you will be amazed at the scale of the building, a significant part of which is not damaged.  You can freely roam the expanses, admiring the views of Kernarfon.  Particularly impressive is the tall Eagle Tower.  Climbing her spiral staircase, then going down, then climbing, you will reach a platform from which it is easy to see the green central zone, where in 1969 Prince Charles went through a formal ceremony of investorship as a Prince of Wales. </p>

    <p>  Today you can hear a lot of rave reviews from tourists who visited the castle.  They talk about the excellent preservation of the building, the delicate restoration of the outside and inside, where it was needed.  Carnarvon, better than other military fortresses, tells the story of the English conquest of Wales and the participation of its citizens in armed conflicts during the Civil War. </p>
