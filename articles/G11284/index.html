  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inguinal lymph nodes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The lymphatic system is a huge network of vessels that penetrate the human body, which direct the flow of lymph to the lymph nodes.  One of its most important functions is the purification of tissues from metabolic products, microbes, foreign substances and toxins.  It is the lymphatic system that provides the body's immune defense. </p><p>  <span>Lymph nodes</span> are rounded formations, their size ranges from 1 mm to 2 cm, and the total number exceeds six hundred.  They serve as a barrier to the spread of infection and even inhibit the development of <span>cancer cells.</span>  There are several main groups of lymph nodes, located in such a way as to protect all the main organs of a person from infections.  Many <span>lymph nodes are</span> located in the chest and abdominal cavities, as well as in the armpits, on the bends of the limbs, on the neck.  And, of course, the inguinal lymph nodes play a crucial role. </p><p>  When our bodies cope with their tasks, we don‚Äôt notice them.  But should there be any kind of malfunction in the work - unpleasant sensations appear.  The lymphatic system is no exception.  What does the enlarged and painful inguinal lymph nodes signal?  Usually this way our body reacts to the penetration of a viral infection.  However, there may be more serious reasons. </p><p>  Inguinal lymph nodes pass lymph through themselves, which comes from <span>the groin,</span> genitals, lower half of the rectum, lower abdominal wall and legs.  If a slight infection of the body occurs, then the enlargement of the lymph nodes can go unnoticed.  The more the infection acts on the body, the stronger the response manifests itself in the form of an increase in lymph nodes.  The infection disappears - swelling and discomfort go away.  However, if the lymph nodes do not shrink for several days, if you feel pain, and the skin in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site of the node has turned red, you should immediately consult a doctor.  A situation may become especially serious when these phenomena are accompanied by fever and weakness. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Inflammation of the lymph nodes</span> in the groin can indicate kidney stones, various hernias, lipomas, as well as serious diseases such as sexually transmitted infections, cancer, HIV.  Enlarged inguinal lymph nodes in women may indicate advanced genital infections.  Complications that developed with this can lead to infertility.  Remember that one of the causes of enlarged lymph nodes in the groin may be cancer.  Do not delay the visit to the doctor for a long time.  With modern methods of treatment, the diagnosis at an early stage greatly increases the chances of a complete cure. </p><p>  Naturally, the doctor will not only prescribe treatment to eliminate the underlying disease, but will also take measures so that the inguinal lymph nodes swell less and do not cause discomfort.  Often you can hear advice to use in such cases a wonderful folk remedy - compresses.  But before you follow it, be sure to consult a doctor, because sometimes warming procedures can only worsen the condition. </p><p>  <span>The</span> doctor determines the <span>inflamed lymph nodes</span> by palpation.  If you suspect that your lymph nodes are out of order, you can test them yourself.  Of course, this does not replace the diagnosis that an experienced specialist will conduct.  However, at the initial stage, such a check will help determine if your inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged.  Their location is not difficult to find: they are above and under the fold, which is formed when you bend your leg in the hip joint.  If the lymph nodes are healthy, they are mobile and painless.  And if you find yourself an enlarged node, then you should not immediately panic.  The good thing is that this fact is evidence of a properly functioning immunity.  And if you need any treatment, only a doctor can decide. </p>
