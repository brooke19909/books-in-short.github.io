    <h2>  Mystic stories </h2><p>  The entire Arkhangelsk region is shrouded in mystical stories, because in the district there are dense forests and swamps.  According to the old huntsman, this happened on the border of the Vinograd and Verkhnetoemsky region, where there is a huge swamp called the Great.  There are many mushrooms and berries, but there are practically no people in this area.  In these places, even the compass malfunctions, you seem to be going in the right direction, and you go a few kilometers from your native places.  The huntsman walked only along the path, trying to get to the last hut in his territories, but the fog was thickening.  And in an instant the fog disappeared, and around unfamiliar places, somewhere nearby a murmuring stream, located on the territory of another huntsman in the Verkhnetoemsky district.  And my grandfather was surprised how it was possible in a few minutes to be 60 kilometers from his forestry. </p><p>  Many people claim that they saw UFOs near the village of Vorontsy in the Vinogradsky district.  Eyewitnesses say they saw unusual flying objects in 1999, 2014 and 2015.  And some even personally met aliens! </p>
