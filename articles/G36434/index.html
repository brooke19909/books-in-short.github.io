The company took into account all the shortcomings that were associated Desire and Incredible, and flaunted three new smartphones.  Among them was one flagship - HTC One X, the characteristics of which were designed to compete with the Galaxy S3 from Samsung, which, in principle, did at a fairly high level.  The phone, like the entire line of new smartphones, was recognized as one of the most successful models of 2012.  In the wake of this success, the company from Taiwan tried to consolidate the success, so in subsequent years it was possible to observe the appearance of more and more interesting models from HTC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one x specifications" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545297.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Ergometric features of the smartphone </h2><p>  You should start the review of this smartphone with the fact that it is very comfortable "sitting" in the hand, and the sensations that the matte surface of the panel conveys are very pleasant.  It should be noted that the phone is monolithic, so when using it there will not be any backlash that was possible on other models of this company.  In general, the company made a very serious bid with the release of <span>HTC One</span> X. The external state of the phone says a lot.  What is the use of <span>Gorilla Glass</span> as a glass on the screen in order to avoid unwanted scratches! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you look at the front of the phone, then in the upper part you can see a speaker for conversation and a camera that can only be used in offline mode as a mirror.  There are 4 buttons on the bottom of the screen: Home, Back, and Task Manager.  On the right side of the smartphone, you can find the volume control, and on the top - the power button of the smartphone, as well as openings for the SIM card and headphones.  On the left side of the smartphone is a hole for USB-devices.  If you turn the smartphone over, you can find a camera in 8 MP.  The smartphone itself can be of two colors: black or white.  If you choose the white option, then the edging of the camera will be silver, if black - then red. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one x 32gb specifications" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545298.jpg" width="314"></div></h2><h2>  Feature technology used in HTC One X </h2><p>  The characteristics of this phone are such that it is one of the first smartphones to use a quad-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz.  Another plus of this smartphone is its <span>full-HD</span> screen resolution.  In addition, HTC One X boasts a gigabyte of RAM.  Of course, this may not seem enough, but this phone loads quite ‚Äúheavy‚Äù games quite simply.  The only drawback in the device can only be called a 1800 mAh battery, and then for the reason that it is non-removable and cannot be replaced with a more capacious one.  There may also be problems if the battery fails and you have to change it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Operational and software </h2><p>  HTC could also use Windows Phone as the operating system, because we know that they have used this operating system in the past.  But today on HTC One X there is ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù 4.0 with the possibility of a subsequent update to version 4.2.  Very good is the HTC Sense program, which gives the standard Android interface an identity.  As additional functions that are new compared to previous phones, you can highlight the ability to unlock the phone only when your face coincides with the photo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one x specifications" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545308.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Camera and smartphone image quality </h2><p>  The camera is always the Taiwanese company‚Äôs <span>Achilles heel</span> .  And not to say that the quality of the smartphone‚Äôs shots is poor, it's just that competitors have better ones.  The camera has 8 megapixels, as well as the ability to shoot high-definition video.  In addition, One Series smartphones have the ability to take photos in panoramic mode. </p><p>  Detailing pictures is poor.  Moreover, for some reason the camera shoots better at night than during the day.  Night photos are sharper, while daytime photos, on the contrary, are blurry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one x specifications Price" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545311.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone screen </h2><p>  The screen size of this smartphone is 4.7 inches.  This is a good enough and optimal size for smartphones.  At the same time, the screen resolution is 1280 x 960, which allows you to watch and shoot video in high definition.  The screen display is developed on Super LCD technology.  This technology allows you to view text from any angle and in any light.  In this case, there is no problem with the ability to read the book of interest to you using HTC One X. The technical characteristics of this smartphone allow you to do this. </p><h2>  Listening to audio and watching videos </h2><p>  Listening to music with this smartphone is a pleasure.  Moreover, this can be done both with headphones and without them.  The company is trying to work on these functions as it should.  Surely a great merit in this belongs to their partnership with Bits Audio.  It is also worth noting that when you turn on the headphones and you will be able to enable the Beats function, which will give a certain fullness to the sound.  As for the video, movies can be watched on HTC One X 32gb.  Phone features allow this completely.  But it‚Äôs worth taking a charger with you, because after watching one or two films, the battery can be completely discharged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one m7 specifications and reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545352.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about this smartphone </h2><p>  Today in the world a lot of people use the smartphone HTC One X. Features, customer reviews and expert opinions are almost identical.  Many users are happy with their purchase, claiming that the smartphone justified absolutely every cent invested in its purchase.  It‚Äôs hard to disagree.  Experts say that you can buy both 32 GB and 16 GB HTC One X. The characteristics of 16 GB are no different from those of a smartphone with 32 GB, but it costs less.  Therefore, if the amount of internal memory in the phone is not so important to you, there is the option of buying a <span>cheaper smartphone.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one x specifications 16" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545349.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  HTC One X, specifications, price </h2><p>  By purchasing the flagship smartphone of 2012 from the Taiwanese manufacturer of high-tech NTS phones, you will receive a few additional items.  Firstly, this is a proprietary box, the design of which has been updated.  She has no pointed corners.  Secondly, this is all the <span>technical documentation</span> that can help you if you have any questions about how to use your smartphone.  Thirdly, it‚Äôs a charger that is best not to be pulled out of your pocket at all and always carried with you, as the phone can run out very quickly.  Fourth, this is a USB adapter, which is designed to connect a smartphone to a computer in order to transfer any files or to configure end-to-end connection.  And finally, fifthly, these are branded headphones from the NTS.  There is nothing special about them, so if you are a music lover, then it is better to immediately buy yourself an additional, better version of such a headset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one x specifications reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545348.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the prices for this smartphone, initially, after the announcement, it cost about 700 US dollars.  Gradually, it became cheaper, and to date, this smartphone can be easily purchased for 350-400 US dollars. </p><h2>  Review Summary </h2><p>  Summing up all of the above, we can conclude that this phone is a very interesting option and will be quite relevant even today.  The pluses of the smartphone, the developer of which is the Taiwanese manufacturer of high-tech smartphones NTS, include its stunning ergonomics, large screen and great sound.  Moreover, the last plus is a merit not only of the company itself, but also of partners who, with each new line of smartphones, are trying to make the sound more and more saturated and pleasant to hear.  The disadvantages of this smartphone are the battery and camera.  Moreover, the battery should be mentioned for two reasons.  The first is that it is quickly discharged, and the second is that it cannot be replaced without assistance.  As for the camera, everything is ambiguous here. </p><p>  In general, the smartphone is great, but if you want something newer, you can take HTC One M7.  Description, specifications and reviews about this model suggest that this is a high-end smartphone. </p>
