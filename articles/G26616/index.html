It is not difficult to do this.  Especially when you consider that there are several options for the development of events. </p><p>  Mobile banking connects: </p><ul><li>  in any branch of Sberbank; </li><li>  through ATMs; </li><li>  through payment terminals. </li></ul><p>  Consider the procedure using an ATM.  In the case of terminals from Sberbank, you will have to act in a similar way. </p><p>  Instructions for connecting the Mobile Bank service (Sberbank Online will not work without such an option) looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Insert a plastic card into the ATM and start working with it. </li><li>  On the main screen of the machine, click on "Payments in my city" - "Mobile Bank". </li><li>  Select the "Connect" option. </li><li>  Indicate the type of banking.  Economy is free, but it lacks some features.  You will have to pay 60 rubles per month for the ‚ÄúFull‚Äù package, but banking will be as complete as possible. </li><li>  Enter the phone number to which you want to connect the service. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  As soon as the client completes the above steps, he will be able to use mobile banking.  And the studied option will be available for connection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile bank sberbank online" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2109190.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Without registering </h2><p>  What is Sberbank Online?  This is the name of the Internet banking service from Sberbank.  With it, users will be able to make transfers and payments fairly quickly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is not necessary to register in the system to use banking.  Some prefer to receive one-time login details.  If you want to regularly use Sberbank Online, it is better to have a separate profile. </p><p>  How to do without registration?  You will need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Insert a card into an ATM or terminal from Sberbank. </li><li>  In the main menu, select "Sberbank Online" - "Get Login Information". </li><li>  Indicate mobile phone number.  Sometimes this item is automatically skipped. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  In the end, the user will be given a check, which indicates the password for login and login.  You can connect the Internet.  Sberbank Online will be available without registration as many times as it is written on the issued check. </p><h2>  Ways to connect banking </h2><p>  But, as we already said, for constant use of the system it is better to register on the service.  Otherwise, the client of Sberbank will get a lot of problems and trouble. </p><p>  The Sberbank Online system for individuals can connect: </p><ul><li>  at ATMs; </li><li>  through payment terminals; </li><li>  in any branch of Sberbank; </li><li>  on the official page of the service. </li></ul><p>  The latest layout is the least popular.  After all, customers most often prefer to independently connect certain options.  It is very comfortable.  And most importantly - free and fast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="online sberbank system" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2109186.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Activation of Sberbank Online </h2><p>  Connecting the studied option through ATMs or payment terminals of Sberbank is not much different from the procedure for issuing one-time login data.  You just have to click on the "Connect" item, and not on "Get a one-time login and password." </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to registration by contacting Sberbank.  In this case, it is proposed: </p><ol><li>  Take documents with you - passport, plastic card, phone. </li><li>  Contact the employees of Sberbank with a request to connect the mentioned option. </li><li>  Fill out the application in the prescribed form. </li><li>  Submit a processing request. </li></ol><p>  Most often, citizens simply turn to Sberbank employees with a request to activate Sberbank Online (Internet banking) and wait.  Employees themselves using terminals or ATMs, as well as specialized computers activate the studied option.  Everything takes about 2-3 minutes. </p><p>  Ultimately, a person will have a permanent Sberbank Online password and login.  This data will have to be used for authorization on the portal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="online sberbank system for individuals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2109185.jpg"></div>
