Overview of the best camera models and their description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Action cameras are successful not only among extreme sportsmen, but also gaining popularity both among professional operators and amateurs.  Athletes value devices for environmental protection and ease of use, and operators for compactness and the ability to receive exciting shots.  Cyclists buy action cameras for use as a regular DVR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.savantmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gopro what is" class="if uuid-3096633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/3096633.jpg"></div><h2>  GoPro Brand Benefits </h2><p>  What is a GoPro?  A California company was the first to introduce action-format cameras to the world, so today most people associate such models with products of a particular brand.  There are a lot of action cameras on the market, but GoPro is the leader.  Brand models bypass competitors in several ways: </p><ol><li><p>  Proprietary software.  The cameras support software for PCs and smartphones so that users can quickly process footage, synchronize between devices and transmit. </p></li><li><p>  Water resistant.  Competitors Xiaomi, Sony, and Garmin offer waterproof cases in addition to cameras, while GoPros are designed to be submerged by default.  No additional fixtures are required for this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li><li><p>  Voice control.  The voice assistant supports seven languages, while the models of many other brands speak only English. </p></li><li><p>  Electronic stabilization.  A huge advantage of Go Pro, which is especially appreciated by professionals, is electronic rather than optical stabilization. </p></li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="keddr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camera gopro reviews" class="if uuid-3096635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/3096635.jpg"></div><h2>  Rating of the best GoPro cameras </h2><p>  GoPro camera - is it really a market leader or just a big name?  Judging by the reviews, the action cameras of the American brand are really high-quality and functional.  The models are universal, small in size, resistant to damage and have a large set of options.  The only common GoPro flaw that users note is the relatively high price.  Some cameras also have a small amount of internal memory (the problem is solved by buying an SD card) and have a built-in battery (this complicates the repair). </p><p>  Which GoPro camera model (reviews will help determine) the best?  It all depends on the requirements of the user, because different models offer a different set of functions.  To navigate in all its diversity, the rating will help: </p><ol><li><p>  GoPro Hero 7. A flagship that shoots excellent 4K video and automatically stabilizes the image, so the GoPro camera stabilizer when choosing a Hero 7 model will be a completely unnecessary purchase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__7rx"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></li><li><p>  GoPro Hero 6. In 4k it doesn‚Äôt shoot very well (resolution 60 FPS), stabilization is on the list of options, but lags behind Hero 7. Judging by user reviews, the cost of the model is clearly overpriced.  However, this does not prevent Hero 6 from remaining in the lead.  If there is no good discount on it, it‚Äôs better to pay a little more and get a ‚Äúseven‚Äù. </p></li><li><p>  GoPro Hero.  This model is the foundation of all foundations.  The camera works simply and clearly, it shoots stabilized Full HD-video.  The case is used the same as in more expensive models.  The screen is a 2-inch touchscreen, water resistant up to 10 m. Among the shortcomings can be noted 4: 3 aspect ratio when shooting 1440 pixels and the lack of HDR in Full HD. </p></li><li><p>  GoPro Hero 5 Session. </p></li><li>  GoPro Hero 3. </li></ol><h2>  GoPro Hero 5 Session </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gopro what is it" class="if uuid-3096636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/3096636.jpg"></div><p>  Very compact camera that is controlled by one button.  There is no screen and you need an application to work, but this does not push Hero 5 Session back in comparison with the leaders.  GoPro allows you to shoot 4K video at a speed of 30 frames per second. </p><p>  There is an image stabilization function, water resistance up to 10 meters and voice control.  The camera is tiny (a cube with a side of 37 mm, weight - 74 g), so it can be used for a quadrocopter, it can easily be attached to the helmet of a motorcyclist or cyclist, and can be used as a DVR. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Overview of GoPro Hero 3 </h2><p>  One of the most reliable cameras in the GoPro line, which got into the rating due to its relatively low cost.  Hero 3 is completely miniature, comes with an underwater box that allows divers to use the gadget.  Management is implemented with just a couple of keys on the case, but it‚Äôs more convenient to work with settings from a smartphone that syncs over Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  Other worthy models </h2><p>  What is a GoPro?  This is a brand for which it is very difficult to make a fair rating, because each model has several advantages and a number of disadvantages.  Therefore, when choosing an action camera, you need to focus only on the user's needs and the expected conditions for using the device.  For example, if you need a long battery life with standard functions, then reliable Hero 3 is suitable. </p><h2>  GoPro Hero 4 Session </h2><p>  What is a GoPro?  The brand has long been associated with the flagships of the market, but gradually the need arose to create budget devices.  The Hero 4 Session camera turned out to be compact, but functional: it is possible to shoot in Full HD or lower quality.  There is no powerful processor, which ensures longer operation of the device.  In some modes, this GoPro model runs for up to two hours continuously. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mounts for gopro camera" class="if uuid-3096637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/3096637.jpg"></div><p>  The camera is equipped with sound-canceling microphones and the usual modules Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.  There is no LCD display, so for settings and framing you need to ensure synchronization with your smartphone.  In this case, the device is very hot.  The case is waterproof, so there is no need to purchase a special case.  The disadvantage of the camera in the absence of a removable battery is that if the charge runs out, you can only remove it after connecting an external battery. </p><h2>  Gopro hero 4 black </h2><p>  A successful model, which is still used by many.  Demand for the GoPro Hero 4 Black is not falling.  The gadget has good photosensitivity, so it shoots in the dark much better than other models of the Hero series.  The viewing angle of the optics reaches 170 degrees, but if necessary, the parameter is adjusted, and the camera stops using the edges of the 12-megapixel matrix.  Continuous shooting of photographs and time passes is possible.  Disadvantages: there is no color display and electronic image stabilizer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hvatay.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stabilizer for gopro camera" class="if uuid-3096638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/3096638.jpg"></div><p>  The model can shoot video in 4k resolution.  In this case, the frame rate will be 30 FPS.  There is a high-speed mode in which the frequency of shooting in Full HD rises to 120 frames per second.  Photos can be taken during movie shooting.  There are USB interfaces on the case, to which you can connect an external microphone, charger or smartphone.  There are fixed mounts for the GoPro camera.  There is an HDMI output. </p><h2>  Features of models of the Hero series </h2><p>  Comparison of GoPro cameras shows that the most successful models were developed as part of the Hero line.  The line is constantly being improved.  There are solutions for professionals (Hero Black), beginners (White) and amateurs (Silver).  Most models have similar characteristics: </p><ol><li><p>  Waterproof case or a special case for underwater shooting (immersion up to 10 meters). </p></li><li><p>  Color touch screen (2 inches).  In the seventh series, the sensitivity of the sensor increased significantly, and the icons became larger, which greatly facilitated the work. </p></li><li><p>  The presence of the HyperSmooth stabilizer allows you to record smooth, high-quality videos and create short clips. </p></li><li><p>  The GoPro App allows you to stream live and share frames online. </p></li><li><p>  There is Full HD, a shooting mode in a wide format, you can use the timer for shooting. </p></li><li><p>  Synchronization with a smartphone is automatic. </p></li><li><p>  Using the sensor, you can zoom. </p></li><li><p>  There is voice control. </p></li><li><p>  Wireless interfaces: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS. </p></li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gopro camera comparison" class="if uuid-3096639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/3096639.jpg"></div><p>  The kit usually includes the GoPro camera itself, a protective frame, a USB charging cable, a sticker with a company logo, adhesive tape for a helmet, a flat tape on double adhesive tape. </p><p>  Now you know what GoPro is.  Most of these are great cameras.  The most necessary functions and advanced technologies fit in a small case, which greatly facilitates the use of the device by both professional operators and beginners.  Models developed for different types of users practically do not differ in the final quality of shooting and basic parameters. </p>
