In addition to storage, there is a slight increase in deductions.  Nothing suspicious.  For this, the KIT Finance Pension Fund is making positive reviews.  No cheating or fraud! </p><h2>  For job seekers </h2><p>  A little about what the employees of the company think about their employer.  This is an important point.  And in this area <span>, the KIT Finance Pension Fund</span> receives mixed <span>reviews</span> from its employees.  In general, they are good, but emphasize some of the shortcomings of the company.  Do not be afraid, they are everywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pension fund whale finance reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1289754.jpg"></div>

This also includes a <span>flexible work schedule</span> after employment, a full social package. </p><p>  But there are several drawbacks, but one of them repels.  Hard work with customers, a constant stream of visitors - all this is not so scary.  It discourages applicants from compelling the storage of pension contributions in this particular fund.  Moreover, KITFinance will influence you in various ways - and simply warn that after employment you will automatically become a contributor, and intimidate, and threaten with dismissal.  This kind of reception is not the best way affects the ranking of the corporation among employers.  Nevertheless, this is not such a reason to refuse employment.  Indeed, if the KIT Finance pension fund is really good and reliable, why not entrust it with its <span>funded part of the pension?</span> </p><h2>  Ratings </h2><p>  It turns out that you can get a job in the organization.  She has her own advantages.  And what about the organization from the point of view of customers?  The success and prosperity of any company depends on them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="whale finance pension fund rating" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1289755.jpg" width="388"></div>

    <p>  The so-called trust level of the population plays a huge role.  It affects the rating.  What indicators does KIT Finance (pension fund) have in these areas?  Visitor confidence rating is top notch.  Judging by the statistics, it is at the A ++ mark.  So far, no indicators have been invented. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The popularity of this organization is also not so small.  KIT Finance Bank (including a pension fund) is among the top ten companies offering storage and payment of pension contributions.  That is, it is a fairly stable organization.  And you can trust her.  In any case, most customers think so.  Not for nothing that KITFinance holds high positions among pension funds. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  When choosing a company with which you can entrust your <span>pension contributions,</span> it is worth paying attention to another important factor - this is nothing but profitability.  It plays a decisive role for many.  It‚Äôs not enough to invest money somewhere, I want to increase them still in size.  Especially if the funds themselves offer this opportunity.  Do not miss her. </p><p>  What kind of KIT Finance (pension fund) does it have?  Everything here is not as simple as it seems.  According to statistics, it is 8.36% per annum.  This is a very large figure, given that most competitors offer no more than 5% return per year.  In practice, taking into account inflation and the crisis in Russia, this indicator drops to approximately 4.5%.  Significantly less than originally promised.  Because of this, the company does not receive the best customer opinions.  After all, some tend to believe that they are being deceived.  This is not at all true.  It‚Äôs just that you are provided with information that should ideally be implemented. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank whale finance pension fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1289756.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Guilty Without Guilt </h2><p>  The negative aspects emphasized by investors do not end there.  Most clients of the fund indicate that they joined the corporation, but were not aware of this event.  In other words, someone independently transferred them to this pension fund. </p><p>  How is that?  Most often, such incidents are revealed in officially working people.  All this is due to the fact that employers conclude cooperation agreements with the KITFinance Pension Fund.  And automatically all subordinates transfer their deductions "to old age" there.  Consent of citizens is not necessary for this.  Not the best reviews about the organization come from here.  After all, you should always ask the citizen for consent to sign this or that agreement. </p><h2>  Transition to others </h2><p>  The KITFinance Pension Fund also does not earn the best opinions when citizens decide to transfer their pensions to other funds.  Such an opportunity is given by law.  But to bring it to life is not too simple.  And all this because KITFinance will reject your applications, coming up with a variety of reasons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="whale finance pension fund yield" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1289757.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <p>  By the way, when it comes time to receive your pension contributions, some problems also arise.  More precisely - constant delays in payments.  It is precisely such situations that are most often encountered in practice. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the majority of positive opinions about the organization is a fake.  Purchased user reviews designed to attract a new audience.  Do KITFinance trust their money?  You must decide this yourself.  In any case, this company will not go bankrupt in the near future and will not be closed. </p>
