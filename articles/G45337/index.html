These include cyclonic, 2 foam, antifoam and HEPA.  The latter is an output filter.  It traps the smallest particles of dust that penetrate through water with air bubbles.  The HEPA filter is detergent and does not require regular replacement.  If the owner plans to vacuum the carpets pre-treated with a cleaning shampoo, the manufacturer recommends adding antifoam to the water. </p><h2>  Vacuum cleaner care </h2><p>  <span>After each cleaning, pour water out of the container to prevent the formation of an unpleasant odor.</span>  <span>After this, the tank must be rinsed and wiped dry.</span>  <span>Cyclonic, antifoam and foam filters must also be washed with water and dried after each cleaning.</span> </p><p>  <span>Before work, no more than 500 ml of water is poured into the tank.</span>  <span>Overfilling is not allowed.</span>  <span>Excess water can penetrate the engine and cause a short circuit.</span> </p><p>  <span><span>The HEPA filter is flushed as it becomes dirty, depending on the frequency of use.</span></span>  <span><span>To clean it, it is necessary to substitute under a stream of water and rinse.</span></span>  <span><span>Brushes, sponges and detergents are not allowed.</span></span>  <span><span>Drying the HEPA filter is also necessary in a natural way, without using heating devices.</span></span>  <span><span>The foam filter in front of it is cleaned in exactly the same way.</span></span> </p><p>  <span>The body of the Vitek vacuum cleaner is first cleaned with a soft, damp cloth, and then wiped dry.</span>  <span>Washing it with abrasive detergents or immersing in water is prohibited.</span> </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  <span>The low price and high quality are what makes the Vitek vacuum cleaner so attractive to customers.</span>  <span>Owner reviews say that over the years, this technique has proven itself perfectly.</span>  <span>However, it can not do without complaints.</span> </p><p>  <span>First of all, they relate to the weight of the unit.</span>  <span>Vacuum cleaners with an aquafilter are quite massive and heavy, especially if there is water in the container.</span> </p>
