For this, there are several lending programs with different conditions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  "Fast and the Furious" - a program for the acquisition of a new foreign car. </li><li>  "Engine" - a loan for the purchase of a foreign car with mileage. </li><li>  "Great opportunity" - applies to new cars of domestic production. </li><li>  "Used car" - also intended for the purchase of a domestic used car. </li></ol><p>  Now consider these programs in more detail. </p><h2>  Credit program "Fast and the Furious" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fortune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car brand &quot;Tesla&quot;" class="if uuid-2751000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2751000.jpg"></div><p>  The Fast and the Furious program was specifically designed to purchase a new foreign car.

The interest rate will range from 16% to 21%.  Particular attention should be paid to the fact that the maximum loan amount will depend on the down payment.

It is noteworthy that absolutely all loans are issued in Russian rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  List of documents for a car loan </h2><p>  In order to apply for a car loan, you will need the following documents: </p><ol><li>  Passport (required original document). </li><li>  One of the listed documents to choose from: </li></ol><ul><li>  military ID; </li><li>  tax identification number; </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  pension fund certificate. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the bank has the right to request additional documents: confirmation from the place of work, income certificate, etc. Also, <span>loan programs</span> provide preferential interest rates on a car loan if the client brings documents confirming his monthly income.  This can be a certificate of wages from the place of work and other documents confirming the level of wages. </p><h2>  Loan processing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pfgfx.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://pfgfx.ru/kredit/lichnyj-kabinet-rusfinans-banka.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Office &amp; quot; Rusfinance Bank &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-2751069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2751069.jpg"></div><p>  There are two ways to get a car loan at Rusfinance Bank: directly at a bank branch and at a car dealership. </p><p>  To get a car loan at the bank, you need to contact the office, write an application and provide all the necessary documents.  After the loan is approved, the money is transferred to even.  An account must first be opened with Rusfinance Bank LLC.  After crediting the required amount, according to the statement of the account holder, the money is transferred to the seller‚Äôs name. </p><p>  The second option is to get a car loan directly at a car dealership where a bank loan officer works.  After the client has chosen a car, an application and several questionnaires are filled out.  Verification of documents takes about 30 minutes.  If the bank makes a positive decision on the application, then the client needs to draw up a sales contract and an insurance policy for the car, make a down payment and pick up the purchase. </p><h2>  Car loan repayment </h2><p>  Now let's talk about repaying a loan to Rusfinance Bank.  You can repay a loan in the following ways: </p><ol><li>  With a bank card. </li><li>  Through payment terminals of Rusfinance Bank LLC. </li><li>  Through the QIWI service. </li><li>  Through the payment system "CYBERPLAT". </li><li>  You can also pay at the MTS, Beeline, Svyaznoy, and Euroset stores. </li><li>  Using the service "Golden Crown" (section "Loan repayment"). </li><li>  Through Rosbank, payments on this loan are made without commission. </li></ol><p>  In addition, it is possible to make payments on credit and through the post office.  But the payer should pay attention to the fact that a commission will be charged on the amount of payment. </p><p>  If the payment was not made on time, the bank charges penalties in the amount of 0.1% for each day of delay.  Therefore, we advise you to make payments a little in advance.  Please be aware that sometimes payment processing may take several days. </p><p>  We will also pay a few lines to the early repayment of the Rusfinance Bank car loan, customer reviews and repayment conditions.  The bank gives its customers the opportunity to repay the loan ahead of schedule.  For this, it is necessary to deposit the loan amount with interest.  The exact amount of payment can be found in the bank or in the help desk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.continentalcurrency.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan repayment" class="if uuid-2751089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2751089.jpg"></div><p>  Remember that the amount to repay the loan is written off strictly in accordance with the payment schedule.  Therefore, deciding to repay the loan ahead of schedule, specify how much funds should be debited according to the schedule. </p><h2>  Who can make monthly loan payments? </h2><p>  Oddly enough, this question is very popular among bank customers.  Monthly payments can be made by the person who received the loan, as well as his relatives, friends and other persons.  In order to repay the loan, you must have a passport, a loan agreement (or a memo on paying the loan) and money.  The whole process takes several minutes.  After payment, the payer is issued a receipt with the following details: </p><ol><li>  Surname, name, patronymic of the borrower. </li><li>  Number of loan agreement. </li><li>  The bank account number of the borrower opened with Rusfinance Bank LLC. </li><li>  Bank details. </li><li>  Amount of payment. </li></ol><h2>  Proof of income </h2><p>  Some car loan programs offer a reduced interest rate if the client confirms their official monthly income.  This can be done both by providing a certificate of income from work, and through the portal of public services.  Confirmation through the portal does not provide for the collection of extra certificates and documents.  In order to receive such confirmation, it is enough to provide the bank with the original FSZN insurance certificate, after which the bank employee can make a request. </p><h2>  State car loan program </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.clickdealer.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family car" class="if uuid-2751103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2751103.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the standard lending program, Rusfinance Bank offers its customers the opportunity to participate in the state car loan program.  To date, two options are provided: ‚ÄúFirst Car‚Äù and ‚ÄúFamily Car‚Äù.  Participation in these programs gives you the opportunity to purchase your favorite car with a 25% discount on the cost. </p><p>  This program applies to cars of 2017 and 2018 of release worth up to 1,450,000 rubles. </p><p>  Requirements for the borrower under the program "First car": </p><ol><li>  The presence of a driver‚Äôs license. </li><li>  The lack of a previous car in the ownership of the client. </li></ol><p>  A loan can be issued for up to 5 years. </p><p>  To apply for a loan under the Family Car program, the following requirements must be met: </p><ol><li>  A family must have two or more minor children. </li><li>  No other loan agreements for the purchase of a car should be executed. </li><li>  The borrower must have a driver‚Äôs license. </li></ol><h2>  Customer Reviews on Rusfinance Bank Loans </h2><p>  Today you can hear a lot of reviews on the car loan Rusfinance Bank.  Unfortunately, not all of them are positive.  Most disputes arise when the client wants to repay the loan in full or in part ahead of schedule.  Today we will not find out who is to blame - an employee of the bank who did not explain the terms of the agreement well, or a client who did not read this agreement beforehand.  We will analyze only the most delicate moments. </p><p>  Payment of a car loan of Rusfinance Bank is made from a special account that the client opens when applying for a loan.  That is, the client replenishes this account every month, and on a certain date money is debited from it.  The account must contain the amount of the monthly installment.  If the amount in the account exceeds it, then everything that is in excess of the amount of the monthly payment will be used to pay off the main debt.  What to do if you need to pay in advance a few months in advance or repay a loan ahead of schedule?  To do this, you need to notify the bank in advance that the amount that is deposited to the account is intended to repay the loan for subsequent months.  In this case, you will have to visit the bank‚Äôs office and draw up a payment order on the account or issue it in an online account on the bank‚Äôs website. </p><p>  When repaying a loan ahead of schedule, remember that the amount of debt should be calculated on the date the funds are debited from the account.  For example, the agreement states that the loan is repaid on the 25th of each month.  You have decided to repay the loan ahead of schedule on the 23rd.  For early repayment of the loan, you need to find out the amount of debt on the 25th day and make it.  If the amount of debt is calculated on the 23rd day, the loan will not be paid in full, and after some time the bank will begin to accrue interest on the debt. </p><p>  Very often, bank customers who want to take a car on credit are invited to conclude a life and health insurance contract.  This procedure is optional.  This is only a service that a bank provides to its customers.  However, when concluding an insurance contract, the interest rate can be reduced by several points.  To issue this service or not - the client decides independently. </p><p>  Mandatory when applying for a car loan is the CASCO policy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sulekha.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Suzuki car" class="if uuid-2751059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2751059.jpg"></div><p>  After analyzing the reviews, car loans of Rusfinance Bank, we can draw the following conclusions: the conditions of the car loan of Rusfinance Bank are really favorable.  Anyone can buy a car of that class at the price that suits him.  In addition, the client has the opportunity not only to make monthly payments under the loan agreement without problems, but also to repay it ahead of schedule without penalties and restrictions. </p><p>  But in order to avoid various unpleasant situations, before concluding a loan agreement, the client must carefully read its terms.  On the official website of Rusfinance Bank, public terms and conditions of loans and documents are presented.  In addition, additional information can be obtained directly at the bank‚Äôs office, from the credit department employees and by phone. </p><p>  Today, a brand new car has ceased to be a pipe dream.  But in order for the purchase not to overshadow anything, you need to treat it with all responsibility and attention. </p>
