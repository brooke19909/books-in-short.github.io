In many Western countries, this format of electronics sales has existed for many years, in our country it is only gaining momentum.  According to many experts, the capabilities of the very first tablet from the operator - the Login device - were very modest. </p>

    <p>  In turn, the second product should have significantly more functions, experts say.  The new tablet - <span>"Megaphone Login 2"</span> - the characteristics, experts believe, should have more impressive ones.  Moreover, many experts are sure that the operator has launched its second ‚Äútablet‚Äù on the market for a specific purpose: to make the device one of the sales leaders in its segment.  Due to what characteristics will the device from Megafon compete with the decisions of other Big Three players? </p><h2>  Design, dimensions </h2><p>  The first thing we will begin to study the <span>tablet "Megaphone</span> Login 2" - the characteristics of the case.  Its main array is made of smooth black plastic.  Silver edging.  The tablet has a fairly small size.  Its length is 198 mm, width - 122, thickness - 12. The device is quite convenient to hold with one hand.  In the upper part of the case there is a volume control key, next to it is a power button.  The main part of the slots is on the right side.  There is an audio jack and a microUSB output.  There is an external microSD slot, as well as a standard size SIM card.  The brand-manufacturer decided to make the case one-piece.  Experts note the high build quality of the tablet case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen is covered with a plastic shell that is sufficiently scratch resistant.  The diagonal of the display is 7 inches, the resolution is 1024 by 600 pixels, the manufacturing technology is TFT, the type is capacitive.  Up to 262 thousand colors are supported.  Since the matrix technology is not the most up-to-date, the image quality may change at different viewing angles. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, experts say that for most users this feature will not bring discomfort, since almost always viewing videos or photos is carried out with the front display.  Which, in turn, provides a very good picture quality. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The tablet has a fairly modern MSM 8225 chipset with two cores and a clock frequency of 1 GHz.  RAM - 512 MB, 4 GB is available on the built-in flash drive (about 1 is actually available).  Can the Megafon Login 2 tablet be considered sufficiently productive?  The characteristics of its hardware components are relatively modest.  Will this affect its competitiveness? </p>

    <p>  Experts are sure: the above resources are enough to launch and work correctly the majority of modern applications.  It is more difficult with games - three-dimensional ones will be launched with great difficulty.  However, according to experts, this brand tablet is absolutely not "gaming."  And therefore, game support here is one of the least significant criteria.  The tablet copes well with its main task - providing access to the Internet using the built-in browser, browsing the web, photos, listening to music, playing videos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  What really is not much inferior to competing solutions tablet "Megaphone Login 2" - battery characteristics.  The device is equipped with a battery capacity large enough for its class of devices - 3 thousand mAh.  At the same time, experts say, the MSM 8225 chipset, as well as a number of other hardware solutions, are considered one of the most energy-efficient.  The result is a fairly long battery life of the smartphone.  Some experts recorded 4-5 days of average intensity of using the device before the battery was discharged.  Many experts note the high speed of charging the battery - within 2 hours. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There are two cameras in the phone - the main and the front.  The first has a resolution of 2 megapixels, it is not equipped with an autofocus function.  Should a camera be considered an important criterion for the functionality of a device such as a Megafon Login 2 tablet?  Characteristics of photos and videos - how important are they in this case for the user?  To answer this question, we will study a small discussion that arose in the online environment between individual groups of experts and users. </p><p>  Many users are not very positive about the quality of video calls using a smartphone.  However, there are also ‚Äúlawyers‚Äù.  Their position is this: the device is designed primarily for use in 3G networks.  Even if there was a powerful camera on the smartphone, the bandwidth (and stability) of the mobile Internet channel would most likely not be enough for comfortable work.  And because it‚Äôs even good that the quality of the video stream in this case is low: already at the hardware level, it adapts to the resources of the Internet channel.  It is better, therefore, to communicate with the interlocutor with a not very detailed, but stable picture, than with the one that has a high resolution, but with constant disconnection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The same can be said about the functions of the camera in terms of creating photos and videos.  High-quality multimedia samples have a large weight in megabytes, and therefore are poorly adapted to transmission when using 3G channels.  The option in which one person will transfer the photo to the other in poor quality to another is probably more preferable than the one in which the user will not be able to transfer a large file at all due to an unstable Internet connection. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  No sensations regarding the software that the Megafon Login 2 tablet is equipped with.  The firmware here is Android OS.  There are very few pre-installed applications, but anything you need can be found in the Google Play directory.  There is a built-in file manager, a <span>program for recording voice</span> , etc. </p>

    <p>  Among the useful branded applications from Megafon are Money (a useful payment tool in some cases), Navigator, as well as several system utilities.  There is also a Yandex browser (along with the standard one, which is part of the OS).  There is an interface for listening to radio broadcasts in the FM-range, experts note the convenience of using it and the stability of the work. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Like many other devices from Megafon, this tablet is compatible with the SIM card only from this operator.  True, this rule applies only in cases where the user is located in Russia.  If you try to insert a SIM card of a foreign telecom operator abroad, the tablet will work. </p>

    <p>  The secret is, experts believe, that the firmware installed on the Megafon Login 2 tablet is supplemented with a branded software module that can recognize SIM cards of direct competitors of the operator.  Thus, experts believe, Megafon deliberately opposes the operation of the device by the owners of only those SIM cards issued by a certain group of market players. </p>

    <p>  Regarding wireless interfaces - the device works in 2G and 3G communication standards, supports Wi-Fi connection (and can itself be an access point).  The experts evaluated the quality of communication upon testing in all available channels as high.  Data by owners who tested the tablet "Megafon Login 2" specifications, reviews regarding the stability of the connection, in general, coincide with the estimates of experts.  The device is well adapted to perform the main task - access to the Internet through a mobile channel. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  What are the prevailing people who own the Megafon Login 2 tablet, features and reviews about the device?  Did the device live up to the expectations of enthusiasts and brand followers?  The most important advantage of the tablet, according to many users - the price.  Having paid 3-4 thousand rubles to the dealer, a person acquires a device that is generally comparable in terms of functions and capabilities with the devices of leading world brands produced in the same class.  What is not surprising, experts say: it often happens that tablets manufactured by order of the conditional Samsung or HTC, and those that will be brought to Russia under its Megafon brand, are assembled at Chinese plants on a single conveyor. </p>

    <p>  Gadgets of international brands very often have characteristics similar to devices of the class to which the Megafon Login 2 tablet belongs.  <span>Omsk, Moscow,</span> Yekaterinburg will receive goods branded by the Big Three operator on their municipal markets with quality no worse than, relatively speaking, Warsaw, Dresden and Budapest, where the largest transnational players in the mobile electronics market operate. </p><h2>  Branded functionality </h2><p>  Users are not at all confused by the rigid binding of the device to the operator‚Äôs SIM card.  Firstly, they believe that Megafon has some of the most favorable internet tariffs in the market.  And therefore, even if the tablet was compatible with any operator, then with a high probability it would be chosen exactly "Megaphone".  Secondly, no one bothers not to use the SIM card from this brand, but at the same time use the tablet via Wi-Fi, use any necessary functions.  The capabilities of the device do not disappear.  All the features laid down by the factory circuit in the Megafon Login 2 tablet are fully involved.  The user manual for this device and those manuals that are written for many of its analogues, produced under international brands, are largely the same.  This suggests that the Russian mobile operator has released a technologically advanced and competitive product. </p>
