If the summer is still far away, and you certainly want a bright sun and a gentle sea, the choice is great enough. </p><p>  It can be Egypt, Emirates, Goa, Sri Lanka and more distant exotic countries and places.  Most often, the choice falls on Egypt.  The popularity of this country is explained by the perfect combination of conditions for a comfortable beach holiday with a rich excursion program, a short comfortable flight and good infrastructure that has developed in the resorts of the Red Sea.  The cost of the tour to Egypt is quite comparable with the cost of rest at the famous Russian resorts, and it can be much lower with a sufficiently high-quality service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mashrabiya beach resort" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29995/710696.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  If you are going to visit Egypt for the first time, the natural question arises: where to relax?  In Hurghada, at fairly affordable prices, the quality of service and the cleanliness of the streets are worse than in Sharm El Sheikh.  The underwater world of Sharm is much richer, and the beaches are cleaner.  However, not all hotels, even five-star ones, are located on the first line of the sea and far from all can offer a convenient sandy entrance to the water. </p><p>  Therefore, if you are not completely confident in the water or small children will go with you, even when you are in a luxury hotel in Sharm, you will not be able to swim from the pontoon.  On the contrary, Hurghada, <span>hotels of 3-5 stars</span> which most often have good sandy beaches with convenient access and are located on the first line of the sea, will suit you much more. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The best sandy beaches of Hurghada are located in remote areas such as Soma <span>Bay, Makadi Bay,</span> Sahl Hasheesh and Safaga.  Within the city you can also find hotels with good beaches. </p><h2>  Recommendations for choosing a vacation spot in Hurghada </h2><p>  The choice of a hotel in Hurghada will depend on your preferences, the company with which you are going to relax, and, of course, on the budget of the trip.  If the funds allow, you can safely choose any of the five-star hotels that you like in the catalogs and have good recommendations and reviews from tourists who have been there before. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that the cost of a tour to Egypt includes flight, transfer, insurance for the entire trip, accommodation in a room of the selected category and <span>meals in the hotel</span> according to the selected system.  By choosing the all-inclusive meal concept, you won‚Äôt worry about how much money to bring along for drinks and food. </p><p>  A certain category of tourists, having first arrived in the country, wants to visit the largest possible number of new places, to go on all excursions, to taste national cuisine.  Such travelers should not overpay for the hotel and the All inclusive system, since they will rarely be in the hotel, only in between trips. </p><p>  These tourists are invited to consider options for simple three-star hotels with a good beach, a cozy area, the necessary range of services at the hotel and adequate food.  One of the budget and worthy accommodation options can be the original oriental-style hotel Al Mashrabiya Beach Resort Hurghada. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The designation "Mashrabiya" </h2><p>  The concept of "Mashrabiya" comes from the Arabic word "Sharab", which means "drink."  In the conditions of the dry hot climate of Egypt, water jugs were placed behind carved wooden shutters, which define the concept of mashrabiya, which is a carved wooden window lattice made using national motifs in the ornament. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cost of tour to egypt" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/431849.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  In desert oases, there is still a custom to leave a vessel with water in mashrabiyas for random travelers who could open the sashes and drink.  Such shutters, thanks to natural ventilation, allowed them to pass through and cool the hot air well and to observe the events on the street, while remaining unnoticed.  According <span>to Sharia law, a</span> woman should not expose her beauty to the public, therefore, oriental beauties often hid behind such windows. </p><p>  Almost the entire front side of the main building of Al Mashrabiya Beach Resort is made using the mashrabiya technique: it is covered with elegant wood carvings of expensive varieties and creates a light twilight and coolness.  It is this feature that gave the name to the hotel.  In the central part of Sakkala there is also a popular cafe, which is decorated in the same style and bears the same name. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Al Mashrabiya Beach Resort 3 * is located at the beginning of the tourist promenade, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhotels.  To the old center of Dahar - only seven kilometers to the international airport of Hurghada - four.  To the new city center, Sakkale, you can walk along the promenade on foot or take a taxi for 5-10 pounds.  Several times a day, the hotel provides a free shuttle service to Down Town (the old city center). </p><h2>  Hotels nearby </h2><p>  On one side of the hotel, at a distance of two hundred meters, is the Dessole <span>Marlin Inn Beach Resort 4 *,</span> on the other, at a distance of less than one kilometer towards Sakkala - apart-hotel Elysees 4 *.  In the same direction is the bungalow complex with the largest public sandy beach of Hurghada - Old Vic. </p><h2>  Hotel Features </h2><p>  Previously, the hotel belonged to the Sinbad chain, so guests of Al Mashrabiya Beach Resort could use the water park and infrastructure of these hotels.  A few years ago, ‚ÄúMashrabiya‚Äù changed the owners, so now this opportunity is not provided. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The main three-story building of the hotel is made in a typical Arabic style, with carved elements.  A beautiful green area with lush vegetation surrounds one- and two-story cottages.  On the territory there is a small pool equipped with umbrellas and sun loungers. </p><p>  A tour desk offers a varied program.  There is a health center with a gym, Turkish bath and Finnish sauna, a beauty salon and spa.  The complex also has a diving center. </p><p>  For business meetings and special occasions the hotel offers to use any of the six conference rooms equipped with air conditioning and all the necessary accessories. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2>
