A. Zverev.  The same enterprises previously produced panoramic cameras of the FT type. </p><p>  The first small-format device was produced in 1967.  The release continued until 1973. About 50 thousand units were put up for sale. </p><p>  What shooting principle is used in this device?  The frame is scanned with a lens that rotates.  The exposure in the process can vary according to the width of the slit.  It also directly depends on the speed of passage of the gap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camera horizon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1943616.jpg"></div>

After it was presented - 205 (hit the series in 2000), 203 and modifications of the latter.  The differences between them are mainly in the number of extracts. </p><p>  Panoramic cameras "Horizon-202" and 205 are presented to a wide buyer with the help of intermediaries - an Italian company.  Because of this model, they were distributed under a different name: PAN.  The PAN-35 modification, which was an analogue of Horizon-202, went on sale.  They distinguished themselves among themselves due to the design of the case. </p><p>  In 2010, a presentation of a joint work of a Russian plant and an Italian company, the Horizont camera, was held in Cologne.  The price of the device did not exceed 1150 euros.  The full name of the model is Horizon-D-L3. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camera horizon Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1943614.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  "Horizon" </h2><p>  The first generation of the device was noticeably different from other cameras of a panoramic type of shooting, which were produced by the same factory.  We are talking about the FT series.  But it should be noted that it uses the same principle of operation - a frame scan using a rotating lens. </p><p>  During the creation of this model, most of all the shortcomings were eliminated, but one minus remained characteristic - ‚Äúzebrainess‚Äù.  In addition, during the cocking of the shutter it was possible to get the risk of tearing the film. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Horizon-202" </h2><p>  This model differs from the previous one in its design, as well as the shutter functionality.  Six to eight excerpts were used (depending on the modification of this generation).  The zebra pattern was reduced, and there were fewer cases of film rupture when rewinding. </p><p>  The development of this camera was carried out by a separate bureau, which belonged to the main factory.  The design was developed by the same specialists who made the first model. </p><h2>  Horizon Kompakt </h2><p>  <span>It went on sale in 2005.</span>  <span>The model received a small number of excerpts.</span>  <span>Slit of an immutable parameter.</span>  <span>This camera is considered to be exclusive, as it was produced for the Lomographic Society.</span> </p><p>  <span>Sold only in beige (later black) version.</span>  <span>The aperture does not change.</span>  <span>This camera is considered a modified device 202.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Horizon 205 pc </h2><p>  This camera was created for professional filming.  An unperforated film with a width of 61.5 mm was used.  In narrower circles, it is known as type 120 material. </p><p>  The device has a ‚Äúshift‚Äù mechanism, which allows the lens to move vertically by 8 mm.  This makes it possible to change the shooting points and increase the space that is included in the picture. </p><p>  Thanks to the rotating design of the lens, you can achieve good picture quality.  This is due to the destruction of optical distortion.  Most often, a similar problem was encountered with devices with fixed wide-angle lenses. </p><p>  Thanks to two levels that provide the most correct position, use the device for horizontal installation. </p><p>  Due to the presence of long shutter speeds, you can shoot at night.  One frame can be exposed several times. </p><p>  Due to the presence of an optical viewfinder, you can see the full boundaries of the resulting image even with the lens moving. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Until now, this camera is in demand.  Older models are collected by collectors, and new ones are used by amateur photographers.  It should be noted the many advantages of these devices and reviews that fully confirm them. </p>
