Knitting a plaid</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A cozy, soft and warm blanket is needed in every home.  It is so nice to wrap yourself in it in winter evenings, sitting near the TV, or use it instead of a blanket, or you can cover it with a bed like a coverlet.  A blanket is very useful for a kid who always wants to wrap it warmer in something soft, light and fluffy.  But is it worth it to buy an expensive plaid in the store, especially for those who know how to knit or crochet well?  Yes, and beginner knitters to master the manufacture of this home accessory will be quite capable.  Knitting a plaid with knitting needles or crochet work is simple.  It is enough to know the basic techniques, to have a good supply of high-quality fluffy wool and a little patience.  But the knitting process itself will please you, and its result can be simply amazing.  A handmade thing, as a rule, is obtained not only very beautiful, but also exclusive, unique. </p><p>  Knitting a plaid </p><p>  For a plaid, measuring 200x120 cm, about 1.5 - 2 kg of wool or acrylic will be required.  It is very important to choose a high-quality, well-twisted, fluffy yarn, then the thing will be really great, especially since knitting a blanket with knitting needles is a long and laborious job, and it would be a pity to make it out of cheap yarn of poor quality.  The remnants of yarn of different colors are quite suitable for work, they will make a patchwork style rug that resembles a patchwork quilt.  It is better to take the remains of yarn of the same thickness, grade and quality, then the work will look better and more accurate. </p><p>  <span>Knitting a plaid with</span> knitting needles.  Various methods and techniques </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. One-piece yarn is knitted into one piece with any embossed or openwork pattern.  It is better to choose a complex pattern, with crochets forming delicate weaves, or with fancy braids.  A patchwork style plaid can also be knitted from monophonic yarn if the canvas is divided into identical squares made with different patterns: dense, openwork, embossed. </p><p>  The work uses thick knitting needles and yarn of medium thickness.  The number of knitting needles and the thickness of the yarn should be chosen so that the knitting is soft, light, dense enough, but not too much.  The main difficulty in knitting a whole fabric is that knitting it even on knitting needles with fishing line is not very convenient due to its large size.  The finished blanket is edged around the perimeter with a knitted border, decorated with tassels or frills.  If you prudently knit a narrow ribbon during work on the edge with a rope (front and back rows are performed only with front loops), then no additional edging is required.  Tip: be sure to first tie a small report of the pattern, which will help to calculate the required number of loops for the set, as well as correctly determine the desired thickness of the knitting needles and evaluate the beauty of the selected pattern. </p><p>  2. Knitting a plaid with knitting needles from individual motifs.  In order not to bother with a wide uncomfortable canvas, separate motifs are made, which are then assembled into a single whole.  Individual parts are made in the form of squares, circles or long stripes, in the entire length of the plaid.  The patterns here are very diverse - a simple rope, openwork flowers (see knitting patterns of round openwork napkins on the Internet or <span>knitting</span> magazines <span>), braids</span> and reliefs.  Colored ornaments are knitted in the center of an individual element, or embroidery is used instead of ornaments, knitted motifs combined with fabric inserts. </p><p>  3. <span>Knitting a baby blanket,</span> and especially knitting <span>blankets for newborns,</span> requires a special approach.  Such things are made of very soft and fluffy yarn of light pastel colors.  The sizes of the children's blanket are approximately one meter per meter.  Knitting methods can also be very diverse, from individual motifs or from a single piece of fabric.  As a rule, children's plaids are decorated with bright knitted applique or embroidery.  The trim from a narrow satin ribbon looks very beautiful, which is inserted either throughout the canvas, knitting for this the holes from the yarn in the form of diagonal or longitudinal stripes, or only along the edge of the plaid, decorating the border with them.  Ribbons are pulled into the holes left for this and tied with bows at the corners. </p><p>  Knitting a plaid with knitting needles is a simple job, but lengthy and requires some patience and accuracy.  But by tying out various patterns, openwork and braids, the novice craftswoman will gain skills and experience, and an experienced knitter will certainly create an exclusive thing. </p>
