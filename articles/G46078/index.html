It was then that members of the government and various officials began to move to Belokamennaya.  But with housing for high-ranking settlers there were some difficulties.  It was then that it was decided to begin a grandiose construction, as a result of which a house appeared on the embankment.  Did the keys to new apartments bring happiness to high-ranking residents, and is it possible to live in this building today? </p><h2>  From project to building of the future </h2><p>  The correct name of the government house is the House of Soviets of the CEC and the Council of People's Commissars, but the people called it differently.  The place for the construction of a skyscraper was chosen long enough.  But in the end, they decided to build "in the swamp" - on the site of the Wine and Salt Yard, at the intersection of Bersenevskaya Embankment and All Saints Street.  The construction was started in 1928, special attention was paid to the arrangement of the foundation.  In 1931, the house on the embankment already received the first tenants.  The total cost of construction was determined at 24 million rubles.  In 1933, the magnificent new building also received a new address: Vsekhsvyatskaya Street was renamed Serafimovich Street. </p>

    <h2>  All for their </h2><p>  The finished house was far ahead of its time.  After cramped hotel rooms, residents were able to enter the spacious apartments of 100 m2, fully finished and furnished.  The government new building offered its residents all amenities: a garbage chute in the kitchen, hot and cold water, elevators, telephones.  The word "infrastructure" was not yet known in the USSR, but in one house there was everything necessary for life.  This is a cinema, a club, a dining room, a shop, a first-aid post, a kindergarten, a laundry, a post office and other organizations.  The house on the embankment in Moscow was really unique for its time.  It is worth saying only that a significant part of the country's population then huddled in barracks and communal apartments without any conditions.  At first, happy new settlers sincerely rejoiced at all the blessings and successfully lived in apartments.  However, this happiness did not last long. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Dark days in the history of the house </h2><p>  Already in 1934, the first arrests of residents of the house took place.  At first, this seemed like some kind of misunderstanding, well, can there really be the most-most deserved enemies of the people?  However, soon the tenants of the government house fell into a real panic.  They came for everyone, regardless of ranks and ranks.  Not only civil servants, but also all their families disappeared, and the apartments were sealed up.  In total, about 800 people living in this unfortunate house were repressed.  Many residents, feeling a suspicious look on themselves, without waiting for the executioners to arrive, ended their lives on their own initiative.  If light appeared in the windows at night - the neighbors knew that they had already come for someone.  In the worst of times, half of the house always remained dark and lifeless.  The situation changed with the outbreak of World War II, then all the residents were evacuated, and after the Victory many returned, empty apartments went to new heroes. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore of a Bygone Age </h2><p>  After the war, the house on the embankment begins its completely new peaceful history.  In 1977, a complete reconstruction was carried out.  All entrances were repaired, many large apartments were redeveloped into a somewhat more modest in area.  Around the same time, tenants finally began to settle in their own way, acquiring new furniture and making repairs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is interesting not only to visit the museum, but also to inspect the house on the waterfront independently.  It has only 25 entrances, one of which does not have residential apartments, a cozy courtyard and an impressive facade are literally saturated with the spirit of bygone eras.  Also, the house boasts an abundance of plaques - only outside there are 25, and in the porches you can see 6 more. </p>
