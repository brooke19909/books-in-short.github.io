    <h2>  Kokand Economy </h2><p>  <span>Uzbekistan ranks fourth in the world in terms of gold reserves, and seventh in terms of the amount of annual precious metal mined.</span>  <span>However, the traditional pillar of the Uzbek economy is traditionally considered agriculture, which thrives in the country, despite all the climatic difficulties.</span> </p><p>  <span>From the planned economy of the USSR, Uzbekistan inherited a rather monotonous agriculture, specializing mainly in the production of cotton, which during the Soviet period turned into a monoculture.</span> </p><p>  <span>However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, agriculture quickly showed a tendency to introduce diversity into production.</span>  <span>Many areas began to be sown with wheat, the yield of which, thanks to proper agronomy, is growing significantly from year to year.</span> </p><p>  <span>And of course, during the time of independence, the number of independent producers has grown, which strive to maximize the satisfaction of consumer demand existing in the market of Uzbekistan.</span>  <span>Kokand, for example, specializes in cotton processing and food production.</span> </p><h2>  The long history of colonization </h2><p>  <span>Before becoming part of the Russian Empire, the territory of modern Uzbekistan and Kokand was independent and put up serious resistance to Russian troops.</span>  <span>The first clash between the Kokand Khanate, the political center of which was the city of Kokand, and the Russian Empire occurred in 1850, when two army units invaded the territory of the Khanate.</span> </p><p>  <span>The war with a state remote from the center of Russia, consisting of a chain of armed clashes, lasted eighteen years, and the result was the signing of a trade agreement that turned the khanate, and with it the <span>Bukhara emirate,</span> into a state dependent on Russia.</span> </p><p>  <span>The city of Kokand in Uzbekistan to this day occupies a special position, which is expressed mainly in the significant development of industry and a large number of enterprises in the service sector.</span>  <span>For example, in Kokand, the Ferghana Region Railway Administration is located, despite the fact that Ferghana is considered the administrative center.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Modernity of Uzbekistan </h2><p>  <span>Kokand, being one of the oldest cities in the country, attracts many tourists from Europe, Russia and the Far East, primarily from China.</span>  <span>However, tourists are primarily interested not in archaeological excavations of ancient settlements, but in the architectural heritage of the late period of the Kokand Khanate and the Soviet period, since the colonial period in the architecture of Uzbekistan is of little interest.</span> </p><p>  <span>One of the most remarkable sights of the city is the palace of Khudoyar Khan, the one who signed the enslaving treaty with the Russian Empire, thereby putting an end to the independence of his state.</span> </p><p>  <span>This palace is a showcase of luxury and narcissism; it was conceived in order to surpass all the khan's palaces built before it with its beauty.</span>  <span>However, its construction was completed five years after the conquest of Kokand, and the palace turned into a monument of a bygone era.</span> </p>
