  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Average salary in Norilsk: a review of the labor market</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Salary in Norilsk may differ from the national average.  Moreover, it may differ within the region depending on the field of activity.  Let's find out how much Norilsk people pay and what is the situation on the labor market of this northern city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="magspace.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="average salary in norilsk" class="if uuid-3110317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3110317.jpg"></div><h2>  The basis of the economy </h2><p>  Industrial production is an area in which almost half of the city works.  One of the most significant local enterprises is Norilsk Nickel, known throughout the country. </p><p>  In addition to industry, other areas are also developed in Norilsk.  Leaders are considered energy, as well as gas and food.  That is why the salary in Norilsk depends on the field in which this or that employee is engaged. </p><h2>  Labor Market Review </h2><p>  Experts give a rather optimistic assessment of the Norilsk labor market.  According to their version, the demand for specialists is not decreasing, but, on the contrary, increasing.  The situation, I must say, is different from the all-Russian market, which was greatly affected by the economic crisis. </p><p>  In general, the situation is considered stable, and the unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the Krasnoyarsk Territory.  The problem of the Norilsk labor market is a shortage of qualified personnel, and not a lack of jobs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another problem of the Norilsk labor market is the outflow of specialists.  A large number of specialists leave the city for various reasons.  New ones come in their place, but they are inferior in qualifications and quality of training. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mansden.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Norilsk teacher salary" class="if uuid-3110321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3110321.jpg"></div><h2>  Unemployment rate </h2><p>  According to experts, from year to year there is an ever more acute shortage of qualified employees.  It is curious that Norilsk complements the number of regions with the lowest unemployment rate. </p><p>  A surge of unemployed citizens is observed in the autumn.  This is due to the completion of seasonal work, as well as individual projects designed for a short period.  After their graduation, able-bodied citizens actually become unemployed again.  In addition, graduates of universities who did not manage to find vacancies and find jobs are replenishing the list of unemployed. </p><p>  The maximum number of unemployed is observed from February to March.  During this period, the volume of repair and construction work is significantly reduced. </p><p>  On the labor exchanges, so-called <span>stagnant unemployment</span> can be observed <span>,</span> in which some citizens do not work for years.  This happens for various reasons.  Some find a lot of excuses, existing at the expense of relatives.  Some are attracted by the status of unemployed, which allows them to receive small material benefits, which people adapt to exist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, Norilsk residents do not have to be afraid of being left without work.  Given the lack of qualified personnel, potential employers are ready to create comfortable conditions for novice specialists and provide them with opportunities for professional training. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zabavnik.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what salaries in norilsk" class="if uuid-3110320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3110320.jpg"></div><h2>  Required specialties </h2><p>  If you make a rating of the most relevant vacancies, technical specialties will be on the top lines.  Humanitarian workers, as always, remain less in demand.  There is a demand for sellers.  The sphere of trade is almost the basis of the all-Russian labor market. </p><p>  Salary in Norilsk is highly dependent on the profession.  Most demanded in the labor market are engineers, electricians, etc.  Accordingly, the higher the demand for specialists, the greater the reward potential employers are willing to offer. </p><p>  The smallest chances for employment are observed among managers, specialists in the field of management and taxes.  Accordingly, for them the salary in Norilsk will be lower.  That is why when choosing a profession, young people often focus on its relevance and prestige. </p><h2>  Average salary in Norilsk </h2><p>  If you believe the statistical information, this figure is forty-seven thousand rubles, which even slightly exceeds the all-Russian indicator.  This situation can be called paradoxical.  Nevertheless, the majority of Russian citizens with a significantly lower income at full employment will envy the Norilsk citizens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.golem.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="salary in Norilsk vacancies" class="if uuid-3110323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3110323.jpg"></div><h2>  Highest salaries </h2><p>  If we talk about the highest paid professions, then they will be leaders and geologists, whose salary is estimated at hundreds of thousands of rubles. </p><p>  If we talk about the other offers that are present on the Norilsk labor market, according to statistics, employers offer the most attractive conditions to employees engaged in the field of transport and car service.  For these vacancies, the salary in Norilsk is about seventy thousand rubles, which can be considered a rather high indicator even for this region. </p><p>  High remuneration awaits professionals working in the field of real estate.  Their work is estimated at an average of more than sixty thousand rubles. </p><p>  Well paid in Norilsk, many working specialties.  That is why this region is attractive for labor migrants who cannot find decent offers at their place of residence. </p><p>  The salary of a teacher in Norilsk is from thirty to forty thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="footage.framepool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="salary in norilsk" class="if uuid-3110325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3110325.jpg"></div><h2>  Youth situation </h2><p>  Knowing what salaries are in Norilsk, many young specialists are counting on remuneration of at least fifty thousand rubles.  However, one often has to start a career with much smaller amounts. </p><p>  Labor market experts believe that young people have too high expectations.  Employers are in no hurry to pay generous remuneration to young professionals who can barely cope with their responsibilities and need additional training. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="69.35579" data-lng="88.18929389999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/9/9/5/14995.png"></div><p>  It is not surprising that among young people in Norilsk there is a rather high percentage of unemployment.  Almost forty percent of young professionals can‚Äôt find a decent job matching their needs. </p><p>  At the same time, experts recommend not to despair and try to start with vacancies in which they offer low pay, but allow you to gain experience.  In the future, this will become an advantage in the struggle for a vacant place.  Indeed, in attractive vacancies there is a fairly high competition. </p>
