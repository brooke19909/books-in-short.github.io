Each of these pieces of land, even the smallest, is rich in numerous historically significant architectural monuments that are several thousand years old.  Each of them is associated with some ancient legend or belief.  Everyone will find interest to their taste here.  That is why tourist flows to the Greek islands do not dry out even after the end of the bathing season, which, as a rule, lasts from April to October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos mare hotel 4" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/501185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Corfu Island - an emerald island washed by three seas </h2><p>  Of all the <span>Greek islands, Corfu</span> is the greenest.  It is not so famous for its attractions as the beautiful nature, which makes it a center of respectable relaxation for wealthy people.  Almost all hotels that are located on the Corfu coastline, divided into several beach areas (Benitses, Dassia, Komeno, Agios Georgios, Kondokalion, Gouvia, Acharavi) are classified as de luxe.  Here, in addition to the giant hotel buildings, there are many mini-hotels that also serve guests at the highest level, for example, Nostos Mare 4 * (Acharavi).  This hotel is located in the northern part of the island in the resort of Acharavi.  It is very popular among guests from Western Europe, as well as Russians who avoid places where there are their compatriots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos mare 4 acharavi" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/501184.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located in the north of Corfu Island between the villages of Kassiopi and Roda and is washed by the <span>waters of the Ionian Sea.</span>  At this resort, tourist infrastructure is better developed than at other beaches.  It does not close during the winter and operates year-round.  Here you can find beautiful landscapes: vineyards, almond and olive trees grow everywhere.  The wonderful climate is conducive to a relaxing beach holiday.  In Acharavi there are many excellent hotel complexes, for example Gelina Village 5 *, which includes Nostos Mare Hotel 4. Reviews of tourists about both the first and the second are basically positive.  The resort is full of vibrant nights, there are many nightly entertainment centers: clubs, discos, bars and cafes.  On the seven-kilometer beach you can find a huge amount of marine entertainment: water skiing, banana, scooter, windsurfing, diving, catamaran, etc. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you bought a tour to the Nostos Mare 4 * hotel (Corfu) and you are interested in the question of how to get to it, then the most convenient way is a direct flight from Moscow or St. Petersburg.  The minimum ticket price from the capital starts from 12334 rubles (round trip).  However, most charter flights operate only in the high season, and the rest of the time you can get to the island through Athens or Thessaloniki.  From the airport to the hotel Nostos Mare 4 * (Acharavi) - 35 kilometers.  You can go there by taxi, by bus, or you can rent a car in advance and upon arrival at the airport receive keys from the employees of the tenant.  By the way, this is the best option, since the car is always useful for exploring the many attractions of the island.  The daily rental fee is about 30 euros, depending on the brand of the vehicle.  But there is another option, how to get to the Nostos Mare 4 * hotel without problems and with comfort - to order a transfer when making the tour.  Then a representative of the hotel or tour operator will meet you in the waiting room and take you by car or minibus to the hotel grounds.  Which of these options to choose is up to you.  In principle, 35 kilometers is not such a long way to make a problem out of this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos mare 4" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/501186.jpg" width="500"></div>

I. Kapodistrias.  Hotel Nostos Mare 4 * is surrounded by a magnificent park of 12 hectares.  It is located right on the first beach line, and the beach can be reached in just a couple of minutes. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  Until April 2013, this hotel was called differently, namely Gelina Mare.  Over the entire period of existence, the mini-hotel Nostos Mare Hotel 4 *, or, as it is commonly called, a boutique hotel, was part of the magnificent five-star hotel Gelina Village.  It consists of one main building and several two-story maisonettes.  In front of the hotel there is a small pool for adults and a small one for children.  Guests at the hotel can take advantage of basic amenities located in the vast area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGelina Village, including a water park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos mare 4 corfu" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/501182.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The Nostos Mare 4 * hotel has a total of 39 rooms of three categories: studio, maisonette (bunk rooms) and standard suites.  The maisonettes are mainly on the first line and overlook the sea with windows.  All rooms are equipped with balconies or terraces with outdoor furniture;  kitchenette with stove, fridge, sink, dishes and a set for tea and coffee;  a bathroom with a hairdryer and toiletries.  Each air-conditioned room has a telephone, satellite TV, a safe, and a minibar for a fee.  The cost of a weekly tour in Nostos Mare 4 * (hotel) on average is about 29,000 thousand rubles per person.  This price includes all-inclusive meals, transfer from the airport to the hotel and, vice versa, from the hotel to the airport, medical insurance, guided tours, air travel.  However, for a <span>Greek visa</span> you need to pay separately about 70 euros.  As you can see, the price is quite reasonable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Room Facilities </h2><p>  Room service is available at the hotel around the clock.  Rooms are cleaned daily.  Towels and bed linen are changed every other day.  In Greece, the attitude to cleanliness is very scrupulous.  And the staff is trying to clean up the numbers of tourists to shine, regardless of whether there will be a tip or not. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos mare 4 hotel" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/501176.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis, tourists can choose for themselves the type of food HB (half board), which includes breakfast and dinner.  Tourists who have chosen the first option have the right to use the pool bar all day long and have a meal three times a day in the main restaurant of the Nostos Mare 4 * hotel.  Guest reviews regarding the level of food vary slightly.  There are those in which tourists openly criticize both the quality of products and dishes, and the level of service, and there are quite positive comments.  Perhaps the administration has to change cooks and staff from time to time.  In addition, tourists can always buy products from the grocery market or shop in the village, which is only a 10-12 minute walk from here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nostos mare 4 reviews" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/501181.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel service </h2><p>  The hotel Nostos Mare 4 * vacationers are provided with the following services: </p><ul><li>  parking; </li><li>  laundry; </li><li>  dry cleaning; </li><li>  first-aid post; </li><li>  car rent; </li><li>  Internet and others </li></ul><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  As already noted above, guests of this mini-hotel can use all the services that are located on the territory of Gelina Village 5 *.  So, there are five swimming pools at the service of vacationers (one in front of the boutique hotel, and 4 in the complex).  There is also a gym, SPA center, Turkish bath, massage room, aerobics and aqua aerobics classes, tennis courts, volleyball and basketball courts, soccer field, table tennis and ping pong, target shooting, darts and billiards.  Except the last, everything else is included in the price of the permit.  The complex also has a mini market, a souvenir shop, a conference room with all the necessary equipment, a currency exchange office, etc.  However, the biggest entertainment for both adults and children is the Hydropolis Waterpart (water park).  By the way, the abundance of water entertainment is what, apart from the sights, Greece is rich in.  Nostos Mare 4 * is a very small hotel, and on its small territory there are practically no entertainment for tourists.  However, the proximity to the Gelina Village complex turns leisure into a real holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece nostos mare 4" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/501183.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Is this hotel suitable for families with children </h2><p>  Of course, parents who wish to buy a tour package to this hotel are interested in whether their children will be interested here.  We must make them happy, because the attitude towards children in Greece is very warm.  For them, in the territories of two hotels there are playgrounds for games, a mini-zoo, a children's disco club, the restaurant has a special children's menu for them, including cereals, dairy products, mild and unsalted dishes, etc. If you are relaxing with a child, then for him, the administration will definitely allocate a cot, and in the restaurant - a special high chair for comfortable sitting at the table.  For the smallest for a period when parents have fun at a disco or left for the next tour, you can invite a qualified nanny.  By the way, this hotel has discounts for children under 15 years old.  For families in which teenagers grow up, this is a big savings.  Many other hotels have skiing for children under 12 years old. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel has its own sandy beach, which is located only 25 meters from it.  Everything here - umbrellas, sunbeds, towels and mattresses - is provided to vacationers for free.  However, water activities will have to be paid separately. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The cost of tours, as a rule, includes several excursions to the main attractions of the island.  Usually for guests of these two hotels - Nostos Mare and Gelina Village - joint excursions are organized.  Often, before the end of the tour, tourists are brought to mountain villages where themed Greek evenings are held specially for them with folk songs and dances, as well as refreshments from local dishes and drinks.  These shows remain in the memory of tourists for a long time.  However, they can make additional excursions on their own by renting a car for this purpose.  By the way, due to the small size of Corfu, you can go around in one day.  Nevertheless, it is better to go each time to one of the many attractions and carefully, as if relishing, inspect it.  In addition, if you have a car, you can find secluded small bays with completely uninhabited beaches, where you can spend unforgettable time with your loved one (s) or with your whole family. </p><h2>  Nostos <span>Mare Hotel 4:</span> traveler reviews and ratings </h2><p>  Guests of the island of Corfu are always delighted with its beaches, wonderful landscapes, intoxicating air, filled with aromas of exotic flowers and plants, so small flaws in the arrangement of hotels can not affect the good-natured reviews of tourists about their vacation on this wonderful island.  However, in the forums about the Nostos Mare Hotel you can find both positive and negative ratings.  However, one should not forget that these comments are subjective, especially when it comes to relationships with staff. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you bought a tour to the Nostos Mare Hotel, then it is better to tune in to a quality and pleasant stay and feel free to fly to the emerald beaches of the Ionian Sea.  Even if the decoration of the rooms is not rich, then do not worry.  Firstly, you don‚Äôt have to spend a long time in the room, and secondly, the main thing in the hotel is cleanliness, and you can be sure about that.  This is all right here.  In addition, the great advantage of all Greek hotels is the friendliness and hospitality of the staff.  All hotel employees try to please the guests and fulfill all their requests, especially when the question is about small vacationers. </p>
