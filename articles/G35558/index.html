    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  The official biography of Pyotr Stepanovich Deinekin says that he was born in December 1937 in the town of Morozovsk, Rostov Region, in a family of teachers.  His mother, Zinaida Mikhailovna, taught in elementary grades.  The boy‚Äôs father, Stepan Nikolaevich, was a history teacher and, despite his young age, ran a local school.  At the beginning of World War II, a man became a cadet at the Borisoglebsk Aviation School and died during a parachute jump.  So in 1943, at the age of 5, Petya, who survived with his mother all the horrors of the fascist occupation, lost his father.  It was then that the boy decided that when he grows up, he himself will become a pilot in order to take his dad's place in the ranks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Way to Aviation </h2><p>  A year and a half after the death of her husband, Zinaida Mikhailovna, in search of better living conditions for her little son, went with him to Lviv. </p><p>  Petra‚Äôs mother, although she never forgot about the tragedy that happened to her husband, did not discourage the young man when he announced his decision to go to Kharkov and enter a special school, where he trained personnel for the country's air force.  However, in response to Deinekin‚Äôs written request for admission to this educational institution, a notice was received stating that there was an order banning the enrollment of young men from Western Ukraine among the cadets.  Without thinking twice, Zinaida Mikhailovna wrote an angry letter to the leadership of the special school, in which she spoke about the death of her husband and what she and her son had to endure in the occupation.  Her appeal led to the fact that the head of the educational institution G. D. Yarovoy apologized and called Peter to take exams in Kharkov. </p><p>  After graduating from a special school, Petr Stepanovich Deynekin (in the biography date of birth indicated December 14, 1937) went to the city of Balashov, Saratov Region, and entered the local military military school.  Looking ahead, we say that with the receipt of a diploma from this educational institution, the education of the future army general did not end, and subsequently he continued his studies at the Yuri Gagarin Air Force Academy. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The official biography of Deinekin Pyotr Stepanovich contains detailed information about his ascent on the career ladder.  However, the beginning of his formation as an officer was not easy.  The young man was sent to serve in Long-Range Aviation units deployed in Kamchatka, namely to the 53rd Bomber Division, as a right-hand pilot-assistant to the Li-2 aircraft commander.  In this position, he served for about a year, from 1957 to March 1958.  Since April, Deinekin was appointed navigator pilot, and a year and a half later he received the post of right pilot in the 104th transport and aviation squadron of the Fifth Long-Range Aviation Army.  A year later, the future army general was already an assistant commander of a heavy bomber regiment.  And now, finally, from the middle of 1960, Peter Deinekin began to fly Tu-16 jet bombers.  This was a great achievement for him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
