Khao Lak - Resort in Thailand</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thailand has long enjoyed the well-deserved love of tourists from many countries.  Khao Lak Resort is one of those places where you can have a great vacation with the whole family.  It will be discussed about him in our article. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  According to reviews, Khao Lak is a rather secluded resort in Phang Nga province.  It is located on the shore of the Adaman coast.  Amazingly beautiful place attracts vacationers with endless snow-white beaches, waterfalls, bays, clear sea water and mango jungle.  The resort offers numerous treatments at yoga and spa centers.  Despite the distance from entertainment centers, the city can offer active leisure. </p><h2>  How to get to Khao Lak? </h2><p>  Khao Lak is often also called Khao Lak.  It is located in southern Thailand, 60 kilometers from Phuket Island, and also 750 kilometers from Bangkok.  The most convenient way to get to the resort is to use one of the flights that arrive at <span>Phuket Airport.</span>  Aeroflot offers direct flights from Moscow.  The flight takes about nine hours.  Then in about an hour you can reach the city of Khao Lak.  Since it is located on the route of all bus routes, there are no problems with transport. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The history of the resort is not as long as that of other regions of Thailand.  It takes its beginning only from the nineteenth century.  In those days, aluminum deposits were discovered on local lands, after which people rushed here, a small town was founded.  Gradually, it grew more and more and took an important place in trade.  In addition, Khao Lak (Thailand) is located just on the road between Phuket and Bangkok.  However, the history of the city has its dark spots.  Not always on these lands everything was fine.  At a certain stage, the town was mired in internecine wars due to rich deposits.  History could have a sad end if the militants had not been able to agree and conclude a truce.  In honor of this event, Wat Chalong Temple was erected in Phuket.  Over time, mining has become less profitable, and local wealthy people engaged in trade. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the twentieth century, the first paved roads appeared in the resort.  Then the locals thought about the need to connect Phuket with the mainland.  In the seventies, the Sarasin Bridge was built across the strait, which exists to this day. </p><p>  The first tourists began to visit Khao Lak (Thailand) in the eighties, which was associated with the opening of the national park.  To urbanized tourists, the resort seemed like a real tropical paradise.  Gradually, the city began to grow; numerous hotels and resort infrastructure were built.  And in 2004, a tsunami hit the region, which dared everything in its path.  Among the victims were many indigenous people and tourists.  But the city was quickly restored and soon again became a paradise for visitors to the country. </p><h2>  Resort Climate </h2><p>  The city is in a tropical climate zone.  Although the resort is located in the south of the country, its climate differs from other regions.  The rainy season here begins in June and lasts until the end of October.  But from March to May the resort is sunny and dry.  Daytime temperature is within +35 degrees.  The warm sea warms up to +29 degrees.  This period is the best for relaxation, because at high temperatures a low level of humidity is observed, which means that the heat is transferred normally.  When planning a vacation at this resort, you should pay attention to the weather in Khao Lak.  The main thing is that your vacation does not fall during the rainy season.  By the way, at this time the rains do not bother too much, because they go at night.  But the sea becomes stormy and stormy.  In the summer, they even cancel all excursion programs to the islands.  There are very few tourists at this time, and therefore bars, hotels, shops and restaurants are temporarily closed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The gorgeous beaches of Khao Lak are still practically unknown to our spa guests.  The town itself is undeservedly deprived of the attention of our travel agencies.  Many tourists learn about the resort quite by accident and first come to it during excursion programs. </p><p>  The beaches of Khao Lak stretch more than twenty kilometers from north to south.  In fact, they occupy the entire coast along the Andaman Sea.  The most famous and equipped beaches are located in the bay of the national park "Khao Lak".  Among them are Nang Tong, Bang Niang, Khuk Khak.  But the coast of Khao Lak itself is just not very much in demand by tourists. </p><p>  The resort itself consists not only of the town, but several more nearby villages.  As a rule, if you offer a vacation in this region, then most likely we are talking about these villages, since their infrastructure is most developed.  There is a good selection of hotels, restaurants, bars and shops. </p>

    <p>  The beaches listed by us are the most popular and popular; the rest of the coast is more deserted.  The northern areas generally have only a few expensive hotels that are built right on the beach, and beyond them begin the wild jungle.  Restaurants and cafes work only in hotels, and there are not even usual shops in the district.  If you have a desire to go on a trip, then you need to book a tour at the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the northern region can offer a very calm and secluded vacation.  There are practically no tourists on the local coast.  You can always find a place where at a distance of two hundred meters there is not a single person. </p><p>  In general, all the beaches of Khao Lak are not crowded, because the resort is not yet very famous and so in demand.  But here you can relax well, enjoying the clean sandy beaches and warm sea. </p><h2>  Bang niang </h2><p>  Bang Niang can be safely called the most popular beach of Khao Lak (the description is given in the article).  It is simply impossible to talk about the resort without remembering the sea coast.  The beach is not crowded enough, but very good for relaxation, and entertainment is available here.  Along the coast are built hotels, bars and restaurants.  Nearby there are a couple of temples, a museum and a grocery market.  The local coast has deserted and lively areas.  During the low season there are almost no tourists.  Therefore, such a time will appeal to those who do not like noisy resorts. </p>

    <p>  According to reviews of Khao Lak, we can conclude that Nang Tong is another popular place.  Unlike the previous beach, it is more elongated, but less wide.  First line hotels are pretty good.  If you need to find a simpler option, you should pay attention to the establishments located along the main road, which runs transport between Phuket and Bangkok. </p><p>  This resort has even fewer tourists than Bang Niang.  But still there are all kinds of water activities, and the beach area is equipped with umbrellas and sun loungers.  On the coast there is a lighthouse, which you can even climb.  The southern coast is called Sunset Beach.  Expensive hotels are built on its territory. </p><h2>  Resort Hotels </h2><p>  Many hotels here were built after the tsunami in Phuket.  Khao Lak is a very young resort in this regard.  Modern hotels can offer excellent levels of service and wonderful rooms.  Local establishments are built to all modern standards.  Some of the best hotels in Khao Lak are: "Breeze Beach Resort 5 *", "Khao Lak Emerald Beach Resort", "Khao Lak Merlin Resort".  In general, the choice of accommodation in the resort is pretty good.  There are simpler establishments and even guesthouses. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  What is this resort without attractions?  Any decent resort should have its own stunningly interesting places.  It is for this reason that existing beauties are exploited or artificially created.  Phanga Nga Province is a beautiful region that boasts natural beauties.  Sights of Khao Lak - this is all that was once created by nature, namely - rocks, reefs, caves and other objects.  The resort also has a tsunami museum and several temples. </p><p>  Tourists can visit the tsunami memorial, the main exhibit of which is a police boat.  During the tsunami, he was thrown to the coast, since then he stands on a pedestal, recalling the events of 2004.  This place is located near Bang Niang Beach. </p><p>  Padungtampotivas Temple is known for its huge gilded Buddha statue.  Visitors are very rare here, but monks live on the territory. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about marine entertainment, it is worth remembering about surfing.  Many agencies offer lessons with trainers, as well as the ability to rent equipment. </p><p>  The resort can please all lovers of shopping.  Numerous markets offer very interesting products.  One of them is located in the center of Bang Niang.  The market operates only three days a week.  It sells vegetables, foods, fruits and fish.  Also here you can buy all kinds of goods - clothes, dishes, souvenirs and more.  It is customary to bargain in the market, so the initial price can be significantly reduced. </p><p>  In the center of Khuk Khak there is another market that sells fresh produce.

According to vacationers, Khao Lak is a great quiet place for a good vacation.  The resort, of course, is interesting to those who like a relaxing holiday away from megacities.  In general, Khao Lak is not too different from the same Phuket or other places in Thailand, it's just that there are much calmer and fewer people.  If you like noisy and loud resorts or are looking for nightly entertainment, then it is worth going to those places that have long been famous for their entertainment infrastructure.  Khao Lak is a resort for those who value natural beauty and silence.  But this does not mean at all that there is no entertainment, they are, and they are all connected with nature and its riches. </p><p>  The beaches of the resort are very beautiful and clean, you will never meet a large concentration of tourists on them.  Here you can always find a secluded corner.  A stunningly warm sea is just made for swimming.  It is almost always calm and clean.  But the storms begin in the rainy season.  Resorts, as a rule, do not visit the resort at this time, so they choose periods when the weather in Khao Lak will be guaranteed to be good. </p>

    <p>  Travelers are very pleased with the time spent at the resort.  Tourists recommend choosing those hotels that are located directly on the beaches, and there are quite a few of them.  This will allow you to spend all the time by the sea, wake up and fall asleep to the sound of its waves.  It is very pleasant that loud music will not bother you here, which means that you can sleep well and gain strength. </p><p>  Experienced travelers are also advised to definitely buy tickets and go to the islands.  You can see stunningly beautiful places and swim in the warm clear water.  Such trips are most popular among our tourists. </p><p>  A mandatory point of the program is a visit to the National Park.  Exotic plants in the jungle and wild animals will not leave anyone indifferent.  Locals are very friendly to all tourists.  Almost all hotels offer free breakfast.  At other times, you can head to any cafe nearby.  Prices are the same in all resort establishments, so it doesn‚Äôt matter where you decide to dine.  Local food is not much like our usual diet, but quite tasty.  If this is not your first visit to Thailand, then the dishes will probably not seem so unusual to you.  Be sure to try the local fish and seafood - it's just amazingly delicious food. </p><p>  An important characteristic of the resort is its proximity to Phuket, where the nearest airport is located.  Therefore, getting to the city upon arrival is not at all difficult, since the transport connection with the island is very well established.  The main pride of Khao Lak (Thailand) is the desert endless beaches, on which you can listen to the sound of the sea indefinitely and bask in the sun. </p>
