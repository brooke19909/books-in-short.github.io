However, during the years of socialism, when the country was on the other side of the Iron Curtain, the flow of tourists decreased significantly.  Over the past 15-20 years, it has become increasingly popular as a tourist destination.  Moreover, tours to the Czech Republic for Catholic Christmas and New Year are especially popular, with a stop at one of the comfortable, but not very expensive hotels in the Czech capital, for example, such as Hotel Golf Depandance 4 *. </p>

    <h2>  About rest in Prague </h2><p>  It is simply a delightful city that spreads beautifully on the banks of the Vltava River.  Here you will find a unique and well-preserved ancient architecture, red tiled roofs, spiers and turrets.  Not a city, but a fairy tale.  By the way, for many Soviet children of the generation of the 80s, the fairy-tale country was presented exactly in the form of Czech cities, in particular, Prague.  Indeed, most of the fairy tales most popular among children came to them from Czechoslovakia (in those years, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were one socialist country). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Prague has a history, destiny, character, and they distinguish it from all the cities of the world.  <span>Old Town Square,</span> Tsletnaya Street, Porokhov or Town Hall towers, Charles Bridge (XV century), red roofs of houses - all this and much more is interesting to see for tourists visiting the Czech Republic for sightseeing and educational purposes.  However, there are no high and low seasons.  Prague is in fashion in any weather. </p><p>  The hospitable doors of all hotels in the Czech capital, including Praha <span>5 Golf</span> Depandance 4 *, are open all year round to guests of the city.  You will be kindly received in any of them, wrapped in attention and care.  And Prague, as <span>Franz Kafka</span> once claimed <span>,</span> will never let you go, and everyone who has come here at least once will come back again and again.  And these are not empty words, official statistical figures also speak about this.  Many of the tourists, after their first visit, come here again, probably in order to watch what they did not have time, or maybe just to walk along their favorite streets again, sit in a quiet cafe or feed pigeons on the square. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golf depandance 4 prague" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1440712.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The price includes breakfast.  In the room specially designed for this, a buffet is available in the mornings where you can enjoy continental breakfasts.  There is a large selection of meat snacks, cheeses, dairy products, various pastries, hot drinks (tea, coffee, cocoa, etc.). </p><h2>  Golf Depandance 4 *: entertainment for adults and children </h2><p>  Of course, everyone likes to spend their leisure time in different ways.  Someone needs walks, excursions, and someone likes, dressed up, to sit in a restaurant or bar, taste culinary delights and original drinks, dance to live music, etc. For lovers of walks, next to the Hotel Golf Depandance 4 * is wonderful Koshirzhe Motol park, and for fans of exquisite entertainment there is a beautiful restaurant with a large selection of Czech and international dishes.  And, of course, here you can order the famous Czech beer in the lobby bar, operating next to the reception in the lobby. </p><p>  For children, unfortunately, there is not much entertainment.  There is only a small game room. </p><h2>  Golf Depandance 4 * Prague: guest reviews and ratings </h2><p>  Most of the tourists who managed to relax at this hotel express their gratitude to the staff for the excellent service.  They are also very pleased with the convenient location of the hotel.  Indeed, due to the fact that there is a tram stop nearby, you can visit different parts of the city and get acquainted with the sights. </p><p>  Tourists in numerous reviews praise local breakfasts: they are plentiful and assorted, even after a week they do not bother.  However, there is one drawback: despite the fact that the hotel is 4-star, rooms are practically not cleaned here, they only take out garbage.  In addition, some Russian tourists feel some kind of bias towards themselves.  For example, you can come across complaints about the fact that all Russians are housed in the most remote building, from whose windows there is practically no view, and in the morning the rooms are very dark. </p><h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  Hotel Golf is a typical European 4 * hotel.  It is quite comfortable, but inferior to Asian.  However, in Prague, as in most European cities, people travel mainly for excursions, so many tourists are not particularly worried about the number of services the hotel can provide.  Nevertheless, the administration tries to provide its guests with all the necessary services and surround them with care and attention. </p>
