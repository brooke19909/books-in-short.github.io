After she died tragically, her demigod husband buried her on this shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amalfi (Italy)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2077786.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  As already noted, the beach of the Grand Hotel Excelsior 4 * is a 10-minute drive from the hotel.  It is very difficult to get there on foot - a continuous serpentine, but this is not necessary, as the hotel organizes a free shuttle to the beach and back to the hotel.  To the delight of the guests, the hotel has its own beach, which is very rare on the Italian coast, and nevertheless umbrellas and sunbeds are paid, but they are cheaper than on other beaches.  Towels are not given to tourists, so they need to be taken with you.

Everyone praises the hotel‚Äôs excellent location, which offers incredibly beautiful views of the bay.  They are not even repelled by the fact that you need to get to the beach every day by shuttle bass.  Most like breakfast.  They like the quality of the products, the taste, the variety and the presentation, in a word, that's all.  Many people like the interior of the rooms and the hotel as a whole.  However, if you look closely, positive feedback on this issue began to arrive quite recently, immediately after the reconstruction of the complex.  Half a century has passed since the hotel was built, and, of course, during this time, repairs have been carried out more than once, but the last of them brought the hotel into a more modern and respectable form.  Finally, he began to match his 4 stars.  Nevertheless, among the reviews there are negative ones, and this mostly concerns wireless Internet.  Despite the fact that on all sites where there is a description of this hotel, free Wi-Fi is noted among the services, this is not true, as it is only in the lobby of the main building and lobby.  In the park, he catches lightly, but not enough to communicate. </p>
