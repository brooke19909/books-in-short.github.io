    <p>  Appearance ZTE V790 is not particularly noteworthy and resembles many devices of that time.  The design of the front part and the rounded contours of the device give the smartphone a lot of similarity with HTC.  Despite the battered appearance, the phone came out pretty pretty. </p><p>  The device is made of plastic, which does not give much solidity.  The quality of the material leaves much to be desired, in some places the case bends and creaks.  An unpleasant detail for the owner will be scratches that appear incredibly quickly on the device. </p><p>  The back side is made of corrugated plastic, which almost does not collect fingerprints.  But the front part is not able to boast of special advantages.  The ZTE V790 display only protects the plastic, which is highly susceptible to scratches.  <span>The oleophobic coating</span> also leaves much to be desired, the prints on the case are very noticeable. </p><p>  The front has become a haven for a small screen, four touch buttons, a speaker and sensors.  The left end got a volume control, and the right remained empty.  At the back of the device is the main camera, unfortunately without a flash, logo and speaker.  The headphone jack and power button are located on the upper end, and the USB jack along with the microphone is located on the bottom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The device turned out to be very tiny and has a weight of only 120 grams.  This greatly affects when using it.  The corrugated back part along with low weight allow you to comfortably hold your smartphone. </p><p>  Although the design without any frills, but very attractive.  The only drawback is the tendency of the device to collect scratches.  The user will definitely need to get a cover for his companion. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen installed in the ZTE V790 is confusing.  Although the phone was released back in 2013, the display is just awful. </p><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a small diagonal of only 3.5 inches.  For a not-so-modern state employee, such a size is quite acceptable; problems begin further.  The screen uses an outdated TFT-matrix, which definitely does not improve its quality. </p><p>  Although the screen size is small, the manufacturer did not choose the best resolution for it.  The display received a total of 480 by 320 pixels.  Accordingly, the image is very grainy.  In addition, the screen received only 262 thousand colors. </p><p>  The ZTE V790 sensor does not improve the experience either.  It supports only two touches at a time.  This will work in full, but this option is not particularly pleasant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The old matrix technology is not showing the best results in bright light.  In the sun, the display image fades, even at maximum brightness.  The image distortion is also depressing due to TFT technology, which does not <span>provide the review</span> necessary for the <span>ZTE V790.</span>  Owner <span>reviews</span> report that with a slight tilt, the image is poorly visible. </p><p>  It is very strange to see such poor screen quality in the 2013 product.  Justifies the manufacturer only the low cost of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The ZTE V790 installed 3.2 megapixels.  Similar cameras were found back in 2005, and it is very unexpected to see such a characteristic on a modern device.  Actually, you don‚Äôt have to wait even for mediocre shots. </p><p>  The camera has a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels, it at least slightly improves the quality.  When shooting distant objects, lack of sharpness and distortion occur, which is quite expected.  Photographing the subject too close, the user will get only a blurry picture. </p><p>  The camera lacks not only a flash, but also most of the necessary settings.  Most likely, the use of the device‚Äôs camera will be minimized due to poor quality. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The manufacturer paid much more attention to the ZTE V790 filling.  Characteristics are rather weak, but quite acceptable for state employees.  The device has acquired a SnapDragon processor, which is very good.  Unfortunately, the device has only one core with a performance frequency of 1 GHz.  Not the worst accelerator Adreno-200 is responsible for the graphics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  512 MB of RAM also looks pretty good.  Although this is the minimum indicator for the device on the "Android".  The situation with the native memory is much worse.  The ZTE V790 is equipped with just one gigabyte.  This feature is not enough even for everyday tasks. </p><p>  Smooths the position of the expandable flash drive.  The device supports a card up to 32 GB.  The user will definitely have to increase the volume, since there will not be enough native memory even for the most necessary applications. </p><p>  You cannot call a device smart, although the performance is quite enough to work with many programs.  For example, quite demanding Skype works without much braking.  However, with games a completely different situation.  The phone copes with simple casual applications, but more advanced ones work not in the best way. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  The manufacturer did not install the most suitable battery for the ZTE V790.  The owner will get a device equipped with a battery of 1200 maH capacity.  Such a battery is not able to provide good autonomy. </p><p>  Minimal use of the device will allow it to stretch without additional charge for a day.  More active work of the device will reduce its life to four hours.  The maximum load will allow the owner to work with the device in just two hours. </p><p>  The most ‚Äúgluttonous‚Äù features are Wi-Fi and GPS connections.  They spend most of the charge.  By controlling the operation of these functions, you can significantly increase the battery. </p><p>  Failure to use all the capabilities of the device is not the best solution.  Solving the situation will help replace the battery.  A more capacious analogue of the battery will allow the owner to be less dependent on the outlet. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The firmware installed in the ZTE V790 will delight the owner with the fourth version of Android.  A rather unusual solution for a rather weak apparatus.  Although there is no need to complain, version 2.3 would have looked much worse. </p><p>  The system does not differ in special refinements.  The company has changed some features of the appearance, but in general the interface has remained standard.  The device housed standard applications for Android, but the proprietary shell is not observed. </p><p>  If necessary, you can flash the ZTE V790 using FOTA or using custom versions of Android.  However, the smartphone does not particularly need updates, they will not bring drastic changes in the work. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  You can become the owner of the phone for only 3 thousand rubles.  The cost looks very attractive, although there are more successful devices with the same price.  Given that the smartphone is discontinued, finding it on the shelves will be very problematic. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Together with the device are headphones, adapter, USB cable, instructions.  It is a standard set.  In addition, the owner must pre-configure for additional expenses.  For example, to protect the ZTE V790 glass, you need a film, and a case is needed for the case.  Also urgent is the need to expand the memory of a USB flash drive. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The phone supports two SIM cards and works only in the GSM network.  When making calls, one of the cards goes into standby mode, since the device has only one radio module. </p><p>  Supports smartphone and features mobile internet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS.  By the way, the phone determines the location in just 10 seconds. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  The Achilles heel of the device is its display.  The small screen size affects the usability of it, and poor-quality picture is very striking. </p><p>  An unpleasant detail was the camera of the smartphone.  The outdated matrix does not allow you to take average quality pictures.  This feature is worsened by the lack of additional settings. </p><p>  Duration of work also leaves much to be desired.  Although the phone, having two SIM cards, is clearly intended for calls, in fact, the device lasts for four hours of talk. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The main advantage of the device is its price.  The affordable price for a device with two SIM cards is very attractive and captivates a lot of buyers. </p><p>  A good choice of system can not be ignored either.  "Android 4.0" shows itself only from the best side.  The owner does not have to worry about installing the latest version. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  For the most part, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a cheap and functional state employee failed completely.  Although the device was provided with many useful abilities, on most of them the manufacturer decided to save, which led to sad consequences.  As a result, the smartphone is outdated even during production. </p>
