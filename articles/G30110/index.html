Some spend their holidays on a luxury liner that cuts the waters of warm seas, while others cannot imagine a vacation without swimming on the beach and lying in the shade of palm trees.

It can be forests and fields, plains and mountains, amazingly beautiful fjords and river valleys.

    <h2>  The concept of "tourism" </h2><p>  Although this form of human activity, which has a specific character, has become fashionable relatively recently, it is rooted in ancient times.  For a long time, people went to travel in order to explore the world and discover new territories.  All of them used certain services from local residents, both in terms of accommodation or food, and in terms of choosing routes to certain places. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In the era of antiquity, the main motives for travel were trade, pilgrimage, or treatment.  Sports trips were created in ancient Greece, and the Roman aristocracy, who actively participated in recreational trips, went to their villas on the seashore or in the mountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the east, in ancient times, people moved to uncharted places with caravans of camels.  They spent the night in tents or in inns with animal pens.  Interestingly, the level of service of tourists of that time in the east was much higher than in Europe.  The reason was more active trade relations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lycian hiking trail" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/606735.jpg" width="521"></div>

    <p>  And when the factor of religiosity intensified in the Middle Ages, large masses of people began to strive for Christian or Muslim shrines.  As a rule, these were pilgrims who took hiking trips.  And only in the Renaissance, when religious motives somewhat weakened, the individual nature of travel increased. </p><h2>  Hiking </h2><p>  You can travel by transport, on horses, with the help of other animals.  But there is a kind of sports tourism, the purpose of which is precisely to overcome the routes as part of a group of the same enthusiasts in poorly rugged terrain.  In the world today there are a huge number of trails designed specifically for this type of tourism.  Some of them are thousands of kilometers long.  For example, the length of the Appalachian trail, located in the United States, is three and a half thousand kilometers.  There are more and more people who prefer hiking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Top Routes </h2><p>  For most, tourism in France is Paris' bridges, beaches on the <span>Cote d'Azur</span> or Provence vineyards, but there are people who are not interested in these places.  They come to the Brittany peninsula in order to be able to walk along the thousand-kilometer coastal route, which is called the Customs Trail. </p><p>  Another, no less interesting route runs directly through the center of today's Europe.  Here once there was a border not just between the GDR and the FRG, but between civilizations.  And to go through it was almost impossible.  But today, this place has become a favorite for lovers of hiking. </p>

    <p>  Once in the Middle Ages, the main road connecting France and Italy was the Via Francigena hiking trail.  Merchants walked along it, pilgrims necessarily crossed it, heading to the holy city - Rome. </p><p>  But there is one route that extremals especially like.  It passes through the territory of an ancient country located in the south of Asia Minor, where the modern Turkish provinces of Mugla and Antalya are today.  This is the country of Lycia, which existed in the first millennium before our reckoning and was distinguished by a rich original culture: writing, language, architecture.  It was alternately conquered by the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Romans and Turks.  This state has long maintained autonomy as part of some ancient empires.  And today it is along it that the famous route passes - the Lycian trail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hiking in Turkey </h2><p>  The sunny coast of this country is far from the only thing that attracts tourists.  Mountains and ancient ruins, fortresses, canyons or bays attract many here.  It‚Äôs so interesting to see it all with your own eyes, walking kilometer by kilometer with a backpack behind. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Today‚Äôs Lycian Trail, which has become popular in recent years, is a 509-kilometer path along the southern coast of modern Turkey, from Fethiye to Antalya.  The track was restored from the historical records published in 1999 by the famous English traveler Kate Clow in her book.  It was thanks to her that the Lycian trail was popularized.  She certainly brought international fame to the Turkish state.  Today there is a mass of people who want to hike in Turkey. </p><p>  The Lycian trail, the route description of which is approved by the government of the country, passes through such ancient cities as Olympos and Phaselis.  It ends in the city of Mira, where, due to its remoteness, many simply cannot reach on foot.  The Sunday Times has identified the track as one of the ten best hiking trails in the world.  The Lycian trail, a description of which many tourists leave in their reviews, is fully marked with red and white marks.  This is done in accordance with the Grande Randonnee, a pan-European agreement. </p>

The Lycian trail is easiest to pass in the Fethiye zone, while to the east the sections are becoming more difficult.  The path runs mainly along pedestrian or mule paths, which are composed of limestone or hard rock.

    <h2>  Route </h2><p>  The Lycian trail begins in a tourist park called the Goynuk Canyon.  There is also located the eponymous amazingly beautiful waterfall.  It is difficult to reach it, because at some point the path from a large, wide path turns into a steep, narrow and mountain path, soaring upwards, as tourists describe, towards the sky. </p><p>  The Lycian trail, taking its name from a very ancient civilization that once inhabited this area, is characterized by elevations that increase or decrease as it descends to the sea or leaves it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lycian Trail Description" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/606740.jpg" width="460"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Settlements along the route </h2><p>  The path passes through the small resort villages of Oludeniz, Kabak, Ksanf, then the path leads along Akbel, Gelemysh, the ruins of Patara to Antifellos, crosses Uchagyz, Kale, Mira, Kutludzha, Zeytin, Alakilis.  On this site, the Lycian trail rises to the level of 1811 meters above the sea.  Then it slowly descends to Belos, Finike, Kumluca, Mavykenij, Karaez, passes through Olympos and Cirali.  After that, the path bifurcates and goes either along the coast - along Tekirova, Phaselis, Asagikuzdere, or deepens into the mainland - through Ulupynar, Beydzhik, Kuzdere, Godelme.  But in both cases, the Lycian trail ends in Hisarchandir. </p><h2>  Seasonality </h2><p>  The most favorable seasons for the passage of the route are spring and summer.  Numerous tourists come here from February to May or from September to November.  The summer here is hot, so many of those who still decide to go at least part of the route prefer shady, though not stretched sections.  In the winter, the Lycian path is impassable, since snow lies along its entire length. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Route Lycian Trail" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/606724.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourist info </h2><p>  In recent years, trekking - a wellness tour has become popular on this route.  The Lycian trail in its western part has a large number of rocky sections that must be overcome with simple climbing.  The coast is also sometimes steep, however rare, but such coveted sandy beaches are found.  The relief of the slopes is similar to the southern coast of the Crimean Foros. </p><p>  This route, which can take up to ten days, combines many advantages.  These sites are attracted by olive and fruit groves, relaxing by the sea, swimming in cozy bays, exploring the ruins of ancient cities that arise along the way.  Truly amazing Lycian trail! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Lycian Trail" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/606733.jpg" width="600"></div>  Pass independently mountains and plains, filled with Mediterranean subtropical aroma, listen to the <span>singing of cicadas</span> and the rustle of waves, feel the silence of ancient cities, learn the secrets of the past and the reality of the present - all this is for those tourists who choose this route for a hiking trip.

    <p>  In addition, it should be borne in mind that until the beginning of April, the Lycian trail in areas above 1500 meters is covered with snow.  At this time, among other things, it often rains heavily.  The last two summer months are considered very hot for trekking.  Moreover, during religious holidays, including holy Ramadan, during the day, restaurants, shops and some beaches may be closed. </p>
