    <p>  The Ural town of Turinsk has been known in chronicles since the 16th century.  In one of the villages of the region, on the banks of the Tura River, the famous battle of Yermak with Yepancha, the Tatar prince, took place.  The battle brought victory to Yermak, and he went on to Siberia to pave a new path from European Russia to sparsely populated Asia.  In place of the capital of the <span>Siberian Khanate,</span> and spread modern Turinsk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city became famous in Russian history as a place of exile for prisoners, mostly political.  A huge prison was built on the outskirts of Turinsk - the famous Siberian hard labor began from here.  From the prison building today there is nothing left, only a memorial sign indicates that difficult time. </p><p>  The road will seem not so far if you go through the city of Turinsk.  Hot springs are located not far from it, and in the city you can stop for a short time, visit the local Museum of the Decembrists.  Thanks to their exile to this settlement, Turinsk itself was ennobled, a park appeared, one of the oldest in the Middle Urals. </p><h2>  Decembrists Museum </h2><p>  The Decembrists Museum is located in the former mansion of one of the participants in the uprising, Ivashev, who arrived in Turinsk with his family.  The institution has an atmosphere of the XIX century: in a huge hall with a fireplace, popular musical evenings are held, here is the famous piano, donated to the museum by Nikita Mikhalkov himself.  An amazing and touching love story of a Russian officer Ivashev and a French girl who was not afraid to go for her beloved to distant Siberia runs a red thread through the fate of both the Russian exile and the town of Turinsk. </p>

    <p>  The Ivashevs' House became the unifying center of the life of the Decembrists, here they held meetings, musical and literary evenings.  Quiet family happiness reigned in this estate until trouble broke in - because of a cold, Camilla, Ivashev's wife, started a premature birth.  The born daughter died a couple of days later, soon Camilla herself went after her.  Vasily Petrovich could not survive his only love for a long time, and exactly one year later he quietly dies in his bed in a dream.  At the Turinsk cemetery, their grave is still revered as a symbol of great and pure love.  Here he is, this land - a hot spring, Turinsk, endless forests, mountains and eternal love ... </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A park </h2><p>  Exiled Decembrists who came to Turinsk, planted a beautiful park near their homes.  During the war of 1941-1945, the park became a big stage - here, in the old wooden building of the local club, actors evacuated from various regions of the country staged their performances.  The theme of these shows was one - the exploits of Soviet soldiers. </p><h2>  Convent </h2>

    <p>  Another attraction of the city is St. Nicholas Monastery, with its rich and difficult fate.  At the very beginning of the 17th century, the <span>Pokrovsky Monastery</span> was opened in Turinsk <span>,</span> which was originally a women's <span>monastery,</span> but then, after twenty years, for some reason it was transformed into a man‚Äôs.  All buildings were wooden, and only at the end of the XVIII century the stone church - Ascension was consecrated.  But by the beginning of the next century, the monastery practically ceased to exist - most likely, this was due to the decision to remove it from the staff, which, in essence, left the church institution without a livelihood. </p><h2>  The road to the source </h2>

    <p>  But how to get to the hot springs of Turinsk?  To do this, you need to leave the city of Yekaterinburg on the Rezhevskaya tract and head towards the industrial town of Rezh.  On the bypass we reach Irbit and, slowly moving along the main road, try not to miss the sign with the inscription "Turinsk".  In the city we drive along the main road and after the bridge we turn into Chekunovo.  It remains to get to the village of Fabrichnoe, then to the forest, and you will run straight into the iron gate.  Having paid for the entrance and driving about a hundred meters, we will find ourselves in front of a wooden tower with a pipe.  This is a hot spring (Turinsk). </p><h2>  Hot spring </h2>

    <p>  The source consists of three pools: the first is 7x8 meters - the largest, then there is a 3x3 pool and the smallest body of water - 2x2 meters completes the orderly row.  Water from the pipe is poured under pressure into a large pool, and from there it pours out alternately into the other two.  In the smallest body of water, the water is cooler than in the previous ones, but the difference is not so noticeable.  Currently hot <strong> </strong>  the springs (Turinsk) after repair are in good condition, a third pool has been built, benches have been set up, the surrounding area is not frightened by wretchedness and garbage.  But, going on a trip, you should consider that there is no hotel on the base.  If you are traveling from far away, you must agree in advance with the inhabitants of the village of Fabrichnoe about an overnight stay. </p><p>  Guests can grab a bite to eat at an inexpensive caf√© and use a changing room and shower.  Bathing lasts two hours - during this time you splash yourself in plenty of warm water, but no longer need.  Water still belongs to the category of mineral-healing with a high iron content and a temperature of 35 degrees. </p><p>  These are the hot springs (Turinsk).  The prices here are quite reasonable, for two hours of bathing from 6 am to 12 pm you will pay 100 rubles, and after lunch until midnight - 200. </p><p>  Sodium-chloride-iodine-bromine water in the source is used to treat diseases of the musculoskeletal system, digestive organs and central nervous system.  It is not recommended to spend all two hours in the pool - go out, take a walk, have a cup of hot tea or coffee in a cafe, and relax.  A hot bath, taken in two or three sets, will bring much more benefit and pleasure than continuous lying in the pool for two hours.  Hot <strong> </strong>  the source (Turinsk) is a protected area, but still do not forget about your own safety and do not leave valuables unattended. </p>

    <h2>  Tour and healing spring </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that this area is famous for its water sources - the Tura River becomes truly great and powerful during the spring flood.  It has the longest bridge in the Urals.  Many local legends and mysterious stories are connected with Tura, one of which is the legend of Pugachev's gold, supposedly thrown into the water.  Local treasure seekers are still trying to find a wooden barrel with precious stones and gold coins at the bottom of the Tour. </p><p>  Orthodox believers deeply revere the sacred spring near the former cell of Father Basilisk.  His cell was very small, with only a single window and earthen floor.  The situation is more than modest: an earthen bed with a mat made of matting and an oven molded from clay.  The water in this <span>holy spring</span> does not freeze even in winter, and pilgrims come to a prayer place to bow to the grave of the holy father and collect healing water. </p>
