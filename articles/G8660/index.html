    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The model looks a bit like a mirror-type camera.  Various elements of the body are clearly distinguished by assembly lines and texture materials.  Build quality is at a high level.  To create the case, the developers used mainly metal and plastic of increased strength.  Each individual element is well built and secured by bolts.  During operation with the device, the moving parts do not hang out and work very smoothly. </p><p>  Like many similar devices, the device has a rather large case.  Its weight along with the battery is about 600 grams.  Compared with the previous modification (SX40), the novelty received a flash that is stronger in favor of the design.  Black dominates in the color scheme, which is why the model is often called the "Canon Powershot SX50 HS Black Camera".  To the right of the lens, the developers installed a lamp to illuminate the auto focus, while on the left - a protruding handle.  Also in the front there are two buttons designed to enable tracking auto focus and translate the lens into wide-angle mode from any position. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the upper part there is a so-called shoe, which expands the capabilities of the device associated with the connection of external flashes.  To the left of it is a key to turn on the built-in flash, on the back there is an on / off button and a dial for changing operating modes, and to the right is a shutter with a wheel for zoom control. </p><p>  On the rear panel of the Canon Powershot SX50 HS, in addition to the screen, you can see several more elements.  The leftmost button on the left is customizable.  In other words, the user can independently program for her any function that he wishes.  On the right, Japanese engineers installed a play start key and a navigation joystick that can work in four directions.  Below are two identical buttons at once, they serve to turn on the on-screen menu and display settings with the viewfinder. </p><p>  On the right side of the case, under a special cover, the ports AV and HDMI are hidden, as well as a connector for the remote control.  On the left side, the developers placed a speaker, and on the bottom - a slot for installing the device on a stand.  It should be noted that in the case of using a tripod, access to a removable memory card is blocked.  In this regard, to replace it, you must first unscrew the camera. </p><h2>  Display and viewfinder </h2><p>  On the back there is a 2.8-inch liquid crystal display equipped with a rotary mechanism.  Its resolution is 461 thousand pixels.  Such parameters can be called pretty decent, because they provide a clear image when previewing frames.  By clicking on a special button, the user can choose one of two options for their display (they differ in the number of images).  On the other hand, many users of the Canon Powershot SX50 HS note that a device of such a high class could have installed a better screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the main display, the device provides a fairly high-quality electronic viewfinder.  Even for most experts, it remains unclear that the developers did not install a separate button for directly switching between them.  In this regard, given the presence of the function of rotating the main screen, many camera owners usually do not use it.  As for the viewfinder menu, it should be called understandable and simple in comparison with similar models from competing companies. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  The dimensions of the device do not allow you to hide it in your pocket or small handbag.  Along with this, the heavy case becomes an advantage when creating sharp images at the maximum approximation.  In general, we can say that the Canon Powershot SX50 HS digital camera boasts good ergonomics.  The successful design of the servos responsible for the change in <span>the focal length of the lens</span> makes its movement very quiet.  This nuance becomes especially relevant when shooting videos, because the sound in the video is not drowned out by extraneous noise. </p><p>  Thanks to the presence of a special protrusion on the handle, the index finger fits very comfortably.  The display has bipolar angles, and therefore shooting in unusual situations is greatly simplified.  Compared with the previous modification, developers have expanded the user interface of the Canon Powershot SX50 HS.  Reviews of the owners of the model in most cases characterize it as quite smooth and convenient for work.  As for the main device controls, most of them are located exactly in the places where users would like to see them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The DIGIC-5 processor is at the heart of the Canon Powershot SX50 HS.  The characteristics of this device allow you to create serial images at speeds up to 13 frames per second.  Compared with its previous modification (DIGIC-4), the processor copes with noise by 75% more efficiently.  In other words, with a long focus, you can turn off the flash and slightly increase the ISO value.  In this case, the photos will also be characterized by high quality, and there will be no noise on them.  The optical stabilization system at the same time independently determines the optimal mode of operation.  Be that as it may, the user, if desired, can independently select manually one of seven working options suitable for him. </p><h2>  Matrix </h2><p>  The Canon Powershot SX50 HS is equipped with a 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor with backlight technology.  This gives certain advantages when creating images in poor lighting conditions.  In particular, it opens up a sensitivity range for the user, the ISO value of which is in the range from 100 to 6400. Optics provides the ability to carry out a 50-fold approximation of captured objects.  Moreover, the device software provides the possibility of four-fold digital zoom. </p><p>  At first glance, it might seem that twelve megapixels for a modern camera will not be enough.  Be that as it may, experts argue that the size of each individual point due to low resolution has increased slightly.  Thus, in the pictures, compared with the previous modification of the camera, the noise level in the frame decreased. </p><p>  The largest image size is 4000 x 3000 pixels.  In other words, photographs taken with the Canon Powershot SX50 HS can be printed in the format of 34 x 25 centimeters without the slightest loss of quality. </p>

    <h2>  Operating modes </h2><p>  At the top of the camera there is a wheel to select its operating modes.  In total there are twelve positions on it.  In particular, it provides almost everything that is necessary not only for an ordinary user, but also for a professional: from standard options for choosing shutter speed or <span>aperture priority,</span> ending with automatic mode, which boasts an extended dynamic range and the ability to shoot video. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  As with all other models from this manufacturer, the Canon Powershot SX50 HS is right-handed.  In this regard, it is not surprising that all the main elements are in the appropriate place.  On the rear <span>panel, Japanese</span> engineers placed the direct start buttons for shooting video, a timer, selecting ISO, changing the focus mode, as well as a five-position standard joystick with a wheel.  It is also used to navigate menus.  In all other respects, the device is very typical of the Canon brand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon PowerShot SX50 HS professional reviews" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/996592.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Work speed </h2><p>  Thanks to the use of a good processor, the time required to turn on the camera does not exceed two seconds.  Given the fact that massive optics are installed here, this indicator can be called decent.  It takes a maximum of four seconds to change the <span>focal length</span> from smallest to largest.  This indicator noticeably worsens when recording movies (up to 10 seconds). </p><h2>  Quality and image formats </h2><p>  The device is capable of creating pictures in JPG and RAW formats.  This feature allows him to look preferable in comparison with SLR cameras.  You can watch the captured videos and pictures on the big TV just by connecting a Canon Powershot SX50 HS camera to it.  Photos are of quality that can be described as above average.  This is primarily due to the low resolution of the sensor and a powerful processing processor. </p><p>  Thanks to the automatic <span>white balance</span> function, the color mode in the foreground and background is determined very correctly.  Algorithms of the model provide the ability to balance with an external light source and with a flash.  As for the noise, they are not felt when the ISO is in the range up to 1600. The sharpness starts to drop significantly if its value reaches the mark of 3200. In the event that the ISO is 6400, the images will look blurry.  At the same time, digital noise is not characteristic of such photographs. </p>

    <p>  High level of detail in complex areas is ensured by the dynamic range correction function.  In fairness, it should be noted the nuance that this function is only available when shooting in JPG format.  The level of chromatic aberration can be called very acceptable.  At the same time, in very contrasting conditions, purple and green edging may appear in the pictures. </p><p>  In macro mode, even at the minimum distance of the lens from the subject, photos are sharp.  Be that as it may, certain changes can be made by the optical system itself.  At a minimum focal length, the frames are characterized by a small barrel-like distortion, and at the maximum, there are slight concave distortions. </p><h2>  Flash </h2><p>  The Canon Powershot SX50 HS Black is equipped with a standard flash that opens.  In this regard, before using it, you need to remove your hand from the top panel.  One of the three scenarios of its operation is selected by clicking on a special button.  As for the range of operation, it is in the range from 0.5 to 5.5 meters. </p><p>  According to the reviews of many owners of the model, indoors, it works quite well.  Both exposure errors and the red-eye effect are uncharacteristic of the images taken.  With the active night shooting mode, shutter speed can be set for up to 15 seconds.  As practice shows, this is quite enough in most situations.  Under conditions of poor lighting or a long focus, the image stabilization system helps a lot. </p>

    <h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  The Canon Powershot SX50 HS is capable of producing HD 1080p movies at 24 frames per second.  Due to the permission, the user has the opportunity to increase it to 30 frames per second.  Recording is accompanied by stereo sound.  The device allows you to zoom directly during the creation of the video.  If necessary, the user can record videos in Full HD format.  Like many other similar modern devices, the model boasts the presence of a number of art filters. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  A good indicator of battery life is considered one of the positive characteristics that the Canon Powershot SX50 HS boasts.  The feedback from the owners of the device indicates that the full charge of the 920 mAh lithium-ion battery used here is enough to create an average of 315 photographs. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the model is positioned by the manufacturer as a flagship device in the zoom segment.  Its main disadvantage is considered to be a rather high cost, which in domestic equipment stores is about 510 US dollars.  However, this minus is typical for most Canon models. </p><p>  The quality of the resulting photographs can be classified as above average.  The main reason for choosing this camera is considered to be the ability to zoom 50 times closer to your subject.  On the other hand, for the same reason, many potential buyers abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãacquiring a Canon Powershot SX50 HS.  Expert reviews indicate that it is not so easy to deal with it without good practice.  Plus, this feature leads to a significant increase in the cost of the model, while situations in which such a zoom could be useful do not happen every day.  Therefore, before purchasing this model, professionals recommend testing it first in the store, and only then make the final decision. </p>
