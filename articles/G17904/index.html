    <p>  If a minimum of documents is required, then the conditions for such a loan are usually not favorable for the client.  High rates, paid services, compulsory insurance may apply.  If you need funds for a short period, you should find out about the possibility of early repayment, because then you will save on interest.  And in some banks, early payment leads to the calculation of fines.  Large rates, large fines are usually valid for loans with instant issuance. </p><p>  It is advisable to choose cards with benefits, for example, with 10% for purchases.  If you have to travel often, it is advisable to choose a program with bonuses for flights.  This allows you to get discounts on trips.  And for shopping, the discount period is perfect. </p><p>  Before applying for a credit card, you need to read reviews on a banking product.  When signing the contract, information regarding payments, additional services, rates should be clarified.  A payment notification service, which is necessary to protect against delays, will not be out of place.  With the receipt of the card, payments must be made in trusted online stores. </p><p>  Cash should be withdrawn from verified ATMs.  Suspicious devices must be reported to the bank or police.  When withdrawing funds, you need to pay a lot of attention to security, which will avoid many misunderstandings. </p><h2>  Loan payment </h2><p>  You can pay off the debt on the card in any convenient way.  Money can be transferred through any banks, payment systems, ATMs and terminals.  Contribute should be an amount that must be at least a monthly minimum. </p><p>  Funds are usually credited within 1-5 business days, depending on the method.  Repayment is carried out in the same way as with a regular loan.  It consists of principal and interest.  If you pay the debt in a timely manner, then the bank offers such customers more favorable conditions for its services. </p>
