Make a macro photo.  And here the amateur photographer faced certain difficulties, the main one of which was the correct lighting of the model or subject. </p><h2>  Importance of light </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A lot of light" class="if uuid-2347739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75564/2347739.jpg"></div><p>  After all, the final result depends on how to deliver the light, how to illuminate the object.  Lighting is especially important for macro photography.  After all, it is difficult to find the right shooting angle for a small object: it can either be fully or partially in the shadow, and sometimes when choosing a photography angle it turns out that when the camera is in the best position, the object is completely in the shadow.  In such cases, a ring flash comes to the rescue. </p><h2>  Ring flash story </h2><p>  Surprisingly, this type of outbreak owes its appearance precisely to medicine.  Dentists were the first to use such an outbreak in the early 50s.  It was used to photograph the oral cavity, the light from the flash was supposed to illuminate it.  An ordinary flash did not cope with this task, and a special device was developed that had an annular shape and was attached directly to the camera lens.  It is this form and this method of attachment that made it possible to make high-quality clear pictures, which were then printed in textbooks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is completely indispensable in those cases when the subject of filming is flowers, insects or decorations.  It is thanks to the ring flash that lighting of macro objects turns out to be improved and the camera lens is brought as close to the object as possible.  It is such a flash that allows you to brightly illuminate the subject and leave the background dark.  As a rule, in most cases, ring flashes are used to illuminate a small object and take a macro photo.  But in some cases, they can also be used in portraiture and in the production of promotional photographs.  With the development of technology in the production of flashes, modern technologies have been applied and modern materials have been used.  And therefore, LED ring flashes are currently used. </p><h2>  Device Parameters </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flash ring" class="if uuid-2347715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75564/2347715.jpg"></div><p>  As in any technique, flashes have their own parameters by which you can make your choice.  They are characterized by many quantities, among which several main ones can be distinguished.  These include a guide number, lighting angle, power adjustment range, color temperature, second-curtain flash synchronization, recharge time and overall dimensions.  The leading number characterizes the power of the flash itself.  It is designated as GN and is measured in meters.  In this case, ISO-100 is considered and the actual f / 1 aperture is accepted.  The presence of various rings for connecting flashes with lenses will not be superfluous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of devices for macro photography </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.allwallpaper.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Macro photo example" class="if uuid-2347724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75564/2347724.jpg"></div><p>  Macro and portrait flash have differences.  A macro ring flash is worn directly on the lens, which provides soft, non-directional light that does not give shade.  It is the combination of many light sources concentrated around the camera lens that gives the desired lighting effect used in macro photography.  Due to the fact that this mode is quite specific, for it the use of conventional or built-in flashes is undesirable.  Just such devices can give a shadow from the lens to the photographed object.  A ring macro-flash is devoid of such a drawback: its light softly illuminates the subject.  Such a flash gives balanced, uniform illumination of the subject, allows you to show the true beauty in detail. </p><h2>  Ring for a portrait </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.premiumbeat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unforgettable portrait" class="if uuid-2347722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75564/2347722.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps the most controversial use of ring flash is portraiture.  This application has its supporters and opponents.  Indeed, such a device makes the subject flat, and in order to highlight the model, it is necessary to use other types of lighting (for example, backlight or modeling light).  When using an annular flash for portraiture, it should be used as a filling light source.  This will avoid unnecessary glare.  However, it can add additional glare that will give the photo a certain charm.  Particularly memorable are the photos of models with the original glare effect from the ring <span>flash in the eyes.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Currently, you can easily find the right device for almost any model of camera. </p><h2>  A bit about Canon flashes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yongnuo YN-14EX" class="if uuid-2347731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75564/2347731.jpg"></div><p>  Canon cameras use their own developed flash algorithm.  It is based on the operation of the TTL system and is called E-TTL or a more advanced version of the flash fire algorithm - E-TTL II. </p><p>  Ring flash for canon Yongnuo YN-14EX has the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>  GN - 14 (ISO 100). </li><li>  TTL support - there is E-TTL II. </li><li>  Reflector zoom is absent. </li><li>  Lighting angle - 80. </li><li>  The ability to adjust power: 1 / 1-1 / 128. </li></ul><p>  The kit also includes adapter rings for attaching to the lens (52 mm, 58 mm, 67 mm, 72 mm) and a soft case for transportation.  This flash provides two modes of operation: manual power selection and E-TTL mode.  The device allows you to shift the intensity of the glow between the left and right LEDs.  This flash has a high recharge speed of 3 seconds. </p><p>  Another flash for Canon cameras is the Yongnuo YN-24EX.  This device fully supports E-TTL mode.  There are also two lamps, the luminous intensity of which can be regulated separately for each, thereby creating lighting from the necessary side.  The flash has a built-in large display.  The kit includes adapters for various lenses (52 mm, 58 mm, 67 mm, 72 mm). </p><p>  Specifications: </p><ul><li>  GN - 24 (ISO 100). </li><li>  TTL support - there is E-TTL II. </li><li>  Reflector zoom is absent. </li><li>  Lighting angle - 80. </li><li>  The ability to adjust power: 1 / 1-1 / 128. </li><li>  Color temperature - 5600 K. </li></ul><p>  When working both in manual mode and in E-TTL mode, the flash very clearly and correctly fulfills the power.  This device implements flash operation on the second curtain.  On the whole, it turned out to be a good mechanism, in many respects similar and working just as well as the Canon Macro Twin Lite MT-24 EX. </p><h2>  Nikon is not far behind </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.babatasfoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meike MK-14EXT" class="if uuid-2347730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75564/2347730.jpg"></div><p>  Nikon has developed two proprietary flash algorithms for its flashes - D-TTL, whose operation is based on the camera‚Äôs matrix metering.  This algorithm is implemented for lenses labeled ‚ÄúD‚Äù and ‚ÄúG‚Äù.  And the i-TTL algorithm designed for system digital flashes. </p><p>  Among the ring flashes for Nikon, the Meike MK-14EXT can be distinguished.  There is a large convenient LCD screen, TTL support, setting both manual and automatic modes, it is possible to set the power for different segments of the flash.  Rings for attaching various diameters (from 52 mm to 77 mm) are included.  GN-14, color temperature - 5500 K, has seven power levels: from 1/1 to 1/128 in increments of 1/3.  Good for macro photography. </p><p>  Another flash for Nikon is the Nissin digital MF18.  Budget option, works well in modern i-TTL mode.  GN-16;  color temperature - 5600 K;  the same as in the previous flash, the ability to control power in increments of 1/3;  implemented the ability to control other external flashes.  The set includes mounting rings (from 52 mm to 77 mm). </p><h2>  Do it yourself </h2><p>  Of course, flashes are currently available and you can always buy them both on online sites and in ordinary stores.  But you can make a ring flash with your own hands.  There are many such examples on the World Wide Web.  Moreover, you can make both stationary - for work in the studio, and portable.  In the manufacture of such a flash, you can use lamps with an E27 cartridge (that is, ordinary).  Then in this case an impressive ring is obtained, which will be stationary in the studio.  Or you can apply modern technology and use LEDs.  In this case, you will have to bother with the heat removal system and the flash voltage supply system. </p><h2>  Selfies in the dark?  - No problem! </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gipershop.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Selfie flash" class="if uuid-2347716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75564/2347716.jpg"></div><p>  It has now become popular to photograph yourself.  Although this hobby has little to do with real portrait photography, but the abundance of selfie-style photographs on the Internet expands one to reckon with it.  Indeed, everyone wants to keep a photo for themselves, for example, from a concert or spring evening walk.  But, unfortunately, on rare phones there are built-in flashes on the front cameras.  And manufacturers went to meet the desire of people and invented ring flashes for phones.  Such devices operate on two AAA batteries.  Diameter - 85 mm, thickness - 25 mm.  The device is put on the phone and is securely attached to it with a clothespin.  The inside of the clothespin is covered with a soft protective silicone, and thanks to this, the phone screen is not damaged.  The flash ring has 32 LEDs that have three light modes.  Thanks to this device, you can take selfies in a dark room on the phone, without fear that then you can‚Äôt see anything in the photo. </p><p>  Among a large number of ring flashes, one can perhaps single out several options and make up a kind of rating. </p><h2>  Nissin MF 18 </h2><p>  The Nissin MF 18 flash comes with six rings for attaching to the lens (their diameter is from 52 mm to 77 mm), for lenses with a larger or smaller diameter, additional rings will have to be purchased.  Its leading number is 16. The flash itself is attached using an adapter to the hot shoe of the camera.  Universal - fits many lens models.  The flash is easy to use with intuitive controls.  The disadvantages include excessive cumbersomeness.  Can be rated solid 4. </p><h2>  Sigma EM 140 DG </h2><p>  This flash is equipped with many functions (high-speed <span>sync,</span> second-curtain sync, flash lock, etc.). It has a guide number of 14 at ISO-100.  It works both in manual mode and automatic.  It is possible to adjust the power and select the side of the glow.  From the negative, we can say that this flash in the kit has only two rings (55 mm and 62 mm), and it has a control system with which you will have to torment.  Because of this, you can give a rating of 3. </p><h2>  Viltrox JY-670 Macro Light Pro Kit </h2><p>  Ability to control one or two lamps.  The guide number is 14. Flash adjustment is manual only.  It is possible to change the lamp power from maximum power to 1/128.  Six rings are supplied (49 - 67 mm).  At a relatively low cost, this is a pretty good flash.  Rating - 4. </p><h2>  Metz 15 MS-1 </h2><p>  One of the most compact flashes.  The leading number is 15. Implemented second-curtain synchronization, six-step power control, the ability to distribute power on the sides of the flash.  Wireless control.  Only two AAA batteries are required to operate.  The disadvantages include a small display.  Rating - 4. </p><h2>  Nikon R1 </h2><p>  The flash is not implemented in the form of a classic ring, but has the form of two reflectors located on opposite sides of the lens opposite each other.  The device is wireless.  Five rings are included (from 52 mm to 77 mm).  The leading number is 10. Wireless communication and fully automatic exposure and synchronization calculation are implemented.  Of the minuses, we can only say that this flash works exclusively with Nikon cameras.  Assessment of the mechanism - solid 5. </p>
