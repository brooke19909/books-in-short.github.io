Crochet is unique in that the product knits quickly and easily, while holding any shape.  And crocheted horses will decorate the children's bedroom, the living room, and even the kitchen, but first things first. </p><h2></h2><h2>  "Wall" animals </h2><p>  From the intricate name it is clear that we will talk about panels with horses.  Such knitted panels can decorate the interior of any room.  They can make pillows, paintings, tablecloths, curtains, bedspreads.  It all depends on your patience and imagination. </p><p>  Horses <span>crocheted</span> for panels can be depicted in motion by you yourself on a sheet in a cage, or you can find ready-made patterns.  They will knit in a sirloin pattern (grid), so the schemes can be of two types: </p><ul><li>  the background is knitted with a grid, and the pattern is knitted with columns; </li><li>  the whole pattern is knotted with columns, and the main lines with a grid. </li></ul><p>  Now let's move on to the panel pattern.  First, a chain of air loops is dialed, the number of which is equal to the width of the product or circuit.  Then a ‚Äúgrid‚Äù pattern is knitted, consisting of empty and filled squares: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted horses" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/345719.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <ul><li>  an empty square consists of alternating columns and air loops (column-loop-column-loop); </li><li>  the filled one is completely knotted out with columns. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, such a panel from single crochets, with 1 or 2 crochets, is knitted.  Everything will depend on the type of thread and the size of the product (the smaller the product, the less yarn). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  How <span>to crochet a horse</span> for a child? </h2><p>  Toys can be for playing and for sleeping.  In the first case, the horse must keep in shape, it knits in a single crochet.  In the second case, it should be soft, it is better to knit with crochets. </p><p>  A crocheted horse (diagram below) is made quite simply. </p><ol><li>  Let's start work with an oval torso.  A circle is tied, the diameter of which will determine the thickness of the body.  Then, without reduction (by the type of knitting of the cap), the length of the body is tied.  The body may be regular oval or irregular, that is, the horse‚Äôs croup is wider.  Fill the knitted oval with a synthetic winterizer or other filler and close the loops. </li><li>  Tie 4 oval-shaped legs.  For convenience on the body, you can mark the thickness of the legs with a special marker and start knitting from the product itself.  Then fill with padding polyester and finish knitting.  Or you can individually tie the legs and then sew them to the body. </li><li>  Now the neck is tied with an ordinary cloth, which is sewn to the side (do not touch the ends yet). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet horse" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/345718.jpg?1393671337831" width="320"></div></li><li>  The most difficult thing remains - the head, which has a narrow end to the muzzle, and expands to the ears.  It fits with the nose, with a small circle that determines the diameter of the muzzle.  Then from it without addition comes knitting eyes (about half the head).  Next, you need to double-triple the loop to get a wide round head.  Fill with padding polyester and close the loop. </li><li>  Sew on your eyes, ears (crocheted squares folded into a triangle).  Sew the head to the neck, fill it with a padding polyester and connect it to the body.  Now it remains to make the mane and tail according to the fringe principle, pulling the ends of the threads through the loop and tightening them. </li></ol><h2></h2><h2>  Crocheted horses for souvenir </h2><p>  By this type souvenir toys of small sizes (5-10 centimeters) are knitted.  They are light in weight and can decorate key rings, car mirrors, and mobile phones.  For their manufacture, in addition to threads and a hook, you will need wire and a synthetic winterizer. </p><p>  An oval torso is tied.  A bent wire (legs) is immediately inserted into it, which is wrapped with wool (it is attached with glue).  The body is stuffed with padding polyester and tied.  A knitted long neck with a head is also sewn to it.  Ears can also be made of wire wrapped in wool. </p><p>  The final touch is round hooves that are sewn to the legs (for this, bend the ends of the wire into a ringlet).  Sew the mane, tail and ribbon on which the horse will hang. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a horse" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/345723.jpg?1393671380718" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As you can see, crocheted horses can be of the most diverse shapes and sizes.  They can tie clothes, a bridle, a saddle, a hat and various attributes.  You can take store toys or cartoon characters as a sample.  Just turn on the fantasy, grab the hook in your hands and create! </p>
