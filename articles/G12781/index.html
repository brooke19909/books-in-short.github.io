In terms of shopping, too, everything is fine - sales centers are constantly selling.  And with the infrastructure, everything is in order.  There is only one not very positive point - the high price of a flight.  A place to relax is a real paradise, but air travel makes vacation an expensive pleasure.  Although, of course, many do not regret the money spent. </p>
