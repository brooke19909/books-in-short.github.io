It is located between the Italian Riviera and the possessions of Monaco.  The city is a quiet and picturesque seaside resort that can offer not only a beach, but also a cultural holiday.  The sights of Menton (France) deserve the attention of tourists. </p><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  The city of Menton (France) impresses with truly French elegance and Italian cheerfulness.  It is dominated by pastel and terracotta shades of buildings, and in the city center you can see beautiful Baroque palaces and cathedrals, as well as shady boulevards, laid in the second half of the nineteenth century.  On the streets of Menton you will be met by typical Italian houses with dark yellow facades, olive and citrus groves, picturesque boardwalks, manicured parks, as well as sand and pebble beaches.  In the city you can walk for hours and admire its beauties. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.774481" data-lng="7.497540000000072" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/9/7/2/11972.png"></div><p>  It is worth saying that the city of Menton (France) is the last settlement in front of the Italian border.  It is famous not only for sightseeing, but also for the international music festival and casino.  In February, in Menton, residents cheerfully celebrate the feast of lemons, which is accompanied by carnival processions.  Such magnificent celebrations are connected with the fact that Menton is the only European city in which culture blooms and bears fruit throughout the year.  The mild climate of the region contributes to the growth and fruiting of lemon trees.  Excellent weather conditions are the reason for the prosperity of lush city gardens and parks, which are considered real wealth.  Of greatest interest to guests of the resort is the Old Town.  Its winding streets with gardens and small shops, markets and aristocratic ateliers have a special charm.  The city is attractive and entertainment facilities: there are many nightclubs, casinos and restaurants.  The resort offers water sports: sailing, water skiing or canoeing.  Here you can also go mountain climbing, horse riding, scuba diving. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical excursion </h2><p>  In France, Menton (photo is given in the article) was inhabited in prehistoric times, as evidenced by finds in caves near the city.  In the Middle Ages, the local lands belonged to the Vento family, and already from 1346 the city passed under the rule of the Monaco Grimaldi dynasty.  And only in 148, Menton declared himself free and left the principality.  And in 1860 he joined France. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yacht Port View" class="if uuid-2973669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2973669.jpg"></div><p>  Since ancient times, local residents were engaged in the cultivation and sale of citrus fruits.  For some time they competed strongly with neighboring Italian regions.  Later this area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity became less relevant, and residents began to grow flowers for the perfumery factories of Provence and Grasse.  As a resort, Menton began to develop in 1880, when it began to visit the Russian and English aristocracy. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the palaces and hotels of the city were turned into hospitals.  Then invaders from Germany and Italy came to Menton.  The city was almost destroyed.  It was fully restored only in the 60s of the last century.  Many talented landscape designers and architects had a hand in the modern look of Menton. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  According to reviews, Menton (France) has gained such great popularity due to its mild climate.  It is difficult to imagine, but in January the air temperature in the city sometimes reaches +20 degrees.  Convenient geographical location is the reason for such warm weather.  Menton is reliably sheltered by mountain ranges from cold winds.  The region is dominated by a subtropical Mediterranean climate, thanks to which the city has warm, non-hot summers and damp mild winters. </p><p>  The coldest month is January.  At this time, the thermometer never drops below +10 degrees.  But mostly the weather is much warmer.  The hottest month is July, at which time the air temperature reaches +25 degrees.  The summer breeze saves residents from the heat. </p><h2>  Jean Cocteau Museum </h2><p>  Among the sights of Menton (France) it is worth highlighting the Jean Cocteau Museum, which houses a large collection of contemporary drawings, mosaics, carpets, ceramics, made by a French writer, artist and playwright Jean Cocteau. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.menton.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jean Cocteau Museum" class="if uuid-2973692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2973692.jpg"></div><p>  He was one of the most significant figures in the literary circles of France in the 20th century.  The museum‚Äôs collection is housed in the bastion in the Menton Port area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary </h2><p>  Most of the sights of Menton (France) are located in the historical center.  Here you can see the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  It was founded in 1880 by the Russian charity.  For the future temple, the organization acquired a mansion in a very beautiful place - Karnole quarter.  The community itself was called the ‚ÄúRussian House‚Äù.  The acquired four-story mansion had 32 rooms.  Only Russians lived here.  Later it was decided to build a temple.  Its foundation was laid in 1892.  During the Second World War, the church building was badly damaged.  Repair work on the restoration was completed only in 1958.  The temple has a ninth-century iconostasis made of <span>Carrara marble</span> in the Byzantine style.  The church still holds revered relics to this day. </p><h2>  Grieving Chapel </h2><p>  The sights of Menton (France) include the Sorrowful Chapel, built in the Russian cemetery at the highest point of the city.  The construction was carried out with the money donated by Russian emigrants in memory of Alexandra Teplyakova (sister of mercy), who helped the Russians during the Russo-Turkish war. </p><p>  The project of the temple was created by Yurasov, and the interior decoration was painted by the Russian artist Kramsky.  In the fifties several new icons appeared in the chapel, painted by V. Tsevchinsky.  Inside the building, a crypt has been preserved, into which the remains of demolished Russian graves were transferred.  For a long time the chapel was in ruins.  Local authorities were even planning to demolish it.  But in 2010, restoration work began. </p><h2>  Historical sights </h2><p>  The most famous building in the city is the Basilica of Saint-Michel, which is a stunning example of Baroque architecture.  The temple is known for its rich interior decoration, beautiful frescoes, pebble mosaics.  At the end of summer, the famous Chamber Music Festival is held on the square near the cathedral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.france-voyage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basilica of Saint-Michel" class="if uuid-2973697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2973697.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists should also visit the Menton Bastion, erected by the Prince of Monaco.  City visitors are eager to take photos from the observation deck of the building. </p><p>  The Museum of Fine Arts, located in the palace of Carnole, which was once the residence of the princely family from Monaco, is very interesting.  The exposition of the institution presents paintings by famous masters of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  The palace is surrounded by a magnificent garden where you can see the richest collection of citrus plants in Europe. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Like any resort town, Menton attracts tourists with beaches.
