    <p>  A number of inconveniences may be caused to tourists by a construction project unfolding on the coast.  The walls of the hotel are really very thin, so if you have a <span>sensitive dream,</span> ask the hotel to settle you on the opposite side of the hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Area </h2><p>  Bach Duong Hotel <span>Nha Trang</span> 2 * is quite small, but quite cozy: tourists are invited to stay in 8 standard and 12 superior rooms.

    <p>  Quite often, if there are free and prepared rooms, the administration does not expect an official check-in time and issues the room keys within 10-15 minutes.  Agree, after a long and tiring flight, this trifle becomes a huge advantage of the hotel, to which many tourists refer in their laudatory reviews. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  It's no secret that in many respects the comfort on vacation depends not only on the location of the hotel, but also on the condition of its rooms.  So, if you go to Vietnam, the Bach Duong Hotel 2 * hotel will offer you quite comfortable conditions.  The air condition is responsible for the microclimate in the rooms.  Of course, minor breakdowns occur, which are quickly eliminated by specialists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To someone, a TV with satellite channels may seem like an inadmissible luxury on vacation - you come here to enjoy the silence, the pacification.  However, all apartments are equipped with a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, including Russian ones.  Moreover, each room has a telephone, minibar and a private bathroom.  The furniture is not new, but in excellent condition. </p><p>  Guests pay attention that the rooms here are quite bright, spacious and, most importantly, clean.  The beds are made with snow-white bedding.  In the bathroom there are not only towels, but also the necessary bath accessories, by the way, of good quality.  Deluxe rooms have a stunning balcony with views of the coast and local beauty.  Tourists love to settle down here in the evening with a glass of wine and enjoy the sunset. </p>

    <p>  Speaking about the shortcomings of the hotel, guests note thin walls and disgusting soundproofing of the rooms - literally every step of the neighbors is heard.  Not quite a pleasant fact on vacation.  The rooms do not have a safe, but for an additional fee you will be kindly provided with a place to store documents, valuables and money at the reception.  These are perhaps the only drawbacks of the Bach Duong Hotel Nha Trang 2 *.  Accommodation prices here are more than affordable.  The cost of a standard double room starts from 1000-1200 rubles per night. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  In Vietnam, there are many stunningly beautiful places with pristine nature, which is why tourists and vacationers rent bikes at the rental point - the most popular type of transport here.  It is on it that guests move along the coast.  In addition, the Bach Duong Hotel 2 * hotel offers all vacationers free parking. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists notice that the hotel does not have its own restaurant, even typical Asian breakfast options you will not see here.  You can eat in local restaurants and bars, where they prepare amazing dishes of national cuisine.  Not far from Bach Duong Hotel 2 * there is a cafe Tuans, quite popular among vacationers. </p><p>  Some tourists buy a tour, which includes breakfast.  How so?  Everything is extremely simple: in this case, upon checking into the Bach Duong Hotel 2 *, they receive food stamps in a neighboring hotel. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Many <span>hotels in Vietnam</span> can not boast of first-class service and amazing service.  A completely different matter - Bach Duong Hotel 2 * (Vietnam).  Upon check-in, all vacationers will receive a password from the wireless Internet.  The kind staff is always ready to help, answer all your questions. </p>

    <p>  If your vacation is limited in time and you cannot tolerate long journeys, it is better to refuse this trip, especially since its cost is quite high.  It is worth noting that in the vicinity of the resort there are quite beautiful, picturesque and noteworthy places.  Most of them are natural.  Sports equipment and diving are available on the beach.  By the way, Vietnam is a great place for those who want to dive for the first time. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  For its stars, Bach Duong Hotel 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) is a hotel that many will like.  The deluxe room with a balcony, which offers stunning views of the coast, is in many ways superior to hotel rooms with more stardom.  Again, recall that in Vietnam, many hotels simply do not fit their category in the description.  The fact that for modest money you will get a great option will surely only please you. </p>
