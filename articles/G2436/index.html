    <h2>  History of the Mari Territory </h2><p>  <span>The name Mari El</span> from the local language means Mari Territory.  Marie is the <span>indigenous people of the</span> area (translated from Mari - "husband, man").  For a very long period, the region was subjected to military invasions from the East and Europe.  For a long time the Tatar Khanate ruled here.  During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the Mari Territory was annexed to Russia.  The borderline state of the republic is visible in everything.  Most of the population did not accept any of the world's religions: neither Christianity nor Islam, and still pray in pagan temples and perform the corresponding rituals. </p><p>  Since the 16th century, the history of the republic has been very closely connected with the life of Russia.  However, like any other region of the country, it has its own symbolism: flag, coat of arms and anthem of the Republic of Mari-El. </p><h2>  Symbolism of the region </h2><p>  <span>The flag of the Republic of</span> Mari El is a symbol of its unity.  It is a three-color rectangular canvas.  The upper strip, which occupies the fourth part of the flag width, has a azure color.  The central strip (half width) is white.  The lower part, which is comparable in size to the upper, has a <span>bright scarlet color.</span>  On the left, next to the pole, on white the Mari national ornament with the signature of the red-brown color "Mari-El" is depicted.  The national flag of the Mari-El Republic flaunts on the buildings where the government, the president, and the buildings of ministries, courts and local governments are located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag of the Mari El Republic" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/590397.jpg" width="432"></div>

Its initial name is Tsarevokokshaysk (Tsarev grad on the Kokshaga River).  It was founded at the end of the 16th century and was originally a military fortress.  After that, artisans and peasants began to settle here, the main occupation of which is agriculture.  Until the 18th century, the city was predominantly military, until it began to open industrial enterprises.  The orientation of the settlement has completely changed.  At that time, the Alexander-Elizabethan Fair became the main entertainment for residents, and Yoshkar-Ola became one of the merchant centers of the republic.  Bazaar Square and now is in Yoshkar-Ola, it serves as the historical center of the city. </p><p>  Currently, the city has a well-developed infrastructure.  Yoshkar-Ola is not only a political center, but also a cultural one.  In addition, it is one of the oldest and most beautiful cities of the Volga region. </p><h2>  Attractions Yoshkar-Ola </h2><p>  The capital of the Republic of Mari El, as a cultural center, has a number of attractions.  Tourists should definitely visit the national museum named after T.V. Evseev, as well as the Museum of Fine Arts.  Those who want to learn more about the life, customs, customs of the local population, as well as immerse themselves in the history of the city, should visit the Museum of the History of Yoshkar-Ola.  Of course, the ancient buildings, such as the Ascension Church (18th century), the House of Soviets (early 20th century), give the city special beauty.  The old buildings contrast with modern shopping and office centers, and the buildings where the government and the arbitration court of the Mari-El Republic are located look spectacular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You should definitely drive a bit out of town to see the Sheremetyevs' estate, amazing in its beauty, reminiscent of a castle in appearance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ministry of the Republic of Mari El" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/590401.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The main advantage of the city is its natural beauty: groves, gardens and squares where you can walk and enjoy the beauty of the Mari nature. </p><h2>  Other cities </h2><p>  Small cities - this is the difference between the Mari El Republic.  Volzhsk is one of them.  This is a district center, whose population is about 61 thousand people.  In Volzhsk, the pulp industry is actively developing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Republic of Mari-El Volzhsk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/590396.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another city is Zvenigovo.  It is also built on the banks of the Volga.  The city has developed the forest industry and ship repair. </p><p>  The third city is Kozmodemyansk.  Its population is almost 25 thousand people.  The city has meat factories, sausages, a garment factory, a brick factory, a plant for the production of spare parts for gas stoves, computer equipment. </p><h2>  Culture of the republic and its capital </h2><p>  The capital of the Republic of Mari-El and its other cities are home to many famous composers, artists, singers, dancers and poets.  For example, the all-Russian fame was received by the dance group, bearing the name of the republic.  The most famous Mari composer Ivan Palantai was born in Yoshkar-Ola.  As for the more famous personalities, we can cite the example of the poet Nikolai Zabolotsky, whose childhood passed in one of the district centers of the republic. </p><h2>  Edge nature </h2><p>  A special pride of the Mari land is its natural wealth, beautiful dense forests, deep clear lakes.  The deepest <span>karst lake</span> is Zryv.  Its depth in some places reaches 56 meters.  Another lake formed at the site of a failure in the earth's crust is the Sea Eye.  The history of this lake is shrouded in many legends and traditions.  It got its name not by accident: if you look from afar or from a bird's eye view, then in shape it resembles the human eye, and tall spruce trees growing around it are thick eyelashes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arbitration Court of the Republic of Mari-El" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/590395.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The wealth of not only the republic, but of the whole of Russia is Lake Tabashinsky.  Its depth reaches 55 meters.  The water in the lake is clean, running, rich in minerals and is healing.  In the depths of the lake, pike, crucian carp, bream, burbot and roach live.  In the mid-70s of the 20th century, this lake was recognized as a natural monument. </p><p>  Another lake of extraordinary beauty is Tahir.  Over time, an island formed on its center, on which a dense green grove blossomed. </p><p>  Shunggaltan Lake has a special healing property.  The mud and water of this source contain a large amount of hydrogen sulfide. </p><p>  Not only the lakes fascinate the eyes of any person who has fallen into the Mari Territory.  There are also unusually clean rivers, for example, Ilen.  In summer, on it you can see a wide variety of birds that nest on its shores and hatch chicks.  Many springs flow into Ilen, so the water in it is cold and clean.  One of the streams is mineral, it is called the Green Key. </p><p>  Tourists should definitely go to the Mari Chodra National Reserve and Park.  These are specially protected places on the territory of which rare species of plants grow.  Forests and meadows here are not affected by human intervention, and therefore are especially beautiful. </p><h2>  The customs and customs of the local population </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Government of the Mari El Republic" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/590400.jpg" width="335"></div></h2><p>  The capital of the Republic of Mari-El and its other cities, despite the developed industry, continue to retain the local national flavor.  It should be noted that the Mari still support and cultivate their originality in modern conditions: they use the folk language, ethnic motifs sound on holidays, you can see dances in folk costumes.  The cafe serves national cuisine.  The indigenous population of the republic is friendly, knows how to value nature, life, and feel unity with the world. </p><p>  The abundance of cultures and endless natural wealth - this is what Russia can boast of.  The Republic of Mari El is a unique part of this large country.  There is no warm sea, but this is not an obstacle in order to spend an unforgettable vacation and enjoy the beauty of the surrounding nature. </p>
