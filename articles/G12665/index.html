The area has a long history and today is the cultural center of the village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yarmp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Day Celebration" class="if uuid-2257563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2257563.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Earlier this part of the city was called Ilyinskaya Square.  The urban development plan was implemented in the XVIII century.  The main attraction of Sovetskaya Square in Yaroslavl is the Church of Elijah the Prophet, listed by UNESCO.  The construction of the temple was the impetus for the construction of the square. </p><p>  And by 1777, Yaroslavl received the status of a provincial city and, accordingly, a development plan.  In accordance with the requirements of the document, instead of dead-end, winding and narrow streets, streets and avenues, wide and straight, should have appeared. </p><p>  It was then that the square became the center.  Fairs were held here on a regular basis (every third month of the year, from 5 to 20).  Everyone gathered, from peasants to merchants, they sold and bought everything, from dishes to domestic animals. </p><p>  Under the reign of Catherine II, public places and a palace for the governor were erected on the square.  But with the advent of Paul I, everything fell into decay and almost all the buildings were demolished, for a long time the area resembled a vacant lot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="russian-church.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of Elijah the Prophet" class="if uuid-2257554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2257554.jpg"></div><h2>  USSR period </h2><p>  The square and the temple suffered during the suppression of the uprising.  As soon as the Bolsheviks became in power, city power settled here and Ilyinskaya Square turned into Soviet Square in Yaroslavl. </p><p>  An interesting fact: it was here that the very first bust of Lenin appeared throughout the USSR, during his lifetime.  It happened in 1919, in November, there was a grand opening.  However, the bust was made of gypsum, of course, that in a short period of time the leader’s “head” began to lose shape, and after 3 years a new monument was erected.  It was a full-length sculpture, but again made of plaster, so everything ended the same way as with the bust. </p><p>  In the 70s, a decision was made to restore the previously lost three-story building, demolished during the reign of Paul I. But the plan was not implemented, since according to the found drawings it turned out to be too small to accommodate the CPSU regional committee.  Therefore, in 1981, a trapezoidal building was erected, where today the regional authorities are located. </p><p>  In the same years, the Mytny Market was demolished and they tried to destroy the chapel of Alexander Nevsky.  But through the efforts of local activists, the building remained in its place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="76.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New year's night" class="if uuid-2257557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2257557.jpg"></div><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Today, <span>Sovetskaya Square in</span> Yaroslavl is the venue for urban outdoor celebrations.  It is here that free concerts are held, the area is included in all excursion programs.  It is also a meeting place, both business and romantic, especially since the Provincial Garden adjoins the street. </p><p>  Tourists are taken to the church, but this has long been a museum, so you will have to pay entry fees and even photos.  But a visit to the temple is worth it - here is a magnificent decoration, with carved iconostases and frescoes dating from 1680-1681 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="openyar.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ice rink on the square" class="if uuid-2257555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2257555.jpg"></div><h2>  Recent Events </h2><p>  In anticipation of the New Year, an ice rink appeared on Sovetskaya Square in Yaroslavl.  He will work until March inclusive.  The skating rink is artificial, and this year the entertainment is paid.  Only on weekdays from 10:00 to 14:00 it will be possible to ride for free.
