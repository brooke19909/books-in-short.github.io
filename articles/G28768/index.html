At the same time, the device demonstrated the technological capabilities tangible for Coolpix representatives.  At the moment, "Nikon Coolpix L-820" is a balanced version of a simplified ultrasound, which has not so many competitors.  However, the optimization and enhancement of functionality could not do without negative shades. </p>

    <h2>  General camera information </h2><p>  The model is a compact camera equipped with a 16-megapixel sensor and 30x zoom.  In the manufacturer‚Äôs lineup, it replaced the L810 modification, which had the ability to zoom 26 times.  The matrix has also been updated - the CCD module has given way to the BSI-CMOS, which is equipped with the Nikon Culpix L-820 camera.  The price, however, has not changed much and amounts to only 8-9 thousand rubles.  Among the budget models of this class, this is a good offer. </p><p>  On the market, the camera is positioned as a variation of point-and-shot, but without PASM modes.  In general, many attractive functions and capabilities of the device, due to obvious optimization due to limited resources by price tags, do not manifest themselves in the best way in practice, which should be borne in mind.  A comprehensive review of the <span>Nikon Coolpix L820,</span> which is presented below, will help identify both the weaknesses and strengths of the Japanese camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Basic technical parameters make it possible to evaluate the working potential of the device, which, in particular, shows the separation of the Culpix line from established simple solutions.  How significant progress is, can be judged by the technical characteristics: </p><ul><li>  The number of pixels is 16.7 million. </li><li>  The sensitivity range is from 125 to 3200 ISO with the possibility of auto-correction. </li><li>  Camera resolution - maximum format 4608x3456. </li><li>  The crop factor of the device is 5.62. </li><li>  Focus - from 22.5 to 675 mm. </li><li>  30x zoom </li><li>  The number of optical components is 12. </li><li>  Video Recording - 1920 x 1080 HD and FullHD at 30 frames per second. </li><li>  Batteries - 4 AA batteries. </li><li>  The dimensions of the camera are 111x76x85 mm. </li><li>  Weight in a completed state - 470 g. </li></ul><p>  Outwardly, the capabilities of the model look more than acceptable for their segment, but it is worth considering that there is no question of a complete comparison with representatives of classes that support similar working properties.  It is enough to note the performance of the Nikon Culpix L-820 apparatus - the characteristic for the shooting speed is expressed at 2.1 frames per second, which is a modest result for modern ultrasounds.  Although burst shooting may pleasantly surprise you - 38 shots for the JPEG format. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Model design </h2><p>  The appearance of the camera does not stand out.  We used the traditional form factor for the ultrazoom, combined with a large pen and a large lens.  Unless the form turned out even more aggressive and brutal, which is facilitated by the zoom lever.  As for the materials, then on this part, too, everything is predictable.  Again, as part of the optimization, the designers could not go beyond black inexpensive plastic, although in terms of color everything is not so sad - versions in red, blue and purple are also available.  Another thing is that the quality of the plastic shade does not change.  Although it is impossible to put it in the negative - the build quality itself is not satisfactory, there are no backlashes and no creaking is observed.  But the Nikon Coolpix L-820 gets dirty very willingly.  The creators nevertheless overdid it with savings, depriving the most easily soiled sections of alternative materials and coatings.  The impractical and almost half-kilogram mass of the device, the increase of which was facilitated by the integration of a group of four AA-batteries. </p><h2>  Technological features </h2><p>  The base of the camera is a 30x Nikkor zoom lens.  In addition to the basic performance characteristics, compared to the previous zoom, this component was added in bright colors.  But its main features lie in the possibilities of a hyperzoom, which was distinguished by less pronounced chromatic aberrations, an improved optical system, and high sharpness indices at the edges of the image. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Got a design and a dual stabilization system formed by electronic and optical correctors.  The first implements stabilization due to high values ‚Äã‚Äãof photosensitivity, and the second - according to the classical scheme due to the dynamic lens in the lens.  But these are not all the significant improvements that the Nikon Coolpix L820 received.  Features of the model are also reflected in sensory functions.  These include the ability to recognize camera vibration and motion in the frame.  It is also worth noting the above-mentioned serial shooting of 38 frames.  This option was implemented precisely in the framework of the task of sharpening images.  From the captured array, the system automatically selects the frame with the sharpest image.  By the way, the manufacturer especially recommends using this shooting mode when the charge is running out, and there is no time for lengthy experiments with the settings. </p>

    <h2>  Functional </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth noting that the device received a full set of shooting modes that were used in other representatives of the Culpix family.  Among them, one can single out macro photography, subject shooting, face focusing, etc. The exposure provides a wide exposure range, however, manual settings lovers will have to get used to the automation by this parameter.  There are several exposure measurements, including spot, center-weighted and multi-zone.  Among the modern functions, it is also worth highlighting 3D shooting, white balance adjustment, a built-in flash with a radius of 6 m, as well as red-eye reduction. </p><p>  At the same time, there remained a wide range of popular options that Nikon Coolpix L-820 never received.  For example, in the video mode, there is no viewfinder, although manufacturers who rely on stabilization and zoom often provide this opportunity.  As for communication, it corresponds to the modern level.  There are audio and video outputs, USB, as well as an HDMI port.  By the way, those who are counting on large volumes of materials should take care in advance of SD, SDXC or SDHC cards of the right size.  The fact is that the main memory of the model is only 65 MB. </p><h2>  Ergonomics workflow </h2><p>  In case you need to bring the device into combat readiness as quickly as possible, you need to remember that it will take about 3 seconds.  A problem may occur if a lens cap is currently installed on the lens.  The design provides for the possibility of resetting the protective accessory, but for fidelity it is recommended to remove it yourself, without losing the cover without fear - it is attached to a special rope.  Then, for convenience, the device should be tilted and turned on a little.  Switching between modes is carried out at the program level - another consequence of the rejection of mechanical ‚Äútwists‚Äù.  Change the mode allows the SCENE button. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it could not do without hardware controls.  These are the buttons for deleting photos, entering the viewing mode and calling up the menu.  A small joystick with a confirmation button is also provided.  By and large, the remaining elements are not required.  Also, before going to the session, it should be noted that the Nikon Culpix L-820 camera works only with finger batteries.  Experienced users recommend using items as large as possible.  For example, a volume of 2700 mAh is enough for an average of 500 shots. </p>

    <h2>  Machine Menu </h2><p>  This part already traces the features of previous versions of Culpix, which were developed with emphasis on simple and clear menus.  Although a considerable part of users are repelled by excessive simplicity, this concerns structuring with pictograms and a large monochrome font.  On the other hand, fans of the brand trace in this an original style, reminiscent of the implementation of mirrorless cameras of the same manufacturer. </p><p>  Through the menu, the operator gets access to all the tools for the initial setup and post-processing of materials shot with the Nikon Culpix L-820 camera.  The manual also notes the benefit of automatic settings - in particular, the white balance can work regardless of the current shooting format, making corrections depending on the lighting.  As for further editorial processing, in this regard the set of tools is not rich - the main program is D-Lighting and the crop function. </p><h2>  Video shooting </h2><p>  In the main mode, the camera supports shooting HD-clips, but if you wish, you can turn on FullHD, which also activates stereo sound with a zoom function.  The advantages of implementing video management include a special button that starts the process.  The features of this mode in the apparatus "Nikon Culpix L-820" include a good zoom, which is softer than in the process of taking photos.  The frequency is 30 frames per second, but if necessary, it can be raised to 240 frames per second.  To do this, you have to turn off the sound recording and set the minimum resolution.  In this way, an 8-fold deceleration can be achieved. </p>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The model was conceived as a transitional camera between practical, low-power and medium-functional cameras and modern ultrasounds with all the necessary tools.  As a result, the model is praised for its successfully implemented ergonomics, high-quality display, versatility in terms of operation and the presence of a macro mode, which turned out to be worthy precisely thanks to the zoom of the Nikon Culpix L-820 lens. </p><p>  Reviews about the design and design are not so impressive, but they can not be attributed to the negative.  On the one hand, the camera turned out to be massive and heavy, but on the other hand, physical manipulations in the process do not suffer from this.  In any case, you can get used to the body shapes and controls. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting right away with a review of the same design, but with different ratings.  The performance of the case is criticized for reasons of soiled and general impracticality.  And this applies not only to plastic, but also to the display, which is even more noticeable.  Users indicate the low power processor, which is equipped with a camera "Nikon Culpix L-820".  Reviews, in particular, connect its low potential with a long start and a modest speed of taking a picture. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The example of this camera proves once again that attempts to transfer individual successful models from initial segments to at least the middle class do not fundamentally change the product.  Especially if the developers also try to preserve the price niche of the model.  By increasing or adding individual functions and characteristics, the creators deprive cameras of other qualities. </p><p>  In this case, overload is observed as an optional option at the expense of practicality, as evidenced by the <span>reviews (Nikon Coolpix L820).</span>  Prices of 8-9 thousand, of course, save the situation, but do not solve the problem of blurry positioning.  At a minimum, in terms of its capabilities, the model can belong to the segment of budgetary household cameras.  But then she will lose in convenience to lightweight solutions with impeccable ergonomics.  And on the contrary, the middle segment will not be accepted by the device due to the functionality and performance not reaching the required values. </p>
