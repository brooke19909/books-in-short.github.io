    <h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Russia is beautiful and rich: the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug is a black pearl of the northern part of our country.  And it occupies no less than 770 thousand square kilometers of the West Siberian Plain.  The district includes: Gydan <span>Peninsula, Taz Peninsula</span> and, of course, the Yamal Peninsula.  Most of the district is located beyond the Arctic Circle.  From the north, the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug is washed by the <span>Kara Sea,</span> from the south it adjoins the Khanty-Mansiysk Okrug, its eastern neighbors are the Taimyr and Evenki Autonomous Okrug, and from the west it borders on the Arkhangelsk Region and the Republic of Komi.  The relief of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area can be divided into plain and mountainous.  All three peninsulas are dotted with small rivers, hollows, ravines and swamps.  The mountain range stretches for two hundred kilometers with a narrow strip along the Polar Urals.  The climate of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug is sharply continental, severe, divided into three zones: the northern strip of the West Siberian lowland, subarctic and arctic.  A population of approximately 500 thousand people with a density of less than one person per square kilometer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Flora </h2><p>  The vegetation cover in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug has pronounced latitudinal zonality.  Five landscape zones can be distinguished: northern taiga, forest-tundra, shrubby, moss-lichen and Arctic tundra.  In the northernmost, Arctic strip, vegetation is very sparse.  Here you can find only mosses, lichens and sedge.  Small bushes and forbs already grow in the moss-lichen tundra.  In the next zone (shrub tundra) dwarf birches and willows grow, along the rivers - berries and mushrooms.  There are many swamps and small rivers in the forest-tundra.  Dwarf birch trees, larch trees and small spruce trees grow here.  In the southernmost zone of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug - taiga, many lakes, swamps, rivers.  The whole territory is covered with dense light and dark coniferous forests. </p>

    <h2>  Fauna </h2><p>  If the flora of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug is scarce enough, then the animal world is rich and diverse.  In five climatic zones of the district, thirty-eight species of mammals live.  Most of all there are predators and rodents - fourteen species each.  Five names of pinnipeds, three - insectivores, two - ungulates.  Twenty species of fur animals have an important commercial value. </p><h2>  Natural resources </h2><p>  The Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (the capital Salekhard) is famous for its hydrocarbon reserves.  About 78% of the total reserves of Russian oil and gas are concentrated here.  Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District is the largest hydrocarbon resource base in the world.  Development of valuable raw materials is being carried out at the Nakhodkinskoye and Urengoyskoye gas, Yety-Purovskoye, Yuzhno-Russkoye, and Yamburgskoye oil fields.  About 8% of the total production of ‚Äúblack‚Äù and about 80% of ‚Äúblue gold‚Äù are mined annually in YaNAO.  In the <span>Polar Urals</span> , chromium, molybdenum, tin, iron, lead, phosphate rock, barite and other minerals are mined. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gupkinsky Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/667401.jpg" width="600"></div>

But the true indigenous people are the Khanty, Nenets, Selkups and Komi-Izhemtsy who have lived in this territory since time immemorial.  The rest settled only in the second half of the twentieth century.  This is due to the development in the era of the Soviet Union of the territories of the Far North. </p><p>  Khanty: from ancient times this people lived in the territories of the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs.  The culture, language and customs of this people are very heterogeneous.  This is due to the fact that the Khanty settled on a rather vast territory and therefore became somewhat scattered. </p><p>  The Nenets inhabit a vast territory of Russia - from <span>the Taimyr Peninsula</span> to the coast of the Arctic Ocean.  These people migrated from South Siberia in the first millennium AD.  It belongs to the Samoyed group. </p><p>  It is known that <span>the Komi people have been</span> living in this territory since the 1st millennium BC.  This people is divided into northern and southern Komi.  The first from time immemorial were engaged in reindeer husbandry, fishing and hunting.  The second were hunters and fishermen. </p><p>  Selkups are the most numerous people of the North.  Selkups were traditionally engaged in fishing and hunting.  Those representatives of the people who lived at higher latitudes still bred deer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/667467.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <h2>  Administrative center </h2><p>  The capital of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District is Salekhard.  It is located on the banks of the Ob (on the right side).  The city is located on the Arctic Circle (the only one in the world).  The population is about 40 thousand people.  The city was founded in 1595.  At first it was a small prison named Obdorsky.  Half a century after the founding, permanent residents appear here.  Since 1923, the village of Obdorsk becomes the center of the Obdorsk district of the Ural region.  And already in 1930, the village was given the status of the administrative center of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug.  Three years later, Obdorsk was renamed Salekhard.  Nowadays, the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, the capital of the AO in particular, is developing quite rapidly.  There are many enterprises in the city: Yamalzoloto, a river port, a fish canning factory, Yamalflot and others.  The Yamal-Nenets District Museum and Exhibition Complex, which has an exhibition center, a local history museum and a scientific library, is open in the city.  Also in Salekhard is the District House of Crafts - the state budgetary institution of culture of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug.  In the capital of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District there are many branches of various universities.  It should be noted that the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (the capital Salekhard) is experiencing big problems with access to the Internet.  The fact is that in the region there is still no fiber optic network. </p><h2>  Cities and areas of the Yamal-Nenets okrug </h2><p>  The Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District has seven districts, eight cities, five <span>urban-type settlements,</span> and forty-one rural administrations.  The areas of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area: Yamal, Shuryshkarsky, Tazovsky, Purovsky, Priuralsky, Nadymsky and Krasnoselkupsky.  As mentioned above, population density is very low.  Despite the vast territory, very few cities have the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District.  Cities: Noyabrsk (97 thousand), Novy Urengoy (89.8 thousand), Nadym (45.2 thousand), Muravlenko (36.4 thousand), Salekhard (32.9 thousand), Labytnangi (26, 7 thousand), Gubkinsky (21.1 thousand inhabitants).
