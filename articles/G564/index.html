    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The name of the <span>island of Goa</span> comes from the word Govarashtra, which is translated from Sanskrit as "shepherd‚Äôs country."  Here on the beaches you can meet peacefully grazing cows.  This is the calling card of the island. </p><p>  As you understand, we are talking about South Goa, but in the northern part - incredible energy, the spirit of freedom, the opportunity to find and understand yourself.  Of course, at first glance, unsanitary conditions, licentious morals and poverty of the local population reign here, however, even staying in 2- or 3-star hotels, for example in Hidden Paradise Mandrem 3 *, you will not feel this at all. </p><p>  Both the internal structure and the quality of services are fully consistent with international standards.  The administrative center of the northern part of Goa is the resort Mapusa (Mapusa). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hidden Paradise Mandrem 3 *" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1491321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As already noted, from the hotel to the beach about 400 meters.  This is a public area, entrance to which is free for all, without exception, but umbrellas, deck chairs and other beach equipment are provided for a fee.  Here you can rent a scooter, sign up for diving courses and take an underwater trip.  Play beach volleyball. </p><h2>  Hidden Paradise 3 Hotel: traveler reviews and ratings </h2><p>  Most vacationers, commenting on their stay in this hotel, write that it is consistent with its description, and here you can find the ideal value for money.  However, there are a few comments that are found in almost all reviews. </p><p>  So, for example, the water in the pool, despite the heat, can be cold, because for lack of powerful filters it is changed daily.  On the one hand, this is a plus, but swimming in cold water is dangerous to health.  In addition, sunbeds by the pool without umbrellas.  And this means that tourists have nowhere to hide from the hot sun. </p><p>  In the evenings, there is absolutely nothing to do.  Of course, you can go somewhere, but those tourists who prefer to relax in the small but green area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel will soon begin to get bored.  As for the service, cleaning is done on request, or, if you leave the key at the reception, the maids will definitely dust, take out the garbage, etc. </p><p>  Some tourists complain about the hotel staff.  He is in no hurry to help tourists if something happened.  Apparently, due to lack of knowledge of foreign languages, employees simply do not understand what is required of them, therefore, they do not react, which is regarded by tourists as disrespect. </p>
