    <h2>  Instruction manual </h2><p>  Acquaintance with the user manual is the first thing that is strongly recommended to do at the beginning of work with the "Minelab X-Terra 705" reviews.  The instruction gives comprehensive information about the principles of the metal detector, the order of its assembly and the control keys.  It provides information on the use and adjustment of the discrimination scale, on methods for determining the exact position of the target, adjusting the sensitivity of the device, ways to tune out interference, the procedure for setting the threshold tone, volume, sound frequency and ground balance.  Read should be applied in specific conditions, to understand how each setting affects the search results, and to find out what needs to be done to achieve maximum efficiency. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Innovative technology </h2><p>  What are the most impressive features of the Minelab X-Terra 705?  Owner reviews suggest that V-Flex technology, thanks to the preliminary amplification of the detected signal, has significantly reduced the number of false positives from interference induced on the cable connecting the coil to the control panel. </p><p>  V-Flex technology is a hallmark of the metal detector.  Reviews about the “Minelab X-Terra 705” speak of the ease with which you can change the frequency of the detector by replacing its coil.  Minelab offers several large, medium and small coils, which eliminates the need to buy any other metal detector.  The balance of the earth is much better than that of its predecessors 705, which facilitates its use even when working in areas with a high content of minerals.  As a result, searchers were able to find objects that previous models could not detect, and work in conditions when most detectors of other brands are powerless.  But best characterized by the "Minelab X-Terra 705" reviews.  The manufacturer, according to the owners, provided accurate digital coil calibration, frequency adjustment and constant soil monitoring, which allows to achieve high performance in a wide range of types of search targets and soil conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Battery Status </h2><p>  Users recommend first of all to make sure that the batteries are able to provide a sufficient duration of the device.  The metal detector is powered by four AA-type batteries 1.2–1.5 V. The indicator does not accurately reflect the initial charge level.  Owners are advised to let the device work for several minutes, and only then check the readings - so they will be much more accurate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Noise Cancellation </h2><p>  The metal detector has five channels, between which you can switch both in manual and automatic mode.  Users recommend using the latter option, since the device is much more accurate in setting a level of interference sufficient for operation than a person.  In this case, the coil should be in a working horizontal position and away from metal objects. </p>

    <h2>  Threshold tone </h2><p>  The threshold tone level is adjustable from -5 to 25. This setting is very important and depends on the user's hearing and ambient noise.  Owners recommend setting the tone level until a barely audible sound is reached.  Sounding too loud will distract and prevent weak signals from breaking the threshold.  Too quiet will lead to the same result. </p><h2>  Tracking mode </h2><p>  In this mode, the soil balance is constantly adjusted to changes in soil composition.  This means that you do not need to install it before you start working with the metal detector, since the adjustment will occur automatically after several strokes of the metal detector.  After that, you can either remember the current value of the parameter by pressing the tracking key again, or continue to work in the current mode.  It must be remembered that several passes over the target may result in blocking signals from it, and not from the ground.  Therefore, it is recommended to exit this mode after signaling the detection of a target. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tracking ground balance </h2><p>  Many experienced metal hunters prefer to use detectors with a slightly offset ground balance.  Previously, they could not do this automatically.  But with the Ground Balance tracking function, users can now automatically adjust sensitivity in the range from + 15 to -15, which made it possible to use the detector on soils with which difficulties had previously arisen. </p>

    <h2>  Pinpoint </h2><p>  Pinpoint mode allows you to set the size of the target by adjusting the sensitivity and exploring the area around the target.  You can also use this function to manually control the detection mode. </p><h2>  Beach ground balance </h2><p>  This feature improves the accuracy of the detector while hunting on the beaches.  This helps improve soil balance in areas with high levels of minerals and perfectly filters signals from almost non-magnetic materials. </p><h2>  Five presets </h2><p>  The detector comes with five predefined templates. </p><ul><li>  Scheme 1 can be used to search for non-ferrous metals such as precious metals, silver and gold. </li><li>  Scheme 2 is designed to reject materials such as foil and to determine non-ferrous metals. </li><li>  Scheme 3 is used to receive signals from small iron-based objects and is generally recommended for searching for relics. </li><li>  Scheme 4 discriminates against most ferrous metals. </li><li>  Scheme 5 allows you to search for any metals and their combinations. </li></ul><p>  The five arrows on the right side of the screen display the detection depth of the Minelab X-Terra 705 metal detector. Owner reviews suggest that although the indicator can indicate a maximum depth of 25 cm, which is 0-5 cm per arrow, the device confidently detects targets located deeper.  Users report finds at a depth of 0.5 m and deeper.  There are many factors that determine the detection depth of the Minelab X-Terra 705. Owner reviews call such parameters as the distance between the ground and the coil, the signal frequency, the degree of mineralization of the soil, the size of the detected object and the presence of metal debris. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  LCD screen "Minelab X-Terra 705" reviews of the owners are called bright and easy to read.  In addition, it is equipped with a backlight, which allows you to continue searching even after sunset.  Coin and treasure detection modes, as well as exploration are the two main modes of the X-Terra 705, which can be used to search for relics, jewelry, old and new coins.  The metal detector rejects signals from targets such as bottle caps and tongues from aluminum cans.  It can be used on beaches and parks. </p><h2>  Two precise positioning modes </h2><p>  The device has 2 modes of positioning finds - setting size and automatic.  If the automatic mode can be found in many detectors, then the exact location is unique and provides useful information about the characteristics of the target, including its size and shape, accompanied by a graphical display and a variable tone. </p><p>  Detuning from interference provides excellent response speed where there is a large amount of debris under the surface of the earth. </p><p>  Iron discrimination masks regulate the filtering of signals from iron objects, so users have the ability to detect targets, even if they are located close to debris. </p><p>  The 28-segment discrimination scale (4 for ferrous and 24 for non-ferrous metals) indicates the iron content and conductivity levels.  The numerical identifier range is from -8 to +48 steps.  A large number of target segments makes it possible to better detect small differences in the composition, as well as to increase the accuracy of determining the goal that the user wants to reject or detect. </p>
