How to sew a tunic without a pattern?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The tunic is a very fashionable, beautiful and comfortable piece of clothing, the suitable version of which is sometimes not possible to find.  And then the creative young ladies decide to independently implement their idea.  However, without detailed instructions, only a few can cope with the task.  Therefore, in this article we will talk about how to build a tunic pattern and sew a thing with your own hands. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic pattern for full" class="if uuid-2981824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981824.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced needlewomen often share tips with novice craftsmen.  They note that at first you should not sew various things from very thin, loose and crumbling fabrics.  That's because it needs to be processed using overlock or other tools that a beginner does not always have. </p><p>  It is best to draw a tunic pattern on knitted, cotton or linen fabric.  In this case, you can choose absolutely any color, there are no strict recommendations regarding this nuance.  And it is also worth noting that the embodiment of the conceived product requires scissors, a piece of chalk, a long ruler, special pins, a measuring tape, a piece of paper, a simple pencil, a needle with a thread and a sewing machine. </p><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  To build the correct pattern of the tunic, it is extremely important to correctly measure the model that will wear the finished product.  To do this, take a centimeter tape, pencil and paper.  We ask a beautiful lady to undress to underwear.  Then we proceed to measure the following parameters: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  girth of the chest or hips (choose the highest value); </li><li>  length of the product; </li><li>  armhole start point; </li><li>  neck circumference (measured at the base); </li><li>  sleeve length if available. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="mccallpattern.mccall.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic quickly without a pattern" class="if uuid-2981828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981828.jpg"></div><h2>  Sketch image </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen give beginners this advice: before you begin to build a tunic pattern, you should outline the model on a piece of paper.  At the same time, the desired wardrobe item does not need to be drawn in full size.  Our task is to prepare a scheme according to which we will be guided.  Therefore, we draw our idea.  If desired, we arrange it with colored pencils, pens or felt-tip pens. </p><p>  After we add 2-2.5 centimeters to the previously taken parameters - allowances for seams.  And also adjust the size of your ideas.  After all, the tunic is conceived as a loose straight dress of short length.  However, remember that if we increase the width of the main canvas, we reduce the length of the sleeves.  Otherwise, you can create an outfit resembling a <span>costume of Pierrot.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach tunic pattern" class="if uuid-2981825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981825.jpg"></div><h2>  The main part is the construction of the pattern </h2><p>  It is not difficult to cut and sew a tunic with your own hands.  To do this, we offer detailed and step-by-step instructions.  It begins with the construction of a pattern of the conceived product: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  We take a piece of fabric suitable for the desired size. </li><li>  Fold in half, forming a rectangle that you want to spread out on a smooth smooth surface and fasten with pins.  So that in the process of work the material does not slip and does not stray. </li><li>  First of all, we postpone the length of the product, just outline the upper and lower points. </li><li>  After we mark half the circumference of the chest or hips.  We also do this using dots. </li><li>  Connect the dots by drawing a rectangle of the desired size. </li><li>  We measure the distance from the lower edge to the armpit.  And on both sides we mark the beginning point of the armhole. </li><li>  Exactly in the middle of the upper side of the rectangle, mark a distance equal to 1/2 of the neck circumference.  This is the gate. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern building" class="if uuid-2983224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2983224.jpg"></div><h2>  Sleeves - pattern construction </h2><p>  On the pattern of the main part, we measure the depth of the armhole - from the shoulder to the armpit, multiply by two and postpone the width of the sleeve.  Next, note the length.  And finally, we connect the intended points, drawing a figure of the desired size. </p><p>  Having carried out simple manipulations, we are finishing the construction of a pattern of a beach tunic, home or front-day.  Then we cut out the product and assemble it, leaving holes for the hands and head, which then need to be framed with a satin ribbon to hide the ugly edge. </p><h2>  Tunic without a pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic pattern" class="if uuid-2981817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981817.jpg"></div><p>  You can quickly and easily make a different version of the tunic.  It will take the young lady no more than half an hour.  So that the reader does not get confused in the actions, we offer a detailed master class: </p><ol><li>  The first thing we buy is material.  To do this, you need to calculate in advance the dimensions of the required canvas.  The length is known and so, because we previously measured it.  And in order to calculate the width, we turn to mathematics.  Multiply the length of the sleeves by two and add half the circumference of the hips or chest.  We take into account seam allowances.  As a result, we find out the width of one part of the conceived product - the front or back.  Both parts should fit on a piece of fabric.  Therefore, we acquire material, given this important nuance. </li><li>  After that, we come home and, just as in the previous instruction, fold a piece of fabric in half. </li><li>  To prevent it from moving, we fix it with pins. </li><li>  Now we take a ruler, chalk and measure from the bottom edge the beginning point of the armhole.  From her in each direction the length of the sleeves. </li><li>  Using a needle and thread, we connect the front and back stitches with a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù seam.  We‚Äôre not trying too hard, we just need to fix the material. </li><li>  Next, we flash the fabric on the machine and remove the auxiliary thread. </li><li>  Finally, we decorate the finished product at our own request. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="simple pattern" class="if uuid-2983288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2983288.jpg"></div><p>  It is very important to note that this simple pattern of a tunic for full young ladies will be especially relevant.  And all because it allows you to perfectly mask any imperfections and extra pounds due to side frills.  However, experienced needlewomen and leading stylists recommend choosing material with a floral or geometric print for the planned wardrobe item.  Plain fabrics are best left for another product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tunic pattern" class="if uuid-2981820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981820.jpg"></div><p>  We hope that we were able to convince the reader that it is very simple to realize our idea.  The main thing is not to be afraid to explore new horizons. </p>
