In order to get fluff, the goat is not sheared, but combed out with a special brush.  Thus, thin and delicate hairs are obtained, which are much thinner and weightless compared to wool.  Fluff allows you to bind light products that will not prick.  This technology appeared in mass production when yarn manufacturers compared fluff and wool and came to the conclusion that fluff has many advantages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Yarn specifications </h2><p>  The yarn is made from natural goat down.  Spinning is carried out on industrial equipment so that the thread is the same throughout its thickness and even.  Sometimes in the markets you can find skeins of yarn that have been manually twisted.  This is now very rare, because the range and availability allows you to buy it without any problems. </p>

    <p>  There are reviews that the ordered goat down yarn turned out to be sticky and tough.  Unfortunately, no one is safe from a fake.  When buying, it is worth considering that it can not be cheap.  It is better to purchase it from manufacturers from factories. </p><p>  Very many craftswomen note in reviews of some difficulties that arose during the first experience of knitting.  They say that the thread is difficult to catch and fix in one place.  Experienced craftsmen recommend getting used to the peculiarities of this material a little and knitting any simple product with the front surface for a start.  After the hands get used to constantly holding the thread in the right tension, the pattern will turn out. </p>
