However, the affordable version of acoustics may sound great, but for this you need to pay great attention to the issue of choice. </p><p>  Experts say that the best option for speakers for music lovers are those that start to cost from $ 100.  But in this case, it is necessary to take into account some of the nuances of choice. </p><p>  <strong>What do we want from acquired acoustics.</strong> </p><p>  When deciding on the choice of speakers, you must clearly determine why acoustics are necessary in your home.  This is the main component, which in the future will determine the choice of the format and size of the system.  Of course, the price of the speaker system depends on this. </p><p>  <strong>Power</strong> </p><p>  In order to determine the power of the system, it is necessary to know that if the power is not large or not enough, then in this case the volume on both the amplifier and the speaker will suffer.  However, the power of the amplifier should not exceed the total power of the acoustics.  This indicator can damage the speakers.  Speaking specifically about the numbers, you need to approximately rely on the following parameters.  A room of 17 square meters will cost acoustics with a power of 60-80 watts.  If the size of the room exceeds 20-30 square meters, the power is 100 watts, 30 meters - 150 watts. </p><p>  <strong>System sensitivity.</strong> </p><p>  This indicator is able to affect the volume of the resulting sound.  In particular, the greater the sensitivity, the more loud the sound will be at the output.  Those.  you can use acoustics with high sensitivity, but do not have too much speaker power and vice versa.  The sound will be great. </p><p>  <strong>Playable frequency range.</strong> </p><p>  In simple terms, this indicator denotes the frequency range, the limits of which allow </p><p>  <strong>System enclosure</strong> . </p><p>  Despite the fact that this characteristic may seem too simple for many, it should not be treated in this way.  It is worth knowing that the case can be of several types.  This enclosure is closed, with a sound labyrinth, as well as a bass reflex.  The simplest are enclosures of a closed type.  This case has some advantages, in particular, they can significantly improve the transient characteristics of the speaker system.  However, the closed space is not the best way to act on the transmission of low frequencies, since they significantly increase the frequency of the lower resonance.  Modern speakers are preferable in their design have a housing with a bass reflex. </p><p>  <strong>Type of acoustics.</strong> </p><p>  Next6, choosing a speaker system.  It is worth choosing the type of acoustics itself.  Those.  what it is: shelf or floor.  Choosing floor acoustics, it is worth noting the fact that you have the opportunity not only to install it efficiently on the floor, but also thereby increase the power and depth of the bass.  Everything happens due to the fact that this type has a large case. </p><p>  <strong>The activity and passivity of the speaker system.</strong> </p><p>  There is also an active and passive type system.  The active system has speakers in which it is possible to adjust the volume.  However, passive acoustics require that an external amplifier work in tandem. </p><p>  System 5.1. </p><p>  Recently, more and more often you can meet those who prefer to purchase 5.1 acoustic kits.  In fact, this system is the main compromise for music.  But at the same time, such acoustics will allow you to get great pleasure from movies and games. </p><p>  In any case, if there is some doubt in favor of a particular system, contact a specialist for help. </p></div></article>
