The population of this city does not reach 50,000, and its total area is 50 square kilometers.  Today we will be transported here in order to discuss one popular hotel called the Gostiny Dvor.  Let's start our review now! </p><h2>  basic information </h2><p>  As you know, there are very few diverse hotels and other similar institutions, so today we will discuss the most popular hotel, which has positive reviews and a good rating.  This establishment was opened in 2002, and today the Gostiny Dvor Hotel in Megion includes 30 comfortable rooms, as well as a billiard room, a sauna, a chic restaurant and an excellent pool.  This hotel is located on the outskirts of the city, which is a definite plus, because it is located quite far from all industrial enterprises operating in the city.  On the territory of this complex you will be able to unforgettably relax away from the bustle of the city, stay in silence, and just have a good few days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gostiny Dvor in Megion" class="if uuid-2738805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32994/2738805.jpg"></div><p>  But did you know that on the territory of this complex there is a small internal park where you can take a walk, both day and night.  In addition, a direct share of attention should be paid to the fact that the windows of the establishment overlook the beautiful bank of the river there called Mega.  This information is a very pleasant addition to your stay at this hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also worth mentioning that the Gostiny Dvor in Megion, the sauna of which will be discussed a bit later in this article, has rooms, each of which is equipped with a TV, telephones with international and long-distance communication, as well as a minibar.  In addition, high-speed Internet is functioning perfectly in all rooms, and this is done so that each guest of the project has the opportunity to communicate in a normal mode and work, if necessary.  At the same time, do not forget that you will be many kilometers from home! </p><p>  We will talk more about the rooms of the Gostiny Dvor Hotel in Megion a bit later, and right now let's find out what booking procedure exists here. </p><h2>  How to book a room? </h2><p>  The first step is to go to the official website and open the ‚ÄúBooking‚Äù tab, which is located second from the left.  By clicking on the ‚ÄúReservation‚Äù button, you find yourself in a separate menu where you need to enter your data: last name, first name, middle name.  You must also specify the date of arrival and date of departure, choose the class of the room: ‚ÄúSuite‚Äù, ‚ÄúDouble‚Äù, ‚ÄúSingle‚Äù, ‚ÄúQuadruple‚Äù, ‚ÄúJunior Suite‚Äù.  In addition, there you must indicate your telephone number so that the project administrator can contact you and clarify any information of interest to the hotel.  The next required field is the email address. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Gostiny Dvor&quot;" class="if uuid-2738803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32994/2738803.jpg"></div><p>  When you enter all this data, you will need to enter the characters that are shown in the picture.  This function is available on almost all sites, but it is necessary in order to receive applications exclusively from people, and not from robots.  After you fill out all the necessary data, you need to click on the "Submit" button.  If you filled out everything correctly, the next step is to get a message on the site page stating that the data has been sent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now you need to wait until the administrator of the ‚ÄúGostiny Dvor‚Äù in Megion contacts you, the sauna is simply amazing, or contact the project representative on contact phone numbers that are listed on the official website of the complex.  Agree, booking on the institution‚Äôs website is a fairly convenient service, right? </p><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  Earlier in the article, it was already mentioned that the Gostiny Dvor Hotel in Megion, whose address you will see later in this article, has exactly 30 rooms of different categories.  One of the most popular is the Lux class, the rooms of which are presented in snow-white tones.  This room consists of a bedroom, a living room, a bathroom and an entrance hall.

If you want to visit the sauna in the ‚ÄúGostiny Dvor‚Äù in Megion, the telephone numbers of this beautiful hotel can be found on its official website in the contacts section, which is the fifth on the left side. </p><p>  The project‚Äôs sauna is made exclusively of wood and stone, and its capacity is from 5 to 10 people.  In addition, here you will find a beautiful and comfortable relaxation room, as well as a small pool where you can plunge into the crystal clear water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pogostite.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sauna of the hotel &quot;Gostiny Dvor&quot;" class="if uuid-2738801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32994/2738801.jpg"></div><p>  The phone number of the sauna in Gostiny Dvor in Megion is indicated on the official website, so if you want to clarify any important information, go to the Internet resource in the section that we talked about a little earlier in this article. </p><p>  Thus, the sauna here is quite pleasant and interesting, so here you will definitely be able to relax well.

The lounge has a large Russian 12-foot table for billiards, which you can use without any difficulties.  Also in this room there are comfortable sofas where you can relax while playing. </p><p>  It is important to mention that an additional advantage is that in the billiard room there is access to the central balcony of the hotel, which offers a breathtaking view of the Mega River embankment.  This is where you can truly relax! </p><h2>  Contact Information </h2><p>  Do you want to visit the Gostiny Dvor hotel in Megion?  Then rather write down the address of this institution, because it is located in Megion on 1 Nefterazvedochnaya Street. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="61.0309345" data-lng="76.12219789999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/7/3/9/7739.png"></div><p>  It is important to remember that this complex has two telephone numbers and a fax, which you can see on the official website in the "Contact Us" section. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As for the reviews, not all of them are positive.  The average project rating varies from 2 to 3 stars out of 5, which confirms an acceptable rating.  In their comments on the Internet, people write about acceptable quality of service, the availability of additional services at low prices and good staff attitude. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pogostite.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Gostiny Dvor&quot; (Megion)" class="if uuid-2738802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32994/2738802.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, quite often in their reviews on the Internet people mention the cleanliness of rooms, their regular cleaning.  As for visiting the sauna, everything is also more or less normal there: there is order and cleanliness.  In general, in short, the reviews are very positive, but the average rating is low. </p><p>  Now you just have to choose whether you are ready to visit the Gostiny Dvor complex in Megion, which is one of the best in the city.  The choice is yours, because now you need to decide whether you are ready to spend the minimum amount of money in order to have a good rest in a hotel with two or three stars out of 5. Try to make the right choice and remember that Gostiny Dvor is waiting every day without breaks and days off! </p>
