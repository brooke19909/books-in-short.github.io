In ancient times, there was the city of Julfar, which was known as the largest point in the pearl trade.  This place is not very popular among tourists, but if they find themselves here, they fully appreciate the mild climate.  Because of this feature, the vegetation is rich here, and because of the abundance of greenery it seems that a person has fallen on a fabulous island. </p><h2>  Ajman </h2><p>  Ajman is the only emirate in which oil is not produced.  Single-masted Dow ships are produced here.  The territory of formation is small, the beaches are snow-white.  In addition, the area is rich in mineral springs, shopping malls and museums.  In the emirate, rest will be diverse. </p><h2>  Korfakkan </h2><p>  A very quiet and cozy place is considered this provincial town.  It became famous thanks to local fishing, diving, thickets of palm trees.  Strawberry plantations thrive in this area.  Flock to Korfakku fishermen from around the world.  The thing is that there is a lot of tuna, sea bass, even sharks swim here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In Korfakkan" class="if uuid-3145635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3145635.jpg"></div><p>  In the city itself there are few opportunities for entertainment.  But there is a picturesque Cornish park, in which the ruins of ancient buildings, sheltered by the water surface, are preserved.  In addition, the architecture of the Palace of the Ruler delights many tourists.  All this is complemented by a souvenir bazaar, colorful restaurants with delicious local dishes.  The quality of service remains consistently high in this emirate. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The disadvantage of this tourist destination is the high cost of everything in the country.  The beaches here are paid.  But for hotels of the Turkish level you will need to pay a higher price.  However, sometimes pleasant actions come across.  In addition, cheap hotels are mostly located away from the beach.  As a rule, you need to travel one to three kilometers to it.  At the same time, the metro does not go to the beach.  And to pay for even a cheap taxi every day is unprofitable.  The disadvantages of the country include the fact that the All Inclusive system, which the Russians loved so much, is not common here.  They do not like to search for a place to eat outside the hotel, and someone likes the consumption of alcoholic beverages without restriction.  According to this system, only a dozen hotels in the UAE operate, and far from always All Inclusive here means no limit on food and alcohol. </p><p>  In general, the country is not suitable for those who prefer to be ‚Äútipsy‚Äù.  Alcoholic beverages are sold in specialty stores.  And the appearance of even beer on the beach is prosecuted.  Drunk in public places is prohibited. </p><p>  Tourists drink alcohol in their rooms, which they usually bring with them.  The country has restrictions on the import of alcohol.  Both the plus and the minus of the country is its multinationality.  In just a couple of days in the UAE, you can try the cuisine of many peoples of the world, purchase all kinds of spices, speak many languages.  At the same time, many Russians fear carriers of other cultural traditions. </p><p>  Once upon a time, nomadic herders lived on the territory of the country, and for the most part, architectural sights are associated with their tombs.  They date back to 2500 BC.  The territory of the emirates used to be fertile, but then the climate changed dramatically and a desert formed.  Then local agriculture disappeared.  Finds of later times contain traces of caravans.  Islam came to this area in the 7th century. </p><p>  This cultural tradition is strong in this state, and it has an undeniable impact on holidays in the UAE.  This, according to reviews of tourists about holidays in the Emirates, it is worth remembering to everyone who is going to enter this country.  In order to get acquainted with all the local attractions, it takes months.  As a rule, tourists are only in a dozen of them, without having familiarized themselves with all the facets of the rich local culture.  The UAE is an exotic country where Russian tourists, judging by the reviews, are drawn to return again and again. </p>
