    <p>  It is not surprising that this is the option of cash investments chosen by many.  Because it makes it possible: </p><ul><li>  Receive income from deferred funds.  An accumulative deposit with the possibility of replenishment allows you to receive interest monthly on a card or by withdrawing at the end of the term. </li><li>  Also, the opening of a deposit, which can be replenished, gives a chance to collect the necessary amount for a large purchase, without holding funds at home or in your wallet. </li><li>  When opening a deposit agreement, which can be increased, it is possible to make contributions of a fixed amount or the amount that the owner of the deposit considers necessary.  This will help to put all the free money into work. </li><li>  Also, a replenished deposit will open the opportunity to raise money and improve your financial condition.  After all, a person who has deposits can afford to plan further life. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="funded deposits with the possibility of replenishment and withdrawal" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45125/1500691.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  What are the disadvantages of such savings </h2><p>  In general, deposits that can be increased in total have no drawbacks.  The only thing is, if you have made a bet on savings deposits with the possibility of replenishment and withdrawal, there is a temptation not to wait for the time when the necessary amount is collected.  Therefore, if there is a goal to set aside a certain amount of cash, it is better to open a bank instrument from which it is impossible to withdraw.  Here you need to look at the situation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Savings deposits in different banks </h2><p>  Of course, various financial institutions offer their conditions and interest rates on deposits.  Each of them also has a certain reputation.  It is up to the depositor to decide which bank to prefer. </p><p>  <em>Savings deposits with the possibility of replenishment in Sberbank</em> </p>

    <p>  This bank is the choice of many consumers of banking services.  Therefore, it is important to familiarize yourself with the deposits of this financial institution.  The conditions for varying deposits are identical to those voiced by other banks, namely: term, amount, interest payment, the possibility of replenishment or withdrawal partially or completely.  On average, depending on the selected conditions, a replenished deposit provides for the following interest rates: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  in Russian rubles - from 5 to 8.6%; </li><li>  in US dollars - from 0.01 to 1.16% </li><li>  in euros - from 0.01 to 0.19%. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the rates in different banks are approximately the same, so the most important thing is to choose the financial institution you trust. </p><h2>  Interest rates on savings deposits </h2><p>  In general, if you look at the statistics on banks, the accumulative deposit with the possibility of replenishment at the interest rate differs slightly.  An exception may be a financial institution like a <span>credit union</span> or a small private company.  Nevertheless, do not rush headlong to meet high stakes.  Such conditions, on the contrary, should arouse suspicion and doubt.  Why high stakes?  Maybe the bank urgently needs money or does it charge high fees for loan products?  If the second option, then you can post, and if the first, you need to think about whether it will be safe for your funds in this institution. </p><p>  This was information to think about.  In the average banking institutions that are popular among the population, interest rates are approximately: </p><ul><li>  in rubles - from 4.5 to 9%; </li><li>  in dollars - from 0.01 to 0.25%; </li><li>  in euros - from 0.01 to 1%. </li></ul><p>  The choice, of course, is yours.  And in order to choose the most profitable savings deposit with the possibility of replenishment, it is necessary to carefully study the conditions of all financial institutions in which you are ready to place funds. </p><h2>  How it works </h2>

    <p>  The working scheme of <span>replenished deposits is</span> quite simple and understandable even to inexperienced investors.  A certain amount of money is deposited to the deposit account, this initial interest rate will directly depend on this amount.  In such a deposit, it is possible to choose a fixed or unlimited number of monetary units that can be paid in a certain period.  By the way, it is very convenient to use remote access to the account in your own online account.  This will allow you to replenish the deposit, while there is no need to visit a banking institution.  Thus, you can save money, even while being far outside the city or country. </p><p>  Interest from the deposit can be received every month, immediately feeling the profit, or at the end of the term, so that the amount of funds earned is more significant.  You can also vary the balance in the deposit account, for example, if necessary, you can withdraw money, and if not useful, then deposit it back. </p><h2>  What alternatives are there to saving money </h2><p>  There are probably no worthy options that can replace the funded contribution with the possibility of replenishment.  It is unreasonable to keep money at home.  Firstly, it is dangerous, and there is a risk of theft, and secondly, this way the currency does not work.  Keeping your savings in a bank cell seems to be reliable.  Nevertheless, with this option, it‚Äôs not that there is no income, but also additional expenses that must be paid monthly or every year for a safe in a financial institution. </p><p>  Love your money, treat them wisely and thoughtfully, then all problems will be forgotten, a new, free life will begin. </p>
