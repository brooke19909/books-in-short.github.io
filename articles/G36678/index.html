But those who are just starting to use them may have difficulty.  Most popular among the population are cards of Sberbank PJSC, the largest credit card issuer in Russia.  The first thing that the owner of a new means of payment needs to know is how to insert a card into a Sberbank ATM. </p><h2>  How is a bank card arranged? </h2><p>  The card is a means of payment in a plastic medium.  It is compact and convenient, it takes up no more space in your wallet than a business card or a discount coupon in a store. </p><p>  The card has a front and back sides.  On the front side are: </p><ul><li>  The logo of the issuing bank, most often in the upper right corner. </li><li>  Surname and name of the owner, if the credit card is registered.  They are indicated by embossed text.  On cards of instant issuance, simply indicate the type - momentum card. </li><li>  Chip.  It protects the card from hacking and stores data.  It is a square with a metallized surface, located on the left side of the card. </li><li>  Validity.  The month and year of replacement of the card are indicated, for example, 03/2019. </li><li>  Card number.  16 or 18 digits. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="thecoolgadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to insert a card in an ATM of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2932757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932757.jpg"></div><p>  On the back of the card, a 3-digit code is indicated, which is used for payment in online stores.  It also contains information about the contacts of the bank (in the top in small print). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to insert a Sberbank card? </h2><p>  Bank customers, in addition to paying by card in stores, can use it at terminals and ATMs for transfers, loan repayments and cash withdrawals.  The first thing that the owner should remember is where to insert the credit card. </p><p>  There are 2 branches in the ATM and the terminal: for cash and a card.  Sometimes cash departments are divided into deposits and withdrawals, but there is always one bank card department. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which side to insert a Sberbank card into an ATM" class="if uuid-2932930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932930.jpg"></div><p>  At the Sberbank ATM, it is located on the right side.  Above it is a sticker with the inscription "Insert a card" or a picture that shows how to insert a card into a Sberbank ATM. </p><p>  It is not recommended to try to put a credit card in the cash compartment.  It will either get stuck or be swallowed by an ATM. </p><h2>  How to insert a card into an ATM of Sberbank: instructions for beginners </h2><p>  The client must remember that the terminals and ATMs have approximately the same device and appearance.  The only exception is the possibility of withdrawing cash: in terminals this cannot be done. </p><p>  The second important point when using a credit card is which side to insert the Sberbank card into the ATM.  All means of payment are inserted only with the front side, the chip forward.  This is important: if you try to insert the card in another way, it will remain in the terminal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="diepresse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to call if the ATM has eaten a Sberbank card" class="if uuid-2932932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932932.jpg"></div><p>  If the client doubts how to insert the card into the Sberbank ATM, he can see the instructions on the ATM: in most terminals there is a picture-tip for new owners. </p><p>  The client also has the right to receive free instructions for users at the bank, which spell out all the nuances of using the means of payment. </p><h2>  In what cases can a terminal ‚Äúswallow‚Äù a card? </h2><p>  Even with the correct use of the credit card, it is possible that the client cannot pull out his card after inserting it into the ATM.  If the card is inserted correctly, the device may malfunction. </p><p>  To reduce the risk of being left without a card and money, it is not recommended: </p><ul><li>  Insert it into the ATM with signs of malfunction.  This can be indicated by the inscription on the screen "Technical work is underway" (or its analogue in English), "blue" or "black" screens without a logo, advertising of Sberbank and other attributes. </li><li>  Pull the time after receiving cash.  After the client has received the money, he is given 40 seconds to get the credit card back.  Otherwise, she will remain at the ATM. </li></ul><h2>  What to do if the card remains inside? </h2><p>  Even those who know how to insert a card into an Sberbank ATM sometimes get into a situation where they are left without a means of payment.  The most common cause is a device malfunction without external signs of a technical malfunction.  In this case, it is urgent to block a credit card and issue a reissue of a new card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to insert a card in an ATM of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2932938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2932938.jpg"></div><p>  Where to call if the ATM has eaten a Sberbank card: </p><ul><li>  to number 900. </li><li>  or 8-800-555-555-0. </li></ul><p>  Both numbers are free bank hotlines.  The client can call there to block the card and issue its reissue without visiting the bank office.  When making a call, you must introduce yourself, give the address, passport details and code word (used in the application when making the payment instrument). </p><p>  Sberbank numbers are indicated on any of the self-service devices, advertising, or company website.  If the credit card was not ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù, and the client simply forgot the card at the Sberbank ATM, he should also call one of the numbers. </p><p>  Technical fault re-release is free.  If the card is lost, the client will have to pay a commission for making a new one in the amount of 30 or 150 rubles, depending on the type of credit card.  Production time for a new card is up to 14 days. </p>
