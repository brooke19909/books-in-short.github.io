This is the name of the currencies of several countries that were once colonies of Great Britain or Holland.  The currency of Mauritius is no exception.  It is useful for those who wish to visit this small island state to know the features of its currency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.le-voyage-autrement.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius Coast" class="if uuid-3243733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3243733.jpg"></div><h2>  Mauritius Currency History during the Colony Period </h2><p>  The state is young, therefore the ‚Äúbiography‚Äù of its currency is short.  The Mauritian rupee dates back to 1876.  It was then that 5, 10, and 50 rupee banknotes were issued.  A banknote of 1 rupee was put into circulation in 1919.  Since 1940 there was an additional issue of banknotes of 1 rupee and 25 and 50 cents.  Since 1954, banknotes of 25 and 1000 rupees were issued. </p><p>  In addition to the paper rupee of Mauritius, there were also coins.  They began to be used since 1877.  The face value was 1,2,5, 10 and 20 cents.  The smallest coins were minted from copper, and the larger ones were made from silver.  In the period from 1899 to 1911, only paper money was used.  Silver coins were returned later than copper ones in 1934.  Then put into circulation coins of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 rupee.  Since 1947, 10 copper-nickel cents were put into circulation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Currency History in the Independence Period </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius flag" class="if uuid-3243731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3243731.jpg"></div><p>  A bank in Mauritius appeared in 1967.  He began to perform the functions of the central bank of the country.  It is he who is engaged in the issue of coins and notes.  The first banknotes were printed in 1967.  Their denomination was 5, 10, 25 and 50 rupees.  On their obverse was depicted Elizabeth II, but the release dates were not indicated.  In 1987, the currency of Mauritius experienced another update, a new series of coins was prepared without a portrait of the monarch, since the island state became a republic in 1992. </p><p>  On the new coins was an image of the local politician Sivusagur Ramgulam.  Copper with steel, nickel-plated steel and copper with nickel began to be used for minting new coins.  Since then, 1 cent coins have become collectible; they are not found in circulation.  In 2007, the Bank of Mauritius celebrated its 40th anniversary, and on this occasion a coin of 20 rupees was put into circulation. </p><p>  In 1985 there was an issue of banknotes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 rupees. </p><p>  In 1998, a new issue of seven banknote denominations took place - 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000. They were printed in England and the text on the notes was in three languages ‚Äã‚Äã- English, Tamil and Sanskrit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.info-mauritius.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banknotes of Mauritius" class="if uuid-3243738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3243738.jpg"></div><h2>  Coins of Mauritius </h2><p>  What is the money in Mauritius today?  Of the coins, the most interesting for collectors is 20 rupees.  It is bimetallic.  The central part is made of an alloy of copper and nickel, and the ring around it is made of nickel and brass.  Its diameter is 28 mm and its weight is 10 grams.  On its front side is a portrait of Sivusagur Ramgulam, and on the back is the building of the Bank of Mauritius in Port Louis. </p><p>  Coins of 1 and 10 rupees have a weight of less - 7.5 and 5.8 grams, and 5 rupees - 12.5 grams.  Their diameter is from 26 to 31 mm.  Coins can be made from nickel-plated steel, or from an alloy of copper and nickel.  The front side contains an image of a politician, and the flip side is more diverse: </p><ul><li>  1 rupee is a coat of arms with palm trees, a key, a ship and a star. </li><li>  <span>5 rupees - two palm trees on the shore.</span> </li><li>  <span>10 rupees - collecting sugarcane (a traditional branch of the island's economy).</span> </li></ul><p>  In addition, commemorative coins of silver and gold of 10, 20, 25, 100 and 1000 rupees were issued.  Their weight is more than ordinary coins - from 17 to 38 grams, and diameter - from 31 to 44 mm.  Release time - from 1978 to 2001.  A jubilee coin of 25 rupees was issued in honor of the 10th anniversary of the island's independence.  20 rupees - on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the wedding of Elizabeth II, and 10 and 1000 - on the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Chamber of Commerce on the island.  100 rupees were issued in 2001 to mark the centenary of Mauritius visiting Mahatma Gandhi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vcoins.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins of Mauritius" class="if uuid-3243739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3243739.jpg"></div><h2>  Banknotes of Mauritius </h2><p>  On old banknotes of the late 1960s, on the front side there was always a portrait of young Elizabeth II, and on the reverse there are such images: </p><ul><li>  5 rupees - sailing boat on the background of the island. </li><li>  <span>10 rupees - Government House in Port Louis.</span> </li><li>  <span>25 rupees - carriage of reeds in a cart on the background of a beautiful landscape with a mountain.</span> </li><li>  <span>50 rupees - a ship in the harbor of Port Louis.</span> </li></ul><p>  In modern banknotes, the appearance is as follows: </p><ul><li>  25 rupees.  The obverse depicts a politician of Chinese descent Moiling Jin Ah-Chuen, who from 1967 to 1976 headed the cabinet of ministers.  On the reverse side is an image of the island of Rodriguez - it also belongs to the state of Mauritius. </li><li>  <span>50 rupees.</span>  <span>On the front side is Joseph Mauricius Paturau, who served as Minister of Commerce from 1962 to 1966.</span> </li><li>  <span>100 rupees.</span>  <span>The front side is decorated with a portrait of Renganaden Seenevassen, who served as Minister of Education, and the back shows the building of the Metropolitan Court.</span> </li><li>  <span>200 rupees.</span>  <span>The obverse depicts the Governor General and Minister of Housing (1967-1976) - Abdul Mohammed.</span>  <span>On the reverse is the Mauritius market.</span> </li><li>  <span>500 rupees.</span>  <span>The local politician Sukdeo Bisundoyal is depicted on the obverse, and the university building on the reverse.</span> </li><li>  <span>1000 rupees.</span>  <span>On the reverse - modern buildings on the island.</span>  <span>The obverse depicts Gaetan Duval, who was one of the founders of an independent state and led the Social Democratic Party.</span> </li><li>  <span>2000 rupees.</span>  <span>On the reverse is a sugarcane cart driven by an ox.</span>  <span>On the obverse is the aforementioned Sivusagur Ramgulam.</span> </li></ul><p>  To protect the authenticity of these banknotes, several symbols are used: a security thread, a metallized thread, a watermark in the form of an extinct dodo bird, which is a symbol of the island. </p><p>  Thus, the appearance of the currency of Mauritius allows you to learn more about the history of this small state, and its politicians, who are very little known. </p><h2>  Exchange rate for different currencies </h2><p>  One rupee of Mauritius is approximately 1.86 rubles, which is very convenient for tourists - you quickly get used to translating prices in stores and in markets.  As with other currencies, the rupee against the ruble sharply changed in 2014.  In 2013, it was about one to one, which roughly corresponded to the ratio of ruble and Thai baht.  The rupee to ruble exchange rate did not change from 1999 to 2013. </p><p>  However, you cannot exchange the ruble for the rupee directly on the island, so you need to remember the dollar or euro exchange rate.  These currencies are the most common on the planet, although when buying tickets at the airport there is a chance to meet the rupees of India, the RMB of the PRC and the South African rand. </p><p>  The Mauritian rupee exchange rate against the dollar is 34.5 to 1, which is reminiscent of the ruble against the euro in 2008. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pxhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ocean in Mauritius" class="if uuid-3243735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3243735.jpg"></div><h2>  Island Prices </h2><p>  What currency to take to Mauritius?  Best of all - dollars and euros, they are found everywhere, especially since there are many tourists from the EU countries on the island. </p><p>  Sightseeing tour of the island costs about 2500 rupees. </p><p>  The remaining prices in rupees are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Food in an inexpensive institution - 200. </li><li>  Lunch for two at the restaurant - 1200. </li><li>  Bottle of water - 25. </li><li>  A kilo of cheese on the market is 270. </li><li>  A kilo of apples, bananas or citrus fruits - 60. </li><li>  Traveling by public transport - 35. </li><li>  Liter of gasoline - 45. </li><li>  Cheap accommodation - 2000. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="pxhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach in Mauritius" class="if uuid-3243736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3243736.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Mauritius? </h2><p>  You can fly to the island from Madagascar, from South Africa, from Malaysia, as well as from Moscow with a transfer, for example, in Istanbul or Dubai.  A one-way ticket can actually be found for 28 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Despite its small size, on this island there are enough attractions both natural and historical and cultural.  The latter include: the oldest botanical garden in the southern hemisphere, the remains of Dutch settlements, British forts, colonial buildings, a museum of stamps, temples of various faiths.  You can swim and sunbathe year-round, but it should be remembered that the rainy season falls on the summer months. </p>
