It is located near the beautiful <span>corals of</span> Sharks Bay.  Sharm el-Sheikh Airport is not far from this hotel - only two kilometers.  And to Soho Square - the main entertainment center of the resort - a few steps.  The hotel is located extremely well - from every corner of its territory overlooks the bay, as well as the island of Tiran.  The beach at the hotel is sandy and loose with gravel, and the room catches Wi-Fi.  It is perfect for relaxing on the sea in every sense of the word, as evidenced by the reviews of tourists visiting it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dessole grand oasis resort" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/689876.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Naama Bay, Soho Square </h2><p>  This place is one of the iconic.  It is completely unlike other resort corners of Sharm El Sheikh.  Soho Square is completely European.  If the hotel is located next to it (such as the Dessole Grand Oasis Resort 4 Sharmelsheikh), then you can always go in evening dress not only to the hotel restaurant, but also take a walk outside the territory. </p><p>  Great cafes, delicious Movenpic ice cream.  True, prices are two to three times higher than in other places.  But here is a great place for a photo shoot or for walking with children during the day.  In the evenings, various shows and concerts take place on the local stages.  Live music plays every day, and sometimes you can get to the performance of real stars - both Russian and foreign.  And most importantly, why people visit Soho in the evenings - this is the famous colorful fountain show. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Three à la carte restaurants - Italian, Oriental and fish - can be eaten by appointment.  In this case, the ticket must be taken before half past ten in the morning, then there is the opportunity to get there on the same day.  These restaurants are closer to the sea, after the bustle of the buffet they offer a meal in silence and comfort. </p><p>  Tourists write that the food is good, tasty, it’s difficult to stay hungry.  The cook prepares the freshest omelettes for breakfast.  For lunch - fine meat rolls, beef.  From fruits - delicious guava and physalis.  Restaurants are also praised by appointment, especially fish (the best dishes are fish soup with cream) and oriental, where they make good grilled meat. </p><h2>  Sea holiday </h2><p>  Once this hotel was called Dessole Grand Oasis Resort 5 *.  Reviews of the hotel's beach suggest that despite the fact that one star was removed from it, the coast still deserves the "five".  The beach of the hotel is well equipped - there are umbrellas, sunbeds with mattresses, it is sandy, has an interesting shape - cascades.  This means that even if there are a lot of people, you can see the sea from any point, and not the heels or the head of a neighbor. </p><p>  Near the coast of the pontoon, near an excellent coral reef.  There are many marine inhabitants, even rare ones.  Here you can see Napoleon fish, stingray, moray eel.  At the same time, the beach is safe for feet - you can not take “coral” slippers.  In addition, the location of Sharks Bay is such that the sun rises here an hour earlier than in all Sharma, and sets later.  Therefore, there is an extra two hours to sunbathe.  On the territory there are two pools - one of them is heated, and you can swim in it at any time of the year.  A small pond for kids is also available. </p><h2>  Dessole Grand Oasis Resort 4 *: photo, reviews </h2>

    <p>  Sharm El Sheikh is famous for its beautiful resorts, and the Grand Oasis is one of them.  Rest at the hotel tourists call calm and quality.  As a rule, they are satisfied with the hotel, the service, the portions in the restaurant, and the rooms.  The staff is friendly, smiling, pleasant.  People often come here a second time, including with families. </p><p>  Party-goers can walk five hundred meters along the street - and here it is, Soho, with its fountains and entertainments.

If you contact the administration before checking in with any requests (for example, that you need a certain type of number or type), then they will be strictly executed.  Most guests recommend that others visit the Dessole Grand Oasis Resort 4 *.  Reviews of this hotel give the impression that the local service and accommodation bring vacationers only positive emotions. </p>
