    <p>  Thus, the village of Koktebel, being a unique holiday destination with a developed tourist infrastructure, is attractive for tourists to visit.  Each vacationer, having visited this wonderful, cozy and picturesque place, will find a rest for himself.  You can get to the village by taxi or bus from <span>Simferopol airport</span> or by personal car via the crossing at Kerch. </p><p>  Most hotels in Koktebel have an approximately equal level of comfort, so tourists can safely choose any of them to stay.  In search of a hotel, you should focus on the reviews of guests who have previously visited it, and see photos presented on numerous tourist portals.  Important is the degree of remoteness from the sea and the availability of infrastructure.  In this regard, all hotels in Koktebel fully meet the most demanding requirements.  All of them are located a hundred meters from the sea coast and have everything necessary for a comfortable stay (sports and playgrounds, equipment, barbecue facilities and gazebos).  An undoubted advantage is their location in the most picturesque corners of the village, surrounded by orchards and cypress groves.  Vacationers go to the sea along beautiful alleys.  Night walks along the Koktebel embankment in the light of lanterns are especially good. </p>
