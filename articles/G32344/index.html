It contains an extensive collection of many species of fish, birds, mammals and other marine life.  This fascinating place in 2017, according to TripAdvisor, the American travel site, was recognized as the best oceanarium in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blogweddingbrasil.com.br" data-author=": Joao Almeida, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding photo session in the Lisbon Aquarium" class="if uuid-2511271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2511271.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The complex was built and opened as part of the exposition of the last world exhibition of the 20th century “Expo-98”, with the theme “Oceans - the heritage of the future”.  Since then, the colossal underwater world in the Lisbon Oceanarium attracts nearly a million visitors from around the world every year.  Until December 8, 2009, the exhibition was visited by 14 million people.  In 2012, this number reached 16 million.  In the same period, it was noted that out of approximately 900,000 visitors, about 320,000 were Portuguese, and 600,000 were tourists from other countries. </p><p>  On February 27, 2016, Oceanário de Lisboa celebrated its 20 millionth visitor.  The Vasco doll with the motto: “Vasco is a good wave!” Was chosen as the organization’s mascot of the organization, which recalls the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama.  This huge talisman, in order to welcome visitors, is located in two places: in front of the main entrance and in the bay where the territory of the oceanarium (port of the Tagus River) begins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="arquitetandorotas.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Talisman of the Aquarium of Lisbon" class="if uuid-2511265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2511265.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The main exhibition pavilion resembling a moored aircraft carrier.  The overall stylistic direction of the entire complex was developed by a North American architect named Peter Chermaeff.  The Lisbon Oceanarium Building received the 1998 Valmore Award for Architecture.  This was not the first work of a famous builder, such projects of Chermaeff are known all over the planet, and among them the world's largest Japanese aquarium on the island of Okinawa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dicaseuropa.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The building of the Lisbon Oceanarium" class="if uuid-2511260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2511260.jpg"></div><p>  In April 2011, the opening of the new Edifício do Mar building, designed by architect Pedro Campos Costa, took place, marking the completion of the Oceanario expansion project.  The new building combines the space reserved for temporary exhibitions, a new reception area, ticket offices, an audience and the Tahoe restaurant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Permanent exhibition </h2><p>  The total area of ​​the aquarium in Lisbon reaches 20,000 m².  Its reservoirs together contain about 7,500,000 liters of water, divided into more than 30 aquariums.  About eight thousand animals and plant organisms, represented by 500 different species, live here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="familianatrip.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquarium with sea anemones" class="if uuid-2511270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2511270.jpg"></div><p>  The main attraction in the interior of the Oceanário de Lisboa is the 5,000,000-liter central aquarium.  It reflects the World Ocean, and several species of fish organically coexist in it, among which are sharks, barracudas, tuna, small tropical fish, giant manti and many other individuals.  Four more aquariums around the main one demonstrate the diversity of marine inhabitants of the North Atlantic (coast of the Azores), the Antarctic Ocean, the temperate Pacific Ocean (Rocky Coast) and the tropical Indian Ocean (coral reefs). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dicasdelisboa.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquarium inhabitants" class="if uuid-2511267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2511267.jpg"></div><h2>  Some animal and plant representatives </h2><p>  <span>The Lisbon Oceanarium</span> provides a collection of seabirds, but the penguin exposition is especially attractive to visitors.  Mammals are represented by two sea otters, touching animals of the family of sea otters.  Of the total mass of crustaceans, two large specimens of spider crabs with incredibly long limbs are most impressive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="tbfotografias.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Penguin pavilion" class="if uuid-2511278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2511278.jpg"></div><p>  In the oceanarium is a stunningly diverse collection of bony and ray-fin fish, such as sharks, chimeras, stingrays, seahorses and others.  Starfish and hedgehogs, corals and anemones, jellyfish and turtles are full of bright flaps.  Incredible forms surprise mollusks: snails, octopuses, cuttlefish and others.  Here is a huge collection of underwater and coastal plants.  The unique conditions of the aquarium allow you to contain especially capricious representatives, which can only be seen in the natural environment.  A large, almost three-meter-long individual fish-moon is one of those specimens that only this establishment can boast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="familianatrip.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Huge manty live in the main aquarium" class="if uuid-2511269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2511269.jpg"></div><h2>  Service and limitations </h2><p>  As one of the foremost public aquariums in the world, the establishment was the first on the continent to receive international quality certificates, including Eco-Management and Audit Scheme.  Seven prestigious awards have been won over the entire life of the Lisbon Oceanarium.  Among them is the 2006 silver medal "For Merit in Tourism".  This reflects the high level of operation of the Oceanário de Lisboa complex.  At the zero level, cells are built, the so-called "marine buildings" so that visitors to them safely leave their things for storage.  If necessary, you can request a wheelchair. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dicasdelisboa.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lisbon Aquarium Restaurant" class="if uuid-2511262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2511262.jpg"></div><p>  The oceanarium has two convenient zones where you can have a good dinner or just a snack.
