    <h2>  Beldibi </h2><p>  This beach resort in the historical Turkish province of Lycia, where the Endam Hotel 4 * is located, is famous for the sea and mountains.  It is located halfway between Kemer and Antalya.  <span>The Taurus Mountains</span> in this place come very close to the sea, because they are picturesque here, like nowhere else.  Directly below them is the village, and across the highway - its resort extension.  It consists of several streets parallel to the sea.  In addition to hotels, cafes and shops, you can hardly find anything here.  The coast is built up with large and small hotels, which mainly stretch along the main street - Ataturk Avenue.  Kemer and Antalya are usually reached from here by a minibus number twenty-eight.  The sights here are mostly natural.  Tourists highly recommend coastal parks that stretch along the sea along the road towards Antalya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Endam Hotel 4 Kemer" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1564089.jpg" width="600"></div>

Go to the airport even further.  You have to overcome about forty kilometers.  If you are going by transfer, then consider yourself lucky.  This hotel belongs to those where they come first, and pick up the last.  On the other hand, the relatively close location to Antalya and Kemer allows you to go there simply by regular bus or dolmush minibus.  The hotel consists of one main building.  It is located in a small garden with an area of ​​four square kilometers.  On the territory there is a swimming pool, a corner with exercise machines and a children's playground.  Near the reception is a shop.  A lot of different shops (especially fruit shops) and boutiques with clothes and beach accessories, as well as pharmacies, are located directly at the hotel entrance, so buying various little things is not a problem.  Nearby is Beldibi's city disco called Fly.  The not too large size of the hotel attracts people who cannot stand the hustle and bustle of large crowds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Endam Hotel 4 Turkey" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1564098.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Pebble (like almost everywhere in Kemer) beach is a hundred meters from the Endam <span>Hotel 4 * (Turkey).</span>  Go there for two minutes.  The sea is very clean, the water is clear.  But the depth is great and there are often waves.  So for very young children, swimming on this beach may not be suitable.  Tourists recommend rubber shoes or “coral” slippers for a comfortable entry into the water.  But at the same time, the hotel staff tried to clear the shore of large boulders.  Therefore, the beach "Endama" is considered the best in all Beldibi.  There are free sunbeds and deck chairs that belong to the Endam Hotel <span>4 * (Beldibi).</span>  From the hotel you can also go to the "wild" coast.  There, the entrance to the water is sandy, but you can run into a sea urchin.  In addition, the hotel has a large outdoor pool, as well as a children's pool.  Around him are also loungers and deck chairs.  The pool has a water slide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Endam Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1564097.jpg" width="600"></div>
