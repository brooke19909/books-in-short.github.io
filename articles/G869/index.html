Clients who use the bank‚Äôs online account perform any operations in it (money transfer, data change, etc.), are required to confirm them by entering special codes.  But it often happens that SMS with a password from Sberbank does not come, although according to the rules, delivery should take no more than 2 minutes!  There are many reasons why this can happen.  You can find out about them and methods of how to get the coveted message with random numbers in the proposed article! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.doylestownhealth.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone in hands" class="if uuid-3104983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124361/3104983.jpg"></div><h2>  Sometimes, to get an SMS password, you just have to wait! </h2><p>  Not always failure in sending messages occurs due to the fault of the client.  Periodically, this happens due to problems on the side of Sberbank or a mobile operator.  This theory will be confirmed by the graph of the popularity of the request ‚ÄúDo not receive SMS from Sberbank‚Äù, taken from the Google Trends service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="query popularity graph" class="if uuid-3104973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124361/3104973.jpg"></div><p>  Blue peaks on the graph show record days when Google users most often searched for the reason why Sberbank SMS passwords did not come.  Since the graph is not wave-like, but consists of many such peaks, this means that problems with messages primarily begin at all at the same time.  This happens either due to errors on the side of the bank, or due to malfunctions in the mobile operator! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The second most popular reason is a poor network. </h2><p>  A message cannot be delivered to the bank‚Äôs customer‚Äôs phone if its device does not catch the network well.  If the client is geographically located outside the city, on the road, in the countryside, it is likely that there is no mobile operator‚Äôs tower nearby, which is why the coverage has disappeared.  In this case, you will have to change the location until at least 2-3 network sticks are lit on the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.news18.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bad cellular signal" class="if uuid-3104936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124361/3104936.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes a bad signal is connected with a broken phone.  In this case, the following methods may help: </p><ul><li>  reboot device; </li><li>  moving the SIM card to another device; </li><li>  activation of network search (manual or automatic, depending on the phone model). </li></ul><h2>  Check if there is enough memory to receive the message. </h2><p>  By default, all text and image messages that arrive on the phone are saved in the internal memory.  Its size is strictly limited.  If free space runs out, SMS from Sberbank does not come with a password, although it is sent by the operator.  It is enough to delete several files from the device‚Äôs memory so that the message appears in the Inbox and the client can open and read it. </p><h2>  The problem may be in SMS filters </h2><p>  On modern smartphones, it is possible to add individual numbers to various exclusion lists, for example, to Blacklist.  If the user mistakenly enters the Sberbank number in one of these categories, then he will not be able to see the incoming messages of this sender.  It is worth removing all unfamiliar numbers from such lists.  Also do not forget to check the Spam folder.  It is likely that SMS with a Sberbank password does not come, because the smartphone mistakenly perceives them as advertising. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sberbank may send a message again </h2><p>  If after the first attempt more than 5-10 minutes have passed, you should not continue to wait for an SMS with a code.  It‚Äôs better to request a re-send password.  This service is free.  It is enough to refresh the page or click on the appropriate button under the form for entering numbers so that the message is sent again. </p><h2>  Check your phone for viruses - install Sberbank Online </h2><p>  This advice applies only to those users who have a smartphone based on Android or Windows Phone, since it is in these operating systems that a malicious program may be launched.  Such software can get into the phone after updating one of the applications or installing a new game through the Play Store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3scworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile virus" class="if uuid-3104971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124361/3104971.jpg"></div><p>  There are special utilities that specialize in scanning smartphones and finding dangerous executive files.  However, it is better to install Sberbank Online on your phone.  Then a mobile bank will appear on your device and at the same time an antivirus, periodically checking the security of the smartphone.  In addition, if you do not receive SMS from Sberbank with a password, such an application will be a convenient solution to the problem, because the operations that go through it do not need to be confirmed by entering one-time codes! </p><h2>  Disable data transfer </h2><p>  If the smartphone has a paid mobile Internet, perhaps some updates and data transfer are taking place at the moment.  This may be the reason why SMS with a one-time Sberbank password does not come.  It is necessary to disable Internet traffic at the time of receiving the message.  For this: </p><ul><li>  use the sidebar (as a rule, it is in it that you can enable / disable data transfer with one click); </li><li>  or go to "Settings", find the "Network" section and disable 2G, 3G, 4G and other methods of transmitting data via the mobile network in it. </li></ul><h2>  What to do if none of the methods helped? </h2><p>  Previously, if it happened that SMS did not come from Sberbank with a password, you could get a code at an ATM.  Now there is no such option.  The bank considered that it would be safer. </p><p>  If all the described methods did not help you, then you will have to wait a while.  The problem may be related to technical work on the servers of the operator or the bank.  You can verify this by calling support. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt have time and urgently need to enter Sberbank Online and complete a certain operation, you will have to go to the physical department.  Only in this way will the bank be able to make sure that you have not been hacked, and that all changes in the accounts occur at your will. </p><h2>  What if the password came, but you didn‚Äôt do anything? </h2><p>  Sberbank‚Äôs security system works in such a way that in the event of an account hacking attempt, the client will quickly find out about it.  For this, two-factor authorization and confirmation of operations by codes have been created.  If you saw that you received an SMS from Sberbank with a password, but you didn‚Äôt even try to enter your personal account, immediately inform technical support.  Although the likelihood that attackers will guess a one-time combination of numbers is small, but it still is, therefore it is better to play it safe and notify bank employees about the incident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="1040return.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cybercriminal stealing money from a card" class="if uuid-3104977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/124361/3104977.jpg"></div><p>  Please note that sometimes SMS codes come very late - after 1-2 days.  If you tried to log in to Sberbank Online in the last few days, but didn‚Äôt receive a message, it‚Äôs possible that your password has recently arrived - this is exactly the message that you did not wait for. </p>
