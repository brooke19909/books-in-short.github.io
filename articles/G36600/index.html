It is used at home, in offices, shopping centers - almost everywhere.  With its help, you can easily and quickly both cool and heat the room.  But with huge demand, most consumers do not really know about all its possibilities.  No less than a few people are guided in the notation of buttons on the air conditioner remote.  This article will help to understand this issue. </p><h2>  Types and Features </h2><p>  Remote controls from the air conditioner are divided into: </p><ul><li>  infrared; </li><li>  wired. </li></ul><p>  Infrared are remote controls that transmit a signal due to radiation.  This system is used in wall split systems, cassette, ceiling air conditioners, as well as in some models of window air conditioners.  Infrared remote controls are convenient to use, but their range is limited to 8 meters, while it should be borne in mind that after 5 meters, malfunctions may occur due to bright lighting.  This type of control is not suitable for systems installed above the recommended values, as well as for those models in which the indoor units are hidden behind suspended ceilings or drywall constructions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.logic-immo.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="remote control from the air conditioner" class="if uuid-2297206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54193/2297206.jpg"></div><p>  Infrared remote controls have a self-diagnosis system, therefore, during a failure, the indicator lamps on the indoor unit of the split system begin to flash by flashing, so the service will need less time for diagnosis and repair. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Wired control the air conditioner at any distance.  If there is a malfunction, they display an error code on the display, which makes diagnostics even easier than with an infrared remote control.  Wired control allows you to control the operation of 4-8 air conditioners.  Some models also have a temperature sensor, which helps ensure optimal performance. </p><h2>  NEAT </h2><p>  Regardless of the manufacturer of the split system, you can highlight the main notation on the air conditioner remote control. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hammacher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heat mode on the air conditioner" class="if uuid-2297254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54193/2297254.jpg"></div><p>  NEAT - heating, temperature up to 30 degrees.  This mode is used to heat indoor air.  It has a designation on the air conditioning control panel in the form of a sun.  The program independently reaches the set temperature as soon as it starts to fall.  It is important to know that each device has its own limitations when used in cold weather.  Restrictions in operation can be from -5 to -15 degrees, depending on the technical characteristics of the air conditioner.  Do not neglect the operating rules of the device to avoid damage.  When choosing an air conditioner, it is important to know the conditions under which it can be used.  There are models in which there are no restrictions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cool </h2><p>  This mode cools the room in hot weather to 16-18 degrees.  This function is considered the main one and is present in any air conditioner.  It has a designation on the remote control of the air conditioner in the form of a snowflake.  Cooling occurs due to the filled refrigerant, which slowly takes heat from the room due to gas generation and releases warm air into the street.  The power of the air conditioner should be selected from the calculation of one kilowatt per 8-10 square meters, under such conditions the device will work most optimally.  When using the cool mode, the most favorable temperature is considered to be 16-18 degrees, if not enough, then you can turn on the fan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prevention.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cooling mode on the air conditioner" class="if uuid-2297223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54193/2297223.jpg"></div><h2>  DRI </h2><p>  The dehumidification function is designed to change the set temperature by several degrees to actively remove <span>high humidity</span> in the room.  This mode is identical to COOL, but at very low fan speeds of the indoor unit of the split system.  The combined use of the function with room cooling means providing more comfortable air.  DRI mode helps to quickly drain the space and get rid of high humidity, it is easier to transfer heat and stop the development of mold.  Some models of the air conditioner have special sensors that respond by automatically turning on this function in the event of a deviation from the norm.  For example, there is this designation on the Gree air conditioner remote control.  In this mode, humidity cannot be programmed and maintained. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.air-rightawayinc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="value on the air conditioner remote control - fan" class="if uuid-2297219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54193/2297219.jpg"></div><p>  Air drainage occurs in this way: </p><ul><li>  The first 10 minutes, the fan is actively working. </li><li>  The next 5 minutes is paused. </li><li>  Then 2 minutes is enhanced ventilation. </li></ul><p>  Do not use this mode near open sources of moisture, such as a pool.  In this case, other drainage methods should be used. </p><h2>  Fan </h2><p>  The function is similar to a fan, use it to change the speed of air conditioning.  In this mode, the cooling and heating equipment does not function, and only air intake from the street occurs.  Suitable for houses in which there is central heating.  In some models, you can only turn on the ventilation of the room without taking air from the street.  Manufacturers most often provide customers with a choice of 3 rotation speeds, and the mode independently selects the most suitable blowing speed. </p><h2>  AUTO </h2><p>  The function maintains a temperature of 22-24 degrees in the room, since it is considered the most comfortable for humans.  The setpoint is aligned every half hour.  In this mode, temperature indicators are not displayed on the control panel display. </p><h2>  Turbo </h2><p>  A mode in which air flows at high speed through a room.  If you can turn off the air intake from the street, you can quickly mix the layers of air.  Thus, the room temperature will be the same. </p><h2>  SLEEP </h2><p>  The mode is used during sleep to create favorable conditions.  In this mode, the temperature changes over 6-8 hours, increasing or decreasing gradually by 1 degree the air temperature so as not to overcool or overheat the sleeping person.  If the air conditioner works for heating, then the temperature rises, if for cooling, it drops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="night mode on the air conditioner" class="if uuid-2297241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54193/2297241.jpg"></div><h2>  SWING </h2><p>  With the help of this mode, fixing or changing the position of the blinds of the split system is carried out.  Thanks to this mode, air is distributed evenly throughout the room.  Some remotes display the movement of the blinds. </p><h2>  AUTORESTART </h2><p>  This mode is not indicated on the control panel, but its presence is very important.  This program is triggered by an unexpected power outage, independently resuming the air conditioner in the set mode, when the electricity reappears. </p><h2>  Standard Modes </h2><p>  The main functions of the air conditioner are: drainage, cooling and heating of the air in the room.  The modes and their designation on the air conditioner remote control should be studied in advance in order to know the technical capabilities of the equipment.  Cooling occurs due to the transition of the liquid state of the refrigerant to the gaseous state, which is carried out due to the intake of warm air from the room, and when heated, the process occurs on the contrary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="learn.compactappliance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modes on the control panel from the air conditioner" class="if uuid-2297351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54193/2297351.jpg"></div><p>  Each air conditioner has basic and additional modes that directly depend on the manufacturer and model of the device.  Designation of icons on the air conditioner remote control: </p><ul><li>  Cool - cooling, looks like a snowflake. </li><li>  Heat - heating, indicated on the air conditioner remote control by the sun. </li><li>  Dry - drainage, image of a drop. </li><li>  Fan - a fan with a corresponding pattern. </li><li>  Sleep - night mode, asterisk image. </li><li>  Lock - protection against children. </li><li>  Led - display backlight for working in the dark. </li></ul><h2>  Special abilities </h2><p>  Some manufacturers in pursuit of the consumer are trying to improve air conditioners with additional options.  Some of them are very useful as a result of operation.  So, special features include: </p><ul><li>  Comfort setting - able to turn on the air conditioner in the miscalculation mode of the optimal mode.  As a rule, in this mode, it is considered optimal 20 degrees for heating, 25 degrees for cooling the room. </li><li>  Air purification - due to built-in filters of various degrees of purification.  It can be coarse - it helps to remove large particles of dirt, and fine - it can even cope with pollen.  In addition, the air conditioner can be equipped with filters that absorb odors.  Street dust settles on the filters, and the air in the room always remains fresh.  Such a designation on the Samsung air conditioner remote control can be found. </li><li>  3D stream - directs the <span>air stream</span> vertically.  The consumer uses this function when he is afraid to catch a cold.  On the remote control of the air conditioner it will be indicated by lfeel. </li><li>  Ionization - saturates a room with ions with negative charges.  The option is designed to improve human immunity and well-being.  In the reviews of some consumers it is said that during ionization a breeze sensation appears.  There is this designation on the remote control of the air conditioner LG, Mitsubishi in some models </li><li>  Filtering and purification of air - this function is not available on all models of the air conditioner; it is carried out by step filters.  It helps to clean the air of dust, dirt and various microorganisms, and also helps to get rid of unpleasant odors.  The function is indispensable for people prone to allergies, and pet owners. </li><li>  Defrosting the heat exchanger - maintains the performance of the air conditioner for a long time.  In this mode, the refrigerant load during cooling is reduced during cooling. </li></ul><p>  A set of additional functions directly depends on the manufacturer and model of the split system.  The designations on the Mitsubishi air conditioner remote control will differ from those of other manufacturers.  Before buying the unit, you need to consult with the seller or familiarize yourself with the options using the instructions that come with the kit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.airdesignservicesinc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="designation of modes on the air conditioner remote" class="if uuid-2297279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54193/2297279.jpg"></div><p>  So, each air conditioner is equipped with the following functions: drainage, heating and air cooling.  In addition, each manufacturer tries to surprise the consumer and diversify the capabilities of the device.  Therefore, when choosing an air conditioner, it is important to study the set of functions of the model you like. </p>
