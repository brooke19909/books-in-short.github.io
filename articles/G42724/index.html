    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Hydramis Palace Beach Resort gives travelers bright moments and pleasant memories.  The reviews contain such positive comments: </p><ul><li>  the territory, although small, is very well-groomed and literally immersed in greenery (here you can find olive trees, grapes, and even pomegranates); </li><li>  high-quality cleaning, regardless of the presence or absence of a tip; </li><li>  large restaurant with a huge selection of delicious food; </li><li>  many free sunbeds on the beach, as well as near the pool; </li><li>  the restaurant bakes delicious bread and cakes; </li><li>  good playground with a safe flooring; </li><li>  excellent sandy beach with a good sunset in the sea; </li><li>  in the territory there is a store with affordable prices; </li><li>  trees and shrubs on the territory are carefully looked after, constantly trimmed, giving them a beautiful shape; </li><li>  to replace beach towels, you do not need to go to the reception desk or anywhere else (just leave them in the room, and the maid will do everything herself); </li><li>  there are Russian-speaking employees; </li><li>  upon check-in, guests are given an information sheet detailing the rules of hotel accommodation, as well as tariffs for services; </li><li>  morning yoga classes; </li><li>  a lot of natural marble in the design of the facade of the buildings, as well as in the interior; </li><li>  if you check into the hotel late at night, you will find dinner in the refrigerator of your room; </li><li>  thanks to well-thought-out animation, children are constantly busy with something and do not sit idle; </li><li>  after 23:00 on the territory the music is turned off. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, no rest can do without negative moments.  Speaking about this institution, it is worth noting its disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is located quite far from large settlements and tourist infrastructure; </li><li>  the restaurant does not provide a children's menu (and the main assortment includes too many spicy and spicy dishes); </li><li>  wireless Internet can be used only at the reception, but even there its signal is extremely unstable; </li><li>  construction is underway on both sides of the hotel, which not only spoils the appearance, but also creates a lot of noise; </li><li>  the animation is mainly in French; </li><li>  tea is not served during dinner (you have to go for a drink at the bar); </li><li>  waiters are not always courteous with guests; </li><li>  due to the fact that a busy highway runs near the hotel, you will be chased by the noise of cars and the smell of exhaust gases; </li><li>  in the afternoon, a terrible pressure of water in the shower (the situation normalizes only late at night, when everyone was already swimming). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Perhaps Hydramis Palace Beach Resort (Crete) can be considered one of the best options for budget accommodation in Crete.  This is a unique combination of beautiful design, comfortable living conditions, bright but moderate entertainment, quality service and family warmth.  As for the location, it can be considered in two ways.  On the one hand, remoteness from large cities can be considered a disadvantage.  But just such a dislocation provides a quiet and relaxing holiday. </p><p>  This is a great option for families.  During the day, children and parents will be passionate about sea vacations or an animation program, and at night you can fully relax, because you will not be disturbed by loud music.  It is also worth paying attention to nutrition.  Dishes are prepared deliciously and at home (in the best local traditions).  But children's diet dishes on the menu you will not find. </p>
