    <h2>  Clio Apart Hotel <span>(Crete): reviews of</span> tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order to make your impression of the hotel in question more complete and accurate, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the opinions of our compatriots who have been vacationing here this year.  Looking ahead, we can say that most of the tourists considered this hotel a great place for a relaxing family vacation on such a wonderful Greek island like Crete.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  As for the location of Klio, our compatriots considered it quite successful.  So, you can walk to the sea in ten minutes.  In the vicinity of the hotel there are many shops and shops where you can buy both groceries and souvenirs.  Here you will also find taverns and bars.  The hotel itself is small and very comfortable.  Everything here is conducive to a relaxing holiday.  In the evenings, due to the lack of animation, you can fall asleep in silence.  In the daytime, for the same reason, there will be no problems with sleeping children. </p><p>  Our compatriots found the rooms at Klio Apartments spacious and well-furnished.  Furniture and appliances are not new, but all in good working condition.  If something fails, then after contacting the reception the wizard will quickly fix all the problems.  The guests were pleased with the presence in the rooms of all the necessary utensils for cooking and eating food.  So many tourists booked accommodation without meals and cooked in their rooms without any problems, buying food in the nearest shops.  As for cleaning, we carried out it efficiently and regularly.  Also, several times a week, as stated, towels and bed linen were changed. </p><p>  Opinions of tourists about food in the hotel mostly agree.  So, our compatriots found the local breakfasts good, but devoid of variety.  As for lunch and dinner, the situation here is better.  In addition, lunch and dinner in taverns outside the hotel is much more expensive than in Klio Apartments. </p><p>  Guest reviews about the hotel staff are also mostly positive.  So, all the staff are very friendly and always try to help.  Pleased with our compatriots is the fact that many either speak Russian, or at least understand it.  So you should not have communication problems here. </p><p>  As for the local beaches, then tourists are mostly satisfied with them.  So, renting beach equipment here is inexpensive.  Near the beaches there are plenty of restaurants and bars where you can both have a bite to eat and refresh yourself with your favorite drink. </p><p>  Experienced tourists recommend that vacationers not spend their entire vacation at the hotel and on the beach, but be sure to travel to Crete.  After all, there is a mass of places of interest to visit.  To do this, you can rent a car or book a tour.  All this can be done, by the way, without going beyond the limits of Clio Apartments. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that most of our compatriots who spent their holidays in Klio Apartments 4 * were very pleased with their choice.  According to them, this hotel is quite consistent with its value and is a good place to relax.  Although, as in the case of other hotels, there were also too demanding travelers who assure that ‚ÄúClio‚Äù is a 3-star hotel.  However, the percentage of such tourists is extremely small, so we did not take their opinion into account, since the vast majority of vacationers were satisfied with their choice of accommodation. </p>
