A beautiful city near Bodrum, located in a calm bay on the border of the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas, attracts many tourists, so the hotel chain is well developed here. </p><p>  When choosing a hotel, it is always useful to get acquainted with detailed information and reviews of other travelers.  This article provides information about the Kalemci Hotel (Kalemchi). </p><h2>  Marmaris </h2><p>  The air of Marmaris is filled with aromas of pines and cypresses growing on the slopes of nearby mountains, eucalyptus trees and the warm sea.  Kalemci Hotel is located on the beach between the turquoise sea and the green hills of the majestic mountains. </p>

    <p>  The city in a picturesque bay overlooking the three islands was built here six hundred years BC, and it was then called Fiskos. </p><p>  Now in its place stands modern Marmaris with colorful bazaars, eucalyptus gardens, orange groves, green palm trees, countless cafes, restaurants and entertainment centers. </p><p>  Nearby there is an international airport (Dalaman), you can also travel to Greece by sea ferry, which goes to the island of Rhodes, and buses daily departing to other <span>cities in Turkey.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Marmaris harbor is the largest in the Aegean Sea, about a thousand ships can enter here.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the <span>sailing</span> center of Turkey is located here and yachtsmen from all over the world gather. </p><p>  Most of the peninsula is a nature reserve, and the unique nature of Marmaris is protected by the state (many travelers are surprised to see numbered date palms).  The summer residence of the head of the Republic of Turkey was built in the protected bay. </p><h2>  Climate and beaches </h2><p>  The weather is always good in this region - hot summers (+ 35-38 <sup></sup>  in July) and humid warm winters (+10 <sup></sup>  in January).  Spring and autumn are a wonderful time when the air temperature is +25 <sup></sup> , and the sea warms up to +20 <sup></sup>  in May and +28 <sup></sup>  in September. </p><p>  Tourists vacationing at the Kalemci Hotel note the unique microclimate of Marmaris, which is closed by mountains from the winds, not very high humidity (35%) and healing air filled with essential oils of pine, eucalyptus and cypress. </p><p>  Thanks to the closed bay, there are no high waves on the sea; on the beaches there is a smooth entrance to the water without cliffs and sharp stones. </p><p>  On the coast there are many well-equipped beaches from a variety of hotels.  You can swim in any of them, if you pay an entrance fee or buy a drink in a nearby bar (3-10 lire).  Please note that on most beaches there is no shower. </p>

    <p>  It is worth trying culinary art such as kufta (meat soup), kebab, dolma (stuffed cabbage from grape leaves), stuffed eggplant and famous Turkish sweets. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  The nightlife of the coastal city is very active.  In various discos and clubs, especially on Bar Street, parties are held, competitions and shows (including the famous belly dance). </p><p>  While relaxing in Marmaris, you can go on safaris on ATVs or jeeps, take a boat ride on mountain rivers or on the sea on yachts and jet skis, go on excursions to ancient cities and take advantage of other entertainments, which Turkey is famous for.  Hotels (including Kalemci Hotel) provide animation services.  But at the Kalemchi Hotel, it consists in conducting water aerobics in the morning and water polo in the afternoon. </p><p>  Basically, the work of local animators is to take hotel guests to discos in city restaurants, and then bring them back (transfer is free).  Children's activities are not organized at the hotel. </p><p>  The most popular excursions are a trip to Pamukkale ($ 60 per person) and to the island of Cleopatra.  During sea excursions, tourists visit magnificent bays with crystal clear sea water, the color of which has nine shades. </p><p>  In the evening, you can watch the ‚Äúsinging‚Äù fountains in the city center or take a walk along the beautiful promenade, where live music is played in the cafe. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists share their impressions of staying at the Kalemci Hotel.  Reviews are different - both positive and negative.  In many respects, the assessment depends on the mood and character of people, but there are also objective comments. </p><p>  It should be noted that the hotel is not intended for families with children - there is no children's animation, no babysitting or entertainment club services are provided. </p><p>  The hotel is also not a quiet haven for older tourists.  The main guests are young people who are actively having fun in bars. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Among the positive impressions are the following: </p><ul><li>  The rooms of the Kalemci Hotel (Marmaris) have been renovated, all furniture and plumbing are in good condition. </li><li>  Large and clean pool, around a lot of sunbeds. </li><li>  Residents of the city are nice to Russians. </li><li>  Close to go to the beach and city center. </li><li>  Nearby there are good supermarkets, shops and cafes. </li><li>  The polite staff. </li><li>  Many Russian vacationers - you can always find a fun company </li><li>  There is a city bus stop next to the hotel that provides quick access to the center. </li><li>  Large selection of diverse and beautiful beaches. </li><li>  Delicious food, lots of vegetables and fruits. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are also negative feedback about living at Kalemci Hotel 4 * (Marmaris).  Reviews of hotel shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  Air conditioning works only in the rooms, in the rest of the hotel (restaurant, reception, corridors and so on) it is very stuffy, and there is simply nothing to breathe. </li><li>  The elevator is also without air conditioning and moves very slowly, so many people walk on stairs). </li><li>  Rooms are cleaned only if a tip (3 lira) is left on the bed. </li><li>  Some tourists note a bad attitude towards Russians (the staff allegedly does not understand when our compatriots try to speak English). </li><li>  Despite the fact that a gym is indicated in the advertisement of the hotel, in reality it is not. </li><li>  The free municipal beach has a dirty sea. </li></ul><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  If you are planning to stay in Marmaris and planning to stay at the Kalemchi Hotel, check out the recommendations of experienced tourists: </p><ul><li>  It is not necessary to exchange dollars (euros).  Lira will be needed for traveling by bus or taxi, and any goods can be bought at local stores for dollars. </li><li>  At all bazaars and in stores you have to bargain, and from the very beginning to reduce the declared price by three times. </li><li>  In the Kalemchi Hotel it is better to take a room on the lower floors, because due to the slow and stuffy elevator you have to run up the stairs several times a day. </li><li>  When choosing an apartment, you can only be guided by the floor on which they are located, since they are all exactly the same. </li><li>  It is worth taking an English-Russian dictionary with you (you can download it to your phone), as the staff generally does not speak Russian. </li><li>  Bring a flash drive with books, films and games, since the Internet is only in the lobby, and access costs five dollars a day. </li><li>  Take bath towels with you, because they cannot be taken out of the rooms, but they are not given out by the pool. </li><li>  Dolmushi buses (white shuttles) can take Ichmeler (another tourist village nearby) in a few minutes and 2.5 lira per person - there is a very clear sea, and even tiny fish swim, and on the beaches it is not so crowded (although umbrellas and sunbeds are also paid). </li><li>  Icmeler has a special beach with free sunbeds for guests of the Kalemchi Hotel.  You need to get off at the Nirvana Beach stop, go down the stairs and go left to the end. </li><li>  Marmaris does not have its own leather factories, so there is not a large selection of leather products, and their prices are more expensive than in other cities in Turkey. </li><li>  From local products, tourists note excellent flounder honey.  It has an original pine aroma and tastes great. </li><li>  You must constantly use sunscreen, especially during trips and excursions. </li><li>  The best gyms are usually in five-star hotels.  Many tourists like to play sports in the hall of the Elegance Hotel (40 lire per person for 1 visit). </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Kalemci Hotel is suitable for budget holidays and is designed for active middle-aged people and youth.  For those who prefer a quiet and relaxing holiday, the neighboring village of Icmeler is more suitable. </p>
