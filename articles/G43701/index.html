    <h2>  The choice of yarn and pattern for warm things </h2><p>  Almost all types of threads are suitable for knitting <span>stoles with knitting needles.</span>  With the diagrams and description of the problems usually does not arise, since the product has only one part of a rectangular shape.  If you knit a cloak in the form of a triangle, then it should already be called a shawl. </p><p>  The following types of stoles can be distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Dense and warm.  For such things, material with a high content of wool or mohair is selected.  As a rule, the thickness of the thread should be no more than 300 m / 100 grams.  Various dense patterns are extremely relevant here: braids, ‚Äúrice‚Äù, ‚Äúchess‚Äù and others.  True, do not use jacquards in order to knit stoles with knitting needles.  It is not difficult to figure out the diagrams and description, but such patterns have an unattractive inside out, which will be visible to others when the product is worn. </li><li>  Openwork and warm.  For such stoles, a thin mohair or angora with a thread thickness of at least 500 m / 100 grams is traditionally selected.  In combination with an openwork pattern, such materials make it possible to achieve lightness and grace of the finished product. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork stole" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1463189.jpg" width="325"></div>  3. Mohairs of Italian manufacturers are considered to be of the highest quality, since they contain at least 75% wool of fine-wool goats and only 25% artificial fibers (cotton, rayon or nylon).  Turkish analogues include about 50% acrylic, which leads to the appearance of pellets, the formation of lumps of mohair on the threads and other troubles. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit stitches with diagrams and description" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1463186.jpg" width="307"></div></li></ol><h2>  Cotton and viscose products </h2><p>  Working with yarn without wool or mohair, you can get the following types of stoles: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Dense but light.  These stoles are suitable for cool summer evenings.  They are often taken with them to the sea to protect themselves from the wind.  Such products are knitted with a small pattern of thin cotton threads. </li><li>  Openwork and light.  It is these stoles that become the main decoration of evening dresses.  Thanks to silk or viscose yarn, products acquire an attractive shine.  The pattern here is suitable for almost any, most importantly - the accuracy of the knitter.  In order for the palatine to become a really high-quality thing, it is necessary to observe the same density and not make mistakes in the ornament. </li></ol><p>  The edge design is also of no less importance: you can make a border simultaneously with the manufacture of the main fabric or crochet the finished fabric. </p><h2>  Simple openwork stoles with knitting needles: with diagrams and descriptions for beginners </h2><p>  Inspired by the tempting idea to tie the stole, many craftswomen can not start work, considering it not too difficult.  Do not get upset or try to do the impossible, because there are models available for almost everyone. </p><p>  For example, you can make an openwork stole, armed with the simplest grid scheme: </p><ul><li>  1st row: knit all the loops face. </li><li>  2nd row: according to the drawing. </li><li>  3rd row: two together, double crochet. </li><li>  4th row: according to the drawing. </li></ul><p>  Next, you only need to repeat the 2nd and 3rd rows. </p><p>  If the craftswoman is already able to perform simple openwork patterns, she can use the following scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stole pattern" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1463196.jpg" width="274"></div>

    <h2>  Palantine in two evenings </h2><p>  Finally, it is worth noting that as simple as possible products have become extremely popular today.  It is enough for the craftswoman to know how to knit facial loops to make stoles with knitting needles.  You won‚Äôt have to bother with the diagrams and description, since the pattern is called a ‚Äúgarter stitch‚Äù.  Its essence is that all rows (wrong and front) are performed with facial loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simple palatine" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1463190.jpg" width="298"></div>

    <p>  It remains only to perform the correct calculation and get to work.  You can knit along or across.  You can decorate such a stole by any means, for example, a fringe along one of the long sides. </p>
