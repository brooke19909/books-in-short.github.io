In order for a truly fabulous guest to shine in your house, you can and even need to decorate it with your own toys.  And the best assistant for work will be beads.  Having made Christmas toys from beads, you will understand what your tree has been missing for so long. </p><p>  New Year's toys from beads can be made in different ways and in different techniques.  One of the options for making a toy is pasting.  To do this, you need a ready-made simple, preferably non-breaking toy, beads, a needle with a thin eye, fishing line and glue.  Stringing beads of the desired shades on the fishing line, glue it gradually to the toy.  Can be glued in a spiral, can be in the form of a fantasy pattern. </p><p>  The next version of the product is braiding.  The materials are the same as in the previous version.  Only this work is a little more complicated.  You will need to master the mosaic weaving.  I am braiding a toy in this way, you can take a diagram of a small pattern specially designed for mosaic weaving.  As a result, you will get a beautiful decoration with a cute pattern. </p><p>  You can also make bead lace and ‚Äúdress‚Äù it with an ordinary toy.  Patterns of weaving such lace can be found in almost any book on beadwork or, if you have a wild fantasy, come up with it yourself.  You can make a variety of pendants at the ends of the lace, which will give the product even more sophistication. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Making <span>Christmas toys from beads,</span> you can use not only Christmas balls, but also make snowflakes, funny figures, or something like that.  The most popular and simple, perhaps, will be snowflakes.  To make them, you will need beads, wire and pliers.  Stringing beads on a wire, you can bend it as you wish, thereby you get a wonderful pattern.  In this case, you can create many different snowflakes completely different from each other. </p><p>  You can also use small snow maidens, Santa Clauses, angels and snowmen as Christmas toys made from beads.  You can make them as completely elementary, which will display the characters only in general terms, and quite complete, with clear contours. </p><p>  <span>Christmas tree</span> toys <span>made of beads</span> are not the only option for decorating the Christmas tree.  You can also take for the manufacture of toys sequins, straw, paper and even thread.  For example, you can inflate a balloon and wrap it with multi-colored threads impregnated with glue.  When the product dries well, the ball must be punctured and carefully removed - that‚Äôs all, the toy is ready. </p><p>  From beads you can make not only toys, but the Christmas tree itself.  Let it be small, but how beautiful and brilliant.  Created with your own hands, it will be the best gift, even if it does not turn out perfect. </p><p>  Increasingly, we can see volumetric toys from beads.  They are just bewitching.  Masters with long experience working with beads sometimes perform such miracles that it is hard to believe that this is possible.  If you master the technique of making volumetric toys from beads, then you can make anything.  And your favorite cartoon characters and funny figures that your fantasy will tell you.  Of course, making a volumetric toy is a painstaking and time-consuming process, but the result will be amazing. </p><p>  New Year's toys made of beads are the best entertainment for your kids.  Having puzzled them with such work and helping them in creating the product, you will not only decorate the Christmas tree, but also have a great time with the children.  Indeed, in the process of work, you can always make contact with children, and many adults will like it. </p>
