And after the Winter Olympic Games were successfully held here in 2014, its fame has gained a worldwide scale.  And this is not surprising, because there are not many places on earth where you can relax year-round and at the same time so varied.  In summer, the tender Black Sea is at guests' disposal, and in winter, the snow-capped Caucasus Mountains. </p><p>  In connection with the holding of the Olympic Games in Sochi itself and its urban areas, a large number of new and modern hotels have appeared, in which guests of the resort can be accommodated with all the amenities.  One of them is the Bogatyr Hotel, which is rather unusual in its architecture. </p><h2>  Hotel in the amusement park </h2><p>  In the Adler district of Sochi, on the eve of the 2014 Olympics, many new objects have appeared that were created specifically for numerous guests of the resort. </p><p>  One of these places was a large <span>theme park</span> dedicated to the historical and cultural heritage of the whole of vast Russia.  It received a simple and understandable name - ‚ÄúSochi Park‚Äù - and has already managed to become a favorite place for many vacationers, although it was officially opened only in June 2014. </p>
