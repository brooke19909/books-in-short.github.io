Someone wants to visit the cradle of Orthodox monasticism - the Kiev Pechersk Lavra. </p><p>  Someone wants to see with their own eyes the places where the history of the Russian state was born and is breathtaking from the names alone: ‚Äã‚ÄãGolden Gate, Podil, Andreevsky Descent. </p><p>  Someone is selflessly in love with this city and comes again to walk along Khreshchatyk or to stand on Independence Square (Independence Square). </p><p>  Someone comes to a unique concert from a nearby city.  And someone is just curious about shopping. </p><p>  All these people need to settle somewhere and Kiev hotels willingly provide their services. </p><h2>  Where to stay in Kiev </h2><p>  First of all, those who want to stay in the city or its suburbs need to pay attention to the hotels in Kiev.  Information about them is presented on numerous sites on the Internet, it is enough to enter "Kiev hotels" in the query line. </p><p>  In Kiev, as in most European cities, the "star" classification of hotels is accepted.  The greater the number of stars, the higher the level of comfort and quality of service. </p><h3>  Luxury Kiev Hotels </h3><p>  Premier Palace is the only six-star hotel in Ukraine.  Such a high level was assigned to him in 2009 according to an inspection conducted by Torsten Berman, the head of the international organization Seven Stars and Stripes, who had arrived from the USA.  All areas of the hotel were tested: service, amenities, cuisine, sports and spa.  By the way, Premier Palace was the tenth hotel in the world that was given the status of six stars. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Five-star hotels in Kiev are distinguished by Ukrainian hospitality, unobtrusively combined with high standards of service.  Among them - Opera Hotel, Hyatt Regency, Radison Blu, Intercontinental.  Reviews of Kiev hotels belonging to the premium class can also be easily found on the Internet. </p><p>  Hotels in Kiev, positioning themselves as four-star hotels, of course, are among the high-class hotels that maintain their status at the "metropolitan level".  Well-maintained and furnished with stylish furniture, chic or cozy restaurants and bars, Ukrainian and <span>European cuisine,</span> wellness centers, high-quality international communications, banking services, the ability to sign up for numerous excursions around the city and suburbs - this is not a complete list of services provided by these hotels. </p><h3>  Economy Class Features </h3><p>  Economy class hotels are located in more distant <span>areas of Kiev</span> from the center <span>.</span>  Their indisputable advantages include the ability to live in Kiev and a low price.  However, the choice of an inexpensive hotel should be taken into account, comparing the services offered with their cost and looking at the comments of former residents. </p><p>  Reviews of Kiev hotels belonging to this category are disappointing.  The disadvantages include: dilapidated buildings, old plumbing, remoteness from the center, the need to independently worry about the safety of their belongings, lack of Internet, minimal service. </p><p>  An alternative is Kiev apartments for rent.  Usually a well-kept two or three bedroom accommodation is offered, located near the tourist points of the city or metro stations.  In most cases, this newly-renovated temporary shelter is equipped with everything necessary for life (from a washing machine to forks and spoons), cleanliness and order are supported by the efforts of incoming maids.  The cost of such apartments depends on their location (distance from the center) and the number of rooms. </p><p>  In order to find a company that provides rental services in Kiev, just enter the phrase "Kiev apartment" in the search bar on the Internet. </p><p>  That, in fact, is all about temporary residence in Kiev.  It remains only to balance their desires and opportunities. </p>
