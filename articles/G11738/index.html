    <p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island is twenty-seven square kilometers.  Despite the fact that not all of its iconic places are open for tourists, it has already won the glory of a world-class resort.  Almost all the buildings of this resort were designed by architects-laureates of the Pulitzer Prize.  The tourist center of the island - Manarat al-Saadiyat - is already hosting guests.  Several million people visit it annually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  National Museum </h2><p>  Saadiyat Island (UAE) is divided into seven districts, the names of which sometimes cause an allusion with the movie Hunger Games movie trilogy, but in their luxury they remind the capital of this dystopia, the Capitol.  One of the main highlights of Saadiyat is the Calceral District.  This is the main museum area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island.  There are already some amazing sights here.  One of them is the Sheikh Zayed National Museum.  This is the first president of the country who made one of the richest countries in the world from the Emirates. </p>

    <p>  The Louvre branch is another amazing project that Saadiyat Island is famous for.  In his building - a huge glass dome and many canals, which creates the impression that you are contemplating works of art on the high seas.  The branch rented paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, Van Gogh, and other exhibits from Versailles and the <span>Georges Pompidou Center</span> from the Louvre <span>.</span>  The museum is due to open this year. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Saadiyat Island (Abu Dhabi) is also known for the fact that you can have fun and usefully here.  Saadiyat Laguns is a district designed for families.  There is entertainment for every taste.  In a huge amphitheater in the open air there will always be shows and concerts.  The Equestrian Center is also located in the same area.  They teach horse riding and demonstrate first-class horses.  Since the district surrounds the central lagoon of the island, there are many places where you can stay alone with wildlife. </p>
