In addition, before starting the process, it is important to know about different Internet tariffs for a mobile phone.  After all, some possible connection options depend on this.

    <h2>  Wide choose </h2><p>  But before you connect the MTS Internet to your phone, you will have to get acquainted with different tariff plans.  They usually help us identify some options for starting to use additional options. </p><p>  The first tariff is <span>BIT.</span>  It is used primarily for reading mail and browsing the web.  You can download 75 mb at high speed per day.  <span>The subscription fee</span> is from 150 to 200 rubles (depending on the region). </p><p>  The second scenario is the Super BIT tariff plan.  Here you can chat, watch movies, read mail and so on.  This is probably the most suitable function that can only be offered to a modern person.  You will receive 3 GB per month, and pay for this from 250 to 300 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are thinking about how you can connect unlimited MTS Internet to your phone, then you should pay attention to <span>BIT Smart.</span>  For it you will pay from 300 to 350 rubles per month.  And for this, get unlimited Internet at high speed.  Here is such a super-Internet from MTS.  How to connect it?  Let's try to figure it all out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect internet on mts on the phone" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Let's go ourselves </h2><p>  The first way that will help us cope with the task regardless of the chosen tariff plan for mobile Internet is a personal visit to the office of your mobile operator.  True, he will have to take a passport just in case.  After all, no manipulations without the owner of the number in the office will not be carried out. </p><p>  How to connect MTS Internet to the phone?  Go to the nearest office of a mobile operator, and then inform about your intentions to start using mobile Internet.  Tell the employee the required tariff, and then inform (if necessary) your passport data.  Next - pass the mobile phone to the operator and wait a while. </p><p>  As a rule, if you have enough funds to make the transition, then all things will be completed in about 5 minutes. You will receive a message with the settings for the Internet, saving which you can work normally on the World Wide Web.  In cases where there is insufficient money, you will have to replenish the account.  And only then to realize the idea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Honestly, this scenario does not particularly attract customers.  After all, on MTS <span>,</span> you can <span>connect the Internet through the</span> phone in two accounts.  And you won‚Äôt have to go somewhere else.  How?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay connect internet via phone" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870915.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  We call the operator </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt really like the prospect of a visit to the office of a mobile operator, you can simply call him from your mobile phone to resolve our current issue.  The thing is that this scenario is the most common among all the others.  After all, the call to the operator is absolutely free. </p><p>  Dial 0890 on the phone, and then wait for an answer.  When they answer you, inform the Internet tariff plan, then wait a while.  If you have enough funds in your account, then you will receive a message with <span>the Internet settings.</span>  Otherwise, the operator will inform you that there is not enough money and will offer to replenish the balance.  And only then resume attempts. </p><p>  In fact, if you‚Äôre thinking about how to connect the Internet to your MTS on your phone, it‚Äôs best not to resort to this scenario.  After all, you have a chance of getting on an answering machine.  Then the process can drag on for about 20 minutes. So we will try to figure out with you what other solution options exist. </p><h2>  Using Commands </h2><p>  For example, you can always use a mobile phone to send a special request that will help you realize your idea.  True, for each tariff plan (Internet), he has his own. </p><p>  So, for example, if you need the ‚ÄúBIT‚Äù option, then dial * 252 #, and then press the subscriber‚Äôs call button.  You will be sent a request with subsequent processing.  Next - wait for a notification about a successful Internet connection.  More precisely, the settings that have to be saved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="super internet from mts how to connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870914.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But for ‚ÄúSuper BIT‚Äù you have to dial * 628 #.  Now, just like the last time, click on the "dialer", and then wait for the settings.  As a rule, if there are enough funds on the balance sheet, the processing of the request will last no more than 10 minutes.  Basically, just such a move helps many to figure out how to connect the Internet to the MTS on the phone.  But there are some more very interesting scenarios.  Which ones?  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Help messages </h2><p>  Well, another rather interesting option is the use of SMS requests.  As a rule, they are most suitable for those who do not particularly like conversations and personal visits to mobile communication offices. </p><p>  Type ‚Äú1234‚Äù on your mobile phone in the text of SMS or send an empty message to number 111. Only after that you can wait for the standard Internet settings.  That is, the fee for 1 MB of downloaded data will depend on your tariff on the SIM card.  That's all. </p><p>  As a rule, messages are not very popular.  Indeed, sometimes processing requests can take a long time.  Then the last method comes to the rescue.  And now we will meet him. </p><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  Another way that you can offer is to use the official MTS website.  More precisely, a special "personal account", which is available to all customers of this mobile operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how can I connect unlimited Internet pay to the phone" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870913.jpg" width="500"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In order to realize the idea, it is enough just to go through authorization on the MTS official website, and then visit the "Services" section.  Now find there in the sub-item "Internet" the tariff you need, then click on the necessary line.  Further it remains only to click on "Connect" and wait a while.  You will receive an alert with the settings, saving which you can use the mobile Internet.  That's all. </p><p>  Now you know how to connect MTS Internet to your phone.  As you can see, nothing is difficult or supernatural.  The main thing is to choose the option that suits you. </p>
