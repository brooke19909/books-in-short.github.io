    <h2>  First impression </h2><p>  Mina Mark Beach Resort (Hurghada) 4 * consists of two buildings.  The hotel is elegantly designed and immediately attracts attention.  Definitely the first impression sets in a positive way, and, I must say, it is not deceptive.  It is worth noting another important point - this hotel complex is located in the very center of the city, in an area called Sakkala.  Tourists are attracted by the fact that the hotel is located right on the first coastline.  Only five minutes from the beach are just a few minutes away!  But that is not all.  In the immediate vicinity is the airport - a little less than ten minutes by car.  Also nearby is the promenade, which is popular, especially among young people.  It is here that you can dine in the best restaurants, visit upscale nightlife venues of an entertaining nature or just take a walk in the picturesque surroundings. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
