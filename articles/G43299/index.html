Now in the construction of multi-apartment buildings, a lot of planning solutions are used.  They are many in the Russian market.  It has also become fashionable to do redevelopment, despite the fact that the changes have to be documented and obtain permission for the reconstruction.  The most popular option was apartments with free layouts.  Typical are buildings that are combined into one group according to some typical characteristics, for example, the year of construction or the material of the walls, as well as a series of construction. </p><h2>  Layout in old houses </h2><p>  <em>The old foundation.</em>  These houses were of low number of storeys: as a rule, 2 floors.  Built of wood.  Year of construction until 1917.  This is mainly an emergency housing.  But there are also buildings built at the beginning of the century, with metal ceilings.  They are not emergency.  The layout of the standard apartments was individual, without a bathroom and with entrance through the kitchen.  Only some houses with metal ceilings had equipped toilets.  There were also options with a bath, but with narrow rooms and a corridor.  There is housing and up to 400 m <sup>2</sup> .  But perhaps it has already been divided into smaller layout options.  As a rule, in such housing there are high ceilings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="layout of standard apartments" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68246/2193317.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>Stalinka.</em>  The period of construction of these apartment buildings fell on 1930-1950, just during the reign of Stalin.  Hence the name of this layout.  There are pre-war and post-war stalin.  The first version of the buildings paid much more attention and invested much more in construction than in the post-war version.  These were already more modest.  Number of storeys of such buildings is from 3 to 4 floors.  Large windows and high ceilings are provided.  A frequently encountered option is 2- and 3-room apartments.  But 1 and 4-bedroom rarities.  Each room had its own characteristics.  One-room apartments were from 32 to 50 m2, two-room apartments from 44 to 70, three-room apartments from 57 to 85 m2 and four-room apartments from 80 to 110. Usually the bathroom is separate and is located next to the kitchen.  The rooms are all isolated. </p><p>  <em>Khrushchev‚Äôs</em> .  Houses with layouts of typical apartments of the Khrushchev type appeared in 1958 - almost immediately after the Stalin era.  We completed the construction of these houses in 1985.  A distinctive feature is the combined bathroom, small kitchens, and in multi-room apartments, <span>walk-through rooms.</span>  The floors in the building were from 4 to 5. One-room apartments had an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 33 m <sup>2</sup> , two-room apartments - up to 46, and three-room apartments - up to 58. The material of the walls is brick. </p><h2>  Modern standard layouts of apartments </h2><p>  <em>Brezhnevka.</em>  The construction of these apartment buildings was carried out in the period from 1964 to 1980.  Rooms in them can be from one to five.  They were built up to 17 floors and usually made of panels, but there are also brick buildings.  Unlike Khrushchev in the kitchen area - it ranged from 6.8 to 7.4 m <sup>2</sup> .  The window sills were larger, and the brick houses had good soundproofing and thermal insulation.  This is one of the advantages of such housing.  They also have isolated rooms and a separate bathroom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="typical layouts of apartments" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68246/2193318.jpg"></div>
