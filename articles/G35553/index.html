    <p>  Models of the organization of training are a systematic set of laws of a teacher and a student during the implementation of training, there are two types - andragogical and pedagogical.  Modern models of educational organization are divided into two groups: </p><p>  The first includes those models of educational organization, the basis of which are pedagogical constructions, the second is based on the latest possibilities of didactic teaching tools.  The turn of education to man, the appeal to humanistic ideas causes increased interest among teachers in the use of various models of the educational process. </p><p>  Modern models of educational organization reflect the psychological laws of the educational process, including students of different ages and in different conditions. </p><p>  In pedagogical practice, a classification is often used according to the content and nature of the contradictions of the educational problem, which is solved by modern models of educational organization: </p><p>  Inconsistency of student knowledge and new information; </p><p>  Multiple choice of a single optimal or correct solution; </p><p>  The novelty of practical conditions is the use by students of their knowledge; </p><p>  The contradiction between a possible theoretical method of solving a problem and its inappropriateness or impracticability in practice; </p><p>  Lack of theoretical justification of the result achieved in practice. </p><p>  According to the classification, modern models of educational organization are evidence of the variability of the educational process, the ability to take into account the characteristics of the individuality of students, the conditions of the educational process;  models of education as a state organization, a traditional model of education, a model of developing education, phenomenological, non-institutional, rational. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Models and technologies of the educational process are constantly changing, and today the problematic process in the development of education belongs to the traditional type at present. The traditional educational process is feasible in the form of an andragogical or pedagogical model. </p><p>  When it comes to the model and <span>technology of education, we have</span> in mind a systematic set of activities of the student and student.  It is also necessary to take into account such many important components of training as content, means, sources, methods and forms. </p><p>  It is known that a change in a system occurs when its elements change.  The system-forming factor in the <span>pedagogical process</span> is its goals.  The essence of the process depends on the goals set.  If the goal is to form new knowledge, then the educational process is explanatory - illustrative in nature, in the formation of independence in cognition, the process has the features of <span>problem-based learning.</span>  If the goal is to develop the individual personal qualities of the student, then such a process is a true developmental, real holistic process of problematic <span>developmental education.</span> </p><p>  In its genesis, the process of education went through several stages.  Starting from the model of dogmatic training, further explanatory - illustrative, and ending with the model of the problematic developing type.  And at the same time, the integrity of training was getting higher.  The main meaning of the integrity of the problematic developing educational process in the subordination of its functions and parts to the main task: the harmonious development of the individual, the formation of an integral person and the upbringing of the personality. </p><p>  Ways to change the educational process are aimed at supporting the initiative of the child, learning the skills of cooperation, communication, expanding experience, and developing student independence. </p>
