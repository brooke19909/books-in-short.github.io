One of the decisive factors of its power was the presence of a well-trained, disciplined army, which at that time was a significant military force.  The army of Ancient Rome had a clear structural organization.  An important place in it was occupied by a cohort.  It was one of the main parts of the army. </p><h2>  The history of the Roman army </h2><p>  At first, the organization of the military was quite simple.  At the beginning of its existence, Rome did not have a standing army.  If the war began, all citizens over the age of 18 were required to participate in it.  Everyone had to arm themselves according to their property qualifications. </p>

    <p>  Rome actively waged wars, expanding its borders, and this affected the changes in the army.  In 405 BC  e.  the first volunteers to receive a salary appeared in it. </p><p>  The Roman army grew, and by the III century BC.  e.  already consisted of 20 legions.  It was replenished not only at the expense of volunteers.  Legions from the allies of Rome and the captured provinces gradually appear.  Over time, the property qualification associated with the mandatory participation of Roman citizens in the war decreases. </p><h2>  Guy Maria's military reforms </h2><p>  Frequent and prolonged military conflicts in which Rome was involved led to outrage among the peasants.  They were torn away from their farms for a long time.  The reform of the army is ripe.  She spent in 107 BC.  e.  Roman consul and commander Gaius Marius.  His main merit was that now citizens who did not own land were drafted into the Roman army.  Hoping to get a higher social status during the service, among the poor there were a large number of people wishing to become soldiers.  They were enlisted in the army for 25 years.  Now the legionnaires received part of the captured booty and land allotments in the conquered territories in Gaul, Italy or Africa.  Educated soldiers who can even read, had good chances to advance up the career ladder. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  What battle order was used in the <span>Roman army?</span>  The cohort played a significant role here.  This is a detachment that made up one tenth of the <span>Roman legion.</span>  During the battle, the legions were built in three or four lines.  The first usually consisted of four cohorts, the second, third and fourth of three.  Caesar preferred to line up the army in three lines.  The soldiers of the cohort stood in a tightly closed formation.  Firstly, the support of the warriors standing nearby was felt.  Secondly, such a system was more difficult to break through the enemy army.  In the event of a gap in the first row, warriors of the second line could quickly fill it.  Thus, the cohort is the main tactical unit of the Roman army.  The position of the legion in the battle depended on how stubbornly and courageously she fought. </p><h2>  Roman cohort - the foundation of the legion </h2><p>  One of the senior or highest centurions commanded this detachment of the Roman army.  Usually they came from soldiers who distinguished themselves by their resourcefulness, quick wits, and courage.  If we draw an analogy with the modern army, then in terms of functions and position, they were approaching the junior command staff. </p>

    <p>  Cohort is a military unit in the army of Ancient Rome.  But there were other types of it.  There were auxiliary horse and reconnaissance units, a cohort consisting of former sailors (something like modern marine corps), as well as a detachment of city guards (cohors urbana), which was created to fight criminals. </p>
