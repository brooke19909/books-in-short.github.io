Often it is called the "gateway" to the Western Archipelago - picturesque islands and deserted gray cliffs.  What to see in Gothenburg in winter and summer?  Will there be any entertainment for children in this city?  Are tourists who have already visited this Swedish city satisfied with the trip?  We will try to answer these questions in this review. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gothenburg, Sweden" class="if uuid-2547144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2547144.jpg"></div><h2>  City location </h2><p>  The name of the city comes from the word "Goths" - this is the population of Getaland (territory in the south of Sweden), where the city of Gothenburg is located.  Looking at the map of Sweden, you will see that Gothenburg is located at the mouth of the Geta Elv River, in the south-west of the country. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.70887" data-lng="11.974559999999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/4/4/4/4444.png"></div><h2>  Sights of the city of Gothenburg in Sweden.  Marina Lilla Boomman </h2><p>  This picturesque place located on the Goethe River always attracts the attention of tourists.  Lilla Boomman has two piers with well-designed infrastructure, which accept boats, pleasure yachts and motor ships.  Every day very small merchant ships come here, bringing clothes, fish, and interesting trinkets to the city.  Locals and visitors alike like visiting these markets under the open sky - here you can always buy pretty decent things at a reasonable price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The quay adjoins the marina, bearing the same name where you can visit the opera house, restaurants, bars, the Lilla Bummen skyscraper, whose height is 86 meters.  From the observation deck, located on its upper floor, you can enjoy panoramic views of the city. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  Many travelers (especially women) are interested in the sights of Gothenburg in Sweden, where you can admire unusual plants and flowers.  These primarily include the largest botanical garden in Gothenburg in Europe.  Here, lovers of natural beauty can see magnificent and rare plants, crops. </p><p>  The collection of the botanical garden has more than 16 thousand species of plants in greenhouses, rock gardens, gardens and fields. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blogyvonne.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2547219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2547219.jpg"></div><h2>  Gardeners Society Park </h2><p>  A magnificent green oasis located in the center of Gothenburg.  In addition, it is one of the beautifully preserved parks of Europe in the 19th century.  Thousands of decorative flowers and lush forests attract tourists here.  In an amazing glass palace, various exotic plants have been growing since 1878.  For more than 170 years, this park has been a favorite vacation spot for citizens and guests of Gothenburg.  In 1992, the park was declared a state protected zone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rose garden </h2><p>  It is located in the <span>park gardeners.</span>  This attraction of Gothenburg must see lovers of roses.  It blooms over 1200 different varieties of these beautiful flowers.  The rose garden has three sections.  In Rosovalen, modern rose varieties are divided into groups.  Old varieties are represented in Rosparken.  A collection of roses from the west of Sweden is collected in Rosarkivet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goteborg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rose garden" class="if uuid-2547221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2547221.jpg"></div><p>  In early July, a party takes place in the garden.  Guests can visit flower shows and listen to interesting lectures. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  The cult sights of Gothenburg (we posted a photo in this material) in our review is the cathedral.  Before, at the place where the temple is today, there was an ancient church, consecrated in 1633 and bearing the name of Gustav in honor of the king, who died in the battle of Lutzen.  The temple received the status of the cathedral in 1665. </p><p>  The current cathedral is the third built on this earth.  As a result of the fires of 1721 and 1802, the old buildings were destroyed.  The modern cathedral was built in 1815.  The construction project was developed by architect Karl Karlberg. </p><h2>  Christina Church </h2><p>  Another interesting attraction of Gothenburg.  This is a German church - all services are held in German.  Christina Church, opened in 1748, is located in the city center.  It got its name in honor of the daughter of King Gustav II - Christina. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Church of Vasa </h2><p>  The monumental neo-Romanesque building with beautiful Art Nouveau elements was designed by architect Ingve Rasmussen in 1909.  The interior of the temple is dominated by a mural of the altar depicting the Ascension of Christ. </p><h2>  Skansen Cronan </h2><p>  What to see in Gothenburg lovers of history and fortifications?  Of course, the fortress.  Skansen Cronan is a (former) defensive fortress located in the Haga area.  It was built in 1689.  The author of the project was the architect Eric Dahlberg.  The fortress had 23 guns and was designed to repel the enemy.  True, she was never subjected to enemy attack. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.encirclephotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skansen Cronan Fortress" class="if uuid-2547232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2547232.jpg"></div><p>  In the 19th century, there was a prison bastion in the fortress.  In the XX century, a <span>military museum</span> was opened here <span>,</span> which presents uniforms and weapons of different eras. </p><h2>  Gunnebo House </h2><p>  If you want to understand how the Swedish nobility lived in the 18th century, visit Gunnebo‚Äôs house with its adjoining gardens.  In 1950, the refined interior of the palace was restored to its original form.  The estate includes the main building, a souvenir shop, a coffee shop and a restaurant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gunnebo House" class="if uuid-2547248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2547248.jpg"></div><p>  The gardens of the old estate can be divided into several zones: the most preserved baroque garden in Sweden, a garden with organic products and an organic farm, a landscape park.  Tourists claim that they were impressed by the cart ride through the gardens, which can be visited during the opening hours of the estate, and you can enter the master's house only with a guide.  The guide will tell you about the amazing story of the Hall family and showcase their magnificent home.  By the way, if you are interested in what to see in Gothenburg in winter, take note of this attraction.  During the celebration of Christmas, there is a noisy and festive Christmas market, and in summer often hosts open-air concerts. </p><h2>  Geta Alvbron Bridge </h2><p>  This attraction of Gothenburg is very proud of the townspeople.  The lifting post, which is located in the very center, plays an important role in the life of the city - tram transport routes pass along it, cars and pedestrians move along it.  The bridge was built in 1939, and after the reconstruction of 1966, it was significantly expanded.  The total length of the bridge is 927 meters with a width of 20 meters. </p><p>  It is especially beautiful in the evening and at night, when the design is colored with thousands of colorful lights. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  The sights of Gothenburg, including museums, are usually located in the city center, a short distance from each other.  For example, the archaeological museum, located in an architectural monument on the corner of Kungsortsavenien Boulevard, presents a brilliant collection of Scandinavian art from the end of the 19th century, as well as works by Zorn, Munch, Karl and Kreie Larsson.  In addition, there are paintings by Monet, Picasso, Rembrandt. </p><p>  Rehssa is a museum of applied arts and design, located nearby, on Vasagatan Street.  A large collection of contemporary design works by Swedish artists is exhibited here, exhibitions of folk art products are periodically held. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.katherinebelarmino.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gothenburg Museums" class="if uuid-2547279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2547279.jpg"></div><p>  Be sure to try to visit the recently opened museums of technology and scientific discoveries Universeum, as well as a museum of world culture.  The first combines exposure to science and technology.  The museum is located in the original building, which was designed by the Gothenburg architect Geert Wingord. </p><p>  The Museum of World Culture is located in an equally interesting building, which was designed by English architects Cecile Brisac and Edgar Gonzales. </p><h2>  What to see in Gothenburg with children? </h2><p>  In Sweden, they love children, so in almost every city there are many places where children of any age can have fun.  Parents and strangers will never make a remark to them.  The Swedes respond with a smile to any prank of children. </p><p>  At Universium, a large scientific and entertainment center, children will be interested in a huge oceanarium, where you can watch unusual underwater inhabitants for hours.  On the second floor you can stroll through a real rainforest with moist air and vines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goteborg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entertainment center &quot;Universium&quot;" class="if uuid-2547285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2547285.jpg"></div><p>  We are sure that the next attraction of Gothenburg - the Liseberg amusement park, operating since 1923, will really like the children.  From the beginning of April until the end of October, you can ride on the original swing and visit other attractions of the park.  In winter, folk festivals and sledding and ice skating are organized here.  In addition, a gnome house appears in the park, where both adults and children write letters with cherished desires. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement park Liseberg" class="if uuid-2547291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2547291.jpg"></div><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists warmly recall their trip to Gothenburg.  The sights of the city are interesting for both adult guests and young travelers.  You can come here in any season.  In the warmer months, Gothenburg is surrounded by greenery, and in winter turns into a fairy tale.  There are never any problems with accommodation: there are many hotels, prices are moderate. </p>
