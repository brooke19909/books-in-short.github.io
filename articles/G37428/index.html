Perhaps someone does not know how to make a beautiful photo of the repair.  In such cases, forums, social networks and sites are full of recommended articles on how to take photos.  In our article you will also find useful information. </p><h2>  What to photograph? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful photos" class="if uuid-2410131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2410131.jpg"></div><p>  The very first question that arises is how to take photos and how to make beautiful photos?  The choice of modern youth, and not only falls on simple smartphones.  Although often people buy cameras so that your favorite moments remain in your memory forever. </p><p>  Cole Rice, a well-known photographer, reveals small secrets of how to capture an event or person in a mobile version. </p><h2>  Cole Rice Tips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="atgbcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photography Tips" class="if uuid-2410134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2410134.jpg"></div><p>  The travel photographer has developed as many as 15 tips for those who cannot afford to buy an expensive professional camera and can only take photos on their mobile phones.  The information below will help you find answers to the question of how to make a beautiful photo: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Light and shadow.  Cole is recommended to change their places - replace the light with darker areas, and the shadow with lighter ones.  A lot of applications on smartphones have these functions, and they can be used to make the photo better.  You can also use filters to add warm tones to the picture. </li><li>  Vignette.  This technique is one of Cole's most beloved.  Its meaning is that it darkens the photo at the borders, while brightening the middle, which makes the photo much brighter. </li><li>  The effect of 50 percent.  It consists in editing the photo as you like best, and then reduce all changes by 50%.  The meaning is very simple: your photo will look more natural. </li><li>  People.  Photo landscapes will look boring if there are no people on it or at least one person. </li><li>  The scale.  Pictures look very impressive if they show the scale of architecture, natural beauty in relation to the person.  A person‚Äôs growth will show how huge something can be compared to him.  How to make a beautiful photo is the next question that many ask. </li><li>  Car window.  Have you ever tried to peek out a window during a trip and take a photo?  Not?  Try it, you can definitely like the result.  You will never know what you will succeed.  It‚Äôs best to use burst shooting. </li><li>  Display.  Have you noticed how beautiful it is sometimes to watch the sunset, especially if it is displayed in some body of water?  Try using a mirror, a car roof - whatever.  This will give your photo a highlight.  Even with the question of how to make a beautiful photo at home, you will have a large number of things with which you can display the object. </li><li>  Water.  Caution, you can wet your smartphone in this experiment.  But if you got a special waterproof case, then boldly lower the phone to the surface of the water - this will create an unusual and effective frame. </li><li>  Vertical photo.  If you need to upload photos to Instagram, set your smartphone to square images. </li><li>  Volume button.  If you are shooting horizontal shots, especially landscape shots, and you are not comfortable pressing the button, use the volume button.  It is much more convenient.  Thus, you guarantee that the effect of ‚Äúshaking hands‚Äù is avoided. </li><li>  Foreground.  It happens that an object needs to be brought to the fore without distracting objects.  This can be done by dropping the camera almost to the ground, which is guaranteed to give you a picture with the subject in the foreground. </li><li>  To attract attention.  Although this departs a little from our topic, it is also very relevant.  Many thieves have divorced in many countries, and everyone knows this.  Do not attract the attention of others with huge backpacks full of gadgets.  Also, do not film foreigners and people in principle without their permission. </li><li>  Bad weather.  Do not be afraid of rain or wind.  This is a great occasion to make the frame rare and unforgettable.  In addition, on cloudy days, pictures are obtained that are superior to those taken on a sunny day in regular and uniform shades.  How to take a beautiful photo in bad weather?  This is no longer a problem! <div class="photo" data-original="www.bergwelten.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bad weather" class="if uuid-2410136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2410136.jpg"></div></li><li>  Hotkeys.  There are times in life when the camera is needed immediately.  You saw an idol passing by on the street, and now he is flying in an airplane above you.  Use the hotkeys of your smartphone. </li><li>  Explore.  You cannot take new original pictures without exploring the world.  Look for new places, new territories, landscapes, architecture.  Go beyond your limits. </li></ul><p>  Thus, following all these tips, you can easily take photos using only your smartphone. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Publication </h2><p>  It is important to note that many photographers are in demand because they post their photos in a dosed manner.  This means that their work does not sink into the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãspam and is not lost among other similar works from the same series.  In this case, it will not be appreciated. </p><p>  Do not get carried away with just ‚Äúhome‚Äù photos, because the forums are full of messages on the type of how to make a beautiful photo at home.  This will not add originality to you, although some still succeed. </p><p>  Put photos 1-2 at a day and choose the most successful pictures. </p><h2>  Imprint </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The right angle" class="if uuid-2410139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77762/2410139.jpg"></div><p>  Some photographers use the fingerprint effect - apply a finger to the camera.  Thus, the image is blurry, but this is exactly what the specialists sought. </p><p>  It is worth considering that the print does not fit all types of photos.  For example, for photographing a natural landscape, this effect will be extremely inappropriate. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  You can take photos for yourself and for people, take pictures of anything, but when you do it not only with your soul, but also correctly, you will find not only universal recognition, but also good self-esteem. </p><p>  In addition, development in the field of photography helps a person discover new and unknown things - this is one of the best creative options for a hobby or even work to do. </p>
