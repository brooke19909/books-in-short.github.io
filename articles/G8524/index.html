Our tourists most often associate acquaintance with marine nature with their stay in Egypt, on the coast of the many-faced Red Sea (we are all used to this European name for this water surface).  It is curious that the Egyptians themselves, in turn, call it the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreen.  It turns out - no less than two - two opposite colors of the traffic light.  However, strangely enough, in Israel and in Jordan they call him in a completely different way: by the Reed Sea.  By the way, all of the above countries have ports and resorts where you can relax. </p>

    <p>  Recently, the political instability of Egypt is increasingly forcing tourists to consider alternative options for recreation.  This article does not pretend to be global, it tells about the rest in only one small three-star <span>hotel in Jordan</span> - a desert country that owns only 27 of the 1,500 kilometers of the coast of the Red (Green, Reed) sea.  Another thing is what this stretch of coast is!  Aqaba Bay (of the same name with the city, the center of the resort) is considered by scientists to be the most interesting and diverse water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Red Sea.  During the season, divers make about 250,000 dives here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate, geography </h2><p>  Guests Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba 3 * <span>(Jordan, Aqaba)</span> in their reviews speak very well about the climate of the resort.  Indeed, the mountains do not pass to the coastal patch of land both sultry desert air and seasonal cold winds. </p><p>  It is not surprising that in this climate a resort holiday on the Jordanian coast lasts a whole year.  The average daily temperature of the resort from October to April is approximately 24 <sup>0</sup> C, while the water temperature in the Gulf of Aqaba is an average of 21 <sup>0</sup> C. This is the most acceptable season for Europeans to relax.  However, there are even more tourists in Aqaba in the high season: from May to September, when even air conditioners can not cope with the heat in hotel rooms, and the air temperature for months is rarely below 33 <sup>0</sup> C. However, this is not critical for diving, because the water temperature in 27 <sup>0</sup> C is the most comfortable for diving. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  A small four-story hotel Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba 3 * (Jordan), containing 43 hotel rooms, was built in the center of Aqaba, on Alsaada Street, on the second line.  From it to the beach 7-8 minutes walk.  Newly arrived tourists usually arrive at the hotel after landing at the airport named after King Hussein and located 10 kilometers away. </p>

    <p>  Within walking distance from Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba there are the main attractions of the city: the picturesque white-white mosque of Hussein Bin-Ali, excavations of the ancient Roman city of Aipa, Al-Hammah-matal boulevard, Akkaba museum, the second highest flagpole in the world (130 m) with the flag of the Great Arab revolution, a local, very remarkable and comfortable city hammam, the ruins of an ancient church. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Externally, the hotel building looks awkward, but quite worthy.  It is universal: in it the hotel itself is thoughtfully adjacent to shops, social and cultural institutions.  The first floor has a ceiling height of one and a half, which makes it possible to create a stylish design in the reception area, other public places and in the hotel restaurant. </p><p>  The interior design of the hotel can perhaps be called classic.  The reception area was finished in combination: a spectacular, moderately presented decorative masonry of stone walls is adjacent to high-quality plaster.  Warm pastel colors: yellow and orange prevail.  The decoration is a lot of glass.  The floor is mostly light, tiled, with harmoniously alternating simple patterns. </p><p>  The design of the hotel rooms is a natural extension of the lobby's color scheme.  The furniture is new, the plumbing is solid. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to the efforts of the staff, significantly exceeds the level of "three-star" service of the hotel Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba 3 *.  Guest reviews about him are mostly positive.  And this is consistent with the statistics of the resort, because judging by the rating of Jordanian hotels (and there are 56 in Aqaba), Al Qydra occupies very worthy positions in the local resort business: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  first place by the criterion of "price / quality"; </li><li>  sixth place by the criterion of "family hotel"; </li><li>  eighth place on the criterion of "romantic hotel." </li></ul><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel complex Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba 3 * (Aqaba), renting rooms to its customers, has a pretty decent infrastructure.  Guests are served in the hotel restaurant.  The price of most tours includes "breakfast only", however, some guests book (with extra charge) half board. </p><p>  The hotel has an outdoor pool with loungers and umbrellas.  The hotel offers a hotel diving center, hairdresser, laundry, parking and car rental, tour desk, doctor's services, currency exchange. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  City hotel Al Qidra Hotel Suites Aqaba 3 * offers its guests the following types of rooms with air conditioning, balcony, satellite TV, Wi-Fi, tea and coffee making facilities and accessories: </p><ul><li>  Standard rooms are triple and double; </li><li>  deluxe rooms (superior) with a double or single bed; </li><li>  Junior Suite (one-room suite with zoning and latest-generation appliances); </li><li>  executive suite (two-room suite with latest generation appliances); </li><li>  family suite (three bedrooms, two rooms, two bathrooms, latest generation appliances). </li></ul>

    <p>  The minimum price of a tour with a weekly stay in a standard room in Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba 3 * and meals including breakfast is 46,116 rubles, half board in the same room will cost 51,177 rubles.  Suites and suites are naturally more expensive. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  In the northern part of the 27-km Jordanian resort coast, sandy beaches are located, in the southern - pebble beaches.  They are paid and free.  This refers to the paid right of presence.  After all, renting sun loungers and umbrellas on the free beaches costs the spa man $ 6 per day. </p><p>  Guests of Al Qidra Hotel Suites Aqaba 3 * respond positively to the various types of Aqaba beaches: municipal (free) and hotel.  For the most part (Slavic mentality) they choose the first type.  At the same time, they pay tribute - the Municipality of Aqaba takes proper care of the beach infrastructure.  There are souls, and changing rooms, and cafes, and toilets.  In addition, those swimming in the waters of such beaches have the opportunity to eat in the coastal cafe, ride a ‚Äúbanana‚Äù, ‚Äúcheesecake‚Äù, a water bike. </p><p>  Resorts (there are fewer of these), who value a secluded vacation, usually choose private, paid beaches.  To be fair, we note that the service received in this case is almost identical to the municipal one. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting: the restaurant of the hotel Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba 3 * is one of the best in the district.  And they cook there deliciously and adapted to the gastronomic tastes of Western tourists.  However, as mentioned above, only breakfast is included in the tour from the hotel.  Why is that?  Yes, because even the best chef is unable to compete with the oversaturated market of restaurant establishments. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the prices of tens and hundreds of local restaurants and cafes are quite suitable for daily meals, their menus are quite diverse.  In a word, a foodie, having flown to Jordan, will see a real gastronomic paradise. </p><p>  Therefore, we ask ourselves a more pragmatic question: what should a tourist taste in Jordan from local cuisine?  The answer may be quite specific: </p><ul><li>  side dish hummus (flavored chickpeas puree); </li><li>  mansaf (very gently cooked pieces of lamb with sour cream, almonds, parsley, rice); </li><li>  falafel (deep-fried various types of legumes); </li><li>  <span>sesame cookies</span> ; </li><li>  baklava from pistachios; </li><li>  pies local "kataef". </li></ul><p>  Do not neglect local coffee.  It is amazing here with the addition of cardamom. </p><h2>  Excursion </h2><p>  Guests of Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba 3 have the opportunity to use the tour services of the bureau of the hotel itself (which will cost more, since it uses the scheme of work of tour operators).  They can also use the services of specialized tour agencies (several of which are within walking distance), which will bring savings of 35-40%. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, tourists are in demand for the following excursions in the Jordanian land: </p><ul><li>  the remarkably preserved Ottoman fortress of the 16th century, next to which is the local museum of local lore; </li><li>  Petra - a city carved into the rocks; </li><li>  for divers, cult flagship Cedar Pride, specially flooded for them at an accessible depth by order of the Prince of Jordan, will become cult objects; </li><li>  for lovers of nature, the picturesque Mujib nature reserve, in the west washed by the Dead Sea (located 400 m below sea level), and in the east turning into mountain ranges fancifully altered by wind erosion, will be a desirable place; </li><li>  Lot's cave (the one mentioned in the Bible). </li></ul><p>  By the way, just from the upper floors of the hotel you can see the nearby lands of Egypt and Israel. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Of course, tourists, leaving for the "non-close world" always, except for a purely resort holiday, count on some special purchases that they cannot make at home.  What can be said about this, based on the experience of being in Jordan?  Judging by the reviews of guests of Al Qidra Hotel Aqaba 3 *, they pulled out a lucky ticket for shopping.  Moreover, the same phrase in various interpretations is also conveyed by guest reviews of various Aqaba hotels.  The thing is that this resort is considered a duty-free zone. </p>

    <p>  Experienced shopaholics advise homegrown brand connoisseurs to shop mainly in Aqaba shopping centers: </p><ul><li>  Aqaba Gateway. </li><li>  Dream Mall. </li><li>  Shweikh Mall. </li><li>  City Center Mall. </li></ul><p>  In local markets, it is worth buying as souvenirs and not only: </p><ul><li>  dozens of types of local nuts; </li><li>  Jordanian coffee (this is something!); </li><li>  oriental sweets. </li></ul><p>  Finally, you can purchase a small pretty bottle with its earth from a handicraft merchant in memory of Jordan: natural multi-colored sand, poured so that a bizarre pattern forms.  Generally speaking, the assortment of ‚Äúpurely Jordanian‚Äù souvenirs is impressive: woven carpets, traditional Dead Sea cosmetics, copper dishes, items made of Nabataean or Hebron glass, Bedouin handmade, old coins, elegant stone figures, hookah, national embroidery. </p><p>  Believers usually get here a bottle made in the shape of a cross, filled with holy Jordanian water. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Judging by the responses of experienced holiday-makers, a good option for a <span>holiday in Jordan</span> is a tour to the Al Qidra Hotel Suites Aqaba 3 * hotel.  Responses of vacationers emphasize the powerful and yet not fully disclosed resort potential of this unique and rich region, which received a powerful impetus for development at the end of the 20th century (only in the 90s Aqaba was provided with energy carriers, i.e., they carried out oil and gas). </p>
