Many people think that it is much easier nowadays to buy knitted hats or socks for children in stores than to make them with your own hands, but masters will not agree with this conclusion.  After all, experts in their field would rather like to come up with a pattern on their own and bring it to life.  Therefore, the article will focus on self-knitting of children's socks.

    <h2></h2><h2>  How to start work and how to organize a workplace? </h2><p>  The place where a person is going to bring his fantasies to life should be with excellent lighting.  In poor lighting, vision can deteriorate, and knitting children's socks with knitting needles will not be convenient, since you can skip some kind of loop.  You need to sit straight, preferably touching the back of the chair with your body.  The distance from work to the eyes should be at least thirty centimeters.  It must be adhered to in order to avoid the development of myopia and so that particles of hair do not get into the eyes.  Before knitting and after, you need to wash your hands so that the yarn and thread remain always clean. </p><h2><br>  How to choose the right knitting needles? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit socks on two knitting needles" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/347714.jpg?1393966161443" width="236"></div></h2><p>  One of the main tools of knitters are knitting needles.  Knitting needles can be: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  wooden; </li><li>  steel; </li><li>  bone </li><li>  aluminum; </li><li>  plastic. </li></ul><p>  Knitting needles are absolutely smooth.  Indeed, in order to knit beautiful children's <span>socks with knitting needles, a</span> person needs to have high-quality materials.  If the spokes have burrs, then certain inconveniences may occur during operation.  The loops should easily slide on the knitting needles, otherwise you will often have to be distracted from the knitting process itself in order to correct the position of the thread on the knitting needles.  Each type of knitting needle has its advantages and disadvantages.  If a knitter needs thin knitting needles, then steel is the best choice.  They are durable and quite solid.  Thick steel knitting needles are inconvenient to use because they are heavy enough.  If for knitting it is necessary to take thick knitting needles, then it is better to choose bone or wooden.  In no case is it recommended to take aluminum knitting needles for knitting light products, as they can easily stain your creation.  There are also knitting needles by number.  For example, No. 5 has a diameter of 5 mm.  In order for the product to stretch well, thick knitting needles are usually taken.  If a person wants to eventually get the product tight enough, then you need to choose thin knitting needles.  To start knitting baby socks with knitting needles, you need to purchase special hosiery knitting needles.  Typically, in stores such a kit consists of 5 pairs.  In the process of knitting, loops on 4 knitting needles are distributed, and the 5th is carefully knit.  With such knitting needles it is very convenient to knit not only socks, but also gloves and mittens. </p><h2><br>  How to choose the yarn (thread)? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby socks knitting patterns" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/347719.jpg?1393966196219" width="395"></div></h2><p>  In ordinary hand knitting, many types of yarn are used: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  cotton; </li><li>  Woolen </li><li>  synthetic; </li><li>  flaxseed. </li></ul><p>  If a person is going to knit a specific product, then it should be borne in mind that the more correctly yarn is chosen, the better quality and appearance of the finished product.  For this reason, it is necessary to know the characteristics of the most common types of yarn.  Woolen yarn simply retains heat superbly.  The range of application of this type of thread is quite diverse.  They are used to create women's, men's and children's pullovers, hats, scarves and mittens are also knitted.  Woolen threads for knitting are made of wool and synthetic fibers.  A product knitted from this type of yarn will be particularly durable.  Yarn does not fall off.  For this reason, sometimes she is given a much greater preference than wool.  Knitting children's socks with knitting needles will not take away a lot of time from the mother-needlewoman, and the baby will have original and unique socks.  Linen and cotton yarn is very pleasant for the body and hygienic.  It is used to make children's summer clothes.  From such yarn you can knit excellent openwork children's socks with knitting needles. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The technique of knitting children's socks </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit baby socks with knitting needles" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/347716.jpg?1393966223977" width="350"></div></h2><p>  We knit socks on five knitting needles, although you can knit baby socks on two knitting needles.  When choosing a loop, you need to take into account that their number must be a multiple of four.  On average, you need from 50 g to 150 g of yarn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2></h2><h2>  The correct calculation of knitting children's socks </h2><p>  In order to know exactly the number of loops that you need to dial at the very beginning of the work, you will need to take two measurements: </p><ul><li>  bone circumference; </li><li>  leg circumference. </li></ul><p>  So, you need to add up these 2 measures.  Divide the result by 2. Then you need to determine the density of knitting by 1 cm (2.5 loops per 1 cm), after which you can dial the desired number of loops.  Usually, this number is 36 loops.  It is better to take knitting needles No. 1,5.  Each spoke should have 9 stitches. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Start knitting </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork baby knitting socks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/347715.jpg?1393966314650" width="600"></div></h2><p>  How to knit children's socks with knitting needles will be discussed in more detail below.  It is necessary to start knitting with an elastic band 1 x 1. Initially, you should measure the end of the thread, which will be equal in length to two knitting needles.  For two knitted together, knitting needles must be 36 loops of the initial row.  To these 36 loops, you need to add 1 additional loop, which will serve to close in a circle.  Then you need to free one knitting needle and knit a tight row with an elastic band 1 x 1. In the process of knitting, it is necessary to distribute the loops on 4 knitting needles.  This is done, as with the knitting of children's mittens.  Then you should close in exactly the same way (as the end of 1 row) knitting in a circle.  Next, you need to knit 4 cm with an elastic band 1 x 1. When 4 cm of elastic is tied, you need to go to hosiery and knit 1.5 cm. </p><h2></h2><h2>  <span>How to knit a</span> heel in a sock? </h2><p>  Professionals need only a few hours to knit children's socks with knitting needles.  Difficulties do not arise at any stage.  Knitting a heel only seems difficult, in fact, it is quite simple. </p><p>  She knits on two knitting needles.  3rd and 4th knitting needles do not participate at all in the heel formation itself.  It is necessary to add 1 loop to the calcaneal knitting needles, while it is necessary to remove 1 loop from the 3rd and 4th knitting needles.  It turns out that on the calcaneal knitting needles 1 loop was added, and on the 3rd and 4th - it decreased. </p><p>  The number of edge loops should be equal to the number of loops that are located on 1 spoke.  In this case, there should be 8 edge loops.  It is better to start knitting the heel height from the wrong side, and to finish - the front side. </p><p>  As a result, the canvas must be given the usual shape of the heel. </p><h2></h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting baby socks" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11346/347718.jpg?1393966244857" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  How can I <span>knit socks</span> with 2 knitting needles? </h2><p>  As you can see, you can easily and quickly knit baby socks with knitting needles.  Schemes are fairly easy to find in specialized stores, magazines or on Internet sites.  But an experienced knitter can independently come up with them.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter, the socks will be knitted on four or two knitting needles. </p><p>  To create socks on two knitting needles, before starting work, measure the size of the trace with a centimeter tape, after which it is necessary to determine the number of loops that will need to be put on the knitting needles.  To start, you need to knit a sock in the middle of the track in the expanded form. </p><p>  Initially, you need to dial a certain number of loops, knit 5 cm of the trace with ordinary stocking.  Then you need to start knitting with absolutely any pattern of the upper part of the sock.  In the middle of the canvas, you must first mark 2 pairs of loops with colored thread.  From marked loops to the left and right, it is necessary to shorten the loops.  The reduction should be done to a height of 10 cm. Then you need to add 6-8 loops at regular intervals and knit with an even cloth to the required height of the sock.  Further, the fabric is neatly folded in half and sewn with a hook or a needle, without having to tighten the seam. </p><p>  We knit socks on two knitting needles and simultaneously decorate them with beautiful patterns.  You can, for example, use openwork crochet, rhinestones and other decorations.  To create beautiful products you need knitting needles, yarn and a great imagination of a specialist.  The result is unique, superior socks. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How to care for woolen knitwear? </h2>
