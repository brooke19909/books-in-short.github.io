In this segment dozens of manufacturing companies successfully operate, annually producing dozens of models with different technical parameters, presented in different price segments.  How is a customer who wants to purchase an electronic gadget able to figure out all of this assortment?  How can he know which of the available phones will best meet his expectations, preferences and, most importantly, will suit him in terms of the ratio of its cost and functionality? </p><p>  Of course, each of the manufacturers tries to influence the client through the media, with the help of various marketing tricks, sometimes - even attributing to the mobile phone those characteristics that it does not possess.  True, those gadgets that do not meet the user's expectations are simply not included in the list of ‚ÄúMost Popular Phones‚Äù. </p><h2>  Secret of success </h2><p>  By analyzing gadgets that have become more or less popular, we can trace some patterns that clearly affect this.  With their help, you can understand what is the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù that allows you to determine the most popular mobile phones.  And, broadly speaking, we can say that we know him. </p><p>  This is the ideal ratio of different characteristics of the smartphone model. </p><p>  For example, the ratio of quality, design and technical parameters to the cost of the device.  Combining each of these criteria allows you to determine which most popular phone is on the market today, as well as why it has become so. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, stylish, ‚Äúnimble‚Äù in their work (having a powerful processor), affordable devices that have an appropriate (high) build quality are very popular.  Only such a gadget can be called the ‚ÄúMost Popular Phone of the Year‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  In this article, we will introduce you to devices that have already earned such a title.  They are actively bought by users who know what goals they are pursuing and what they want to get from this device in the end.  Thus, one buyer may prefer a more affordable gadget, wanting to save money on its purchase, and the other will appreciate the technology and wide functionality in the smartphone, allowing you to enjoy new options with it. </p><h2>  How will we share? </h2><p>  Given all this, as well as different price categories, which include the most popular phones, we suggest constructing this rating article based on a simple but effective classification.  It is guided mainly by the cost criterion of the model.  Thus, in the article we will share the most popular brands of phones, depending on which price class this or that model can be attributed to.  The most appropriate, probably, is the separation by marks of 10, 20, 30 thousand rubles.  They allow you to more or less form similar groups of devices that are most in demand.  Well, let's start the characterization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Category ‚Äúup to 10 thousand‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  First of all, of course, we will present the most accessible representatives of the ‚ÄúMost Popular Phones‚Äù rubric, the price of which does not exceed the bar of 10 thousand rubles.  This includes representatives of the most famous brands in the world: Samsung, LG, Lenovo and others.  Of the many Chinese smartphones that are in the same category that are in high demand, we could not be found.  Therefore, we present the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù models that deserve attention. </p>

    <p>  The most affordable of them can be called the representative of the Lumia line of models promoted by Nokia.  At a price of only 4 thousand rubles, the device has a 4-inch TFT-display with a resolution of 854 by 480 pixels, 512 megabytes of RAM and a 4-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz.  With these parameters, as well as having a battery capacity of 1430 mAh, the device has every chance of being presented as the most popular phone in Russia, operating <span>on the basis of Windows Phone.</span>  Especially ‚Äútasty‚Äù in it is, of course, the price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The second representative of the market, which is also affordable, but of Korean origin, is the <span>Samsung Galaxy Star Plus.</span>  The device has all the same 512 MB of RAM, a TFT screen, as well as a 1500 mAh battery.  Its cost is 4,500 rubles, which allows us to talk about some kind of competition with the Lumia described above. </p><h2>  IPS displays </h2><p>  Do not think that all the popular ‚Äústate employees‚Äù are offered to the buyer with a lower-quality TFT-screen.  In fact, there are many examples of IPS display implementation on the same affordable device.  For example, this is the Lenovo S660.  The device is endowed with a powerful 3000 mAh battery, a more colorful screen and a <span>MediaTek MT6582M processor.</span>  With such characteristics, the phone is offered for 9-10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Another interesting model that is popular is the LG L90.  The smartphone will cost you 9 thousand, but it also has a hardy battery (2540 mAh), a 4.7-inch IPS display and a Qualcomm processor with 4 cores. </p><h2>  Category ‚Äúfrom 10 to 20 thousand‚Äù </h2><p>  The most popular phones were presented above, the cost of which did not exceed the mark of 10 thousand rubles.  Now it's time to talk about more expensive devices.  These include, in particular, Explay Dream and LG Nexus 5. The first one is priced at 12 thousand rubles, having a 2000 mAh battery, the ‚Äúheart‚Äù MT6589T (4 cores of 1.5 GHz each), a 5-inch display with a resolution 1920 by 1080 pixels.  The second has the same screen, but is equipped with a more powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor. This model sells for 20 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Former flagships </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to such a category of popular gadgets as the once-famous and advanced ‚Äúflagships‚Äù.  Apple, for example, is considered the 4th generation model (iPhone 4 / 4S), and Samsung - Galaxy S4.  The latter, of course, boasts a more powerful battery and technical specifications of the platform on which the gadget operates.  Speaking about the product with an apple on the back cover, we mean the pinnacle of style and technological progress that its development company has made in recent years. </p><h2>  Category ‚Äúfrom 20 to 30 thousand‚Äù </h2><p>  More expensive are the most popular phones priced up to 30 thousand rubles.  This includes mainly models that follow the flagship version in the developer's lineup.  For example, such is the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Alpha. </p><p>  In all its parameters, it could claim the title of ‚Äúflagship‚Äù: a display with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels, a powerful processor with 4 cores, each of which has a clock frequency of 1.8 GHz;  as well as 4 cores with a frequency of 1.3 GHz;  2 GB of RAM and a battery for 1860 mAh.  Another feature that can be attributed to this device is a high-tech and stylish appearance (this effect is achieved due to the metal case of the device).  A price of 22 thousand rubles for such a model can be called democratic. </p><p>  In addition to Alpha, in our category, where the most popular phones are presented, there are also LG G3 (3000 mAh for the battery is an essential parameter), a Snapdragon 801 processor (the most powerful among devices of this class today), a colorful display with a resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels. </p><p>  Popular (from this category) are also considered HTC One M8 (once the flagship of the Taiwanese corporation at a price of 25 thousand) with its similar processor as that of the G3 and a simpler display. </p><p>  And, of course, you can not miss the sensational at the time of release flagship Galaxy S5.  This model, priced at 24 thousand rubles, boasts 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal memory, a Snapdragon 801 processor. This is the most popular phone (Android) among all in its segment. </p><p>  Not without phones running on Windows Phone.  In particular, we are talking about the popular Nokia Lumia 930 model. The phone has a bright screen, stylish design (their proprietary multi-colored lining on the case is bright and bold), a high-tech filling (the same Snapdragon) and an attractive price of 25 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Category ‚Äúover 30 thousand‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  The most expensive are traditionally models, the price tag of which exceeds the mark of 30 thousand rubles.  First of all, these are the newest and most popular versions from such ‚Äúflagship‚Äù manufacturers as Samsung and Apple.  Therefore, this includes the Apple iPhone 5S (whose price is about 33 thousand rubles), iPhone 6 (42 thousand and above), as well as 6S (46-48 thousand rubles apiece).  These are the latest products from leading mobile industry leader Apple.  As for the Korean concern, we can recall such products as the Samsung Galaxy S6 (about 40-42 thousand rubles) and Samsung Note 4 (the price is the same).  These are the most powerful and most high-tech smartphones that meet all the requirements of the market.  The latest models developed by this company are in no way inferior in their indicators (both in terms of capabilities and from the perspective of design) to the same ‚Äúapple‚Äù one. </p><h2>  Keyboard Phones Category </h2><p>  In the article, as you can see, the emphasis was placed on smartphones - devices with a touch screen, processor and a full-fledged operating system.  Now I would like to name the most popular cell phones.  In this context, it is precisely the keyboard devices of the ‚Äúobsolete‚Äù pattern (as many call them). </p>

    <p>  Among those, the most famous are Nokia.  Nokia 515, 220, 230, 225 models are today the best-selling devices on the market among keyboard phones.  They are followed by the lesser-known TeXet TM-229, DEXP Larus B1, Sigma mobile X-treme DZ67.  These phones can be called very convenient to use, inexpensive and practical in everyday life.  You can also mention Alcatel One Touch 1009X, <span>Samsung S5611,</span> FLY TS111 and so on. </p><p>  These phones, as a rule, are used as an "additional" in tandem with the main smartphone.  Often they are taken for the opportunity to call the numbers of different operators in order to, therefore, save on communication services. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  Having characterized a large number of phone models, we can conclude that there are different directions, different criteria for assessing how this or that gadget suits the user or not.  Therefore, choosing a device for yourself, you should clearly understand what qualities it should possess and should be offered at a price.  And then you just need to search a bit to find the best option for yourself. </p><p>  Nobody can know in advance how this or that device will show itself in practice.  Therefore, we recommend that in the process of choosing a model pay attention to its sellability and reviews of those who have already purchased one. </p>
