    <h2>  Prospects </h2><p>  Once, the city authorities planned the construction of the second exit of Art.  "Borovitskaya", which was supposed to serve as passengers also by transfer to other metro stations.  But, as it turned out later, such a construction was completely inexpedient, so they soon turned up from this idea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Interesting to know </h2><p>  It turns out that when the construction of the station began, the workers excavated an old house of the nineteenth century at a depth of five meters.  It still remains a mystery what the purpose of this building was, and most importantly - by whom it was erected.  But what was most surprising was that all the things and furniture in the house were completely untouched by anyone. </p><p>  Therefore, it was decided that a museum would be established in this place.  But all the people who were near this building began to feel badly in a strange way, and some even lost consciousness.  As a result, the house was dismantled and taken far beyond the capital. </p><p>  Such a wonderful location right in the heart of the capital gives Borovitskaya metro station a large number of historical sights located next to it.  The main ones are, of course, <span>Red Square</span> and the Kremlin building, since every centimeter of these places is fraught with the history of our country.  In addition, not far from this metro station, Alesandrovsky Park is located - a favorite place for both citizens and visitors to Moscow.  It was founded in the twenties of the nineteenth century. </p><p>  Also nearby is a temple built in the name of the Holy Martyr Antipas Bishop, the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ.  In addition, there are well-known cultural institutions, such as: Moscow Memorial Museum.  A.N.  Scriabin and the Gogol House library, four cinemas, many children's centers, nightclubs, cafes and restaurants, as well as a huge number of all kinds of supermarkets, shops and various travel agencies. </p>
