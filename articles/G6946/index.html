    <h2>  About the field of activity </h2><p>  This is a <span>non-state pension fund</span> that has existed in Russia for a long time.  It was founded back in 1994.  For 22 years it has been offering the population pension insurance services. </p><p>  <span>The non-state pension fund</span> "Gazfond" is a place that promises to preserve the pension savings of citizens.  Also, one of the organization's tasks is to insignificantly increase pension savings.  Upon retirement, Gazfond begins to pay its funded part.  Nothing suspicious. </p><h2>  Spread </h2><p>  How common is the studied NPF?  This question is also of interest to many citizens.  After all, small non-state pension funds in Russia have recently been closed. </p><p>  Fortunately, Gazfond is an organization whose branches are distributed throughout the country.  The head office is in Moscow.  But NPF branches can be found even in the smallest village.  These are not scammers, but a large company offering public insurance services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  What can be said about the rating of the organization?  What place among similar companies does the non-state pension fund Gazfond take? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf gas fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1500762.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is no unequivocal opinion here.  But one thing is clear - the organization is among the ten leaders among non-state pension funds.  In some sources, the company is located in 3-4 places, somewhere it is indicated that it is located in 5-7 places. </p><p>  It‚Äôs enough to remember only that ‚ÄúGazfond‚Äù is one of the largest non-state pension funds in Russia, which is included in the Top-10 of the best companies offering services to the population to form the funded part of the pension. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  The next important indicator is the level of reliability.  It is also called a trust.  It usually shows how much the population trusts the company.  And the stability of her work, too. </p><p>  NPF "Gazfond" has the highest reliability of all existing to date.  The trust rating is set to A ++ (or AAA).  That is why the organization receives positive feedback from the population.  People believe in the integrity of the fund, and also trust it with their pension savings.  After all, Gazfond is a very stable organization, which obviously will not be closed suddenly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  Fund returns are constantly changing.  And for her, "Gazfond" reviews are mixed.  The population indicates that there is profitability, but it is much less than promised.  The selected fund is not very suitable for increasing pension savings. </p><p>  Why?  According to statistics, the profitability of the organization remains at a very low level.  For example, in 2012 it amounted to 4.17%, and in 2014 - 2.72%.  Therefore, the exact return is difficult to name.  Many are advised to focus on 5-7%.  These are the indicators most often featured in the entire history of the Gas Fund. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  <span>The non-state pension fund "Gazfond"</span> receives various reviews.  There are good ones among them, and not so much.  The main thing is that lawyers assure that this fund works according to the law.  Here, customers say, quite often there are delays in the payment of pension savings.  But at the same time, the money is still given to the owners. </p><p>  The good news is that the employees of the Gazfond are always ready to help visitors.  They answer all questions in the most understandable language.  The organization also has a "Personal Account" for remote work.  Many indicate that this service does not work well. </p><p>  Gazfond is a very good place to preserve pension savings.  Consider this organization as an organization that can be trusted with a future pension, is clearly worth it. </p>
