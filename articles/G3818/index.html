    <p>  The climate of this country is mainly tropical monsoon.  However, in the north it looks more like subtropical, and in the south it looks more like sub-equatorial.  There are no significant temperature changes during the year.  In the north, the hottest season lasts from May to October.  The temperature in this period, as a rule, rises to 30-33 ¬∞ C.  Heat lovers are best to go to Vietnam in July-August (this applies to the north of the country).  In the south, temperatures are relatively stable throughout the year.  This gives tourists the opportunity to come constantly to Vietnam.  Holidays in July here will be as good as, for example, in October.  Moreover, regardless of the month, the average humidity is about 80%.  In addition, an amazing feature is that in all regions of the country there are both dry and rainy seasons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2>

    <p>  If we talk about the features of a <span>beach holiday</span> in this part of Indochina, then, on the one hand, because of the high temperature indicators, it might seem to someone that summer is not the best time to visit these places.  Those who travel to Vietnam in July should be prepared for the fact that, in addition to high air temperatures, they can expect quite a high level of precipitation.  Humidity on the coast during this period can reach 80-90%. </p><p>  On the other hand, at this time the water warms up very much, its temperature is able to rise to 29 ¬∞ C.  This makes it possible to completely calmly swim for everyone.  In addition, do not forget that holidays in Vietnam in July are quite budgetary, since summer in Southeast Asia is officially considered a low season.  During this period, there has been a significant reduction in prices, there are no problems with booking hotels on the beach, and in the struggle for the attention of tourists, many companies are ready to provide the highest level of service.  At the same time, for the most comfortable beach holiday, tour operators advise choosing southeast and central Vietnam in July. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  List of the best places for a beach holiday </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vietnam vacation in july" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11964/437787.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><p>  One of the best places to stay at this time is the small city of Hoi An, which is located in the middle of the country, on the coast of the <span>Gulf of Tonkin.</span>  In July, the weather is very hot, and the rainfall reaches only 110-150 mm.  The air temperature warms up to 30-32 ¬∞ C, and the water temperature - up to 25-28 ¬∞ C.  In addition to Hoi An, those who want to go to Vietnam in July should pay attention to one of the most famous sea resorts - Nha Trang - and the tourist capital of the country - Mui Ne.  These cities are located closer to the central part, and the air temperature in the middle of summer rises here to 27-30 ¬∞ .  As for sea water, it manages to warm up to 28-29 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Sightseeing vacation </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to vietnam in july" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11964/437790.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  Resting in the hot summer months on the tropical coast, do not forget about the excellent opportunity to visit a large number of Asian temples and a variety of architectural monuments.  Such an abundance is primarily due to the fact that this is an original country, characterized by a very rich culture, in which philosophy and four directions in religion are intertwined (Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Taoism).  Arriving in Vietnam in July, you should definitely visit the amazingly beautiful Halong Bay, which is home to the mythological dragon, which is one of the varieties of the <span>Loch Ness monster.</span>  Here you can also watch a puppet show, find out the characteristic features of silk painting and plunge into the world of national dances.  In addition, any tourist planning a vacation in Vietnam in July should definitely look at the famous Marble Mountains, which formed from the islands, or take a tour along the unique <span>Mekong River.</span> </p>
