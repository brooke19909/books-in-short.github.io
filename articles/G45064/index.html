Micro four thirds system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Micro Four Thirds System is the most common system portable camera format developed jointly by Panasonic and Olympus.  He entered the market for mirrorless cameras and lenses for them at least a year before the appearance of the first real competitor.  Superiority and the presence of not one, but two major manufacturers - the main advantage of MFT technology.  This becomes apparent, for example, when comparing lens catalogs.  Micro 4: 3 has more than 75 options for optics manufactured by Panasonic and Olympus, as well as by third-party manufacturers, including Sigma, Tamron, Samyang, Voigtlander and others. This provides a large selection.  Therefore, you should follow the advice of professionals to make the right decisions about buying the best MFT lenses.  Below are the most worthy models produced in accordance with this standard.  Using adapters on the Micro 4: 3 allows you to install optics with mounts Leica M, Four Thirds and Olympus OM. </p><h2>  Leica 200mm ∆í2.8 </h2><p>  This is a silent telephoto lens for mirrorless cameras Panasonic and Olympus, in which its focal length equivalent reaches 400 mm.  Mounted using standard Micro 4: 3 mount.  The optical quality of near and far objects is excellent throughout the frame, even with a wide aperture, and a minimum focusing distance of just over 1 m allows you to shoot impressive close-ups.  Leica also includes a 1.4x tele-converter, which turns the lens into ∆í4 / 280 mm (560 mm equivalent).  This essentially corresponds to the coverage and aperture of the Olympus 300mm ∆í4, and in many respects corresponds to its quality.  Such flexibility while maintaining a high standard attracts many.  If the budget allows, and preference is given to the focal length of 200‚Äì280 mm, rather than 300 mm, then this lens is an excellent addition to the system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Leica DG Elmarit 200mm f / 2.8" class="if uuid-2637825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2637825.jpg"></div><h2>  Leica DG 8-18mm ∆í2.8-4 </h2><p>  This is the fourth Micro 4: 3 ultra-wide zoom lens and arguably the most compelling to date.  Although it cannot be scaled like the Olympus and Lumix 7-14 mm models, the additional coverage at the longer end makes it more flexible, and many photographers have appreciated the ability to install standard (or even serious ND) filters without vignetting, especially those which use a long exposure.  The Leica wide-aperture lens may not be as sharp in the corners as the Olympus 7-14mm, and it does not have a constant aperture value, but in turn it is smaller, lighter and cheaper.  The model surpasses the older Lumix 7-14mm ∆í4, avoiding its problems with purple artifacts.  Considering fast and quiet focusing, a sealed body with smooth adjustment rings, this is a lens that is easy to recommend.  According to user reviews, it is their favorite ultra-wide zoom for Panasonic and Olympus cameras, as well as a tempting upgrade for owners of Lumix 7-14mm ∆í4 or Olympus 9-18mm. </p><h2>  Leica DG 100-400mm ∆í4-6.3 </h2><p>  This is the super telephoto zoom for the Micro 4: 3 system.  Designed for Olympus and Panasonic Lumix housings, the lens provides an equivalent range of 200-800mm with wider coverage than any other optics, making it ideal for wildlife photographers.  It features high quality lenses and assemblies compared to existing telephoto lenses, although it costs much more.  A cheaper alternative is still the unsurpassed Lumix 100-300mm, but if Leica can afford it, you should ask yourself whether it is worth a little closer to the Olympus 300mm ∆í4 Prime.  But if you need high-quality super-telephonic zoom, then this model will provide everything you need, filling in an important gap in the MFT catalog. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dpreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Leica Summilux 12mm F1.4" class="if uuid-2637830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2637830.jpg"></div><h2>  Leica DG 12mm ∆í1.4 </h2><p>  This is a high-end lens for MFT housings that provides classic 24mm coverage.  Olympus and Samyang offer cheaper and lighter small 12mm optics, but Summilux is a step brighter, sharper in corners at maximum aperture, and the only one that has dust and splash protection.  It is about twice as expensive as the Olympus, so you need to make sure that its benefits will be in demand.  Ultimately, Summilux is a premium silent lens that does what is required of it and is a welcome addition to the extensive MFT catalog. </p><h2>  Olympus 8mm ∆í1.8 Fisheye </h2><p>  This is the first fisheye lens with a f1.8 relative aperture, which allows you to shoot in low light conditions without increasing sensitivity.  Even with a full aperture, the optics provide very clear details in the corners, making it a great choice for interior photography.  It is great for action and extreme sports, shooting still images and videos, especially since its body is protected from dust and moisture.  Many are skeptical about the appropriateness of this type of lens, but Fisheye gives much more than expected thanks to aperture ratio, quality and assembly.  They make it much more flexible than low-light models.  An alternative is the inexpensive Samyang 8mm ∆í3.5 lens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympus 7-14mm f / 2.8 PRO" class="if uuid-2637832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2637832.jpg"></div><h2>  Olympus 7-14mm ∆í2.8 </h2><p>  The ultra-wide zoom provides a range of 14‚Äì28 mm (equivalent) with a constant f2.8 relative aperture.  Its characteristics correspond to the Lumix G 7-14mm, but it is brighter and boasts protection from adverse weather conditions.  Like the Lumix G, the built-in lens hood means that there is no standard filter thread at the front, but you can purchase lens adapters from other manufacturers (such as Lee).  A large diaphragm and a stiffer design means that it is larger, heavier and more expensive than its counterpart.  Nevertheless, the lens was a step forward in all respects, and it is devoid of the violet glare that Lumix suffers on some cases. </p><h2>  Lumix 30mm ∆í2.8 Macro </h2><p>  It is undeniable that this is the most profitable high-end macrooptics.  This is arguably the cheapest way to enjoy true 1: 1 auto-focus on one of the best Micro 4: 3 lenses, and it seems the manufacturer has not compromised on quality.  The only drawback of the model, users consider the lack of a focus limiter, which could improve the AF speed for pictures other than macro, but even with a full focus range, the AF works quite quickly.  Considering that close to standard coverage makes the model the most flexible of the 3 MFT macro lenses, it is a very attractive option for Panasonic or Olympus owners interested in close-up shots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic LUMIX G 42.5mm f / 1.7" class="if uuid-2637834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2637834.jpg"></div><h2>  Panasonic Lumix G 42.5mm ∆í1.7 </h2><p>  This is a short telephoto lens that resists the hugely popular Olympus 45mm ∆í1.8.  In user tests, Lumix provides greater clarity in angles at large apertures and is able to focus much closer, performing a dual function as the main macro lens.  It has optical stabilization (for owners of Panasonic housings without such functionality).  Although in many tests the lens is superior to Olympus, the lens provides better visualization of out-of-focus areas and is usually sold at a great discount.  Both models are a great choice, and professionals highly recommend them. </p><h2>  Olympus 40-150mm ∆í2.8 Pro </h2><p>  This is a high-end telephoto lens with a constant f2.8 relative aperture.  The range of 80-300 mm (in 50 mm equivalent) is ideal for portrait and street photography, as well as wildlife photography and sporting events.  The lens works fast, it is dustproof and waterproof, and provides very sharp and high-contrast images in the corners, even at maximum aperture.  The focal range is much longer than that of the competing Lumix 35-100mm ∆í2.8, although its physical dimensions are larger.  Many people prefer to shoot with faster aperture optics in order to achieve a lower depth of field, but if the capabilities of the lens seem sufficient, then it is worth including it in your collection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dpreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Leica DG Summilux 15mm F1.7" class="if uuid-2637837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2637837.jpg"></div><h2>  Panasonic Leica 15mm ∆í1.7 </h2><p>  This is a high-quality universal general-purpose lens for Olympus and Panasonic cameras, the price of which is lower than alternative options.  Its focal length equivalent to 30 mm in full-frame format is unique.  However, it is ideal for universal optics.  The lens is a bit wide for traditional portraits, but landscapes, architecture and even pictures with a shallow depth of field are within its competence, and optical quality is a step forward compared to alternatives with the same focal length.  Professionals advise using Summimux 15mm if the budget allows, instead of the cheaper Olympus 17mm ∆í1.8.  This is especially true for owners of GM1 or GM5, as they blend well.  If the Olympus Micro 4: 3 17mm ∆í1.8 lens is already there, then Panasonic is hardly worth buying.  Of course, his optics are a little better, but not enough to replace an alternative model. </p><h2>  Panasonic Leica 25mm ∆í1.4 </h2><p>  This is a standard Micro 4: 3 lens with an effective focal length of 50 mm.  He was the second model released by Panasonic under the Leica brand for the MFT.  Leica is developing optics, and Panasonic is producing them in Japan.  Build quality and adjustment ring are of high standard and provide excellent results.  The relative aperture allows you to work in low light and get a shallow depth of field, which is great for close-up portraits.  According to the owners, it is easier for them to photograph portraits of children with this lens than with longer focal lengths.  However, some Olympus camera users report random noise during frame composition when adjusting aperture.  Several 25 mm variants are now available for the Micro Four Thirds, but many still remain faithful to this old but solid model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Leica DG Nocticron 42.5mm f / 1.2" class="if uuid-2637840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2637840.jpg"></div><h2>  Panasonic Leica 42.5mm ∆í1.2 </h2><p>  Leica Nocticron is undoubtedly a high-end portrait lens.  A focal length of 42.5 mm is equivalent to 85 mm in full-frame format, making it the classic choice for portrait shooting, and the f1.2 aperture value provides a shallow depth of field.  What really impresses is how much the lens copes with sharpness in the corners even at maximum aperture, which makes it extremely useful in low light.  Suffice it to say that unfocused areas are also exemplary.  The only drawback, except for the size, is the price corresponding to the high quality of the model.  Fortunately, in case Nocticron can‚Äôt afford it, there are many wonderful MFT short telephoto lenses, but for those who require the best, it is indispensable. </p><h2>  Panasonic Lumix 7-14mm ∆í4 </h2><p>  Owners of MFT cameras can choose from 3 lenses with ultra-wide zoom, and professionals recommend each of them.  Lumix G 7-14mm with a range of 14-28 mm (equivalent) provides excellent results throughout the frame, even at maximum aperture.  It is equipped with a built-in hood that copes with the protection of optics from shock, scratches and ambient light.  On the other hand, you cannot install filters without a makeshift lens adapter, and Olympus body owners may suffer from purple artifacts when shooting bright light sources.  With a price between less extreme 9-18mm and higher-level optics 7-14mm ∆í2.8, it remains a popular choice and a favorite of professional users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 75mm f / 1.8" class="if uuid-2637842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2637842.jpg"></div><h2>  Olympus M Zuiko Digital 75mm ∆í1.8 </h2><p>  The Japanese manufacturer continues to produce high-end lenses in a metal case.  This model provides a telephoto equivalent of 150 mm with a wide aperture, which makes it ideal for serious portrait shooting, as well as for fine detailing of landscapes and urban environments.  Preservation of the relative f1.8 aperture at a longer focal length resulted in an increase in cost (approximately double compared to 45mm ∆í1.8), and, despite the robust construction, it is not airtight.  Owners of Panasonic cameras should be aware that, like all Olympus lenses, there is no optical stabilization, so to avoid jitter, they need to shoot at a fairly high shutter speed or on a tripod.  But even with these reservations, the model remains very desirable, especially for serious portrait painters. </p><h2>  Olympus M Zuiko Digital 17mm ∆í1.8 </h2><p>  This is a general purpose lens.  With an equivalent 34 mm focal length, it provides a field of view that is almost identical to the classic 35 mm optics adored by street photographers.  Thus, it is wider than 50 mm and does not suffer from distortion of 28 mm lenses.  This makes the model ideal for everyday work, and its light weight and small size mean that the owner is unlikely to notice that it is installed.  A large aperture is useful in low light, and also allows you to create a bokeh effect, especially if the subject is close to the minimum focusing distance.  With sufficient care with the distance and composition, you can even take a portrait.  The disadvantages of the lens users include the optional hood, the lack of protection against dust and moisture and a rather high cost.  However, its quality is high, so it is most in demand, especially by those who have not yet acquired 20-mm optics. </p>
