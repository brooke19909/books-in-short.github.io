    <p>  The first of them is characterized by a lack of cohesion, a clear separation of leaders and personal relationships.  A group of a high level of development is usually called a collective.  This community has those properties that are absent in the formation at a low level of its development. </p><h2>  Team concept </h2><p>  The path that a low-level group goes to the very top step of its development is individual.  But in the end, such a community has a significant impact on the individual. </p><h2>  Team Signs </h2><p>  A group of people reaches their high level of development if there is: <br>  - common goal; <br>  - cooperative activity; <br>  - interdependent relationship of responsibility; <br>  - General management, which may be either one of the most authoritative members, or governing bodies. </p>

S. Makarenko formulated the basic law by which the community of pupils should live.  Its basic principle is movement.  This is a collective life form.  Stopping always means his death. </p><p>  The main principles of the collective, according to the great teacher, are dependence and publicity, as well as perspective.  An important role is played by the parallel actions of all its members. </p><p>  Makarenko also revealed the <span>stages of development of the team.</span>  They consist of four stages, the first of which is becoming.  It occurs during the formation of a class, circle, or group into a collective or socio-psychological community, where relations between students are determined by their goals, objectives and the nature of the joint activity.  In this case, the main organizer is a teacher who puts forward certain requirements for children. </p>

These are students who not only fulfill the requirements of the teacher, but also present them to other classmates.  At this stage of development, the collective acts as an integrated system in which the mechanisms of self-regulation and self-organization are already developed and begin to work.  Moreover, this community is an instrument for the purposeful education of positive human qualities.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the third stage of development of the collective according to Makarenko, flowering occurs.  The community reaches such a stage of its development when the demands of its members for themselves become higher than for their environment.  All this indicates the achievement of a high level of education, as well as the stability of judgments and views of students. </p><p>  Being in such a collective, the personality has all the prerequisites in the formation of its morality and integrity.  The main feature of such a community at this stage of development is the presence of common experience and the same assessment of certain events. </p><p>  The fourth stage of development of the group is a movement.  At this stage, students, relying on the already learned collective experience, make certain demands on themselves.  At the same time, the basic need of children is compliance with moral standards.  At this stage, the upbringing process smoothly passes into self-education. </p><p>  All stages of the development of the collective according to Makarenko do not have clear boundaries.  Each of the subsequent steps is added to the previous one, but does not replace it. </p><p>  Describing his theory of the stages of collective development, the great teacher paid great attention to the traditions created by his members.  These are sustainable forms of community life, helping to develop a line of behavior, as well as decorating and developing school life. </p><p>  According to Makarenko, to unite and captivate the team is capable of a goal that can be close, medium and distant.  The pillar of the first of these is personal interest.  The average goal is determined by complexity and time, and the distant is the most socially significant.  A similar system of prospects should permeate the entire team.  Only in this case will its development proceed naturally. </p>

What does he mean?  At one stage or another of the development of the collective, each of its members is under the simultaneous influence of the educator and his comrades.  Sometimes the punishment of the guilty can be too harsh.  That is why this principle of advice Makarenko use with caution.

    <p>  According to the theory of a well-known teacher, the following features are characteristic of a fully formed collective: <br>  - constant vigor; <br>  - friendly unity of all members; <br>  - self-esteem; <br>  - motivation for ordered action; <br>  - a feeling of security; <br>  - emotional restraint. </p><h2>  The development of the theory of Makarenko </h2><p>  The characteristics of the development stages of the collective were also considered in the works of Sukhomlinsky.  This teacher, working for many years as a teacher and school principal, on the basis of his own experience formulated a set of principles, thanks to which a highly organized group of students is formed.  Among them: <br>  - unity of pupils; <br>  - initiative; <br>  - amateur performances; <br>  - the wealth of relations between students and the teacher; <br>  - harmony of interests; <br>  - the leading role of the teacher, etc. </p><p>  The stages of development of the collective are considered in their works by A. T. Kurakin, L. I. Novikov and others. Moreover, they have a completely different approach to this issue.  These authors believe that not only requirements can rally children at the stage of development of the student body.  Other means help in this. </p><p>  Recently, there has been a clear tendency to understand a group as a group whose members have a high level of development.  Moreover, such a community should be distinguished by integrative activity, cohesion and a single focus.  The most significant quality of the group, according to modern authors, is the level of <span>socio-psychological maturity.</span>  It is this feature that is the main prerequisite for creating a team group.  What are the main stages of its formation? </p><p>  At the first stage of development of the group, a conglomerate occurs.  This community consists of children previously unfamiliar with each other, who were gathered at the same time in one space.  The relationship of the guys at this stage is usually situational and superficial.  If you assign a name to such a group, it will be nominalized.  In the event that the members of such a team do not accept the conditions and goals set for them, then the transition from the conglomerate will not happen.  Such cases are not uncommon in school practice. </p>

In this case, the group goes into an association, where the goal for each of its members is designed by the task.  At this level, the first bricks in the formation of the team are laid.  With joint activities, the group moves to a higher level of organization, changing interpersonal relationships.

    <p>  In the presence of favorable conditions there is a change in the stage of development of the children's team.  At the next stage, a cooperation group is formed.  Such a community is distinguished by a successful and actually functioning structure of the organization.  Also in this case there is a high level of group cooperation and preparedness.  All relations between the members of the cooperation group are business in nature and are aimed at achieving the goal. </p><h2>  Lutoshkin's concept </h2><p>  According to this author, there are the following stages of development of the student body: <br>  1. The first stage is the nominee group.  This community exists formally and has joint activities and time.  If this is observed at school, then such a team is called an unfriendly class. <br>  2. The second stage is an association group.  It arises when all its members have the same goals. <br>  3. At the third stage of development of the team according to Lutoshkin, a cooperation group arises.  It is characterized by unity of goals, high cohesion and a single approach to solving the tasks. <br>  4. The fourth stage is the creation of an autonomy group.  This community is distinguished by internal unity, developed self-control and high preparedness for solving the problem. <br>  5. The fifth stage is characterized by the emergence of a collective group.  This is the highest stage of development of the community, all members of which are connected by a single goal, as well as by activities on the path to achieving it.  In addition, in such a group one can observe moral and psychological unity, high preparedness, and a perfect organizational structure. </p><p>  Consider the characteristics of all stages described by A. N. Lutoshkin. </p><h2>  Rated group </h2><p>  At this stage of development of the educational team, it can be called a ‚Äúsandy placer‚Äù.  Comparison is not accidental.  At first glance, the grains of sand are gathered together.  However, each of them is on its own.  Any blow of wind can spread sand grains in different directions.  So they will remain until there is someone who rakes them in one pile.  The same phenomenon occurs in the human community, when certain groups are specially organized or arise by the will of circumstances.  On the one hand, all together.  But on the other - each of the members of such a group is on its own.  Such a ‚Äúsand scattering‚Äù does not bring satisfaction and joy. </p><h2>  Association Group </h2><p>  <span>This stage of</span> development of the collective is called ‚ÄúSoft Clay‚Äù.  This name was not given to this stage by chance.  Soft clay is a highly sensitive material.  Taking it in hand, you can sculpt anything.  A good master can make a beautiful vessel or any other beautiful product from clay.  But without the application of effort, the material will forever remain just a piece of soil. </p>

Here, the role of a master can be played by a formal leader, a class teacher, or simply an authoritative student.  Yes, not everything is going smoothly.  The team lacks the experience of mutual assistance and interaction.  However, efforts to rally the community are already visible at this stage.

    <h2>  Cooperation Group </h2><p>  This stage of development of the collective is called "flickering beacon."  At this stage, the team is compared with the stormy sea.  Located among the raging waves of an experienced sailor, the flickering fire of a lighthouse allows you to choose the right path and brings confidence.  Here you just need to be careful and not lose sight of the saving ray. </p><p>  The team forming in the group also gives each of its members signals for choosing the right path and is always ready to lend a helping hand.  In such a community there is a desire to work and help each other.  The role of the lighthouse in it is played by an asset. </p><h2>  Autonomy group </h2><p>  The next stage in the development of the collective is called the ‚Äúscarlet sail‚Äù.
