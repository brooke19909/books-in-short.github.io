This country, located in the center of the Balkan Peninsula, nevertheless collects a rich tourist harvest all year round.  In winter, mountain resorts attract lovers of challenging ski slopes.  At any time of the year, ancient Orthodox monasteries attract pilgrims.  Balneological therapies based on mineral thermal springs and healing mud provide an opportunity to improve health of the unwell.  The beautiful nature and the mass of historical and cultural attractions provide the basis for a rich excursion program.  Wine and gastronomic tours to Serbia are very popular.  After all, this country has a unique cuisine.  And besides, Russians do not need a visa to enter Serbia (if the length of stay does not exceed thirty days).  Well, what about the sea?  Serbia is located in the central part of the Balkan Peninsula.  Therefore, there is plenty to choose from.  During the partition of Yugoslavia, the Adriatic coast went to Croatia and Montenegro.  Eastern neighbors - Romania and Bulgaria - have access to the Black Sea.  Nearby are Albania and Greece.  Therefore, many travel agencies offer combined tours "Serbia + sea tour".  When is it better to go, which country to visit yet, what to see and what were the prices in 2016 - read about all this in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serbia sea holidays" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1500957.jpg" width="600"></div>

Southeastern Europe lies in the zone of temperate continental climate.  Winters here are not very severe, but long.  Snow falls already in late autumn and lasts until March.  However, temperatures are far from Siberian frosts.  In January, the coldest month of the year, the thermometer ranges from ‚Äì1 to ‚Äì9 degrees Celsius.  There is a lot of snow in the mountains, which attracts skiers from all over the world Serbia.  Holidays at sea in the resorts of the former Yugoslavia is possible from the first of May.  Summer in this region is hot, arid.  The duration of the beach season is not the same everywhere.  First of all, the Romanian resorts are empty - in early September.  And at the end of the month, the Black Sea cities of Bulgaria say goodbye to the beaches.  In the Adriatic resorts in Croatia and Montenegro (the western neighbors of the Republic of Serbia), a sea holiday in September is most comfortable.  The curtain of the beach season drops only in October.  But for those who went on vacation only in the middle of autumn, there is an opportunity to sunbathe and swim in the sea.  They are waiting for the resorts of Albania and Greece.  In the last state there are two seas to choose from - the Ionian and Aegean.  And this is only if we consider the mainland of Greece. </p>

    <p>  In Thessaloniki, Patras, Athens, <span>beach vacations are</span> possible until the end of October. <br><br></p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why choose Serbia </h2><p>  The question arises: if we want to relax at sea, why go to a country located in the interior of the mainland and not having access to the coast?  We explain.  Serbia is a very colorful country.  Many villages seemed to have come off the frames of Kusturica films.  Enchanting in its beauty nature, hospitable people, excellent cuisine, excellent wines, ancient monasteries, thermal springs, mountains and plains - all this is Serbia.  Holidays at sea photo illustrate as "seals".  No matter where the coastal resort is, everything is the same: sand, sunbeds, umbrellas, water.  And tours that combine outdoor activities and passive sunbathing on the beach provide both mind and body health.  In addition, prices in Serbia are much lower than in the promoted Croatia and Montenegro.  Such a combined tour, such as ‚ÄúThree Balkan Countries‚Äù, allows Europe to see a budget traveler.  There is a more expanded program, for example, five states.  And for those who are looking for a very economical tour ‚ÄúSerbia + sea vacation‚Äù, travel tips reveal the secrets of cheap bus trips from Brest (Belarus) and Uzhgorod or Lviv (Ukraine).  So you can see several countries of Eastern and Central Europe at a time.  More expensive travel - by plane, with accommodation in Greece.  In order to get into this EU state, you need a Schengen visa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serbia sea holidays photo" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1500926.jpg" width="600"></div>

But what about holidays in Serbia at sea?  Reviews of tourists praise the resorts of Bulgaria.  In summer, very comfortable weather is established there.  Sandy beaches and gentle sloping into the sea makes Bulgaria a "country of children's relaxation." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays at sea in greece serbia" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1500936.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Acquaintance with Hellas </h2><p>  If you have a Schengen visa, you can expand your acquaintance with Southern Europe.  There are several tours that can be arbitrarily called "Holidays at sea in Greece + Serbia."  Their cost largely depends on the type of transport (expensive flight or a long bus trip to Belgrade, Athens or Thessaloniki), accommodation, duration, duration of stay in a hotel of a seaside resort.  Consider, as an example, a tour from Brest (Belarus) through Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.  The first two countries tourists see only from the window of the bus.  But in Budapest, a city tour is provided.  By the way, transfers are made exclusively during the day.  Tourists spend all nights in hotels.  Only on the fourth day after leaving Moscow does the group reach Belgrade (Serbia).  Holidays at sea, reviews of which are mostly very good, come on the sixth day of the tour.  Before this, tourists visiting the Meteora.  For a beach holiday in the seaside Greek resort of Loutraki, a full four days are allotted.  One of these days provides a trip to Athens.  Then the group moves to Delphi and Thessaloniki.  After spending the night in this city, tourists return to Serbia through Macedonia.  From Belgrade, the group moves to Novi Sad.  In this city, which bears the unofficial title of ‚ÄúSerbian Athens,‚Äù a guided tour is conducted.  And then tourists go through Hungary, Slovakia and Poland back to Brest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Serbia sea holidays with kids" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1500930.jpg" width="510"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation and meals </h2><p>  "For your money - any whim," - say tour operators.  Therefore, you can choose the conditions of accommodation when purchasing a tour "Serbia + sea tour".  Hotels, of course, will be three-star upon moving.  After all, you will need to assemble the whole group early in the morning and move on.  But if the client so desires, a hotel room may not be a double standard.  You can pay for deluxe or suite.  If you travel alone, you do not have to share a room with a stranger.  But then a surcharge is required to occupy a double room.  All hotels offer breakfast only during transfers.  Other meals are not included in the price of the tours.  The bus stops at roadside cafes.  Living and dining conditions change when you arrive at the seaside resort.  As a rule, tourists spend three to five days on a beach vacation (maybe more, depending on the tour).  For this period, travelers are accommodated in a hotel of the category they paid for.  The type of food is also changing.  Usually this is half board (breakfast and dinner).  What are the prices?  Take an average tour to Serbia with a vacation in the seaside resort of Greece.  Bus trips, overnight stays in double ‚ÄúStandards‚Äù of three-star hotels will cost one person six hundred fifty-five euros for fifteen days.  The same thing, but with a beach holiday in the resorts of Montenegro or Croatia will cost less. </p><h2>  Traveling alone </h2><p>  Those who like to plan their holidays themselves do not have to buy tours to Serbia.  Holidays at sea will be better if you choose the resort to your taste and book a hotel.  You will not have to pay extra for the services of a tour operator.  But no one will "take you by the handle" and talk about all the sights.  It is difficult to talk about what is better: independent travel or an organized tour with a group.  Everywhere has its pros and cons.  Independent travelers can only be advised on how to get to Belgrade.  The leader of the Russian aeronautics Aeroflot and the airline JAT Airways make regular flights from Moscow to Belgrade.  On board will have to spend about two and a half hours.  If you want to spend a couple of days at sea first, you should choose the airline S7, which regularly sends its planes to the capital of Montenegro Podgorica.  In the summer there is the opportunity to catch a charter to the resort of Tivat (Montenegro).  From there, a train runs to Belgrade.  There is also air traffic, it will take half an hour to fly.  But tourists do not advise to go by train in the direct train "Moscow - Belgrade".  Firstly, for a long time - more than two days.  And secondly, a visa is required for transit through Hungary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Serbia sea holidays" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1500929.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Wellness holidays in Serbia </h2><p>  Over a thousand healing springs hit from the ground in this unique country.  And there are deposits of no less valuable mud that have beneficial effects on joints damaged by rheumatism, arthritis and arthrosis.  Among the auxiliary therapeutic factors include clean air, a warm climate and beautiful nature.  In Serbia, there are several dozen balneological resorts.  It is difficult to list them.  But if you see a settlement on the map of the country, the name of which contains the word ‚Äúbathhouse‚Äù, you should know: there is a hydropathic center.  The only exception is Zlatibor.  Serbia treats diseases of the thyroid gland and respiratory tract, metabolic disorders, all types of anemia, and depression at this world famous resort in Serbia.  The spa centers offer programs to reduce weight and restore youth and beauty.  In the resort of Prolom Banya, stones and sand are washed from the kidneys, rheumatism and various skin diseases are treated.  The main healing factor in Buyanovka Bani is volcanic mud - one of the best in the world.  There are thermal springs at this resort.  Even hypertensive patients can bathe in them - blood pressure from healing water will only decrease.  Those who have problems with the gastrointestinal tract should go to Vrnjachka Banya.  Acquired diabetes and female infertility are also cured here.  That is why you should first visit the balneological resorts of Serbia.  Holidays at sea will only fix the healing effect. </p><h2>  Gastronomic and wine tours </h2><p>  You can also taste prosciutto, lapskovitsa, various burekas with a good glass of lozovaci or kaisievachi within the framework of the tour ‚ÄúSerbia + sea tour‚Äù.  Photos of travelers often show colorful feasts in authentic restaurants.  However, in order to make a real feast to the stomach, you need to go on a special gastronomic tour around the country.  Such are organized from Moscow and St. Petersburg.  The tour lasts only five days.  A ticket costs twenty nine thousand rubles.  The package includes a flight to Belgrade, accommodation in a double room with breakfast, four bus tours of Belgrade plus Novi Sad, Topola, Oplenac, wine tasting and various types of crayfish.  The highlight of the program is lunch and dinner in the best restaurants in Serbia with an authentic atmosphere and live music.  At the end of the tour, each participant is given a bottle of wine.  It should be said that Serbia‚Äôs cuisine is mainly meat.  It‚Äôs hard to be a vegan in this country.  The most common appetizer is Meso Mesh.  She presents a dish with at least half a kilogram of different types of meat.  There is lamb, and chevapchichi (home-made sausages), and chicken, and pork and beef.  This portion, which will cost five to twelve euros, can be overcome if you drink about a liter of young Serbian wine. </p>
