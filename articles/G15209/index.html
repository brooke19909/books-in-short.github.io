Since childhood, Georgiana dreamed of marrying a decent and handsome man.  However, her marriage could not be called happy.  The Duke of Devonshire preferred to live in a quiet family circle in a country house, not enduring secular pleasures, while his wife loved only secular pleasures.

    <p>  The Duchess Georgiana Devonshire was not able to give her husband neither home comfort, nor a calm family idyll, so since 1790 their marriage has already been called broken. </p>

    <p>  Lady Cavendish in society was not just famous, but the infamous person, about whom the whole London high society gossiped.  Her plumes and tournaments were incredible luxury.  They said that even Georgiana's stockings and garters were decorated with precious stones.  It was she who laid the foundation for the fact that a special shade of brown began to be called "Devonshire." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Duchess of Devonshire was no less famous for her lovers.  She chose only the most famous and interesting men for love, for example, the young brilliant politician Gray or the famous portrait painter Gainsborough. </p><p>  A special place in the life of Georgiana was occupied by cards.  According to contemporaries, she played almost every night.  England does not know a more avid gambler in its entire history.  The Duchess of Devonshire not only went to play cards herself, but also made her husband constantly arrange card evenings.  Georgiana could lose several thousand overnight.  And the "debt of honor", which the Duchess of Devonshire gained very quickly, was forced to give her husband.  He did this so as not to ruin her relationship. </p><p>  Georgiana, who understood that she was not giving him the family he was dreaming of, was trying to change something in their lives.  Therefore, she introduced the duke to a provincial noblewoman, the beautiful Elizabeth Foster, with whom she became friends with, despite different social statuses.  Her new girlfriend, who had already managed to learn all the hardships of family life, found herself in poverty along with young children. </p>

She, in addition to compassion, was guided by calculation: the new girlfriend belonged to the type of those women that her husband liked.  Gradually, between the Duke and Bess, feelings arose that grew into a deep relationship.  The strange "three" life they led shocked the high society.  However, the Duchess of Devonshire herself quietly enjoyed it.

    <p>  Since the summer of 1791, she and her husband decided to live separately: the duke with Bess and the children, one of whom his lover gave birth to from him, is in a country estate, and Georgiana herself settled in Bath with her new lover, politician <span>Charles Gray.</span> <br><br>  In 1797, the scandalous socialite, dancing in an open dress at the ball, caught a cold.  The disease was further aggravated by a severe infection in the eyes.  To restore the duchess‚Äôs sight, she underwent surgery, which left noticeable scars on her beautiful face.  However, even being disfigured, Georgiana was still considered the most popular lady in the world and an avid player.  She continued to play cards until her death. </p><p>  The Duchess of Devonshire died in 1806 from consumption.  She died in the arms of her friend Bess, blessing their marriage to Cavendish.  At the time of her death, Georgiana had huge debts that her poor husband paid until his death. </p>
