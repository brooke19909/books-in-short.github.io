This place has some fantastic aura and is distinguished by its attractiveness.  Anyone who has been here at least once will certainly want to come back here again and again.  What is so special about this settlement?  Maybe the magnificent nature of these places and the enchanting landscape of Kara-Dag?  Or maybe the main reason for the attraction lies in that fun bohemian life that guests of the village can plunge into during the summer season? </p><p>  In order to answer these questions, you need to get acquainted with the sights of Koktebel (Crimea) and the entertainment that it offers its guests. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The area that surrounds Koktebel is rightfully considered one of the most beautiful in Crimea.  It is here that the steppe ends and the mountains begin.  They rise their asymmetric tubercles above the earth's surface.  Rocky peaks are also included in the list of attractions of Koktebel.  After all, they form such bizarre forms that the terrain becomes similar to lunar landscapes, but only brighter and more colorful.  Bays and beaches, the embankment and streets - everything in this village is subtly in harmony with each other, giving rest to soul and body. </p><p>  But just a little over 100 years ago, it was God‚Äôs forgotten place.  By the sea there was only a small village, whose inhabitants lived in structures erected from clay.  Instead of stoves, they heated themselves and cooked food on the hearth, which was located in the center of such a house, with a chimney arranged in the ceiling.  Since the 90s of the 19th century  here summer residents began to master.  The first of these was Eduard Andreevich Yunge, a well-known professor at that time, an oculist from St. Petersburg.  The whole Koktebel valley was bought up by him literally for pennies.  The professor planted a small vineyard here and began to engage in agriculture.  After the death of Junge, the sons began to sell the inherited land for suburban areas.  However, the bidding was not very good.  After all, these places were little known and remote from large cities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, about two dozen summer residents came to Koktebel.  These were lawyers and doctors from Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as theater artists.  One of the houses with a tower, standing on a deserted shore, was bought by Elena Kiriyenko-Voloshina.  She literally persuaded her son Maximilian to settle in Koktebel.  Since then, Voloshin began to invite his friends from Europe, Moscow and St. Petersburg to Koktebel.  He enthusiastically described to them the expanses of the eastern coast of Crimea, on which the Cimmerian tribe lived 2,000 years ago.  Thus, one of the most famous art colonies in Russia began to form here.  Philosophers and scientists, artists and musicians, writers and poets came to visit Voloshin.  From May to November, 400-600 people stayed in his house.  In 1931, Voloshin‚Äôs house was transferred to the Writers' Union. </p><p>  And only in the 50s of the last century did civilization come to the village.  Pensions and cafes began to be built here.  By this time, the place had already gained wide popularity, gradually turning into one of the most fashionable resorts. </p><p>  Today Koktebel is a secluded village located on the Black Sea coast.  It does not belong to the famous southern <span>territory of Crimea.</span>  These places are characterized by a slightly different climate.  Summer is very hot, and in winter there are frosts. </p><p>  Attractions in Koktebel and the surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village are not very many.  Conventionally, they are divided into natural and cultural.  The first include natural caves, rocks, capes and mountain peaks.  It is they who attract independent and active tourists to Koktebel.  In most cases, such facilities are far from the village.  However, in this regard, Koktebel was lucky.  Tourists can reach many of the amazing natural places almost on foot.  There are also existing bus routes.  So, we consider the main attractions of Koktebel and interesting places that attract travelers to themselves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Karadag Nature Reserve </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Koktebel and Crimea, this place can be considered with confidence one of the most basic.  That is why it attracts the attention of not only scientists of various directions, but also ordinary inhabitants who came here to admire its beauty. </p><p>  The Karadakg Nature Reserve is of most interest due to its diversity.  Indeed, on its territory there are steppe open spaces that are open to all winds, and the harsh peaks of mountain ranges, and the beautiful sea surface that goes beyond the horizon. </p><p>  Kara-Dag owes its origin to the oldest volcano.  He erupted in these places at a time when dinosaurs lived on our planet.  After that, after about 120-130 Ma, a monstrous natural disaster literally tore the volcano to pieces.  After this, the formation of the coastline, as well as <span>Kok-Kai, Belaly-Kai, Syuru-Kai,</span> Karagach and Kara-Dag.  In other words, the territory of the reserve is one, and only a small fragment of the dead volcano.  This is confirmed by the fact that the breed often contains jasper and chalcedony, carnelian, amethysts, agates and other minerals, the formation of which occurs only at high temperatures. </p><p>  Should you get acquainted with the sights of Koktebel to go to this reserve?

It is called Silent Bay.  The territory of this amazing corner of nature is more than 1.5 thousand hectares.  Those tourists who like to relax in tents, as well as naturalists, come here. </p><p>  The name of the bay was not accidental.  The fact is that here, even in the most inclement weather, the sea remains still quiet.  This is explained by the special location of this place, which is surrounded by several hills.  This can be seen in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lomography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quiet bay" class="if uuid-2454772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2454772.jpg"></div><p>  A kilometer from the coastline are small islands - Kekurs.

Voloshin lived in the village most of his life.  He was a Russian poet, translator, landscape painter, as well as a literary and artistic critic. </p><p>  Voloshin‚Äôs paintings captured a lot of Crimean landscapes amazing in their beauty.  Today they can be seen in the museum.  The poet died in 1932, bequeathing his house to the Writers' Union.  Today, in this building (photo can be seen below), built back in 1913, a museum operates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitcrimea.guide" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House Museum Voloshin" class="if uuid-2454769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2454769.jpg"></div><p>  Its exposition presents visitors the most complete collection of Voloshin's watercolors.  The library of more than 1 thousand volumes has also been preserved in the house.  The first floor of the museum offers to get acquainted with the literary exposition, which tells visitors about the poet's work.  The second floor is considered a memorial part.  Here in its original form is the workshop Voloshin.
