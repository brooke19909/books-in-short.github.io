    <p>  Athens is the heart of Hellas.  For many, the city is associated with the birth of all kinds of arts, and this is true.  The capital of Greece is very unusual, because here modernity and antiquity are harmoniously interwoven. </p><p>  This is one of the most beautiful and mysterious places on the planet.  The capital of Greece captivates and falls in love even at the moment when you first look at it from the porthole of the airliner. </p><p><noindex>  <span>Athens Holidays</span> </noindex>  It will be saturated, fascinating and informative.  Indeed, the sights here are located literally on every square meter. </p><h2>  Legendary monuments </h2><p>  Once in Greece, you should definitely look at the Acropolis.  The historical complex has gigantic dimensions.  The most famous architectural monument is the pride of all of Hellas. </p><p>  The famous Parthenon, designed by Iktin and Kallikrath, is another attraction of Athens, which is part of a large complex.  This huge temple today is more than half destroyed.  However, its giant facade, decorated with regal columns, is considered the hallmark of all of Greece. </p><p>  On the territory of Athens is the Acropolis Museum.  It has been recognized several times as the best historical site in Europe.  Its expositions are compiled so competently that they allow tourists to fully immerse themselves in the history of the country, to understand the importance and significance of its capital for the cultural and religious development of the whole world. </p><p>  What else to see in Athens? <noindex>  <span>Tour operator Mouzenidis Travel</span> </noindex>  recommends including Ancient Agora in the mandatory program.  This ancient market, located in the immediate vicinity of the Acropolis, is very colorful.  It borders the Monastiraki shopping district, where you can always find something interesting. </p><h2>  At the origins of history itself </h2><p>  Ceramikos is another attraction of the Greek capital.  This is a unique area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAthens, located in the southwestern part of the city.  Here you can see the Sacred and Dipilon gates.  Many centuries ago, the largest cemetery was located near them, where eminent citizens of the Greek capital were buried. </p><p>  When you are on vacation in Athens, you should definitely look at the legendary port of Piraeus, whose age is almost two and a half thousand years!  Centuries fly by, but nothing changes in this corner of the planet.  The port still welcomes ships on which guests, merchants and Christian pilgrims arrive in the country.  The dimensions of Piraeus are impressive.  To realize this, to feel a slight thrill from contact with eternity, you should definitely take a walk along the pier. </p></div></article>
