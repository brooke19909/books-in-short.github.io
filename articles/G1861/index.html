When it was launched onto the market, its battery had a capacity of 920 mAh.  Among other devices from the company, this indicator was the highest.  Sometimes the C116 is confused with the model indicated above.  Indeed, the models are similar in characteristics, the whole difference lies only in the design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola S115" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1866594.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Posing and picking </h2><p>  Initially, the model was presented as a budget option.  Appearance is boring, and the functionality is small, only basic functions are available. </p><p>  The Motorola S115 phone received the following equipment: there is an instruction, the device itself, charging for it and a battery.  Also a warranty card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone motorola s115" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1866593.jpg" width="248"></div>

    <h2>  Features and specifications </h2><p>  The model is monochrome, so the battery charge decreases slowly.  It has a classic form factor.  The weight of the device is 81 g.

There are 24 options in the phone‚Äôs memory.  You can edit melodies, and the option of vibration alert is also available. </p><p>  You can go online thanks to GPRS technology. </p><p>  Messages have a separate advantage: you can enter text using a dictionary.  Of course, at the moment it‚Äôs difficult to call it a plus, but for the time when it was released - just right.  EMS function is missing. </p><p>  There are no modes that would allow you to encode sound. </p><p>  As mentioned above, the ‚ÄúMotorola C115‚Äù display is black and white.  On the screen fits no more than 3 lines of text.  Its resolution is 96 √ó 64 pixels.  There is Russification, and also shows the talk time. </p><p>  As for multimedia, games are built-in.  The ability to take photos and videos is not. </p><p>  The type of battery is lithium-ion.  During standby time, the phone will be discharged in 120 hours, during a conversation - in 8 hours, and the device charges for almost 3 hours. </p><p>  The organizer has a calendar and an alarm clock.  A calculator is also available. </p><p>  Phone book is missing.  Subscribers can only be saved in the memory of a SIM card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola S115 display" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1866595.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting points </h2><p>  In 2006, almost 30 thousand Motorola S115 phones were seized from Euroset.  There was good reason to believe that devices adversely affect human health.  They had to be destroyed.  A little later, after a while, the prosecutor's office of the capital of the Russian Federation made a statement stating that a large consignment of phones was probably stolen and sold at a low price.  A few years later, the seizure was recognized as legally incorrect and illegal. </p><p>  In the same year, RussGPS accused the manufacturer of violating the rights to manufacture and sell licenses and telephones.  Thus, this prohibition, if confirmed, would have spread to the phones of the company, including Motorola C115.  However, the manufacturer reacted quite quickly - on his part, a lawsuit was filed against the prosecutor in the amount of US $ 18 million for defamation and damage to his reputation. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Phone reviews are good.  It has long gone out of sale, but it can be purchased, so to speak, "with hands."  The phone is able to easily perform the simplest options, such as making calls, sending messages.  The speaker sounds good.  The playback quality is pleasant, it doesn‚Äôt cut on the ears. </p>
