It represents a whole complex of scientific disciplines and industrial branches related to the study of the earth's crust and its deeper spheres.  The tasks of geology are mainly aimed at understanding the laws governing the formation and distribution of mineral deposits (mineral deposits).  Most of the specific issues addressed in modern geology relate to depths of the order of 10-15 km, due to the geological depth of the cut in the areas of ancient folding and the current level of technical capabilities for mining and exploration of minerals. </p><h2>  General concepts </h2><p>  Engineering geology is a scientific and technical branch of geology that studies the features and patterns of interaction of the geological environment with engineering structures.  The object of engineering geology is the upper layers and horizons of the earth's crust, the geological conditions for their formation and occurrence, morphological, strength and dynamic characteristics in connection with human engineering activity. </p><p>  Along with highly specialized tasks, engineering geology provides for the study of geological composition, soil properties and composition, hydrogeological conditions, destructive geological processes and a number of other issues.  Therefore, the fundamentals of engineering geology include the need for certain broad knowledge in a number of related geological disciplines, including general geology, mineralogy, geomorphology, hydrogeology, petrography, tectonics, geophysics, etc. </p><h2>  Targets and goals </h2><p>  Geotechnical surveys aim to carry out a comprehensive and comprehensive assessment of geological factors caused by human activities in the construction and economic sphere, in conjunction with natural geological processes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The main tasks of engineering geology, including the study of geological-tectonic, geomorphological, seismic and technogenic factors, focus on the development of engineering-geological justification, which without fail precedes the construction of facilities with the status of engineering structures.  These are civil and industrial buildings and structures, roads and railways, dams, bridges, airfields, subways, underground workings, underground utilities and many other objects. </p><p>  Thus, engineering geology is designed to provide designers, builders and maintenance services for economic facilities with all the data necessary for the design and construction, as well as for the implementation of activities related to their operation. </p><p>  Based on the results of engineering and geological work, they make a conclusion on the fundamental possibility of building structures and buildings or determine the most favorable sites for their placement.  The conclusion should contain recommendations on the preferred method of work, proposals for designs in terms of their maximum reliability and preventive measures to combat possible negative geological processes that could threaten the safety of the building or structure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Main sections of engineering geology </h2><p>  Being a part of geology as a science, engineering geology, in turn, includes a number of independent disciplines, of which engineering geodynamics, soil science and regional engineering geology are considered the main ones. </p><p>  Soil science, as the name implies, is the scientific branch of engineering geology, which knows the structure, composition and properties of soils, the laws of their formation and accumulation, as well as the peculiarities of spatio-temporal variability due to the engineering, construction and economic activities of people. </p><p>  The object of engineering geodynamics is a wide range of today's geological processes that have a significant impact on the conditions for the construction and operation of economic facilities of any scale.  Such processes include earthquakes, landslides of various origins, dips, subsidence, cracks, etc. Along with research and forecasting, they all necessitate the development of protective and protective measures, which also relates to the tasks of engineering geodynamics. </p>
