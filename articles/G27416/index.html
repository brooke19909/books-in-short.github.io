After all, the device is not cheap at all, and throwing such money away, as they say, down the drain will be for many an equally big problem.  A few years ago, in most cases, the loss of the phone was final, and finding out where the device is located was quite difficult.  However, now the situation is somewhat different.  So what to do if you stole an iPhone, how to find a device?  We‚Äôll talk about this today. </p><h2>  Primary actions </h2>

    <p>  Probably, with the loss of the device, any of us will experience shock and panic.  And it looks quite logical.  But here, more than ever, cold calculation and the ability to analyze events are important.  So far, all the technical nuances will be left nearby aside.  Try to remember where you were during the period when you last carried the device with you.  Think about in what place you could put it out and leave it, forget it or banally drop it. </p><p>  <span>The human factor is</span> not asleep, and you just could leave the device at home.  Try calling your number from another phone.  Even if the gadget is outside the house, it really fell out, then people passing by it can hear the call and answer it.  Now we do not always count on the decency of fellow citizens, but <span>what the hell is not joking,</span> as they say. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to do if an iPhone is stolen?

    <p>  Everything ingenious is simple.  Now we will not address the sophisticated functions that are equipped with ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices.  If you are sure that the device was stolen from you, then you can try to contact the suspect.  Just one word ‚Äúreward‚Äù can fundamentally change the situation.  And what to do next is up to you.  Although I don‚Äôt really want to give money for my phone, sometimes it needs to be done.  Inexpensive ‚Äúdialer‚Äù may not work out those funds, but we are talking about iPhones. </p><h2>  We are trying to find the device </h2>

    <p>  From year to year, representatives of the American Apple company advise platform lovers and people who are just starting their acquaintance with ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices to activate the flagship search function.  You can find the device only when the function was turned on, otherwise the owner can only sympathize.  A sufficient and necessary condition for this is the presence of an account in the iCloud corporate cloud storage and its binding to a valid email address.  The user can always cope with this himself, we only recall that this is done using the standard settings of the device.  So, if you are wondering what to do if you have stolen an iPhone, how to find it now, we hope that you managed to activate the search function in advance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What restrictive measures will the abductors face? </h2>

    <p>  Many users who ask, ‚ÄúThey stole an iPhone, what should I do?‚Äù Do not suspect how important it is to create an account in the iCloud cloud storage on the device and link it to an email address.  In fact, thieves who stole the device in this situation simply can not activate the device again.  Even installing a new firmware will not bring the desired result: to activate, you still need your email address and password to it. </p><h2>  IPhone stolen: what to do?  We control the device remotely </h2><p>  You, perhaps, did not know that the devices working on the basis of the IOS operating system are equipped with a remote control function.  To do this, use the official website of the corporate <span>cloud storage.</span>  There you can find an application called ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù.  The user has the right to connect several devices to the account.  He will see their list in the appendix.  You can do without the help of the site.  To do this, from the application store you need to download the program with the appropriate (‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù) name.  Its functionality remains at the same level as on the site.  By the way, the function that we talked about in the previous paragraph will allow you to <span>block the iPhone.</span> </p><h2>  More about the program, or how to find your device </h2><p>  Let's say you open a program.  If your smartphone is online, the user will immediately see it.  At the same time, we will have a poor, but still a choice of actions.  First you need to look at the location of the smartphone.  It is possible that he stayed at home or stayed with friends.  Especially for such cases, the American company has provided a remote sound playback function on the device. </p><p>  Search iPhone in case of theft, you can start by activating the loss mode.  At the same time, the attacker will lose many prospects, since access to the data will be blocked.  A message about this will appear on the screen, which may force the robber to change his mind.  The service will record the movement of the smartphone on a satellite map of the area.  In extreme cases, there is a function to delete all data if the user believes that it is not possible to return the device. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The seventh generation operating system (and also higher) does not allow attackers to go through the process of reactivating the device.  This is the lock mode.  To maintain security at the appropriate level, update the software.  The only way out for well-wishers in this situation is to turn in the device for spare parts.  However, this does not always come to this, and therefore there is a chance to find your device and get it back. </p>
