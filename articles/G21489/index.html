Bulgaria and its attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most unforgettable spectacles that can be found on the planet is the Valley of Roses (Bulgaria).  Tell me, have you ever seen with your own eyes how millions of buds of various colors and sizes simultaneously open, heading for the sun?  Did you smell lavender, mint and roses against the backdrop of the freshest mountain air?  If not, then this immediately needs to be fixed by going to a small Bulgarian town called Kazanlak.  About what this place is famous for, how to get there and what to do there, read below. </p><h2>  Bulgaria, Valley of the Roses.  How to get there </h2><p>  This nature reserve is located between two mountains - Stara Planina and Sredna Gora.  They are located near the city of Kazanlak, which is a good transport interchange in Bulgaria.  Many routes pass through this settlement, as well as railway lines, so you can get there without any problems.  For example, it is 200 km from Sofia, 110 km from Plovdiv, and only 50 km from Gabrovo.  Arriving at one of these major cities, you can buy a bus ticket that will take you to the right place in an hour or two.  Also, cars are often rented in the country because it is available.  You can remove an inexpensive car and go on an independent trip through the mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valley of roses bulgaria" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558632.jpg" width="512"></div>

Bulgaria on the threshold of a new era did not even exist, but on this place there was already a settlement formed by the Thracians, which was called Sevtopolis (in honor of its founder Sevta the Third).  For unknown reasons, this city fell, and already in the 5th century of a new era, archaeologists discovered the remains of structures and tombs on these lands.  The main among them was Kazanlak, in honor of which they called the city, which was again founded here.  Since then, under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, a rose garden was created here.  The city began to develop the production of rose oil, as well as some sectors of light industry.  So, from then until now, it is generally accepted that the town and all the surrounding areas are almost the most important sights of Bulgaria.  The Valley of Roses today is not only a spectacular reserve, but also plays an important role in the development of the country's economy - here they continue to produce rose oil. </p>

This spectacle begins at sunrise, and it is most striking in July.  It is at dawn hours in the most advantageous and surprising light that the Valley of Roses appears before us.

Point number two - learn how to collect roses.  Here, local florists will come to your aid, who will tell you which of the buds can be cut, and which should still ripen.  And, of course, do not forget to see the main architectural sights of Bulgaria.  The valley of roses surrounds the ancient Thracian tombs, therefore, to see them with your own eyes and capture in the photo is the duty of every tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valley of roses bulgaria on the map" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558636.jpg" width="600"></div>

Bulgaria </h2><p>  Photos of rosebuds of various varieties, colors and shades, which can be seen everywhere, were made mainly in this region.  The fact is that the bushes that are grown here are considered the best in Europe.  Their care technology has been kept secret for centuries.  In addition to the main function of this valley - to please the eyes of everyone who gets here, here, as mentioned above, the industry for the manufacture of essential oil is also very developed.  The essence, made on the basis of the petals of these plants, is realized not only in the native country, but also far beyond its borders.  Many French perfumers choose it to create their masterpieces.  Of course, rose oil made here will cost much more than any other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valley of Roses Bulgaria photo" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558634.jpg" width="462"></div>

    <h2>  Museum </h2><p>  The most unique varieties of roses that have been brought here from different parts of the planet for centuries are the most important thing that the Valley of Roses is famous for.  Thanks to Bulgaria, it is considered a "land of roses", therefore it would be foolish if the authorities did not create a national museum at the very epicenter of such beauty.  By visiting it, you can learn many historical facts from the life of the local plants.  Those varieties that we can meet today began to be imported in the 17th century from India.  Later, other exquisite <span>species of roses</span> from the East, as well as from various parts of Western Europe, followed.  The museum also hosts seminars where you can learn the technology for the production of essential oil. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria rose valley how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/558635.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The festival </h2><p>  Now we will consider what entertainments the Valley of Roses can please us.  Bulgaria is a cult "pink country", because every year there are festivals in honor of this plant.  Such an event is always held in the summer, during the collection of petals.  All participants must be dressed in antique or Thracian costumes.  The action itself begins on plantations where bushes are grown - there florists collect the "crop".  After the queen of roses is chosen, which are carried by three or four guys in the throne until they reach the city.  Well, there already, under the light of neon lights, a carnival unfolds with dancing until the morning. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Briefly we learned about what it is, Valley of Roses (Bulgaria).  On the map, finding this place is very simple, you just have to go down a little east of Sofia.  The convenient location of the reserve, its unearthly beauty, aroma and amazing history attract tourists from year to year. </p>
