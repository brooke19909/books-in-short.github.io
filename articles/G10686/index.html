As a result of the struggle of applicants for power, the country broke up into three independent tribal formations, called the Elder, Middle and Younger Zhuzes.  It was the head of the Younger Zhuz - Abulkhair Khan - who played an important role in establishing the Russian protectorate. </p><h2>  Problems caused by separatism </h2>

    <p>  Hard times came right after the collapse of the Khanate.  The weakness resulting from separatism was immediately exploited by aggressive steppe neighbors.  The younger zhuz, whose lands extended in the western part of present-day Kazakhstan, was attacked by the Dzungar tribes who made peace with Russia but did not stop the predatory raids on their neighbors.  The situation was becoming critical. </p><p>  In 1730, after another series of raids, the first appeal of Khan Abulkhair to the Russian authorities followed with a request for help in repelling aggression.  In gratitude, he promised Anna Ioannovna the conclusion of a military alliance to ensure the security of the Russian borders.  However, they replied from St. Petersburg that they agreed to help in the fight against the Dzungars, but only if the territories subject to Abulkhair entered the Russian protectorate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Entry under the auspices of Russia </h2><p>  Abulkhair Khan accepted these conditions, despite the fact that their implementation deprived his people of independence.  In this case, his exorbitant ambitions and resentment for the fact that after the death of High Khan Tauk, he was not elected as his successor, played a role.  Agreeing to sacrifice state sovereignty, this cunning politician hoped in exchange for citizenship to receive guarantees from Russia that the khanate would be transferred to its direct heirs. </p>

    <p>  The lord of the Middle Zhuz, Khan Abulmambet, did not lag behind him.  He managed to obtain the citizenship of two of the greatest powers at once - Russia and China.  His policy of maneuvering between these countries was called "between a lion and a tiger."  The elder Zhuz at that time could not do anything, since he was completely influenced by the Kokand Khanate and was deprived of his own voice. </p><h2>  Mission of Russian diplomacy </h2><p>  In 1731, when the Kazakh rulers were mired in political intrigues and in the search for ways to satisfy their personal vanity, the ambassador, Count A. I. Tevkelev, arrived from St. Petersburg.  Performing the mission entrusted to him by Anna Ioannovna, he gathered on October 10 the most influential representatives of the Middle and Younger Zhuzes and, with the support of Khan Abulkhair, representing the Younger Zhuz, convinced them of the benefits that they were promised to enter under the Russian protectorate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  His diplomacy was a success, and at the end of this congress, the khans at the head of the zhuzes and twenty-seven other rulers of a lower rank swore allegiance to Anna Koran on the Koran.  This act became the legal justification for the accession of the Kazakh lands to Russia, although it was still far away before their final entry under the canopy of the double-headed eagle. </p>

    <p>  The alliance with Russia helped the Kazakhs resist the Dzungarian invaders.  During the period of intensification of their raids, in 1738-1741, an army formed from representatives of the Middle and Younger Zhuzes, with the support of the Russians, inflicted several crushing defeats on the enemy.  In these campaigns, at the head of the combined forces was the brother of the khan of the Middle Zhuz - Abylay.  In 1741, in one of the battles, he was captured, and only the intervention of the Orenburg administration saved his life and restored freedom. </p><h2>  The end of the life of the famous ruler </h2><p>  Abulkhair Khan never managed to subjugate all three Kazakh Zhuzes, although he fought for the supreme power for many years.  In the vast expanses of the boundless steppes, fame spread about him as a fearless commander and ally of the no less famous <span>Khan Abylay.</span>  However, such popularity among the people gave rise to the envy of many Kazakh rulers.  One of them - Sultan Barak - made a lot of efforts to overthrow his rival.  Both of them, possessing bright charismatic qualities, harbored mutual hatred towards each other.  This was the reason for the tragic denouement. </p><p>  From documents that have reached us, it is known that in August 1748, Abulkhair Khan, accompanied by a few guards, returned from the Orsk fortress.  An ambush arranged by Barack and his companions awaited him on the way. </p>

    <p>  In the ensuing unequal battle, the head of the Younger Zhuz was killed.  Abulkhair was buried near the confluence of the Kabyrga and Olkeyka rivers.  This place is located eighty kilometers from Turgay - one of the cities of the Aktobe region. </p><h2>  Folk memory </h2><p>  Today, this place has become one of the monuments of the history of Kazakhstan.  In the people it is called the Khan Molas, which means "the grave of the khan."  In September 2011, the Committee on Science under the Government of the country, as part of a program studying the rule of Khan Abulkhair, initiated the exhumation of his remains.  The genetic examination carried out confirmed their authenticity, which is very important, since he is one of the heroes, the veneration of whose memory expands every year. </p><h2>  Descendants of the Khan </h2><p>  After the death of Abulkhair, his son Nurala became the khan of the Younger Zhuz and, following the example of his father, sought an alliance with a powerful and influential neighbor - Russia.  Numerous of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren were also included in the circle of the highest board of the khanate. </p>

    <p>  A curious detail: one of the distant descendants of Abulkhair, Gubaidulla, became a prominent Russian military leader during the reign of Alexander II.  Having survived until 1909, he passed away as a cavalry general and a recognized founder of the national communications troops.  Abulkhair Khan himself, whose biography still requires deep study, remained forever in the memory of his people. </p>
