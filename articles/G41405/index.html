This is not just a place for walking, but a whole infrastructure with a two-level pedestrian zone. </p><p>  This area was not once considered habitable.  The desert territory was often flooded during the flood of the river, and it was no coincidence that the wetland was called Obolon.  About 40 years ago, it was decided to build an expensive neighborhood here, which Kiev could be proud of.  The Obolonskaya embankment, stretching for four kilometers, is built up with beautiful buildings that have a unique style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Obolonskaya embankment how to get there" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1493280.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is not intended for meditation and is not performed according to all the rules of Zen Buddhism.  But here you can take a walk, sit with friends on benches and take a break from all the problems.  The scattered huge boulders, on which there are signs where they were brought from, look strange, because they are surrounded on all sides by high-rise buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Obolonskaya Embankment" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1493285.jpg" width="600"></div>
