  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accounting and calculation of economic efficiency of loans in commercial organizations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Financial activity of any modern enterprise is practically impossible without attracting credit resources.  Their use makes it possible to significantly expand the scale of the enterprise and increase its market value.  With the implementation of such measures, naturally, the calculation of the economic efficiency of the enterprise also changes. </p><p>  In the period of the expanding global financial crisis, the problem of timely settlement of obligations arises especially urgently, and therefore, the calculation of the economic efficiency of measures to develop production becomes relevant.  It is especially difficult in these conditions to organizations of private ownership, as  they cannot count on stable and substantial financial support from the state.  It is necessary in various ways to reach an agreement with suppliers of goods, work and services on <span>deferred payment</span> and very carefully to calculate the effectiveness of the project.  However, whatever the deferral, there comes a time when it is necessary to pay off your obligations, not only to suppliers, but also to the budget for taxes and fees. </p><p>  Everywhere today, such an economic phenomenon as a tax credit has become widespread, which should be a necessary element in calculating the economic efficiency of an enterprise or institution.  A tax credit means the postponement of tax payments that occur at the time of the <span>tax credit.</span> </p><p>  However, in practice, many questions arise in case of a need for it: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1) whether <span>commercial organizations can</span> use a tax credit; </p><p>  2) what is the procedure for its receipt, how is the calculation of <span>economic efficiency</span> and reflection in accounting carried out; </p><p>  3) what are the conditions and grounds for its provision to organizations. </p><p>  In addition, one of the functions of financial management is to manage the effective use of loans and borrowings, the analysis of which is carried out in the financial statements. </p><p>  Analysis of the structure of borrowed funds in commercial construction organizations has led to the conclusion that the method of accounting from implementation has a significant impact on the structure of the balance sheet.  Consequently, the analysis of the efficiency of using loans and the calculation of economic efficiency will directly depend on the accounting method adopted by the organization. </p><p>  The peculiarity <span>of the balance sheet</span> when using the method of accounting for revenue on payment is that it is compiled on January 1 of each year, and if money is not received from the customer on that day, the receivables of the customer will not be visible in the balance sheet.  Moreover, the page ‚ÄúAccounts payable‚Äù reflects all debts to suppliers and subcontractors for materials received and work performed.  As a result, the receivables of customers are not visible in it, and the cost of work performed during the <span>reporting period is</span> reflected in the page ‚ÄúGoods Shipped‚Äù.  As a result, when calculating the capital structure indicators, the figures obtained do not reflect the actual picture of the ratio of funds in the organization and the calculation of economic efficiency that was used in the planning of activities. </p><p>  When analyzing the structure of sources, it is necessary not only ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù to follow the calculation methods given in the literature on the analysis of the economic activity of business entities, but proceed from the specifics of the organization‚Äôs activities. </p><p>  Thus, the calculation of economic efficiency and financial statements of an economic entity provides an extensive amount of information.  On its basis, many performance indicators of the enterprise are adjusted and improved (if used correctly).  As mentioned above, high demands are placed on accountants and accounting documents.  Therefore, accounting does not just affect the <span>economy of the enterprise,</span> but is its ‚Äúnerve endings."  The slightest mistakes in work and errors in planning and organization of accounting lead not only to the criminal and administrative liability of managers, but also to serious and sometimes irreparable situations at the enterprise and in the economy as a whole. </p>
