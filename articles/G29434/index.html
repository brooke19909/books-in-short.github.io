Sample balance sheet filling</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many Russian companies are required to provide the Federal Tax Service balance sheet.  This document includes figures reflecting business turnovers, expenses, and liabilities.  Therefore, the balance sheet is the most important source of information indicating the level of enterprise performance.  How should this document be compiled?  What can look like samples of balance sheets? </p><h2>  What is a balance sheet? </h2><p>  To start, let us dwell on some theoretical questions.  So, before you examine the samples of the balance sheets, it is useful to consider the essence of this phenomenon.  The term under consideration most often refers to the methodology for grouping and classifying information that reflects the organization‚Äôs property assets in financial terms. </p>

    <p>  The balance sheet, as a rule, has 2 sections - asset and liability.  The first reflects property distributed by structure and location, the second - is classified based on its sources.  The balance sheet is provided at the end of the year. </p><h2>  Is a balance sheet required? </h2><p>  In the general case, it is mandatory.  Drawing up a balance sheet for Russian enterprises is a procedure enshrined in law.  An exception is established for individual entrepreneurs - provided that entrepreneurs keep a book of accounting for income and expenses.  Enterprises registered as LLC must provide balance, even if they operate using the simplified tax system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Balance Forms </h2><p>  The key document is legally defined by which the company must report in the aspect of accounting indicators to the state - form 0710001, corresponding to OKUD.  Or, as it is often informally called an accountant, form 1. The balance sheet, a sample of which we will consider in the article, can also be complete or simplified.  Based on what criteria can an enterprise choose the first or second reporting option? </p><h2>  Which form to choose: full or simplified? </h2><p>  Strictly speaking, the choice does not depend on the preferences of the organization‚Äôs leadership, but on the provisions of the law.  Therefore, the main thing is to interpret them correctly in order to then fill out the correct form of the balance sheet.  Of course, the company in any case can choose the full scheme of compiling the appropriate type of reporting.  But working with form 1 in this version is characterized by an incomparably greater complexity than when choosing a simplified document.  Firms, therefore, whenever possible strive to work according to a second, simpler scheme.  But for this they must meet a number of criteria: </p><ul><li>  the share of the authorized capital of the company owned by legal entities should not exceed 25%; </li><li>  the average number of employees per year should not exceed 100 people; </li><li>  the company's revenue should not be more than 400 million rubles.  in a year. </li></ul><p>  Only in accordance with the above points can a company send a simplified balance sheet to the Federal Tax Service.  We will consider a sample of reporting in this format a bit later.  Now we will study the specifics of compiling Form 1 in its full version.  We agree that we have to draw up a balance sheet for the year.  A sample of filling out the relevant document for other reporting periods (quarter, half year and 9 months) will generally be characterized by a similar structure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Balance sheet requirements </h2><p>  Before studying the actual algorithm for compiling the required reports at the Federal Tax Service, we will consider some legislative nuances regarding the requirements for documents of this type. </p>

    <p>  So, many lawyers recommend paying attention to the following requirement: <span>financial indicators</span> reflecting the activities of all structures of a legal entity, including branches and representative offices in any settlements, should be included in the balance sheet.  Another important requirement is that if the balance is passed by the LLC, then the figures reflected in the document must be approved at the general meeting of the company owners.  Form 1 should be supplemented by audit reports, if provided by joint-stock companies, banks or insurance organizations. </p><p>  We will now study the sample filling in the balance sheet.  Let's start with a scheme involving the use of the full version of form 1. </p><h2>  Important Attributes </h2><p>  So, consideration of the algorithm of necessary actions can be started by studying the specifics of filling in the very first lines of the document.  The heading of Form 1 should indicate the date of its preparation - December 31 of the year for which reporting is submitted.  After this, you must specify the full name of the company, the specifics of the activity, the legal form and type of ownership of the organization.  Next you need to determine the unit of measurement of financial indicators.  The best option is thousands of rubles.  The neighboring option needs to be emphasized.  You should indicate the correct location of the company, as well as pay attention to indicating the necessary codes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Let us agree that the balance in our example is filled in as part of the <span>annual reporting by the</span> leadership of a new company operating as an LLC with the involvement of the STS. </p><h2>  Full form filling algorithm: asset </h2><p>  The first thing we do is fill the asset. </p><p>  Column 1 should not be completed by all enterprises - only those that form <span>explanatory notes.</span>  Therefore, you can put a dash in it.  After that we pass to the lines.  They must be filled very carefully. </p><p>  Line 1110 records the difference between the two balances ‚Äî the debit of account 04 and the credit of account 05. Do not forget that we enter the values ‚Äã‚Äãin thousands of rubles.  That is, if the corresponding indicator is 140,000, then in line 1110 we write 140. </p><p>  In line 1150, you must also calculate the difference between the two balances - the debit of account 01 and the credit of account 02. Similarly, enter the number in thousands in the corresponding field. </p><p>  Line 1170 should include data corresponding to the debit balance of account 58. </p><p>  In paragraph 1100, the total of lines 1110, 1150, and also 1170 is summarized. It is useful to double-check the numbers before addition. </p><p>  Next, fill in line 1210, which records the sum of the balance indicators for accounts 10 and 43. </p><p>  In paragraph 1220, a figure is fixed corresponding to the balance of the debit of account 19. </p><p>  In line 1250, it is necessary to reflect the indicators that are calculated by adding the two balances - on the debit of accounts 50 and 51. </p><p>  After that, we consider the final figure and fix it in paragraph 1200. We summarize, thus, the indicators on lines 1210, 1220, as well as 1250. </p><p>  It is necessary to carefully double-check the numbers in paragraphs 1100 and 1200 - the fact is that to fill in line 1600 they need their sum. </p><h2>  Balance filling algorithm in full version: passive </h2><p>  Our next task is to correctly fill in the liability.  In it, similarly to the information that the balance sheet form contains in the asset part (we examined the sample algorithm for filling it out above), the numbers are indicated in thousands. </p>

    <p>  In line 1310 you need to reflect the figure corresponding to the credit balance of account 80. </p><p>  In paragraph 1360, the credit balance of account 82. </p><p>  Line 1370 should contain figures corresponding to the indicators of the credit balance of the account 84 (if the company has a profit). </p><p>  In order to calculate the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor paragraph 1300, it is necessary to summarize the data on the above lines - 1310, 1360, as well as 1370. </p><p>  Provided that the debt of the company is short-term, the indicator for paragraph 1520 is calculated by adding up four balances - for loans of accounts 60, 62, 69, as well as 70. </p><p>  On line 1500, you can copy the values ‚Äã‚Äãof clause 1520. </p><p>  Line 1700 records the numbers resulting from the summation of the data in paragraphs 1300 and 1500. </p><p>  Next, you can put dashes.  After that, it is necessary to verify the values ‚Äã‚Äãin lines 1600 and 1700. They must be the same.  If so, then the balance is drawn up successfully. </p><p>  Consider now a sample of filling the balance sheet in a simplified form. </p><h2>  Simplified balance sheet filling algorithm: asset </h2><p>  In the asset, we need to fill out 2 (if necessary, it should be added to the document - to display the codes) and 3 columns - in it we will record the indicators. </p><p>  In the line ‚ÄúMaterial non-current assets‚Äù, which can be assigned the code 1150, the value of fixed assets of the company is fixed. </p><p>  Next, fill out the item ‚ÄúIntangible, financial and other assets‚Äù.  We agree that the key ones are long-term investments, therefore, the line in question must be assigned code 1170. </p><p>  In the ‚ÄúInventories‚Äù item, it is necessary to indicate numbers similar to those recorded in general form, on line 1210. At the same time, this will be the code for the simplified document. </p><p>  In the item "Cash and cash equivalents" you need to record the relevant information and assign it the code 1250. </p><p>  Then we assign the code 1260 to the line ‚Äúfinancial and other assets‚Äù and fix the numbers there that were not included in the higher paragraphs of the simplified form. </p><p>  After that, we consider the total amount that will need to be reflected in line 1600. This can be done by adding the indicators for items 1150, 1170, 1210, 1250, as well as 1260. </p>

    <p>  Now we pass to the liability. </p><h2>  Simplified form: passive </h2><p>  In the paragraph ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù are fixed figures reflecting the <span>authorized capital,</span> reserve funds and retained earnings.  The code should correspond to the indicator, which is the largest in the monetary volume.  We agree that this is retained earnings.  Therefore, we assign the code 1370 to this line. </p><p>  The next line, to which code 1520 must be assigned, records <span>accounts payable</span> in the short-term category. </p><p>  Next - we consider the results - in paragraph 1700. We summarize, thus, the indicators for lines 1370 and 1520. </p><p>  After this, it is necessary to verify the numbers at paragraphs 1600 and 1700. Considering the full sample of filling out the balance sheet form, we noted that they should converge.  A similar criterion is also for a simplified document. </p><p>  This may be a sample of the balance sheet of a small enterprise, which, in accordance with the provisions of the law, is entitled to use the simpler version of Form 1. However, the company may, at its discretion, also use the full version of the relevant document. </p><h2>  Balance at zero revs </h2><p>  It happens that the company, formally being in the status of a registered legal entity, does not conduct active activities, as a result of which there are no financial turns on it.  How is the corresponding balance sheet filled - zero?  A sample algorithm for compiling it is extremely simple.  All that needs to be filled in form 1 in this case is lines 1250 and 1600 in the asset, as well as 1300 and 1700 in the liability.  Most likely, they will reflect the minimum authorized capital of the company - 10 thousand rubles.  Of course, all other parts of the document - in particular, reflecting information about the company - must be filled out correctly. </p><h2>  Filling the balance sheet: what to look for </h2><p>  So, we examined the samples of the balance sheets - complete and simplified.  It‚Äôs easy to fill out the relevant documents if you have access to the necessary accounts for which the balance is recognized.  However, no matter how logical the sample of the enterprise balance sheet is, it is useful to take into account a number of the most important nuances of filling it out.  Consider them. </p>

    <p>  Form 1 of the balance sheet must be signed by two officials - the director and chief accountant of the company.  This ensures that the information provided by the company to the Federal Tax Service is correct. </p><p>  Before filling out the balance, you need to make sure that work is in progress with Form 1, approved by order of the Ministry of Finance No. 66n of July 2, 2010, and not with any other document. </p><p>  When compiling the appropriate type of reporting, it is recommended to be guided by the criteria prescribed in PBU 4/99, namely in section 4 of this source. </p><p>  If the company has been operating for more than a year, then indicators for previous periods should be indicated in the current report.  In accordance with paragraph 10 of PBU 4/99, the corresponding figures can be adjusted (if there are necessary explanations for the balance sheet). </p><p>  If any indicators in Form 1 are negative, then they must be entered using parentheses.  Any correct sample balance sheets must meet this criterion. </p><h2>  When to provide balance in the Federal Tax Service? </h2><p>  It is necessary to submit Form 1 to the Federal Tax Service before April 1 of the year following the reporting year.  The date of fulfillment of this obligation corresponds to the time of sending the specified document by mail or its actual transfer to the Federal Tax Service.  However, if it is a day off, then the date on which Form 1 is provided is the next business day.  Therefore, firms should be careful when reporting close to deadlines. </p><h2>  Balance sheet value </h2><p>  The provision of the appropriate type of reporting, as we noted above, is the obligation of Russian enterprises established by law.  However, not only the Federal Tax Service may be interested in obtaining the necessary figures from the company.  The fact is that the indicators recorded in Form 1 are able to give, on the whole, a quite adequate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow things are going on at the enterprise, and how effective its business model is. </p>
