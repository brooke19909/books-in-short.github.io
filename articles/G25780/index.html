    <h2>  Alcudia </h2><p>  It is one of the oldest cities in Mallorca, a former antique Roman port.  Now the town has become one of the best beach resorts in the north of the island.  And its full name is Puerto de Alcudia.  All urban entertainment - and these are mainly discos and nightclubs - are concentrated in the so-called ‚ÄúGolden Mile‚Äù area, that is, very close to the place where the Globales Condes De Alcudia 3 * hotel is located.  A little in the depths of the island lurks a real pearl - the old city of Alcudia.  There are still preserved thirteenth-century ramparts, along which you can bypass the historic quarters around the perimeter.  And the buildings in the city are also almost all medieval.  This fortress has long protected the entire island from pirates.  Tourists usually like the city cathedral - the gothic church of St. Jaum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Globales Condes De Alcudia 3 Mallorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1538001.jpg" width="600"></div>

The rest of the time you will have to get with a transfer, most often in Barcelona.  From this Catalan city, as well as from Valencia, ferries and larger ships go to Palma.  Regular buses run from the airport to Alcudia - since the public transport in Mallorca works like clockwork.  The Globales Condes De Alcudia 3 * hotel has an excellent location.  Nearby is not only the beach, but the center of the town, shops, restaurants, as well as the promenade, where there are snow-white yachts.  Supermarket Spar is just around the corner from the hotel.  There is a bus stop near the hotel entrance.  There are several flights here - you can get to the island's capital, Palma, go to the other end of Mallorca or the airport.  In addition, a tourist train stops right there and takes you to the center of Alcudia.  Although you can safely walk there - the distance to the old city is not more than one kilometer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Globales Condes De Alcudia 3 Spain Majorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1537997.jpg" width="600"></div>
