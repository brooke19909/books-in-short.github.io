One of the most popular of the not too expensive resorts in this country is the city of Candolim.  The village is small, but the tourist infrastructure here is developed just fine.  Of course, there are hotels in this town that are convenient for tourists.  One of the best, according to many guests of Candolim, is Affortel Magnum Resorts 3 *. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  The city of Candolim is located 15 km from Panaji, the capital of Goa.  The most suitable time for a beach holiday here, as elsewhere in India, is the period from October to February.  Buses run regularly from Panaji to Candolim.  They leave from the station of the capital Goa every 20 minutes.  You can get to Candolim from Panaji in just 15-20 minutes. </p><p>  Some tourists who book rooms at the Affortel Magnum Resorts 3 * hotel get to the place and by taxi.  It costs usually not too expensive.  The cost of the trip from the airport is 810 rupees. </p>

    <p>  The location of the Affortel Magnum Resorts 3 * hotel itself is considered by most tourists to be very successful.  It is located in close proximity to one of the busiest streets of the city - Candolim Beach Road.  According to many guests, the hotel is a convenient starting point both to the south and to the north.  Actually, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel‚Äôs location itself - Khobra Uddo - is considered by tourists to be one of the most quiet and not bad, including family vacations.  Several large shops and markets are located right at the entrance to the hotel, which is certainly very convenient for its guests.  The exact address of this hotel is: INDIA, GOA, Magnum Resorts, Near Health Center Candolim, Bardez, North Goa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  This hotel is a modern four-story small building with balconies.  The exterior, in fact, of the house itself, is rated by most tourists as very good.  The walls of the building are painted in a pleasant green color, and the balconies are in blue and white.  Such an organic combination of shades makes the facade of the hotel fresh and elegant.  Tall palm trees grow in the courtyard next to the hotel.  A solid large pool with clear blue water also gives a solid look to the area.  The hotel courtyard is paved with beautiful neat paving tiles. </p><p>  On some specialized sites, this hotel is classified as a two-star hotel.  The range of services here is really not too big.  But, since the service at this hotel is not bad, the furniture is new, and the equipment is working properly, it can nevertheless be considered a three-star with some stretch.  Yes, in principle, this is not particularly important to which group the hotel belongs to.  The main thing is that living in it, judging by the reviews of tourists, is quite convenient. </p>

Many of its guests prefer to relax near Monica's, as the beach is clean and there are always a few people.

The presence of balconies is also attributed to the advantages of the hotel.  From some windows of the hotel you can see the sea, from others - a neat courtyard with a pool.  Water in the latter, by the way, is most often clean. </p>

    <p>  Tourists also praise the Affortel Magnum Resorts for the fact that there, in contrast to many other similar establishments in India, there is no living creature.  Rats and lizards do not appear in the hotel rooms.  Sometimes, however, small ants make life difficult for guests. </p><p>  The air conditioners in all rooms are brand new.  In any case, they work, judging by the reviews, regularly and perform their functions well.  Hotel guests do not suffer from stuffiness.  Moreover, all rooms are equipped with ventilation. </p><p>  The rest in this hotel is mainly residents of India itself, coming from deep provinces.  Therefore, guests with a European appearance are always in the center of attention of curious neighbors.  Such a slightly annoying interest can perhaps be considered to some extent a minus of this hotel.  Also, many tourists attribute to the shortcomings of the hotel frequent interruptions with hot water.  But this is also a disaster for most Goa hotels.  Without interruptions, hot water in India can only be used by guests of those hotels in the bathrooms of which flow heaters are installed. </p><h2>  What you should know about </h2><p>  The rooms in this hotel are quite good, but there are not particularly.  Judging by the reviews of tourists who arrived from Russia, the administration is trying to populate the new arrivals primarily in those that are worse.  The room, for example, may be too damp.  Or the room may not have a balcony.  In this situation, you should definitely ask the administration to replace the apartment.  Usually the hotel staff meets tourists and provides a better room at the first request.  In order to be sure that the requirement to replace the room is heeded, it is worth making a small present to the hotel employees.  It can be, for example, a box of chocolates or a bottle of vodka (for a man). </p>
