    <h2>  What you should pay attention to? </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to carefully consider the terms of lending and use.  The most important indicators are: the credit limit, the cost of services, the annual interest rate on the loan and the duration of the grace period, the complexity of registration, the terms of repayment of the debt.  To date, the lending rate in many banks ranges from 22 to 35%, and the limit on loans, as a rule, does not exceed 750 000 rubles. </p><p>  Many people wonder where it is better to get a credit card without inquiries.  Let's figure it out together. </p><p>  The cost of issuing a credit card and its service varies for each bank.  And if plastic is usually issued free of charge, then a fee of between 300 and 6,000 rubles per year is charged for its service, based on the card category.  You also need to learn more about the availability and duration of the grace period - the time during which you can pay the debt without interest.  As a rule, it equals 50-60 days, although exceptions are possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Remember that repaying a loan is a regular process, and therefore it should be as convenient as possible.  Better when there are many repayment channels.  Today, banks provide an opportunity to pay off debt not only in their branches, but also through payment terminals, ATMs, as well as using online services.  Access to Internet banking and the presence of SMS alerts also make using a credit card more camouflage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where better to get a credit card reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2079326.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Below we will tell you where it is better to take a credit card. </p><p>  Pay attention to the commission for <span>withdrawing cash from a credit card.</span>  Credit cards are primarily designed for cashless payments, but they also allow you to withdraw money in cash.  But the commission for this procedure can reach up to 7% of the withdrawn amount.  Be sure to find out about the presence of partner banks.  In their ATMs, a lower commission is charged (as in your bank) compared to third-party ones.  Also, these ATMs allow you to repay the loan by depositing cash.  The more partners your bank has, the better. </p><p>  Ultimately, some credit cards have additional features, for example, they provide discounts at certain stores and restaurants, allow you to accumulate bonuses in various airline programs, and sometimes you can even get a small percentage of your purchases, it is also called Cash Vask.  If you are interested in such advantages of a credit card, then check all the details with the bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So where is the best place to get a credit card?  We will talk about this later. </p><h2>  Manual for the recipient of a plastic credit card </h2><ul><li>  All loan conditions should be carefully studied: find out the loan rate, the size of the credit limit and the cost of annual servicing. </li><li>  Find out if there is a grace period and its period: the more, the more profitable for you.  You also need to clarify whether it applies to cash withdrawals. </li><li>  It is necessary to study the possibilities and conditions for repaying the debt well: to find out about the minimum monthly payment, when it is necessary to make it, how to do it and what penalties for its delay.  Study the contract very carefully, because often this information is given in small print or in footnotes. </li><li>  Familiarize yourself with the conditions for withdrawing cash from an ATM, how much the commission is at "native" ATMs and third-party ATMs, and request a list of partner banks.  As a rule, it is posted on the website of the card issuing bank.  Remember that some banks do not have "their" ATMs and even branches. </li><li>  Carefully read the bonus programs on the card: think carefully about how much you need it.  If so, you should choose a card that best suits your nature of expenses and lifestyle. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is it better to get a credit card without inquiries" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2079327.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Not sure which one to choose - Visa or MasterCard?  For citizens of the Russian Federation, there are practically no differences between these systems.  The main payment currency for Visa is the dollar, and for MasterCard is the euro. </p><p>  Where is it better to get a credit card for reviews? </p><h2>  What options do the largest banks in the country offer? </h2><p>  Not sure which credit card you would like to get?  This is really not an easy question, because today more than 70 banks offer this product, and the number of credit programs exceeds one hundred.  However, there are still some tips, following which will help determine: </p><ul><li>  If you need a credit card as a monetary guarantee, in other words - you want to have a ‚Äúspare‚Äù wallet with finances for emergency cases, then in this case it is better to choose a card with a long grace period.  You can significantly save on interest, if you meet the "grace period". </li><li>  If you fundamentally need the ability to withdraw cash from a credit card, then you should give preference to a bank that has a wide network of ATMs - its and its partner banks.  The advantageous offer for withdrawing cash from a credit card is not more than 3%.  It is important to decide in advance in which bank it is better to take a credit card. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is it better to get a card with a credit limit" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2079328.jpg"></div></li><li>  If you are an avid traveler, then you will like a credit card with bonus loyalty programs for railway or airlines.  Such cards are now provided by almost all the major leading banks in Russia. </li><li>  Women will like credit cards, which include discounts in beauty salons and shops. </li><li>  For motorists, a card with bonus loyalty programs for car dealers or gas stations is suitable. </li></ul><p>  A frequent question: "Where is it better to get a card with a credit limit of 200,000 rubles?".  You can give a lot of recommendations, but even following them, it is very difficult to decide on the best credit card.  Therefore, in our article there is a small analysis of the market, which will allow you to choose the best offer. </p><p>  This rating takes into account the maximum criteria and, most importantly, consumer preferences.  According to statistics, the priorities for cardholders are: </p><ul><li>  credit interest rate; </li><li>  card service price; </li><li>  loan limit amount; </li><li>  grace period duration; </li><li>  speed and procedure of registration; </li><li>  comfortable use (are there SMS alerts and an Internet bank, a commission for cash withdrawals, the number of ATMs, etc.). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank is better to take a credit card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2079329.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  To understand which credit card and which bank is better to choose, the conditions should be studied very carefully. </p><h2>  Card from UniCredit Bank for those who are constantly driving </h2><p>  Users of this plastic can use a number of services free of charge for motorists: car evacuation in case of an accident, fuel delivery, technical and legal advice over the phone, the ability to call a taxi if the car breaks down. </p><h2>  Card from Promsvyazbank for those who do not want to pay for the first year of service </h2><p>  Holders of this credit card will have points in the bonus program PSBonus.  This makes it possible to pay up to 90% of the cost of purchases in partner stores of the bank. </p><p>  Which bank is best to take a credit card without overpaying? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which credit card and which bank is better to choose the conditions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2079330.jpg"></div>
