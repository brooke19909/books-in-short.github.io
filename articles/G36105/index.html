  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY stone jewelry - general theory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern fashion industry offers young ladies a choice of many products from precious metals and gems.  However, in order to look more remarkable, girls prefer to create jewelry from natural stones with their own hands.  This is not surprising, because no one will have such an ornament, and the product itself looks attractive and completes the image.  You can create stylish and fashionable jewelry using different materials - beads, leather, iron and so on.  But first things first. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aobeipearl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jewelry for fashionistas" class="if uuid-3122803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3122803.jpg"></div><h2>  Bead jewelery </h2><p>  It's no secret that the easiest way to make a necklace or bracelet is from the most affordable material.  So at the moment is beads.  A lot of workshops and lessons on weaving, videos and patterns - this is what this material can offer fashionistas.  But how to improve what is?  The answer is simple: make jewelry from beads and stones with your own hands.  In fact, this only sounds complicated.  To work, you will not need much: </p><ul><li>  Beads. </li><li>  The design of a bracelet or necklace, perhaps your own imagination. </li><li>  The stones. </li><li>  Jewelry carabiner. </li></ul><p>  When everything is ready, you can start assembling, there is nothing abstruse.  The most difficult thing is to get the stones of the right size, but this, subject to a huge number of online stores, is quite realistic.  In addition, all this, not counting the scheme, can be found in hand-made stores.  The assembly itself will not take much time, about an hour or two - and a unique fashionable decoration is ready.  You can wear it yourself or give it, some people also sell finished products.  Of course, they are far from a great corporation, but they get their part of the well-deserved profit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jewelry made of stone and beads" class="if uuid-3122794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3122794.jpg"></div><h2>  Leather </h2><p>  Jewelry made from natural materials is very expensive.  In addition, they are great for many modern styles.  Where gold earrings cannot be worn, simple wickerwork will do.  Usually, jewelry made of leather and stone, created with your own hands, is a necklace or beads, but you can also come up with your own design of earrings.  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  Stones of the desired shape and size, always with a hole for the lace. </li><li>  Leather laces.  They can be found in specialized stores or redeemed for nothing at the workshop workers working with this material.  You can cut pieces of leather on your own, or you can ask in the same place in the workshop for a fee. </li><li>  Carabiner or other type of fastener. </li><li>  Time. </li></ul><p>  It will initially be quite hard to work with the skin, especially if this is the first time.  That knots are not tightened, then the weaving is crooked.  But after a short workout, everything will go smoothly.  When creating jewelry from stones with your own hands, you only need to choose the ‚Äúright‚Äù mineral, the process itself is complicated only because of ignorance or inexperience.  If you want to do such a simple thing, you should look at several workshops on the topic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.risingsunstudiojewelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jewelry made of stone and leather" class="if uuid-3122808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3122808.jpg"></div><h2>  Iron </h2><p>  This method is the latest because it is the simplest.  To make jewelry with stones with your own hands, you will not need anything but material.  In fact, this is a simple assembly of the product, only there is no template - the person creates himself. </p><p>  You can buy all the necessary resources in the store for creativity, there are usually several types of required material.  You can buy stones through the Global Network or in special stores - it all depends on the requests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tesuosstore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple stone jewelry" class="if uuid-3122797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3122797.jpg"></div><p>  To create a quality product you will need one tool - pliers.  You will also need the decorative material itself and something like a jewelry rope or rings.  When everything you need is purchased, you can proceed.  On average, it can take from 5 minutes to a couple of hours to assemble one jewelry from stones with your own hands, it all depends on the complexity of the product. </p><h2>  Cost of stones </h2><p>  Natural stones are not just glass; their price is much higher.  If you carefully study the stores for jewelry, you will see that some models are sometimes more expensive than a gold chain or ring.  Of course, everything is not as bad as it seems.  Of course, we are not talking about rubies or sapphires.  Each craftswoman can afford to buy several beads from semiprecious or ornamental stone.  The same hematite is quite inexpensive - about three hundred rubles per piece, and the effect of it is amazing.  But you will have to spend money on malachite products - the cost of one medium-sized bead starts from a thousand rubles. </p><p>  Do not be afraid to create, make jewelry with stones with your own hands, fantasize.  In addition, individuality is now at the peak of fame.  By selling the simplest stone products, you can earn extra money, and, among other things, also enjoy the process itself. </p>
