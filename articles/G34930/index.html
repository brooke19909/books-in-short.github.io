Vacationers note a high level of cleanliness, comfort and excellent room decoration.  Not all hotels in Krasnodar are so scrupulous about this issue.  Toiletries for guests are prepared in advance, they are new.  The staff is helpful and communicates well with tourists. </p><p>  Among the minuses can sometimes be noted unclean air conditioning.  The remaining nuances such as a fallen off nail from the wall are solved in the shortest possible time, which is satisfied with all travelers who stay here. </p><p>  Particular attention in the reviews is given to the perfectly completed repair.  Due to the location of the hotel, the rooms are always quiet.  No noise can be heard from the street, from the neighbors it is minimal.  The last question for some is really important.  Some hotels in Krasnodar are located in places where it is almost impossible to achieve silence, and it is incredibly difficult to relax in such conditions. </p><p>  Guests say that there are few outlets in the building.  For breakfast, not a wide variety of dishes is served, but what is available is enough to get enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar hotels hotels" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1430911.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about Victoria </h2><p>  Guests who visit this hotel, note the positive aspects in the work of the staff and the hotel as a whole.  "Victoria" among some ranks first among all the options they visited.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, we can say that this option is quite suitable for those who plan to stay just a few nights.  You can live here, the conditions are suitable, but the guest will not feel much comfort and coziness.  Considering all the hotels in the center of Krasnodar, I must say that this option is the cheapest and easiest. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  As it becomes clear from the article, in Krasnodar there are a lot of options that allow people to settle for a short period of time for little money.  Those who do not disdain to spend the night in dormitory rooms can significantly save money and even live in comfortable conditions. </p>
