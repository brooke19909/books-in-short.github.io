Each tourist will be able to choose a guest house in the city of Gelendzhik - the prices of the highest season for accommodation do not exceed 2000 rubles per day. </p><h2>  Guest House Thin Cape </h2><p>  An excellent guest house with the same name district is located ten minutes from the open sea and the equipped central beach of the Thin Cape. </p><p>  The guest house itself is a two-story heated cottage with nine rooms and a parking lot in the courtyard for 6 cars.  Accommodation this hotel offers year-round, as well as other guest houses in Gelendzhik.  Thin Cape is happy for its tourists at any time of the year.
