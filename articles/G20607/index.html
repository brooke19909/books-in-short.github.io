About 750 thousand people live here.  The city has an ancient history, it is associated with the Mayan civilization, although the settlement appeared on world maps only in the XVIII century.  It is believed that the name came from the word Kancan, which translates as a magic snake or the throne of a snake. </p><p>  The city is conditionally divided into two parts: </p><ul><li>  Zona Hotelera, in other words, territory with hotels, hotel area; </li><li>  Downtown, part of the city where locals live. </li></ul><p>  People come here to visit the sand spit, which from a bird's eye view resembles the number "7".  The length of the beaches is 30 kilometers, and the coastline is 400 meters wide.  The average temperature throughout the year is +32 degrees.  But not only for this reason tourists come here, there are many interesting places. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Cancun is, first of all, a beach, an opportunity to go diving and get a sea of ​​positive emotions after seeing coral reefs.  All the beaches of the city and the surrounding area are sandy.  The sand itself is of calcareous origin, fine.  Depending on the time of year, the intensity of the waves also varies.  On weekends and <span>holidays</span> , various festivals and holidays are held on the banks, artists and singers perform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="noticaribe.com.mx" data-author=": " data-source="http://noticaribe.com.mx/2013/05/05/caen-extorsionadores-del-cdg-cuando-exigian-derecho-de-piso-en-negocio-de-la-plaza-de-toros-de-cancun/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Plaza de toros" class="if uuid-2289406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2289406.jpg"></div><h2>  The central part of the city </h2><p>  As they say, not a single beach, there are enough attractions in Cancun.  If you do not travel to the suburbs, you can walk around the center in the area of ​​Bonampak Avenida.  Here are concentrated cultural centers, ATMs and exchange points, there are markets and supermarkets.  You should definitely go to the Mercado 28 market, this is where you can find a unique souvenir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the historical part is the Mayan Museum, which is combined with the site of the archaeological site of San Miguelito. </p><p>  In the hotel part of the city there is still a place of an ancient settlement - the ruins of the city of El Rey.  These are 47 preserved structures, some of them even preserved carvings.  And in the house of culture you can learn about local culture, and every day the exhibition changes.  You can learn about folk dances and songs at the theater.  And of course, you should visit the Plaza de Toros arena.  This is an opportunity to see firsthand the Mexican bullfight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.expedia.com/El-Rey-Ruins-Hotel-Zone.d6075612.Vacation-Attraction"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal ruins" class="if uuid-2289407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2289407.jpg"></div><h2>  Royal ruins </h2><p>  Another attraction of Cancun is Las Ruinas del Rey.  There is a theory that these are the remnants of the Mayan observatory surrounded by a fishing village.  Buildings date back to 200 years of our era.  Excavations at this place began in the 16th century, today these are small temple-hills, a town square and two streets that adjoin it. </p><h2>  Nizuk Park </h2><p>  And for lovers of water entertainment, a Mexican attraction in Cancun is a water park.  Here you can swim with dolphins, there are also many other attractions.  There is also a diving zone, rides and slides. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.10best.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.10best.com/destinations/mexico/cancun/vicinity/attractions/el-meco-archaeological-park/"><img itemprop="image" alt="El Meco City" class="if uuid-2289413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2289413.jpg"></div><h2>  El Meco City </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the main attraction of Cancun - the ancient Mayan city of El Meco.  The approximate age when the structures were erected - X or XI.  It is believed that in ancient times it was a port city, which is located near the islands of Women.  However, there is no such place in the standard programs of travel agencies, therefore only true connoisseurs of ancient architecture get here.  The main building is the stone pyramid of El Castillo, 10 meters high. </p><h2>  Park Shkaret, description </h2><p>  Every tourist who has visited the country has a photo with the sights of Cancun in Mexico.  This is a national park, magnificent nature with many dirt rivers, coral reefs and pristine beaches.  In this place you can observe how the ruins of the Mayan people are being excavated. </p><p>  The park has the opportunity to swim with dolphins, dive under the water and watch the reefs or go on a safari on the island of Jaguars.  There is a unique tent with butterflies and a cave with real bats. </p><p>  Dance and music shows are regularly held on the territory, mainly by actors in national costumes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.writeopinions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Isla Mujeres Island" class="if uuid-2289429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2289429.jpg"></div><h2>  Isla Mujeres Island </h2><p>  The Isla Mujeres Island's Cancun landmark photo attracts and bewitches even seasoned travelers.  This is a completely miniature piece of land among the waters of the ocean, only 5 miles long.  There are very shallow beaches.  But this is not the most interesting, there is a tortoise farm on the island.  And of course - Mayan ruins and buildings erected by Caribbean pirates in the 17th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapers-xs.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://wallpapers-xs.blogspot.com/2012/12/chichen-itza-yucatan-mexico-el-castillo.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Isla Mujeres Island" class="if uuid-2289433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2289433.jpg"></div><h2>  Ceremonial center </h2><p>  There are few tourists reaching this place, so these photos of Cancun's attractions in Mexico are few, but it’s worth coming here.  The ceremonial center is called Chichen Itza, this ancient city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  It was erected when the Roman Empire ruled Europe.  The heyday falls on the 7th century, when the God of Rain was the universally recognized deity.  The village passed from hand to hand, the most dangerous settlers were the Taltes, who recognized human sacrifice. </p><p>  In the literal sense, the name Chichen Itza means a place near the well, and Itza is the name of the tribe.  Indeed, there are two senodes in the district: </p><ul><li>  Sacred. </li><li>  Sholok. </li></ul><p>  Researchers suggest that the second cenode was used as a well with drinking water, and the second was a ritual place.  It was here that the victims intended for the Gods were dumped.  In support of this fact, human remains, fragments of dishes and jewelry were found in the well. </p><p>  Be sure to visit the “Temple of the Warriors”, a field where ancient people played the ball, the Karakol Observatory and the wall of skulls.  And if you like to tickle your nerves, then you should definitely go to Holbosh Island or to Isla Muharis.  In summer, some of the largest sharks, the cetaceans, sail to these shores to enjoy plankton.  Underwater excursions in this season are held daily. </p>
