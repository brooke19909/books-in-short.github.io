    <p>  To know the essence of the state is to understand all its contradictory and diverse properties, sides, <span>forms of being</span> in a complex, presenting it as an independent institution.  In this case, the main and determining in its development and functioning are revealed.  To reveal the essence of the state is to analyze it as a political organization of a mature, mature class.  Comprehension of the nature of this independent institution is considered one of the main tasks in the theory of law. </p><p>  The essence of the state as a <span>political organization is</span> mainly related to what constitutes a special organization of political power.  At the same time, power is endowed with concentrated power.  Various state institutions that contribute to organizational design act as this force.  Thus, political power becomes obligatory and functioning. </p><p>  The state institutions are various bodies (army, prisons, courts, punitive bodies) and legal norms.  They materially embody political power.  Thus, its indissoluble connection with one degree or another degree and form of development of statehood is formed. </p><p>  <span>Political power</span> expresses the needs, will, interests of social groups, the leading role among which is occupied by classes.  However, the political nature is determined not only by the presence of regulatory mechanisms of class relations.  The essence of the state to one degree or another involves the regulation of relations between groups in society.  Politics is, first of all, a special system of relations between all classes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, the essence of the state as a political entity is most clearly manifested when comparing it with civil society.  Inside it (society) there are various relationships.  Public include ideological, economic, religious, moral, cultural and other organizations and unions. </p><p>  As a result, the essence of the <span>social state is formed,</span> represented by the unity of content and form.  Moreover, the form is a political power.  The content is presented by civil society. </p><p>  One of the important characteristics of the state is its structural nature.  It manifests itself in the presence of a special apparatus, represented by persons vested with public authority.  These figures perform the functions of leadership and management, ensure the protection of the political and <span>social system,</span> including through coercion.  However, the state is not the only instrument of power.  Besides him, there are other forms of its implementation.  In particular, non-governmental associations, <span>political parties</span> and movements, <span>labor collectives,</span> trade unions and so on are quite common.  In comparison with them, the state is a clearly structured system that includes special bodies that carry out its various external and internal tasks. </p><p>  A fairly fundamental characteristic is territorial integrity.  The state organization promotes the unification of the population in one territory with the subsequent division of it into smaller administrative units.  Thus, the state has clear boundaries.  The entire territory within these borders is subject to legal norms and power. </p><p>  The state as a special organization of political power is also characterized by other specific features.  Among them, the most important are the following: </p><p>  1. Monopoly on enforcement measures against the population. </p><p>  2. The sovereignty of power. </p><p>  3. The publication of rules and laws binding on all citizens. </p><p>  4. Collection of fees and taxes on the maintenance of the power apparatus. </p>
