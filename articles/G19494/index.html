    <p>  If you are a legal entity, then you can get access to the full range of services knowing the code word.  If you know how to call the MTS operator from a mobile, but accidentally forgot the code word, then you can change it only with a personal presence at the company‚Äôs office.  The list of services is identical to the already mentioned.  Plus a few extra ones.  For example, you can choose the method of delivery of bills. </p><h2></h2><h2>  By fax or email </h2><p>  If you contact the Contact Center in this way, you can expect services to be connected or disconnected, help to change the number, your data and tariff plan, block the phone at the right time, or cancel the lock.  In addition, legal entities can change the password for Internet services and the delivery address of bills. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Talk about the cost </h2><p>  You already know how to call the MTS operator, but you need to know about one interesting point.  Oddly enough, the fact that the call is made for free does not mean that you will not have to pay anything.  If the service that you ask the operator for can be made by you through the self-service terminal, then you will pay 10 rubles for it.  This does not apply to simple consultations, but this includes, for example, connecting additional options.  That is, even if the price list states that the connection to the service is free, you will still be charged 10 rubles for the operator to complete this procedure for you.  In this regard, it's time to talk about how to do without a Contact Center, and you can do this in a variety of ways. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Other solutions to problems </h2>

    <p>  Instead of calling the operator, you yourself can solve many problems without resorting to his help.  There are tons of options for this.  You can always choose the most convenient.  It also depends on whether you have access to the Internet nearby, whether you can type text messages, and how to top up your phone balance.  Let's start with the simplest - text messages. </p><h2></h2><h2>  We manage SMS services </h2><p>  This is a free resource available to anyone at any place where he has a telephone connection.  No settings will be required, and to find out special codes that allow changing tariff plans and connecting options, you can only send the number 2 to number 111. Upon this request, you will receive a complete list of services that you can get using this method.  If you sent an application to change the tariff plan, and this is impossible for technical reasons, you will receive a response: "This request cannot be fulfilled."  However, nothing will be deducted from your balance sheet.  You can also find all service codes on the operator‚Äôs website.  This method is available even to a child, and you can use it, for example, on a trip. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Mobile assistant </h2><p>  Here you also do not need the MTS mobile operator number.  The method differs from the previous one only in that you do not need to send anything.  And instead of sending messages to number 111, just call him.  This is also a free call.  Following the automatic instructions, you can find out your balance, replenish it with a payment card, make a "promised" payment, and so on.  Please note that when roaming this service is paid. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Electronic assistant </h2>

    <p>  You can control your phone even from payment terminals.  This is very convenient if you are used to replenishing your mobile balance in this way.  So, without going far, you can change your tariff plan or activate a new service.  However, not all so simple.  To have access to this feature, you need to get a password.  This can be done through a personal account or in person with a telecom operator. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Personal account on the site </h2><p>  The MTS operator, like many large players in the communications market, offers its subscribers a very convenient tool - a personal account.  So you have access to more services, you manage your expenses in real time, you can control the location of your child and store your contacts on the network, which will prevent their accidental deletion. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  No matter where in the country you are.  If you have a local number and an MTS operator, how to call (St. Petersburg, Siberia or Moscow - there is no difference) in this case?  Dial one short number 0890, for whatever issue you call.  If the case is not so urgent, use other controls.  Add services via text messages or short numbers, find out the balance by calling 111. All this greatly simplifies the scheme of interaction with operators.  You will not need to listen to the entire voice tree that meets you before the operator is in touch.  Extra money will not be deducted from you.  You will always be aware of where your money goes, what you pay for.  Now you know not just how to call the MTS operator from a mobile, but also how to do without these calls. </p>
