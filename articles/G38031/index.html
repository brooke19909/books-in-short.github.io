    <p>  But not only tourism lives on this fertile land.  Kuban has long been considered the Russian breadbasket, and for good reason.  The region occupies a leading position in gross agricultural output.  All industry is concentrated in several major centers - this is Krasnodar, Armavir and Novorossiysk.  These <span>cities of the Krasnodar Territory</span> impress with their production capacities and volumes.  Also, the Kuban became famous for another popular product - wine.  Investments in winemaking reach enormous proportions, and the products are not inferior in quality to wines from the former USSR.  Therefore, many to the question "Where is it better to live in the Krasnodar Territory?"  answer - next to the vineyard. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The region is located in the southern part of Russia and is simultaneously located on the shores of the Black and Azov Seas.  The northern part of the Kuban borders with the Rostov region, and the southern - with Georgia and Karachay-Cherkessia.  The region is part of the <span>Southern Federal District</span> (Russia, Krasnodar Territory, identifier is 23). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most of the Kuban territory is occupied by plains, but further to the south the foothills of the North Caucasus begin.  The region was named Kuban due to the river, which flows through the entire region. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  When the entire coast of the <span>Krasnodar Territory</span> joined the Russian Empire, Cossacks from the Black Sea region poured en masse there.  They developed new lands, were engaged in construction and defended the empire from the southern aggressors. </p>

    <p>  Now in the Kuban there are more than 5.5 million people with a population density of 70 people / sq.  km  The bulk of the inhabitants are Slavs (about 90%), followed by Armenians (5.5%) and Ukrainians (4%).  Separately, it is worth mentioning the Cossacks.  The Krasnodar Cossacks is a special movement, isolated from the older northern brother - the Don Cossacks.  The descendants of the Cossacks are widely represented among the population of the Kuban, and most of them occupied many villages of the Krasnodar Territory. </p><h2>  Crime </h2><p>  The criminal situation in the region can be called more or less calm.  Quite often, the nearby Caucasus is heating up events, from where people travel north in search of a better life, and the Kuban is the first region on their way. </p><p>  Also resort towns and cities of the Krasnodar Territory have their own criminal specifics, and Sochi facilities after the Olympics are still a tidbit for criminals.  But if we talk about most ordinary villages and towns, then peace and order reign there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unemployment rate </h2><p>  Kuban unemployment amounted to only 6% of the economically active part of the region, which is significantly lower than the average Russian level.  Also, the region was distinguished by a high salary, and although it is judged by the polls ‚Äúin envelope‚Äù, the quality of life still remains at a high level. </p>

    <p>  Many people are wondering where it is better to live in the Krasnodar Territory.  It all depends on your preferences and skills.  If you want office work - go to the cities, love nature and fresh vegetables to the table - you can choose any village: you may not find highly paid work in the village, but you definitely will not stay hungry. </p><h2>  The property </h2><p>  House prices <span>in the Krasnodar Territory</span> vary by region.  The highest housing prices recorded on the <span>Black Sea coast.</span>  The average price per square meter starts at 50 thousand rubles.  In Krasnaya Polyana and Sochi, it starts at 110 thousand. </p><p>  But if you have a car and you are not embarrassed by a trip for one or two hours to the sea, then you can find a more acceptable option for your wallet, since good houses in the Krasnodar Territory are not uncommon.  Quite a lot of people settle in small villages near major resort cities, where in 15-20 minutes you can safely get to the center and enjoy all the benefits of civilization, if one is not enough at home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climatic conditions of the region are pleasing with their diversity.  In the mountains, there is a clear climatic zonality, while in the lowland zones the climate is temperate continental.  On the coast of the Krasnodar Territory, it also differs: south of Tuapse - humid subtropical, and from Anapa to Dzhubga - dry Mediterranean. </p>

    <p>  In general, the Kuban is characterized by <span>hot summers</span> and frequent floods.  The average temperature of the region in the summer months is 23 degrees, and winter in the region is mild and almost without snow.  The temperature spread is especially felt in the winter: if in the capital of the region it keeps about -4 degrees, then in the same Sochi it does not fall below +5.  The same applies to the uniformity of precipitation: plains account for 400-600 mm per year, while the mountainous regions ‚Äúcollect‚Äù up to 3500 mm.  Therefore, where it is better to live in the Krasnodar Territory, it is up to you only: love clean air and crystal freshness - welcome to the mountains, but be prepared for heavy rainfall, and if you like a temperate climate, the plain and coastal area is for you, but you have to stock up with good air conditioning for May-October. </p><h2>  Cities of the Krasnodar Territory.  Krasnodar </h2><p>  The region is rich in wealthy villages, small villages and beautiful cities.  Let's try to identify the most interesting places from a tourist and practical point of view (recreation and permanent residence). </p><p>  Krasnodar was founded on the site of the former military fortress of Yekaterinodar.  It is one of the largest cities in the region and the capital of the Kuban with a population of almost one million people.  It is there that more than a third of the entire industry of the region is located. </p>

    <p>  Of the advantages, one can note the attractiveness of the city: landscaping, developed infrastructure, a wide selection of housing for every taste and budget.  The beauty of the capital and the friendly population make the city extremely attractive in the eyes of tourists and people who want to move to the Krasnodar Territory.  Responses of the indigenous population, of course, differ from tourist surveys, but both of them note an obvious fly in the ointment: this is the transport system of the city - outdated and with eternal traffic jams even at night.  But for lovers of hiking, all conditions are created: paths, parks, squares, bike rental and much more. </p><h2>  Sochi </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous and now fashionable resorts of the Kuban with a population of almost 400 thousand people.  Sochi real estate owners are called lucky, and even a dilapidated barn in the city is estimated at a very good amount. </p>

    <p>  What is surprising for the city is the simultaneous presence of both a sea and a ski resort, so the popularity of Sochi is year-round, unlike other coastal cities and villages.  He has a lot of advantages, and small minuses do not prevent tourists and immigrants from moving to this universal city.  Too many residents of the Kuban, to the question ‚ÄúWhere is it better to live in the Krasnodar Territory?‚Äù, They answer with confidence: ‚ÄúOf course, in Sochi.‚Äù </p><h2>  Novorossiysk </h2><p>  This is the third most populated <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãin the Kuban.</span>  More than 300 thousand people live here.  The main attraction of the city is a huge seaport - the largest on the Black Sea.  At this place, on the shore of the Tsemess Bay, the ancient Greeks founded their colony and gave rise to the development of the city. </p><p>  In addition to the port, Novorossiysk is widely known as the "cement capital".  It is no less famous and the variety of champagne Abrau Durso.  Many residents note as critical minus the difficult environmental situation due to winter winds such as ‚Äúboron‚Äù and dust from cement plants.  The rest is a well-developed and beautiful port city, where there is something to see and have a good rest near the sea. </p><h2>  Yeisk </h2><p>  This is a small city in the north of the Kuban, right on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  Some call it a small copy of Novorossiysk, so it is not without the advantages of a large brother, and its shortcomings. </p>

    <p>  Yeysk has a developed infrastructure, a seaport with an oil terminal and related environmental problems such as oil and fuel oil spills coupled with dustiness due to industrial enterprises.  The resort line is more or less free from all kinds of environmental problems, but when you inhale the air in Yeysk and, say, in Tuapse, you will clearly feel the difference. </p><h2>  Gelendzhik </h2><p>  One of the most famous seaside resorts of the region.  Literally every third Russian has been to this beautiful place.  The city is famous for its magnificent bay, warm and mild climate, as well as numerous jobs during the holiday season.  The only drawbacks that are noted by both tourists and locals are the noise of the city in the summer months due to the abundance of tourists and expensive housing (purchase / rental).  Nevertheless, the city remains overpopular and rightfully competes with the venerable Sochi. </p>
