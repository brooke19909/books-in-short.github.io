    <p>  Non-residents who work in the territory of the Russian Federation must provide a copy of a residence permit and work permit. </p><p>  Having examined the documents, the bank makes a preliminary decision.  If it is positive, then the client can proceed to the selection of a particular property.  It must comply with the program conditions.  After selecting the borrower has to collect <span>documents of title</span> to property assessment. </p><h2>  Further procedure </h2><p>  Based on the estimated amount of housing, a credit limit is formed.  It makes up no more than 80-100% of this figure.  Since the social mortgage in Kazan is a long-term type of lending, the bank requires the provision of guarantees in the form of insurance of risks of loss of working capacity, property right or property damage.  Then the client needs to sign an agreement with the bank.  The borrower can familiarize himself with its form in advance even at the stage of collecting documents.  In some cases, it is necessary to sign a contract of sale, from which the mortgage follows the law.  In addition, it is also necessary to issue a mortgage - a security that gives the creditor the right to obtain fulfillment of the obligation.  The process of completing state registration of documents is ending.  Here's how to get a social mortgage. </p>
