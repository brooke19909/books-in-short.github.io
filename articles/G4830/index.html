    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Visit the nearest transfer point.  By calling the toll-free hotline number of this payment system, you can find out in which bank you can receive the ‚ÄúContact‚Äù transfer. </li><li>  Present a passport or other document that is included in the liver of identity documents. </li><li>  Announce to the employee of the financial company the code and the exact amount of the transfer. </li><li>  Sign a statement and an expense order. </li><li>  Get cash at the checkout. </li></ol><h2>  Money transfers "Contact" </h2><p>  Throughout the territory of the Russian Federation there is no limit on the amount of transfer.  As for foreign currency, here the system sets restrictions - no more than 5,000 dollars of transfer per day. </p><p>  Sending a transfer is carried out in ruble equivalent.  In this case, the sender can convert and indicate any currency received. </p><p>  Do not forget about the commission that is charged to the sender.  The size of the commission is fixed and set by the tariffs of the monetary system, and its size directly depends on the amount of transfer. </p><p>  Registration of a translation takes no more than 5 minutes.  Immediately after sending, the recipient can contact any nearest branch and receive money. </p><h2>  Contact translations in Moscow </h2><p>  In Moscow, transfers in this payment system are very popular.  On the territory of Moscow there are 396 points where you can send or receive a transfer.  You can use the services of the system in the following financial institutions: Metropol Bank, URALSIB, GLOBEXBANK, BinBank, Education and Loko Bank. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in which bank can I receive a transfer contact" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12962/1058046.jpg" width="600"></div>  Return transfer </h2><p>  According to the terms of the payment system, if funds are not received within 30 days, the payment is returned back to the sender‚Äôs bank.  In this case, the transfer commission is withheld.  As a rule, transfers are returned for the following reasons: </p><ol><li>  The recipient does not know in which bank the "Contact" transfer can be received. </li><li>  When sending, a mistake was made in personal data, and the sender did not appear in the bank branch to correct them. </li></ol><h2>  Alteration </h2><p>  If an error was made while sending the transfer, appropriate changes must be made, otherwise the recipient will not be able to collect the funds sent.  To make changes, you must provide the employee of the financial company with a passport, give the transfer number and write a statement.  The statement should detail what changes are needed. </p><p>  After making amendments, the recipient can immediately contact the branch that cooperates with this payment system and receive funds. </p><p>  Thanks to the Contact money transfer system, anyone can quickly solve the financial problems of a close person or loved one by sending him money.  When sending to a company specialist, you can always check with which bank you can receive the ‚ÄúContact‚Äù transfer and communicate this information to the recipient. </p>
