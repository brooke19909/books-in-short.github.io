    <h2>  Brazil before the discovery by Europeans </h2><p>  The history of Brazil before the discovery by Europeans was not studied as well as we would like.  The country was inhabited by various tribes of Indians: Ache, Pirah, Guazhajara, munduruka, Tupi, etc. They mainly led a primitive nomadic and semi-nomadic economy.  Although there were agricultural crops, for example, on the island of Marajo. </p>

    <p>  None of the Indian tribes of Brazil in the pre-colonial period did not even come close to the level of creating their own statehood. </p><h2>  Arriving Europeans to Brazil </h2><p>  The history of Brazil has changed radically since its discovery by Europeans.  The Portuguese expedition to Pedro Alvarez Cabral, who reached the shores of modern Brazil in 1500, was the first to discover this country for the Old World.  Cabral called the Territory Earth Vera Cruz (True Cross), but a few years later it was renamed the Land of Santa Cruz (Holy Cross).  Later, the name "Brazil" was fixed, by the name of one of the trees that grew here.  In addition, the discoverer founded a small fortress on the new lands - Fort Seger, which translates as Safe Harbor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Many other European expeditions followed this traveler to Brazil.  Most often, the Portuguese began to visit this country, realizing what riches it possesses and what it can bring to the Portuguese crown.  In addition, these lands were considered Portuguese by the division of the world in 1494 between Portugal and Spain. </p><h2>  Colonial Brazil </h2><p>  But permanent immigrants from Portugal to Brazil began to stay only in 1530.  The cities of San Vicente (1532) and Salvador (1549) were founded.  The latter became the administrative center of the colony. </p><p>  Brazil soon became a center for sugarcane production.  This crop was cultivated mainly by black slaves massively imported from Africa. </p><p>  In the first half of the XVII century, the Portuguese, who inhabited Brazil, had to wage a difficult struggle with the Dutch, who also claimed to be part of these territories.  In addition, the <span>Portuguese colony</span> expanded its territory inland. </p><h2>  Empire </h2><p>  After the troops of the French emperor Napoleon occupied the territory of <span>Portugal, the Portuguese</span> king Juan VI crossed with his court to Brazil, where he made Rio de Janeiro his residence.  How Brazil developed did not take this step - it is unknown, but one thing is clear: this was the beginning of a new period in its history, when it ceased to be just a colony. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that even after Napoleon was elected, Juan VI did not want to return from Brazil to Lisbon.  He did this only in 1821 under pressure from Portuguese aristocratic circles.  In Brazil, he left his son Pedro in the status of vice-king.  But when the Portuguese parliament tried to completely destroy Brazilian autonomy, Pedro refused to obey and proclaimed himself emperor.  From this moment, the history of the state of Brazil begins. </p><p>  When in 1826 the father of the Brazilian emperor Pedro I, Portuguese King Juan VI passed away, his son refused to become the monarch of Portugal, and left the throne of this country for his young daughter.  However, his brother Miguel soon overthrew his niece.  Therefore, Pedro I abdicated the Brazilian throne in favor of his young son Pedro II, and he went to Portugal to call his brother to account. </p>

    <p>  Under Emperor Pedro II, Brazil became a powerful power, capable of dictating its conditions on the continent.  During the empire, there was a reorientation of the country's manufacturing specialization from sugarcane cultivation to coffee cultivation.  Slavery increasingly faded into the background, until it was finally banned in 1888. </p><h2>  Establishment of the Republic </h2><p>  However, despite the successes of the government, the history of Brazil soon changed dramatically.  Republican forces grew stronger in the country.  In 1889, Emperor Pedro II was overthrown during a bloodless coup.  Brazil has become a <span>federal republic.</span> </p><p>  The period from 1889 to 1930 is commonly called the Old Republic.  During this period of time, a series of uprisings took place in the country, in particular, a revolt in the fleet (1893-1894) and an uprising of Canudus (1896-1897).  During World War I, Brazil officially sided with the Entente, but its real help was minimal. </p><h2>  The era of dictatorships </h2><p>  In 1930, the Old Republic was virtually liquidated, as a result of the coup a political force came to power led by Zhetuliu Vargas.  At the beginning of the reign of Vargas, a number of progressive laws were adopted, in particular the Constitution, and women were given the right to vote.  But soon the regime became reactionary and acquired fascist features.  Vargas began to persecute opposition forces, and in 1937 declared a state of emergency, dissolved Congress and established a de facto dictatorship. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the Vargas regime resembled a fascist one in type, during the Second World War it joined the Anti-Hitler Coalition and sent Brazilian soldiers to the front. </p><p>  After the war, Vargas was forced to resign.  The Second Republic was established, in which the former Minister of Defense under Vargas Eurik Gaspar Dutra became president.  A new Constitution has also been adopted.  In 1951, Vargas again came to power, already as president of a democratic republic, but in 1954, under mysterious circumstances, committed suicide. </p><p>  The next president, Juscelino Kubitschek, moved the capital to a city specially built for this purpose - Brasilia. </p><p>  In 1964, a military coup took place, during which the highest ranks of the army seized power in the country.  This <span>authoritarian political regime</span> lasted until 1985. </p><h2>  Modern stage </h2><p>  But in the mid-80s, it became clear that in the modern world Brazil could not effectively develop under the previous regime.  The country's history changed again in 1985, when the military, under pressure from the people, were forced to cede power.  Democratic elections took place, during which electors elected President Tancredo di Almeida Nevis, who soon died.  His duties began to be performed by Vice President Jose Sarney.  In 1988, a new Constitution was adopted. </p><p>  In 1989, the first popular elections of the president since 1960 took place.  Fernanda Collor won on them.  However, two years later he was accused of corruption and impeachment was declared against him.  This fate already befell President <span>Dilmo Rousseff</span> in 2016 <span>.</span>  Michelle Thimer became her successor. </p>

    <p>  Brazil is currently one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  In addition, it is one of the five largest and most populated states on Earth. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  We learned how Brazil has evolved over the centuries.  Historical facts can be not only instructive, but also interesting.  We‚Äôll talk about some of them now. </p><p>  The modern capital of Brasilia was created in 1960 according to the plan of the architect Oscar Niemeira.  She is one of the youngest capital cities in the world.  Brasilia is the third capital of Brazil after Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. </p><p>  The <span>largest city in Brazil</span> is Sao Paulo, which has never had a capital status. </p><p>  Genetically, most modern Brazilians on the male line are descendants of the Portuguese, and on the maternal side are representatives of local Indian tribes. </p>

    <p>  In Rio de Janeiro, the symbol of the country is installed - the Statue of Christ in Brazil.  The history of this 38-meter monument begins in 1922.  It was then that construction began, and the occasion was the celebration of the centenary of the country's independence.  The construction was completed in 1931.  Now the statue is recognized as one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World. </p>
