    <p>  The warm waters of the Egyptian Red Sea are home to some of the most breathtakingly beautiful <span>coral reefs.</span>  Sea life boils in it, and here you can observe one of the most beautiful underwater landscapes on the planet.  Ancient <span>wrecks,</span> coral gardens with hundreds of marine species, spectacular walls, canyons and caves are waiting for brave divers who flock from all over the world to the Red Sea.  Here you can find over 400 species of coral and about 1,500 species of fish, turtles, sharks and dolphins.  Each dive is an adventure, and no one ever knows what surprises await under the surface of the water. </p><h2>  What is interesting Coral bay </h2><p>  A typical resort picture is characteristic of the area near the Coral Bay: along the coast are hotel complexes, water parks, evergreen palm trees and snow-white beaches.  For a long time, local resorts were considered the best place for those who prefer a relaxed vacation in the hot sun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Coastal hotels with cool pool water, fun animations, lazy bliss of hammams - all this has long been a hallmark of Egyptian resorts. </p><p>  Of particular interest to vacationers is the beach "Coral Bay".  In the Sharks Bay area, the beach consists entirely of coral chips, and you can go into the water by going through a long row of pontoons.  This place is very popular with diving enthusiasts.  The only place where there is no coral in the beach sand is the Sharm El Maya area. </p><h2>  Sharm El Sheikh - the best resort in the Sinai </h2><p>  The most popular and expensive resort in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula is Egyptian Sharm El Sheikh.  He is considered the most Europeanized. </p><p>  The coast near Sharm el-Sheikh is completely cut by bays: Sharm el-Maya, Gadenz Bay, Naama Bay, Pasha Bay, Ras Umm al-Sid, Ras Nasrani, Nabq, Sharks Bay.  Almost all of them are protected by the state, which means that landscaping is prohibited here.  In order to swim in their waters, you will need special shoes so as not to injure your feet on the coral bottom. </p><p>  Windsurfing enthusiasts prefer Nabq Bay for relaxation - windy weather and high waves often occur here.  You can calmly swim in the bays of Naama Bay and Sharm El Maya, as they are protected from the wind. </p><h2>  The choice of time for rest </h2><p>  The weather in Sharm el-Sheikh can be described as follows: hot summer, which lasts from May to October, and warm winter - from November to April.  The hottest summer months are July and August.  During these months, the daytime temperature rises to + 45¬∫, and nights also do not differ in special coolness.  This weather will be appreciated by lovers of good tanning and swimming in warm water.  Coral Bay at this time of the year beckons with its azure waters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The unique and extremely picturesque underwater world, which the Coral Bay is so rich in, has become a source of attraction for tourists.  The entire Egyptian coast of the Red Sea is incredibly popular with scuba diving enthusiasts due to the long coral reefs. </p><p>  The most beautiful coral reefs have different contours: round, branched, flat, and sometimes they take an unusual bizarre shape.  Their color scheme is also interesting - from bright yellow and pink shades to dark blue and black. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about Coral bay </h2><p>  The water in the Coral Bay is particularly transparent, so divers who decide to make an underwater trip in its waters can be seen from the side of the vessel, even if they plunged to a depth of 15 meters.  Such purity of water is explained by its strong salinity, the absence of flowing rivers and the fact that representatives of marine flora and fauna living under the water column constantly purify it. </p>
