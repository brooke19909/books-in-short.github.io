It is ideal for trips to the sea, to hide from the scorching sun or gracefully defile from the beach to the house, without carrying a heap of clothes.  Also, many beautiful people prefer to wear a tunic as home clothes.  She does not constrain movements and allows you to look feminine and fashionable.  That's just on the shelves of the store you can not always find the goods of the desired style and color.  Therefore, in the current article we will talk about how to sew a tunic with your own hands.  The master class is ideal for beginner needlewomen, and even those who absolutely do not have the skills of cutting and sewing. </p><h2>  Where to begin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tunic to sew patterns" class="if uuid-2963751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2963751.jpg"></div><p>  Sewing a tunic is not at all difficult.  But only if competent training is carried out.  First of all, you should think over the design of the desired thing.  In the material presented, we explore the technology of performing the simplest tunic.  But after all, if desired, it can easily be decorated with bows, beads, appliques and other details.  Professionals recommend sketching their idea on paper in order to look at it from the side and finally approve the design. </p><h2>  Material purchase </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen, telling how to sew a tunic with their own hands quickly and without a pattern, say that special attention should be paid to the choice of fabric.  Beginners should not buy loose or crumbling.  It will be extremely inconvenient to work with it, because such material needs processing.  And overcasting the edge with a sewing needle will not be enough; an overlock is required. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Stretch fabric should also not be used for sewing tunics.  It is very difficult to sew it both manually and on a typewriter.  Experts are convinced that the best option for beginners is cotton or linen.  It‚Äôs good to cut it, and then sew it together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brazilianbikinishop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a tunic pattern" class="if uuid-2963728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2963728.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparation of related tools and materials </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsewing a tunic with or without a pattern comes to the mind of many young ladies who are absolutely not versed in cutting and sewing technology.  Therefore, recently, the topic studied in the article has become especially relevant.  And professional craftsmen are happy to share their tips with beginners.  For example, they say that for the realization of what was conceived in life it is necessary to prepare such tools: </p><ul><li>  large comfortable scissors; </li><li>  chalk or a bar of soap; </li><li>  centimeter tape and a large ruler; </li><li>  pins or special studs; </li><li>  a needle or sewing machine; </li><li>  threads of a suitable color; </li><li>  piece of paper and pen. </li></ul><p>  Since in the article we figure out how to sew a tunic with our own hands quickly and without a pattern, the reader will not have to look for a template of a suitable size on the Internet or in needlework magazines.  Therefore, many masters may limit themselves to the list of necessary items mentioned above.  But for more creative young ladies who want to make a unique product, decorating it with additional details, various decorative elements will be required.  We choose them, focusing on our preferences. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  The next step in the instructions on how to sew a tunic with your own hands without a pattern will be the measurement of the model for which we are preparing the intended product.  Therefore, we take a centimeter tape, a piece of paper and a pen.  A beautiful lady should undress to underwear.  Only in this case will it be possible to obtain the correct parameters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amybelievesinpink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tunic without a pattern" class="if uuid-2963730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2963730.jpg"></div><p>  So, we need to find out the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  estimated tunic length; </li><li>  distance from the lower edge to the armpit; </li><li>  girth of the chest or hips (we take a larger value); </li><li>  sleeves length; </li><li>  girth of the neck. </li></ul><h2>  Building patterns </h2><p>  Professional experts say that you can sew a tunic with your own hands on a pattern made by yourself.  This is not difficult!  To do this, buy a piece of fabric on which we can fit two rectangles.  The length of each should be equal to the estimated length of the tunic.  Since the intended product should be free, we calculate the width of each rectangle as follows: add 15-20 centimeters to the circumference of the hips or chest and divide the resulting number into two. </p><p>  Now we turn to the main part of the master class, which will help to sew the tunic yourself.  We fold the purchased piece of material in half and put it on a flat smooth surface, ideally on a comfortable table.  We fasten the segment with pins or pins so that it does not fidget when constructing a pattern and cutting. </p><p>  Using a large ruler and soap or chalk, set aside the desired length and width.  Then draw a rectangle at the given points.  We outline on it the distance from the lower edge to the armpit and collar, equal to half the circumference of the neck.  Then cut out two rectangles at once.  Next, draw the goal line.  On the front, it should be a little deeper, but you can do the same. </p><p>  Separately, cut out two smaller rectangles.  The length of each is equal to the estimated length of the sleeves, the width is measured on the main pattern of the tunic - from the shoulder seam to the armpit, we multiply the final value by two. </p><h2>  "How to sew a tunic": the final stage of the master class </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="to sew a tunic with your own hands without a pattern quickly" class="if uuid-2963720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2963720.jpg"></div><p>  If the reader reached this point, it means that he successfully coped with all the previous ones.  The necessary materials and tools have been prepared, the parameters have been removed, the pattern is completed and the intended product is cut.  Now the only thing left is to stitch it.  We take a needle with a thread or sit down at a sewing machine. </p><p>  If the needlewoman plans to work with an electronic unit, her tunic should be "made".  This implies that you need to connect the sides and parts above the shoulders with a ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù seam.  Further, without turning the base to the front side, we sew on the sleeves, which are previously required to be connected along the long side, forming a ‚Äúpipe‚Äù.  The edges can be sewn with a needle, for example, using a seam ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù.  Or buy satin ribbons in the store and sew them along the gate line, the lower edge of the tunic and as a cuff trim. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="we sew a tunic" class="if uuid-2963724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2963724.jpg"></div><p>  On this, our master class on how to sew a tunic with your own hands ends.  As you can see, it is not at all difficult to realize what was conceived.  Professional needlewomen often joke that it is much more difficult to decorate a finished thing.  Because the fantasy has no boundaries and can for a long time immerse the craftswoman in work. </p>
