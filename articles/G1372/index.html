    <p>  Almost three thousand years ago, at this place stood the rich capital of ancient Greek Caria - the city of Halicarnassus, which was also called Zephyria because of the constant sea breeze (Zephyr is the <span>god of wind</span> in Greek mythology). </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, the Knights of Rhodes built a castle here, which later became the fortress of the Ottoman Empire.  Then the city acquired its current name - Bodrum, which in <span>Turkish</span> means "basement" (that is, the underground fortifications of the castle). </p><p>  Now the city has gained fame as the noisiest and busiest resort in Turkey.  Russian travelers, for example, call it ‚Äúpeppy Bodrum‚Äù, and English-speaking visitors call this international recreation center ‚Äúthe bed of Europe‚Äù (since the pronunciation of the word ‚ÄúBodrum‚Äù is similar to the English word ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here at every step there are bars, night clubs, restaurants, taverns and discos where tourists flock from hotel complexes built in fourteen bays of the ancient peninsula. </p><p>  Vacationers living in the Sky Sea Hotel 3 (Bodrum) can visit any city in Turkey - buses go from Bodrum to anywhere.  For example, to Gyukova Bay (with a transfer to Mugla), Pamukalle (10 minutes, via Denizli for 3 euros), Istanbul (13 hours), Izmir (4 hours) or Ankara (10 hours). </p><p>  You can travel by car - renting a small car in Bodrum costs from 30 euros per day. </p><h2>  Climate and beaches </h2><p>  Bodrum has a temperate Mediterranean climate - it is not as stuffy here as in other resorts, thanks to the refreshing breeze from the Aegean Sea (which is cooler compared to the Mediterranean). </p><p>  In summer, the temperature is quite comfortable, there is no such heat as in Antalya in Bodrum.  On average, in July - 28 <sup>¬∞</sup> C, and in October - 21 <sup>¬∞</sup> C. </p><p>  In ancient Zephyria, a gentle gentle wind blows from the sea, so fans of windsurfing, kitesurfing and other water sports gather on the beaches. </p><p>  Sky Sea Hotel 3 <span>(Bodrum, Bodrum)</span> has its own beach, but according to tourists' reviews, it is almost not cleaned and is a rather dirty and rocky piece of wild coast. </p><p>  Nearby there are many beaches of other hotels - also small pebble areas or concrete platforms with imported sand.  There is also a public beach (250 m) - without sunbeds, but with beautiful sand, where there are no big waves (behind La Blanche, opposite the playground). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many go swimming in the beach of the five-star Agean Dream Hotel, 100 meters from the Sky Sea Hotel 3. There is good access to the sea, excellent sand and sunbeds (everyone can come). </p><p>  Bodrum is surrounded by dozens of beaches located in 14 picturesque bays, which can be easily reached by minibuses (50 euro cents): </p><ul><li>  Bitez (blue flag, windsurfing center). </li><li>  Gumbet (constant parties and dances until the morning). </li><li>  Ortakent and Gumusluk (many fish taverns on the shore). </li><li>  Turgutreis (one of the largest tourist centers). </li><li>  Yalikavak (interesting windmills). </li><li>  Gelt√ºrkbyuku (representatives of the Turkish elite come here). </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sky sea hotel 3 bodrum reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23071/560412.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  There are many attractions in and around Bodrum: </p><ul><li>  Castle (Museum of Underwater Archeology, 10 lire). </li><li>  The ruins of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus (one of 7 wonders of the world, 4 lira). </li><li>  Ancient Greek Theater (13 thousand spectators). </li><li>  Source Hermaphrodite. </li><li>  The historical center on the island of Patmos (Monastery of St. John the Evangelist and the cave of the Apocalypse). </li><li>  <span>Samos Island</span> (Temple of Hera and Pythagorea). </li><li>  Black Island (hot springs in the grotto). </li><li>  Rhodes island in Greece (need a Schengen visa). </li><li>  Halicarnassus Disco (one of the largest dance floors in the world, 35 lire). </li></ul><h2>  Hotel </h2><p>  Sky Sea Hotel 3 (Turkey) is an economy class hotel built in 1991 on the seafront near the famous tourist villages of Turgutreis (1 km) and Bodrum (18 km), which is 55 km from Kos Ippokratis Airport and 65 km from the airport of Dalaman </p><p>  The hotel consists of one three-story building, including 40 rooms (35 standard, 3 Extra Large Rooms and 2 Suites).  The cost of a standard room is from 1775 rubles per night. </p><p>  The staff does not speak Russian.  Below is an image of Sky Sea Hotel 3. The photo shows the general view of the building (many tourists believe that the advertising photographs of this hotel are retouched, but in reality it is quite ‚Äúragged‚Äù). </p>

    <p>  The floor is tiled.  Change of linen and towels - on request. </p><p>  The reviews noted such inconveniences as traces of water leaking on the ceiling, crumbling plaster over the beds, lack of a door in the shower, rusty plumbing and cockroaches in the room. </p><p>  Hot water is heated by solar panels and served on schedule, so you can only take a shower during lunch. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Sky Sea Hotel 3 provides half board (HB), that is, breakfast and dinner are included, and you can have lunch at an additional cost in the hotel restaurant or in the surrounding taverns. </p><p>  The menu is standard.  Despite the declared "buffet", almost all dishes are served only portionwise (as reported in the reviews), the additive is not allowed (including in relation to water, tea and coffee, as well as wine and beer). </p><p>  Breakfast: fried potatoes, boiled eggs, cheese, sausage (soy), vegetables, jam, watermelon. </p><p>  Dinner: salads (tomato cucumbers), olives, grilled vegetables, rice-beans-potatoes (alternating), pasta (every day), chicken (once every 3 days), meat with vegetables (once every 10 days), fish ( every 14 days), a dessert of balls of dough in honey (rarely). </p><p>  Pastries (buns with cheese) are served in the afternoon snack at 16.00 only in a limited quantity - one dish for the entire dining room, therefore a crush. </p><p>  For breakfast and afternoon tea and coffee - for free (traditionally of poor quality).  At dinner, you need to pay 2 lira for one cup of tea or coffee. </p><p>  Regarding the food in Sky Sea Hotel 3, the reviews are mostly negative.  It is reported that the portions are very small, and queues and scandals for a piece of bread are humiliating.  The restaurant is constantly dirty tablecloths, there are no dishes for children.  The highchair is only one and never washed. </p><p>  Drinking water until 22.00, in the evening the cooler is removed.  Pouring water into bottles and taking it with you is not allowed. </p><p>  It is forbidden to bring your own food and drinks to the hotel restaurant (the staff simply takes them away). </p><p>  It is also forbidden to shift tables (for a large friendly company) - this leads to noisy quarrels with staff. </p><p>  Tourists report in reviews that you can eat deliciously in the nearby fish restaurants for 14 lire - cold appetizer, vegetable salad, <span>grilled dorado,</span> melons and watermelons.  There is also a good inexpensive cafe for La Blanche. </p>

The reviews are different, sometimes they are subjective and depend on the mood and general nature of the person. </p><p>  Its pros and cons can be found anywhere, even in a five-star palace.

    <p>  A good location of the hotel is noted - near Bodrum and Turgutreis.  This is an opportunity to take pleasant walks along beautiful promenades, colorful markets and historical places, visit restaurants, entertainment centers and shops, as well as admire beautiful parks and yacht clubs. </p><p>  The hotel has a good pool (but no slides), as well as many foreigners, which is always informative and interesting in terms of cultural exchange. </p><p>  Experienced travelers note that in the Sky Sea Hotel 3 bar, beer is really tasty and served in glass glasses, and not in plastic glasses, as in many hotels in Turkey and Egypt. </p><p>  It is also reported that alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are bottled in the presence of the client - while traditionally in Turkish and Egyptian hotels all drinks are served in glasses (already spilled and diluted in an adjacent room). </p><p>  There are interesting reviews for those who want to lose weight - some ladies are pleased to say that they were able to reduce weight by 3-5 kg ‚Äã‚Äãper week due to meals in the hotel restaurant, that is, a strict vegetable diet with limited portions of food. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are many tourists who did not like their stay at Sky Sea Hotel 3 (Turkey).  Reviews include the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Aggressiveness of staff (employees allow themselves not only to yell at vacationers, but often open their arms and rudely push tourists). </li><li>  Hatred of the Russians (the hotel owner has repeatedly said this to tourists in person). </li><li>  If you are late for dinner even for 20 minutes (due to a flight delay, for example) there will be no dinner, no compensation. </li><li>  If breakfast or dinner is skipped due to an excursion trip - no <span>dry rations</span> or compensation </li><li>  There are no hot water in the room for several days. </li><li>  The water in the shower is salty. </li><li>  Poor sound insulation (at night in the basement the equipment is very noisy and keeps you awake). </li><li>  The beach is dirty, there are many stray dogs. </li><li>  The same person draws up documents at the reception, imposes food in a restaurant, cleans the pool and mopping floors - he does not change clothes and does not even rinse his hands. </li><li>  Bed sheets are not changed, but only turned on the other side. </li><li>  The rooms have a strong smell of sewage. </li><li>  Room cleaning is purely symbolic and 1 time in 10 days.  Toilet paper for money. </li><li>  On the day of departure, as a rule, the bar is closed for departing tourists (although the day is paid). </li></ul><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Experienced travelers give the following tips for travelers who are planning a vacation at Sky Sea Hotel 3: </p><ul><li>  Take food and drinks from Russia on the first day (night).  If you are late for breakfast or dinner, you can stay hungry.  In addition, arriving at Turkish airports, Russians immediately feel the heat and stuffiness, and a can of soda there costs 5 euros. </li><li>  You need to pay for the remote control from the air conditioner at the reception, but our tourists turn on the air conditioning perfectly and without the remote control (you just need to learn before the trip). </li><li>  Take a kettle and tea and coffee bags with you. </li><li>  You can go to children's discos in the neighboring Agean Dream Hotel (at 9 p.m. except Saturday). </li><li>  It is better to buy products at the Migros supermarket (go half an hour).  At the first visit you need to buy a ‚Äúmoney card‚Äù - there will be good discounts </li><li>  In the same Migros, you can successfully exchange currency - pay $ 100 for a penny and get change in lira at a very favorable rate </li><li>  To buy all excursions in the city (from a hotel guide is twice as expensive).  There is a good boat trip on the ship for only $ 20 (8 hours at sea with lunch and afternoon tea, and children are free). </li><li>  The water park costs $ 22 (at a travel agency), children under 6 years old are free, pensioners from 60 years old are also free (no certificate is required). </li><li>  Good purchases can be made at the Midtown store (en route to Bodrum). </li><li>  Take beach shoes (on many beaches the entrance to the sea is stony, fragments of bottles and sea urchins come across). </li><li>  Take earplugs with you (poor sound insulation), an English-Russian dictionary (you can download it to your phone) and a flash drive with movies, books and games (the Internet does not work well). </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Sky Sea Hotel is designed for a modest budget vacation. </p><p>  The main thing in any trip is a personal attitude, positive emotions and good company. </p><p>  Those who find it difficult to hold out for ten days without meat, animation and a lot of alcohol should choose a different hotel. </p><p>  Active tourists who travel to distant lands across the sea, the sun, interesting excursions and new experiences will be able to relax in any hotel, including the Sky Sea Hotel. </p>
