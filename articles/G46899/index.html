    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  When making a review of the Le Bleu Hotel &amp; Resort 5 * hotel, one cannot but pay attention to the comments of guests who were resting here.  Some of their reviews are very helpful.  Here's what they say: </p><ul><li>  When choosing this hotel, it is necessary to take into account the fact that there are a lot of families with children, but it is better not to stay with very tiny kids, since discos are held until the very last hour and it can be noisy. </li><li>  Good renovation, the walls are refreshed, and the rooms have everything you need, and a big plus are their own balconies, which offer a wonderful view. </li><li>  The cuisine is varied, but not particularly impressive, although everyone can find a dish to their liking. </li><li>  You should definitely visit the SPA center and sign up for a massage to a Balinese girl.  Many vacationers are advised to purchase the service exclusively of this massage therapist. </li><li>  Great animation, children and adults are busy all day, and in the evenings, a variety of shows will help diversify your vacation.  It is very convenient that the whole city is located along the sea, so it‚Äôs nice to stroll along the coast in the evening and visit the local bars outside the hotel. </li><li>  Particular attention should be paid to the sand and pebble beach, there are always a lot of free sunbeds, a gentle entrance to the sea, but it is better to swim from the pier, there are remarkable arbors where you can take good photos. </li></ul><p>  In general, judging by the reviews, Le Bleu Hotel &amp; Resort 5 * is very suitable for young people.  The ultra all-inclusive system is most convenient for those who wish to relax all night long.

    <h2>  What else is on the territory? </h2><p>  The beach, of course.  Of course, it is not located directly on the territory of Le Bleu Hotel &amp; Resort 5 * (Turkey, Kusadasi), but in the immediate vicinity.  The hotel itself goes to him.  And the beach is truly wonderful - sand and gravel, spacious, clean and well maintained. </p><p>  Also, since the concept of the hotel is primarily focused on family vacations, children are given increased attention.  From the morning until the evening there is a mini club where vacationers from 4 to 12 years old can do their favorite hobby.  Attentive animation staff individually treats each of the children, and tries to maximize their involvement in recreational activities.  There is also a children's pool with water slides. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the hotel has a mini market, souvenir shops, smoking areas, a hairdresser and a beauty salon.  Among the particularly pleasant services, one can note the availability of car rental, lunch on the road, facilities for people with disabilities, and room service. </p><h2>  For beach lovers </h2><p>  Due to the peculiarities of the local religion, the famous ladies' beach was once allowed to be visited only by women, but with the transformation of the city into a resort, this place became accessible to absolutely everyone.  Here, the smallest and golden sand on the entire coast, many bars and various extreme sports are available. </p><p>  Water park "Adaland" will appeal to lovers of water extreme sports.  This theme park includes 24 slides and is considered one of the most interesting in the world.  From steep descents it is breathtaking and adrenaline rises, so only adults are allowed on many slides.  For little vacationers, there is a dolphinarium and an aquarium with many exotic fish. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  And it is also necessary to tell about them, since we are talking about Le Bleu Hotel &amp; Resort 5 * (Turkey, Kusadasi). </p><p>  Kusadasi fortress dates back to the 13th century and occupies an entire island.  Once it was a strategically important place, and the fortress walls guarded important sea values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom pirate attacks.  On the territory of the fortress there is a Byzantine tower, which offers breathtaking views of the entire resort and the marina with prestigious yachts.  And after a cultural walk, you should go down to the beach and have lunch at a local colorful restaurant with traditional dishes. </p><p>  You should definitely go to the ancient <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ephesus</span> for at least one day.  Here are concentrated the most important historical sites of the country, protected by UNESCO World Heritage. </p><p>  The Temple of Artemis is rightfully considered one of the seven wonders of the world.  The building is made in the ancient style and attracts high marble columns that rose 20 meters.  The main feature was the statue of the goddess, decorated with gilding and jewelry.  Until our time, very little has been preserved, but the atmosphere around the temple itself captivates the views of tourists. </p><p>  The famous Temple of Apollo was conceived as a skillful and majestic phenomenon of ancient Greek architecture.  It was built for almost half a century, and it was destroyed in one day by a powerful earthquake.  Now antique columns look like an arch, from where a stunning view of the coast opens. </p><p>  The large amphitheater in Ephesus deserves special attention.  The emperors themselves came here, and legends went about the possibilities of the theater stage.  The theater was built during the heyday of the Roman Empire and accommodated up to 25 thousand spectators.  The construction is well preserved to our days, which will allow us to most reliably estimate the scale of the amphitheater. </p><p>  The house of the Blessed Virgin Mary attracts many tourists.  This is the oldest place with olive trees, where water supply and an underground atrium were discovered.  There is a wish wall and vaulted arches, creating a special atmosphere of the architectural complex. </p>
