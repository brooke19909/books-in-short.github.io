Yes, because Montenegro in June is most suitable for a vacation with young travelers.  A relatively short flight, the same in duration as in Turkey, will not tire the child.  The absence of tropical heat (in contrast to Thailand) will not cause problems with acclimatization.  Excellent infrastructure for children will leave many of the most pleasant impressions of their stay in this Balkan country.  Dry summers without showers, a clear sky, a calm sea will provide you with a comfortable swim and a bronze tan.  And the enchanting views of ancient monasteries and towns under tiled roofs will long remain in your memory as the quintessence of a wonderful pastime. </p>

    <h2>  Tours: Montenegro, June </h2><p>  Since the <span>May holidays,</span> travel agencies have been selling packages to this Balkan country.  Montenegro is one continuous resort.  Biela, Krasici, Igalo, Ulcinj, Herceg Novi, Perast, Prcanj and Peraziƒá Do - these are just a few names, but this is not a complete list.  The beaches in the first month of summer are still half empty; there are no crowds on the streets of medieval towns.  If you want to have a good rest and not make a fatal gap in the family budget, Montenegro in June is the best choice.  Prices for tours during this period are low.  Two people can spend a week in this fabulous country for only 23-29 thousand rubles.  The price of the tour, of course, depends on the category of the hotel, the type of transport that you will get to the place of rest, and the duration of the trip.  The cost of a hotel room varies depending on the season.  And in July-August, Montenegro experiences a peak in the influx of tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Weather: June features </h2><p>  The holiday season in Montenegro begins in May and ends in October.  What are the benefits of the first <span>month of summer?</span>  Well, unlike May, schoolchildren have a vacation, and there is a chance to spend a vacation with the whole family.  Secondly, the waters of the Adriatic already have time to warm up by June and delight the beach people with a quite comfortable temperature of +21 ... + 24 ¬∞ C. In May, it must be said, in the Balkans, summer is fully taking over.  The thermometer column often stands at +30 ¬∞ C, but the sea is still quite cold - up to +20 ¬∞ C.  July and August in Montenegro are the hottest months of the year.  Paradoxically, it is precisely this temperature hell that accounts for the high tourist season.  In June there is still no such suffocating ringing heat, and the beaches delight the eye with space.  In addition, booking a hotel room to your liking is not difficult.  And to go on an excursion with a child will be much more comfortable at +25 ¬∞  than at +35 ¬∞ . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro in June prices" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/451883.jpg" width="320"></div>

Unlike May, when the season is just beginning, Montenegro in June pleases tourists with a large selection of entertainment.  All tour desks operate at full capacity.  Groups are staffed, and your plans will not be broken due to a shortage of people, as it happens out of season or because of unexpected rain (the summer is dry here).  June is a great time to visit the Boko-Kotor fjord (it is, by the way, the southernmost in Europe), the fabulous beauty of <span>Skadar Lake, the</span> deep canyons of Tara and Tsievna, the mountains of Durmitor, Lovchen and Biogradsk.  In addition to natural attractions, it will be interesting for the student to visit the UNESCO-protected cities of Budva and Kotor, the historical capital of Cetinje, the island of St. Stephen and the <span>monastery of Ostrog.</span>  The average cost of excursions is about thirty euros per person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours Montenegro June" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/451872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  As noted above, Montenegro in June provides tourists with a large selection of accommodation.  Comfortable luxury hotels are located in the bay of Becici.  More budget housing should be looked for on the second and third lines from the sea - in Budva, Podgorica, Tivat, in the small resorts of the Ulcinj Riviera.  By the way, despite the small size of Montenegro, climatic regimes in this country vary depending on the region.  In Budva extended to the sea, the average monthly temperature in June is +25 degrees, and in Podgorica - 28. The warmest sea is observed near <span>St. Stephen</span> and Rafailovici.  There, the water has already warmed up to +23 degrees.  But the nights in June are still fresh, +14 ... + 17 <sup>about</sup> S. Osadkov per month falls on average 63 mm, that is, very little.  The probability of falling under a short-term rain is small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Montenegro in June" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/451873.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Events </h2><p>  Do not be afraid that your little traveler will get bored.  Montenegro in June is eventful.  Due to the proximity of Slavic languages, a child can take part in many celebrations.  On June 3, the country celebrates Independence Day.  In Budva, in the first month of summer, two festivals take place annually at once: dance and music of the Mediterranean.  Sometimes in June falls the Christian holiday of Pentecost (Trinity).  This day is universally celebrated as a traditional race.  In June Podgorica hosts the Cultural Summer festival.  On the streets of the city you can see concerts, performances, exhibitions.  And in Kotor, June is marked by an interesting event.  Divers from all over the world present amateur documentaries - chronicles of their dives - to the general public. </p><h2>  Wellness </h2><p>  Holidays in Montenegro in June will allow you and your child to gain strength.  The first fruits are already appearing on the shelves of the markets: apricots, peaches, cherries, strawberries.  And in the second half of the month you can even enjoy early figs.  The sea is so clear and clean that every pebble is visible.  Do not forget about the possibilities of healing.  The Hercegnovsky coast has healing mud, and the beaches of the Ulcinj Riviera with their basalt sands heal many joint diseases.  In the medical and tourist institution "Igalo" conduct complex therapy.  Here you have <span>thermal springs,</span> cold baths with radon, and mud wraps. </p>
