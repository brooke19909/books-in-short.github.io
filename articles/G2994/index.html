    <h2>  Historical past </h2><p>  No wonder the Tver region is called the heart of Russia.  One of the most ancient Russian cities - Tver - has been known since 1135.  The great Principality of Tver that arose, being the main center for the creation of the Russian state, existed as an independent state entity until the end of the 15th century.  A sufficiently rich and glorious historical past, saturated with interesting events, the modern life of the region was reflected in numerous historical and cultural monuments of history.  Despite the significant variability of urban and rural landscapes, among the new life as living islands of history, there remain ancient sights of the Tver region, revealing the beauty of the <span>architecture of Ancient Russia.</span>  These are <span>windmills,</span> wooden churches, Slavic mounds dating from the XII-XIV centuries, and many others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical monuments </h2><p>  The national shrine of the Tver land is Nilova Deserts.  This is the most famous monastery in the region, founded in the 16th century.  The region is also famous for manor culture monuments.  So, having been in Torzhok, it is worth visiting the estates Mitino, Nikolskoye, Rayek, recognized as masterpieces of Russian provincial classicism.  Noble nests of various sizes and architecture are represented in other areas of the region.  These are the estates of Podgorodnee, Kuropatkin and Mikhailovskoye in the Toropetsky district, the estate of the architect A.S. Khrenov in the Bologovsky district and others.  The Gornitsa estate located in a small village of the Kuvshinovsky district is interesting for visiting.  Here you can see the well-preserved unique stone Vladimir Church. </p><p>  In Tver itself, among the architectural masterpieces, it is worth highlighting the Tver Imperial Track Palace, built in the 18th century and designed in the style of classicism with the inclusion of Baroque elements.  Its main purpose was to provide rest for members of the emperor‚Äôs family along the way from St. Petersburg to Moscow.  Now the palace houses the <span>Tver Regional Art Gallery,</span> called the main treasury of the city. </p><p>  The track palace is located on the territory of the former historical center of the city - the Tver Kremlin.  In the City Garden you can see the preserved ruins of the castle moat.  The Kremlin itself after the last fire in 1763 was no longer restored. </p><p>  Among the majority of regional centers in the Tver region, the pretty town of Kimry stands out with its architectural appearance.  This is the most striking example of a "town of provincial Russian Art Nouveau." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Temples of the Tver region </h2><p>  In any, even the smallest, town of the region, you can find genuine historical sights, among which a considerable place is occupied by the churches of the Tver region.

    <p>  From the point of view of tourism, the picturesque town on the Volga Staritsa is interesting.  Tver region of the sights here is in all its ancient glory.  Numerous church ensembles and individual churches are distinguished by some unique architecture that clearly does not correspond to the established canons.  Of the stone architectural monuments in Staritsa, the Assumption Monastery, founded in 1297, stands out.  The shrine, surrounded by a solid stone wall, has survived with all the buildings.  The architectural monuments of the 18th century also deserve attention in the city: Pyatnitskaya church with graceful aisles-rotundas, located at the foot of the old settlement, the Ilyinsky church in the Baroque style, the St. Nicholas church that fits perfectly into the coastal panorama of the Volga.  A special attraction of the town is also Aptekarsky Lane, a unique street that can no longer be found in Russia. </p>
