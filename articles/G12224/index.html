Maybe it is, but this rule does not apply to chain hotels.  Because such hotel chains value their reputation too much to lower standards in certain countries.  Therefore, those who come to rest in Egypt <span>(Hurghada), ‚ÄúAlbatross</span> Aqua Blue‚Äù meets exactly the same level as his namesake in Turkey or Western Europe.  After all, the Pickalbatros Hotels &amp; Resorts line is also in Picalbatros in Africa.  Well, this hotel complex is located fifteen kilometers south of Hurghada, on the road to Safaga.  Why did I use the expression "hotel complex"? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Albatross Aqua Blue Hurghada" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/237026.jpg" width="600"></div>  Yes, because Albatros Aqua Blue (Hurghada) is part of a conglomerate of five hotels with a single vast territory.  Most likely, the 4 * category was assigned to Aqua Blue only because the hotel is located on the second line from the sea, but this is the only inconvenience.  And is it a drawback?  For parents with young children, the disabled and the very lazy, free buses constantly run to the sea, but the majority of tourists go there on foot, and now I will explain why.  A short (about 500 m) road passes through a fabulously beautiful park past various pools.

Their names are Beach Albatros Resort (also four) and Albatros Palace Resort &amp; SPA (five).  And the neighbors of Aqua Blu, which are not separated from it by any fences and other barriers, are two albatross hotels: Aqua Vista Resort &amp; Spa (4 stars) and Garden Resort 4 *.  Thus, buying a ticket to one hotel, you get the opportunity to use the services of several (including five-star).

    <p>  In fact, this is a huge resort town with many bars, artificial ponds, paths and entertainment.  Only on the second line there are thirteen pools (2 of them are heated)!  And most importantly, they are all different.  In Aqua Vista - places of rest for older people and with small children.  In Garden - a variety of aerobics classes and other animation.  There are also some ‚Äúserious‚Äù slides for courageous adults.  And in Albatros Aqua Blue (Hurghada) - the most interesting and unusual pools.  One with tidal waves, and there is also a children's one - with numerous fountains and various funs for the little one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Albatross aqua blue hurghada reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/235376.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for food, in the main restaurant "Karkade" of the hotel "Albatross Aqua Blue" (Hurghada) for each lunch or dinner, several types of meat and fish are offered.  A dessert table can not be described in words.  There is no shortage of fruit.  If you are relaxing on the beach, you do not need to return to the hotel to have lunch.  You have the opportunity to do it on the beach - in bars or in the restaurant of the nearest Beach Albatros Resort.  In addition, you can dine for free at the three restaurants in the nearest Garden Hotel: Italian, Chinese and Arabic.  And the bars on the second line alone counted as many as nine, and all of them are at your service. </p><p>  Since tourists from the CIS countries make up the lion's share of vacationers in the hotel complex, its employees speak almost all Russian and will easily understand your wishes.  For younger visitors, a mini club is open during the day.  Another team of animators tirelessly fills the leisure of adults: often there are discos with live music and other events.  By the way, it is not forbidden to have fun at parties in other hotels of Albatross.  Aqua Vista has a good spa.  In a word, the reviews in Albatros Aqua Blue (Hurghada) were called universal: the hotel is suitable for families with children, as well as for youth or older couples. </p>
