This prince became famous for having raised an uprising against Rurik, leading the Novgorodians in 864.  We will talk about these events, about the role of Vadim and Rurik in them in this article. </p><h2>  Biography facts of Vadim the Brave </h2><p>  Nothing is known about the date and place of birth of Vadim.  Even in The Tale of Bygone Years, which describes events from biblical times, nothing is said about this.  In later chronicles of the 16th century a legend appears which describes the turmoil in Novgorod. </p><p>  The troubles began after the calling of the Varangians in 862 for reigning in Novgorod.  It is known that the locals did not like the self-control of Prince Rurik, after which Vadim the Brave led an uprising against him.  Together with most of his associates, Vadim was killed in 864, and the uprising was crushed. </p><p>  The famous Russian historian V.N. Tatishchev writes that Vadim came from a clan of Slovenian (Eastern Slavs) princes, however, he also does not know anything about the date of his birth. </p><h2>  Reasons for the uprising </h2><p>  Some scholars, mentioning the legend of Vadim, argue that this is fiction.  And others believe that this legend explains his presence in the annals of the troubled and dissatisfaction of the Novgorodians with the Vikings, who were hired by Prince Yaroslav to rule Novgorod.  As you know, some Varangians were killed during the Troubles.  For which the locals later took revenge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coollib.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of the Varangians" class="if uuid-2526873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2526873.jpg"></div><p>  It is also believed that the revolt of Vadim the Brave could not have occurred in Novgorod in 864, as described in the annals, since, according to some archaeological facts, Novgorod did not exist then.  Nevertheless, at that time there was already Ladoga, where the Varangian Rurik began to reign in 862.  According to some versions, Ladoga itself could be called Nova-gorod, which is consonant with Novgorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the annals tell of the "Yurik-new settler", in which many see the name of Rurik, who ruled the principality and constantly increased tribute from the Novgorodians, which was one of the reasons for the uprising. </p><h2>  Versions of Vadim </h2><p>  According to some historians, Prince Vadim the Brave, who allegedly led an uprising against Rurik, could have a completely different name.  So, for example, it is believed that this is not a name, but a verb - ‚Äúdrive‚Äù, which in various dialects means ‚Äúhorse guide‚Äù, ‚Äúguide‚Äù, ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="history.sgu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Summon Varangians to reign" class="if uuid-2526930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2526930.jpg"></div><p>  There is also an opinion which says that the name Vadim refers to princely retinue vocabulary and, according to it, could mean the governor, leader, leader.  Consequently, the conflict between Vadim and Rurik can also be regarded as a clash of two squad groups. </p><p>  However, these are only versions of historians, which are often based on assumptions and rather controversial facts that ignore fundamental works, for example, such as The Tale of Bygone Years or Nikon Chronicle. </p><h2>  Varangian Rurik </h2><p>  Vadim the Brave and the grandson of Gostomysl, Rurik, according to legend, still consisted of a conflict that led to the fact that Vadim was killed.  However, Rurik also, according to some historians, the figure is rather controversial and ambiguous, there is even a version that it did not exist at all. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="okultureno.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Rurik" class="if uuid-2526963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2526963.jpg"></div><p>  However, according to the official historical version, Rurik lived in the 9th century, his date of birth is unknown, and he died in 879.  According to legend, he was the grandson of the Ilmen elder Gostomysl, who is considered to be a Slovene by origin (ancient Slav).  It is believed that Gostomysl was one of those who called the Vikings to reign over the Slovenes. </p><p>  Rurik himself, according to one version, is considered to be a Yutlander (ancient Dane) by origin, and according to another - encouraged (one of the tribes of the ancient Slavs). </p><p>  According to ancient Russian chronicles, Rurik is identified with the Varangian, who was called to reign in Novgorod and subsequently suppressed the rebellion of Vadim the Brave.  Rurik is considered the ancestor and founder of the princely, and later the royal dynasty.  Rurikovich is considered as the founders of the Old Russian state as such. </p><h2>  Historians Assessment </h2><p>  According to historians, the revolt of Vadim the Brave, who led the Novgorodians against Rurik, still took place.  Fundamental science, based on the annals that have survived to this day, unequivocally declares this incident.  There is also no doubt in the personalities of both Vadim the Brave and Rurik himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wwwzoryacom.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;The Tale of Bygone Years&quot;" class="if uuid-2526913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2526913.jpg"></div><p>  Disputes are only allowed about the time of the birth of these historical characters and about the name of Vadim, since it is really possible to interpret him as a ‚Äúvoivode‚Äù.  In other cases, statements that there was no rebellion against Rurik, and all this is fiction, are unfounded and unproven.  In other words, this is a free interpretation and fantasy of individual historians. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summarizing the above, it can be said that the uprising of the Novgorodians led by Vadim the Brave against Rurik and the Vikings is a scientifically proven fact that has confirmation in the ancient Slavic chronicles.  There is also a series of indirect evidence that speaks of these events that occurred in 864. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coollib.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Weapon of the Varangians" class="if uuid-2526920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2526920.jpg"></div><p>  Vadim the Brave is also a literary character, however, references to him in works of art are based on ancient documents.  So, for example, Catherine II mentions him in her work - ‚ÄúHistorical performance from the life of Rurik‚Äù.  Later, the famous Russian writer Ya. B. Knyazhnin created a tragedy called "Vadim Novgorodsky."  A.S. Pushkin and M. Yu. Lermontov also took up work on this story, as they were interested in both the personality and the fate of Vadim the Brave. </p><p>  Vadim is the leader of those who did not put up with the injustice of the Varangians.  However, Rurik played an important role in the history of Russia, influencing the formation of the state as a whole, and later on creating the whole royal dynasty of the Rurikovich.  And it is not known how the history of Russia would have developed if Vadim the Brave had defeated Rurik. </p>
