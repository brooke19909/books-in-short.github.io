  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Arad city, Israel: photos and descriptions, attractions and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Regardless of the time of year, the flow of tourists to Israel does not decrease.  Whatever city of this country tourists travel to, it will be interesting for its sights, climate, unique Dead Sea, where there are always sightseeing trips.  Hikers will appreciate the diversity of the landscape of the National Israeli Highway.  And we will begin a virtual journey to Israel, in its small city of Arad, which is located in the southern district of the country. </p><h2>  City location </h2><p>  The modern city of Arad was built in 1961.  It is located within the line of sight of the ruins of the ancient city, which also bore this name.  Artifacts found during archaeological excavations confirm that it was destroyed about 2700 years ago. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="31.261447" data-lng="35.21486200000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/8/6/2/3862.png"></div><p>  The modern city of Israel - Arad borders <span>the Negev desert,</span> which is a continuation of the <span>Sinai desert,</span> and the hills of Judea.  To the west of Arad, 45 km along the mountain serpentine, is the city of Be'er Sheva, and to the east of the city is the Dead Sea.  You can drive to it on highways.  The distance to it is 25 kilometers.  Arad is also considered the closest city to the historical monument of Masada fortress.  According to the latest statistics, about 24 thousand people live in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ancient Masada Fortress </h2><p>  One of the ancient sights of Israel in Arad is Masada Fortress - object No. 1040 in the World Heritage List.  This fortification overlooking the Dead Sea is a reminder of one of the most dramatic events in Jewish history.  The fortress stores one of the last episodes of the Great Rebellion against Rome 2000 years ago.  Instead of fighting, 1,000 Jewish rebels decided to kill each other so as not to fall into the hands of the Romans alive.  The scenery around Masada with Herod's palace, overlooking the vast gorge and the Dead Sea, is as dramatic as its background.  Nevertheless, the fortress continues to be one of the largest tourist sites in Israel. </p><p>  Masada was a stunning natural fortress in the Jewish desert of Israel.  It was built in the Roman style by Herod, king of Judea, somewhere between 37 and 31 years BC.  Masada had an advantageous position: on the one hand, it was located above the Dead Sea at an altitude of 1,500 feet, on the other, it was surrounded by desert.  It was the residence of the king with a palace, as well as administrative centers and warehouses, including weapons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.atlasobscura.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Masada Fortress" class="if uuid-2513868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2513868.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of Masada </h2><p>  The fortress museum presents artifacts and informational audio presentations that contribute to the revitalization of the history of Masada.  The museum is located at the cableway station.  Having been in it, as if you are returning during the dramatic fall of the fortress, tourists say.  This is facilitated by recreated rebel dwellings, straw baskets, looms, sandals, clothing, kitchen utensils and clay pots. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The museum has information about the use of the fortress by the Byzantine monks in the VI century.  Remaining untouched for more than 13 centuries, it has lost all signs of human habitation.  Thanks to the excavations, some fragments of the buildings were restored, including Herod's palace with hanging terraces, baths with preserved mosaics and frescoes, a synagogue and a camp established by the Romans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iliatorlin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of the Ancient Masada Fortress" class="if uuid-2514904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2514904.jpg"></div><h2>  Commercial and industrial center Zim </h2><p>  Zim Center Arad is an open and spacious shopping complex located in the industrial zone at the main entrance to Arad.  In Israel, in many cities there are such shopping centers.  It is located close to the main transport artery (route 31) leading to the Dead Sea, Masada and Eilat, and is the main stop for travelers in the area. </p><p>  It combines commerce and entertainment along with tourism and public services.  The complex is an integral part of the city.  Fashion stores such as Castro, Fox, Timnoon, Delta, Aldo, Togo, as well as restaurants - Pizza Hut, Schnitzelier and Aroma "settled" in it.  An ideal location provides optimal visibility from all sides and ideal access to the center for the residents of Arad and its environs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="michaelarch.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zim Shopping Center" class="if uuid-2515935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2515935.jpg"></div><p>  Here is the quarter of artists, where you can wander between various galleries, visit workshops (agreeing in advance), get acquainted with artists and their works.  In the shopping arcade you can buy only the original work of the artists themselves. </p><h2>  Resort City </h2><p>  The resort city in Israel Arad is the cleanest city on the planet, according to UNESCO.  People with bronchial asthma, bronchitis and pulmonary diseases come to its resorts.  They are treated with mountain air, which is rich in iodine and bromine.  Procedures using Dead Sea water help those who come with skin problems and those suffering from rheumatic diseases to recover. </p><p>  The urban microclimate with mild winters and long summers surprisingly relieves fatigue and insomnia.  Rest in the sanatoriums of the city is inexpensive in comparison with the cost of rehabilitation in the sanatoriums of other cities in Israel.  In Arad, the treatment prescribed by professional doctors does not differ from the appointments in other sanatoriums in the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Travel to Israel" class="if uuid-2513903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2513903.jpg"></div><p>  Having visited at least once in a health resort in Arada, people tend to come here all the time.  This indicates that they receive effective recovery, calling the procedures carried out in the sanatorium simply life-giving.  The vacationers also like the high level of staff, and the conditions of stay in the hotels of the city.  In addition, having arrived in Arad, vacationers do not feel the language barrier, the local population speaks Russian. </p><p>  An excellent budget vacation is called by tourists staying in Arad (Israel) in reviews.  Pluses - in everything, they argue. </p><h2>  Arad Tourism </h2><p>  Traveling to Israel will delight thrill-seekers.  Extreme tourism is organized in Arad.  A fairly new sport - snapling (canyoning) was widely used in this country.  This is a kind of journey through the mountain gorges.  The program of this trip includes: climbing, climbs, descents on the ropes, mountaineering, diving (water canyoning). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goarad.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Snapling - extreme tourism" class="if uuid-2516055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2516055.jpg"></div><p>  The variety of landscapes of the National Israeli Highway is known to hiking enthusiasts all over the world.  Israel is famous for its many trails, winding between breathtaking heights in the north and space landscapes in the south.  These routes are a great way to see the beauty of the country. </p><p>  Tel Arad National Park in Israel is the remains of the fortified city of Canaan, which is repeatedly mentioned in the Bible.  It is located on the outskirts of the city.  It is here that excavations are being conducted that help archaeologists study the historical layers in detail.  The park is divided into Lower and Upper Town.  On a hill overlooking the city and the Arad Valley, fortresses from the time of the Kingdom of Israel open. </p>
