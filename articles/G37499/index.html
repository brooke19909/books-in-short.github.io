One of the most interesting and popular places for tourists is the city of Brasov in Romania.  If you have made your choice in favor of it, this article will tell you about all the best attractions of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.neverendingfootsteps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of Brasov" class="if uuid-2532875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2532875.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  <span>Brasov</span> appeared on the map of <span>Romania</span> in the Middle Ages.  Saxon charm permeated the city far and wide and has survived to this day.  At the beginning of the 13th century, the Saxons came to the lands of Romania.  The first mention of the city dates back to 1235, which referred to the settlement of Corona.  When exactly Brasov was founded in Romania, whose photo can be found below, is unknown.  Over its long history, the city has changed many names, such as Kronstadt, Brasco, Stefanopolis, Brassov and Orashul-Stalin. </p><p>  The city is famous for the first printing and publishing book opened in Transylvania in 1535.  Some sources claim that it was here in 1559 that the first Romanian-language school in the country was founded.  Also, Brasov (Romania) became famous as the birthplace of the leader of the Transylvanian Protestants Johannes Honterus. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  In summer, the average temperature is 25 degrees Celsius.  In winter, at the foot of the mountains, it‚Äôs about minus 15. As you go up, the temperature drops, so if you go here for a ski vacation, there‚Äôs no more warm things.  Comparing with the Alps, the weather in Brasov (Romania) is cooler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mount Tympa </h2><p>  Nature reserve and keeper of rare species of plants and wild animals.  This attraction of Brasov in Romania rises above the sea at an altitude of about a kilometer.  Millennia ago, here people worshiped various gods.  On the site of the former fortress of Brasovia, there is now an observation deck with a gorgeous view.  From here you can see absolutely all the sights of Brasov in Romania, which will also be discussed in this article.  A pedestrian forest path with 25 serpentines leads to the top.  It takes at least an hour to get up.  After 10 minutes, you will definitely meet a bear.  There is also a funicular to the top, which takes anyone in just 3 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldtravelbug.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black church" class="if uuid-2532159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2532159.jpg"></div><h2>  Black church </h2><p>  The construction of this landmark in Romania, in Brasov in particular, took almost a century.  At first, the monument was a Catholic church of St. Mary.  In 1547, the evangelical Lutheran church was opened here.  The attraction is on the list of the largest temples in the southeastern part of Europe.  Now on the territory of the church is a museum, as well as an organ of Bucholz.  You can see a large exhibition, a collection of Turkish carpets of the Middle Ages and the heaviest bell in Romania. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.theglobetrottingteacher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black church" class="if uuid-2531959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2531959.jpg"></div><h2>  Rasnov Fortress </h2><p>  This landmark of the city is located on the road to Bran Castle.  The fortress was built instead of the former fleet of knights of the Teutonic Order.  Then there was a trade route between the principalities of Wallachia and Transylvania.  The fortress was built due to the Tatar invasions that ravaged the villages.  Residents fled to the forest territories of the Carpathians.  Several villages, united, began the construction of a fortress, which was to save their lives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldtravelbug.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brasov Romania" class="if uuid-2532158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2532158.jpg"></div><p>  At the very top of the mountain stands the Rasnov fortress, protected by a cliff and slopes.  The only road leads to it only from the south side.  During a raid on it, the inhabitants of the settlement rose, after which they closed the gates.  Opponents fell into deep ditches and under shelling with stones and arrows.  For centuries, the fortress was famous for its rebellion.  Nobody managed to take the ‚Äúdefender‚Äù by storm.  Only once the army of Prince Transylvania Gabriel Bathory was able to make people surrender.  During a long siege, they found a source of water and blocked it.  Residents had no choice but to surrender, and in a couple of years to buy Ryshnov.  For about 17 years, Turkish captives dug a well, about 150 meters deep. </p><h2>  Street Strada Sforiy </h2><p>  This attraction of Brasov attracts tourists not only as a historical object, but also as a fun interesting place.  The word "Sphoria" can be translated into Russian as "rope".  They named the street because of its width - 111 meters.  Initially, in the 16th century, it was a passage for firefighters, which is why no doors go out onto the street.  Strada Sforia is 80 meters long, and in fact is a side street. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theglobetrottingteacher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Forests of Brasov" class="if uuid-2531971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2531971.jpg"></div><h2>  Gates of Catherine </h2><p>  As in any other historical city in Brasov, a fortified wall with guarded gates towered.  Now, in almost original form, only the gates of Catherine have been preserved.  Also here used to be the monastery of St. Catherine, which gave its name to the gate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dangerous-business.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gates of Catherine" class="if uuid-2531980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2531980.jpg"></div><p>  In the 16th century, by the forces of nature, or rather as a result of the flood, the gates were demolished, because of which they had to be replaced with new ones in 1559.  The sight was disturbed by fire and earthquake in 1689 and 1738, respectively.  Reconstruction was carried out in the 19th century, during which several towers were added. </p><p>  Of the former and untouched natural disasters from the 16th century, only one central tower has been preserved.  Now it is located in the Bastion of weavers.  This is the place where the city model has been located since the 17th century. </p><p>  It is interesting that the Romanians of the Shkei district could get to Brasov only through the gates of Catherine, the rest of the routes were closed to them.  Because of this, the attraction has acquired another name - the Gate of the Wallachians.  In the period from the 13th to the 17th centuries, Romanians were not allowed inside the fortress at all.  They had to live on the reverse side and only at a certain time enter the city for money. </p><p>  Like the rest of the buildings of his time, the gates of Catherine served for defense.  There was also a drawbridge.  Now on the territory of the gate is a museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dangerous-business.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Forests of Brasov" class="if uuid-2531979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2531979.jpg"></div><h2>  Gate Shkay </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the previous attraction, there is a gate with an interesting name Shkei.  Due to the expansion of traffic, it was decided to build another gate.  They were built for the year 1827-1828.  Due to its breadth, they managed to completely supplant their predecessors, which they closed and used as storage facilities.  Now the gates of Shkay are decorated in the Baroque style and differ from their original appearance. </p>
