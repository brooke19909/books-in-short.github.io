    <h2>  The Sense Deluxe Hotel 5 * (Side): reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  As you know, many tourists today are no longer satisfied with only official information about a particular hotel and the advice of managers from travel agencies.  So, in the process of choosing a hotel, they try to be guided also by the reviews of other people who have already had occasion to stay in a particular place.  This allows you to make an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, which will be as close as possible to reality.  Therefore, we decided to save you a little time and effort and provide generalized comments from our compatriots regarding their stay at The Sense Deluxe Hotel 5 *.  Reviews of Russians, it must be said, for the most part are positive.  In their opinion, this hotel fully justifies its category and cost of living.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the sense deluxe hotel 5 side reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/967364.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The hotel itself and its territory </h2><p>  Many tourists, arriving at the hotel in question, were pleasantly surprised by its novelty and modern design.  As for the rooms, our compatriots assure that they are all wonderful and you don‚Äôt have to pay extra for moving to a more decent apartment.  By the way, guests of other hotels in Turkey sometimes complain about this fact.  Nevertheless, experienced travelers when booking a room at The Sense Deluxe Hotel 5 * (Side) recommend choosing apartments with sea views.  In this case, you can enjoy your stay at this hotel even more.  The rooms themselves have a great hi-tech design.  Here you will find modern furniture, the latest technology.  The apartments themselves and the adjacent bathroom are very spacious.  Many guests of the hotel note luxurious huge beds, on which some parents even comfortably accommodated with small children.  Tourists were pleased with the daily quality cleaning.  Linen and towels were changed regularly.  Also, every day, if necessary, the contents of the minibar and bath toiletries were replenished.  By the way, many guests note that all linen, bathrobes, towels are snow-white, soft and new. </p><p>  As for the territory of the hotel complex, our compatriots found a small, but very well-planned and stylishly decorated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the sense deluxe hotel 5 side" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/967363.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  In the process of discussing food in the vast majority of hotels in Turkey and other countries, the opinions of tourists who have been here differ sharply.  However, the Sense Deluxe Hotel <span>5 * (Side)</span> considered by us was an exception to this rule.  So, according to our compatriots, the cooks here work wonderfully well.  The main restaurant will offer you a lot of skillfully prepared dishes.  Here are several types of meat, poultry and fish, seafood, vegetables (grilled, steamed, etc.), salads, a lot of delicious pastries, sweets and snacks.  Many guests also praised the <span>work of the bartenders.</span>  In addition, often in their comments, hotel guests noted the fact that in restaurants and in bars it is almost impossible to see the queue, which is an indisputable plus. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As a rule, tourists come to Turkey, and in particular in Side, for an excellent beach holiday.  Therefore, the issue of the hotel‚Äôs proximity to the sea and the availability of its own beach plays an important role.  As for The Sense Deluxe Hotel 5 * (Side), the reviews we are reviewing, this hotel is located on the second coastline.  However, it has its own beach.  You can either reach it on foot (according to the guests, it takes no more than three minutes), or drive on a special car.  Tourists, according to their statements, practically did not use the last option, since there was no special need for it.  As for the beach itself, our compatriots found it very clean and well equipped.  However, they note that when entering the water there are quite large stones.  But they are clearly visible.  In addition, a number of guests in their comments noted that they often saw workers remove stones from the bottom.  Therefore, they do not exclude that by the next holiday season the bottom here will be more gentle and comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the sense deluxe hotel 5 side reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/967362.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other entertainments </h2><p>  The hotel also does not have to miss the guests.  So, tourists, they said, had a great time at the pools.  Some guests considered the animation program rather weak, but most tourists did not complain about this fact.  The youngest guests enjoyed visiting the mini-club and mini-disco.  By the way, in our reviews, our compatriots note that, probably, starting next year, this hotel complex will only accept guests over 18 years old.  Therefore, those planning a family vacation with young children should once again clarify this information when booking accommodation. </p><p>  And of course, experienced travelers recommend that everyone arriving on holiday in Turkey, and especially in Side, be sure not to spend all their time on the beach and hotel grounds, but to go on excursions to interesting places that abound in this region.  You can do this as part of an organized group, buying a tour from a guide in a hotel or in one of the companies in the vicinity, or on your own by renting a car from a rental agency. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Almost all of our compatriots were also very pleased with the staff of The Sense Deluxe Hotel 5 *.  According to them, most of the employees here are true professionals.  They are very friendly and welcoming with guests and are always ready to help in resolving any issue.  By the way, not all hotel workers speak Russian yet.  The fact is that for the most part the hotel contingent consists of German tourists and local residents.  However, this situation, according to guests, is likely to change for the better by the next holiday season. </p>
