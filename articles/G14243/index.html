  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Application is an entertaining kind of art.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Application is a <span>type of fine art</span> in which the details are first cut out with scissors and then glued in the correct order to the base.  This type of creative work is used everywhere.  The study of applications begins with the nursery group of kindergarten.  Children make simple crafts on a piece of paper.  Details are cut out by the tutor.  Over time, work is becoming more complicated.  At the end of <span>preschool age, children</span> independently cut out the necessary parts for the drawing, produce voluminous work, using a variety of materials. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider what an application is, what materials are used in such art, how it is made, what needs to be learned, because an application is one of the difficult decorative and applied techniques.  We will also figure out what material such crafts can be made from. </p><h2>  Material for applique </h2><p>  Application - is the compilation of paintings from small elements.  If you ask a child what an applique is, he will first name paper crafts.  We will not argue, of course, begins teaching such an art with paper and cardboard.  But already from kindergarten application from leaves and fabric is applied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn leaf applique" class="if uuid-2299784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2299784.jpg"></div><p>  If you look more broadly, then pictures from fabric or leather are embroidered on clothes and shoes.  On the products of Japanese and Chinese masters, you can see the application of silk.  You can use in the work and fur, and beads, and felt sheets.  They make drawings by sewing on felt shoes for children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pictures are created from beads and newspapers, even plasticine is used.  Images from threads glued on paper look beautiful.  Even on furniture, drawing from small components is used.  They just do not stick on top, but crash into the wooden part. </p><h2>  Types of applications </h2><p>  Views vary in both subject and image form.  Application is such a wide area that the difference manifests itself even in the color scheme.  For example, <span>silhouette cutout</span> from black paper is popular.  There are one-color pictures, and there are multi-colored ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aspoonfuloflearning.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's paper application" class="if uuid-2299769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2299769.jpg"></div><p>  The simplest <span>type</span> of paper <span>application</span> is a flat image.  Then the children are explained how to make three-dimensional pictures, in which the details are not glued to the end, and the edges of some are notched or twisted, bent by eyelets, etc. </p><p>  Subjects of work are also different: </p><ul><li>  Subject, when one object is displayed in the center of the sheet. </li><li>  Storyline.  The plot is viewed in the picture. </li><li>  Decorative.  Placing on the plane of the ornament of cut elements. </li></ul><h2>  Value </h2><p>  During the applique class, children learn to work with their hands, use scissors, and bend sheets.  The motility of the hands and fingers, imagination and orientation in space, the ability to perform work carefully, carefully comparing it with the model of the teacher, are developing. </p>
