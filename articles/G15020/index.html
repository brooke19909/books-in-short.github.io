    <p>  Directly on the territory of the hotel there is a whole complex of pools and a separate one near the restaurant.  The complex includes four pools, among which there is an ordinary one for swimming, a pool with excellent water hills, as well as two heated pools: one in which animated water programs take place, and a children's pool. </p><p>  The pool, located near one of the many restaurants that the Deauville hotel offers its guests, is an excellent place to relax those who want to relax from the hustle and bustle.  The water in it is heated.  So even in cool weather in this pool you can safely swim.  It also has a special area for children, so parents and children can safely come here. </p><p>  As on the beach, lifeguards are always on duty at the hotel near pools.  They keep order and look after the little mischievous, so that adults can take a break from the endless tracking of children for a while and enjoy a vacation in this wonderful place. </p><p>  Everyone who has ever visited here really likes the variety of water activities that the Deauville Hotel (Anapa) offers.  The reviews of the hotel staff and all vacationers suggest that there are no problems finding a place to cool in the summer heat.  All pools and the sea do their job perfectly.  Some, however, upset that the beach is not right next to the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Restaurants at the Deauville Hotel </h2><p>  The question of where to find food does not arise for tourists arriving at the Deauville hotel.  The only problem with food in this place can only be the choice of a particular restaurant or bar where guests are going to have dinner on that day.  At the disposal of vacationers there are two restaurants and six bars, which are located in different parts of the hotel. </p><p>  The main restaurant, which serves a refined and rich buffet, is called Normandy.  It presents more than three hundred dishes, a variety of drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and there is a special children's menu. </p><p>  The main highlight of the restaurant is the availability of open cooking.  This means that everyone can watch how the local chef prepares his signature dish for dinner.
