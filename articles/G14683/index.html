  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Small refrigerator: advantages, disadvantages and scope</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In a small kitchen it can be difficult to place all the necessary equipment.  A small refrigerator, despite its modest dimensions, can be quite roomy and partially solve the problem of lack of space.  In order to choose the best option and not miscalculate, you should determine the desired size, functionality and study possible modifications.  Design also plays an important role: a stylish refrigerator can become a real decoration of the kitchen. </p><h2>  Features and Benefits </h2><p>  A small refrigerator is a compact device with a height of not more than 130 cm. Such equipment is indispensable in small-sized apartments, office buildings, as well as in cottages.  It allows you to comfortably and creatively equip your living space and does not require too much free space.  The main advantage of such models is their compact size, thanks to which the unit can easily be placed under the kitchen worktop, built into a cupboard or taken with you to the cottage.  The built-in small refrigerator is ideal for fans of stylish interiors.  The engine of the unit also has a modest size, so it makes almost no noise.  The device can even be put in the bedroom and not worry about loud sounds. </p><p>  Thanks to the compact engine and other internal mechanisms, the small refrigerator has good capacity, for example, an apparatus with a height of only 85 cm has a useful volume of 115 liters.  Another important advantage is the affordable price, since a smaller size also means lower cost.  The features of a miniature refrigerator include an almost full-fledged functionality: the ability to hang the door to the other side, a built-in voltage stabilizer, a freshness chamber, a freezer, an audible alert when the door is open. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  There are several types of small refrigerators, each of which has its own purpose and features.  First of all, it is necessary to distinguish between floor and table models.  The former have a larger size and functionality, while the latter are extremely compact and small in capacity.  There are also built-in models that blend harmoniously with the kitchen set and are completely invisible in the interior. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.orbitaloc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Small two-door refrigerator" class="if uuid-2409873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2409873.jpg"></div><p>  Small refrigerators are single-chamber and two-chamber.  Single chamber have one cell, sometimes divided by shelves.  Such a model can be equipped with a compact freezer or available without it.  A small refrigerator without a freezer is usually used in offices, so that employees can keep their lunches brought with them.  Two-compartment refrigerators are larger, as a rule, one chamber is a refrigerator, and the second is a freezer.  Such models are suitable for a small apartment and a small family of two to three people. </p><p>  Manufacturers of household appliances have also provided special devices for a narrow audience.  Portable refrigerators are compact portable units equipped with an autonomous power source.  Bar serves for cooling drinks and desserts.  Automobiles work from the cigarette lighter.  There are also <span>refrigerators for wine,</span> in such models the door is usually made of glass.  Of particular interest are miniature devices with a USB cable that can be powered from a computer or laptop.  Although the internal volume is relatively small, in such a micro box you can cool several bottles of water, a portion of ice cream or yogurt.  A small refrigerator for the office is an ideal solution for employees in the summer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  When choosing a refrigerator, you need to pay attention to its configuration.
