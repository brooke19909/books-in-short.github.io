Gorchakov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The last chancellor of the Russian Empire, the largest diplomat, the person who made history in the difficult period of Russia's life, Prince A.M. Gorchakov was born 220 years ago, in 1798.  Alexander Mikhailovich - a representative of the ancient family of Russian aristocrats, rooted in the reign of Yaroslav the Wise. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúYou, Gorchakov, have been lucky from the first days ...‚Äù </h2><p>  He was a lyceum student of the famous first set of Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, which he graduated with a gold medal.  A. S. Pushkin dedicated the poem ‚ÄúOctober 19‚Äù to his classmate. </p><p>  Interesting fact.  The poet highly appreciated the opinion of Gorchakov about his work.  So, for example, after reading his poem ‚ÄúThe Monk‚Äù at the Lyceum and hearing disapproval, he handed over the manuscript to the future Chancellor of the Russian Empire for destruction.  The prince kept the creation of Pushkin in his archive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait painted by Pushkin" class="if uuid-3146682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3146682.jpg"></div><p>  Gorchakov was one of the first among the graduates of the Lyceum to go to public service, as he refused his parental inheritance in favor of his sisters.  His career soared up.  As an assistant to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Karl Nesselrode, he traveled to many European cities and participated in the Congress of the Holy Alliance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Nerd" or "good grandfather" </h2><p>  The prince liked the diplomatic service.  Looking at the soft expression of his face, half-smile, duck nose, narrowed eyes, his opponents made a mistake, assuming that they saw in front of them a "nerd," "kind grandfather," or "cabinet professor."  Contemporaries said that Gorchakov, with all his gloss and delicate wit, has the grip of a bull terrier, but manages not to leave bite marks. </p><p>  Not supporting the line chosen by Nesselrod in the conduct of the country's foreign policy, he resigns and bitterly learns about its signing.  Gorchakov has not served for three years.  He spends a forced pause, marries Mariya Alexandrovna Urusova. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russian.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great diplomat" class="if uuid-3146727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3146727.jpg"></div><p>  Fate gave Alexander Mikhailovich a second chance.  In 1841 he received a new appointment to Stuttgart, a few years later the future Chancellor of the Russian Empire - Extraordinary Envoy to the German Union. </p><h2>  Hard trials </h2><p>  In 1853, the prince became a widower.  As a result of a happy fifteen-year marriage, two sons were born, and the children of Maria Alexandrovna grew up from their first marriage.  A year later, the prince becomes ambassador to Vienna. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  1856 brought difficult trials; Russia lost the Crimean War.  Forced to sign a humiliating agreement, she and Turkey lost the Black Sea fleet.  The Turks transferred their ships to the Mediterranean Sea, and Russia had to destroy the remains of the fleet and fortresses on the coast with its own hands.  In such an environment, Alexander II appoints Gorchakov to the post of vice chancellor of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  In a circular prepared for the tsar, Gorchakov proposed increasing attention to the internal problems of the country, leaving for a while active foreign policy activity.  The athletes call it ‚Äútake a time out‚Äù, and in the diplomatic language of Gorchakov it was: ‚ÄúThey say Russia is angry.  No, she focuses. ‚Äù </p><div class="photo" data-original="wp.wiki-wiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berlin Congress" class="if uuid-3146703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3146703.jpg"></div><p>  In 1867, he was appointed chancellor of the Russian Empire.  Gorchakov tirelessly works in the diplomatic field to eliminate the consequences of the Crimean War.  Searches for and loses allies, affects the connection between France, Prussia and Germany, maneuvers between them.  Finally, in 1870, he told the Tsar that it was time for Russia to raise the question of its ‚Äújust demand‚Äù.  In the spring of 1871, the London Convention was published, according to which all articles banning the stay of Russia in the Black Sea were canceled. </p><p>  It was the finest hour of the great diplomat, to which he was walking in a difficult and indirect way.  The Chancellor of the Russian Empire himself was proud of this event, as the main achievement of his diplomatic activity. </p><h2>  Retirement </h2><p>  The style of the last Chancellor of the Russian Empire was as follows: without showing any cruelty or pressure, he did not give up and did not give a drop of achievement to his opponents.  Sophisticated mind, excellent education, secular tactics enabled Alexander Mikhailovich to maneuver between the major powers, to defend the interests of Russia. </p><p>  His last victory took place in 1875, when the already quite elderly diplomat did not allow Bismarck to attack France again.  The constant position of A. M. Gorchakov was: ‚ÄúSupport the weak versus the strong, thereby weaken the strong.‚Äù </p><p>  In 1882, the sick and already elderly prince ended his service as Minister of Foreign Affairs.  But the highest grace the title of chancellor of the Russian Empire remained with him until the end of his days. </p><p>  Interesting fact.  Gorchakov Alexander Mikhailovich was the last chancellor and the last lyceum student of the first set, who left this world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wp.wiki-wiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Strelna. Monument on the grave" class="if uuid-3146705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3146705.jpg"></div><p>  Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov died in 1883, was buried in Strelna, at Holy Trinity Cemetery. </p>
