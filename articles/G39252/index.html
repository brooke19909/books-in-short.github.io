At that time, large world states had not yet learned to solve serious geopolitical issues without the use of force and, consequently, human casualties. </p><h2>  The reasons for the Russo-Japanese war </h2><ol><li>  Strengthening friendly relations between Russia and China.  As you know, until the 90s of the 19th century, the main focus of Russian foreign policy was in the Balkans, but since 1894, the strengthening of friendship with China began.  Russia provided this state with diplomatic and military assistance in the war with Japan. </li><li>  <span>Conflict of interests of</span> Russia and Japan in terms of influence in the Far East and in Manchuria. </li></ol><h2>  Strategic mistakes and military victories </h2><p>  Initially, it was clear that the <span>Japanese army was</span> not ready for a long war.  But Russian generals believed that Asians would negotiate with European countries and organize a war on two fronts.  This was the strategic mistake of the Russian military and diplomats.  Also, the Russians, assuming the general backwardness of the forces of Japan (incidentally, also a mistake), thought that on the Western Front much more forces would be needed than on the Eastern.  Russia's plan was to conduct a grueling, protracted war, in which victory at sea would be achieved on the 7-8th month, and troops would land on the islands.  As a result, the Japanese plan worked, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was an instant strike on the Pacific squadron and the seizure of dominance at sea. </p>

    <h2>  The balance of power at sea </h2><p>  Russia and Japan, a few years before the start of the war, had already begun to strengthen their fleets.  Russia already had experience in the <span>Crimean War,</span> which showed the importance of success at sea.  Assuming the inevitability of war in the east with Japan, military commanders identified the main task - the strengthening of the Pacific Flotilla. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, consider the state of the fleets of countries.  The total number of ships of the Russian Empire in the east for 1904 was 64. Of these, 35 were destroyers, there were also cruisers, armadillos, and large boats.  The Japanese fleet outnumbered the Russian one.  Only 47 destroyers were put into operation 47. The total number of <span>the Japanese Navy</span> was 87 units.  As we can see, the Japanese Navy outnumbered the Russian squadron by 23 ships.  Perhaps the Russians were confident in technical superiority, but that did not work either.  Japanese ships were faster, fired better and were more protected from enemy shots. </p>

    <h2>  Start of war </h2><p>  Surprise is one of the important elements of success in a war.  The Japanese army, namely fleet forces, on January 27 <span>launched a war</span> in two directions at once.  Note that both battles ended successfully for the Japanese, although their fleet also lost some strength.  The first Japanese attack was at night.  The squadron of Asians consisted of 25 ships of three types: armadillos, cruisers, destroyers.  As a result of the shelling, the Russian battleships Tsesarevich and Ratzivan, as well as the cruiser Pallada, were damaged.  From surprise, the Russian troops really could not repel this sortie of the Japanese. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second attack took place in the morning of the same day, as a result of which 5 more Russian ships were out of order.  It cannot be said that the damage to the empire‚Äôs fleet was fatal, but quite tangible, because ship repair was poorly established. </p><p>  Where was the second battle of the day?  The now famous Korean Incheon at that time was called Chemulpo.  At the beginning of 1904, there were 2 Russian ships on the roadstead in this port: the Varangian and the Korean.  The Japanese attacked the Russian forces with 14 ships.  It is clear that the fate of the Russian ships was determined, but the Japanese could not defeat them quickly anyway.  The commander of the "Varyag" Rudnev believed that we should try to break out of the claws of the Japanese and reach the port of Arthur.  A battle ensued at sea.  Damage to the "Varyag" did not allow the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãleaving Korea to be realized, but 3 Japanese ships were also neutralized.  Note that the Russian sailors did not die and after some time were able to get to their homeland. </p>

    <h2>  The death of Makarov </h2><p>  The leadership of the Russian army understood that the Pacific Fleet at the time the war started did not stand the test of military operations.  To establish military training, the commander of the fleet was appointed the famous vice-admiral Makarov.  This man had significant combat experience, so he had to effectively cope with the tasks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  During the month of its activity, the Russian fleet was transformed.  Makarov significantly increased the level of military training, raised the organization of the fleet.  The intensity of the exercises also increased, which made it possible to increase the number and success of ship exits to the sea.  Of course, the Japanese did not sit idly by, observing the qualitative changes in the Russian fleet.  All exits from the port of Arthur were constantly mined.  March 31, 1904 the cruiser "Petropavlovsk", on board which was sailing and Makarov, was blown up by a mine.  All people on board died. </p><h2>  Second stage of the war </h2><p>  The victory of the Japanese Navy made it possible to organize an island state transfer of significant landing forces to the Liaodong Peninsula.  By the way, this operation was thought out and organized in advance, because secretly little by little the Japanese entered Korea back in the fall of 1903.  Of course, the Japanese army did not wage open aggression.  We are talking about people from the reserve, who were merchants, artisans, etc. The main task of these forces was to prepare the conditions for the success of the landing operation, to collect intelligence. </p>

    <p>  From January 24 to March 3, more than 35 thousand Japanese landed on the Korean coast.  It is important for us to understand the balance of power of the Russians.  The total army in Asia amounted to 123 thousand people.  Of these, approximately 24 thousand were in the Primorsky Territory.  On the Kwantung Peninsula stood about 30 thousand.  Russians 19 thousandth army guarded the border with Korea.  Northeast China was a strategically important territory for tsarism.  There were more than 50 thousand soldiers of the imperial army.  The army was commanded by General A.N. Kuropatkin. </p><p>  The Russian group on the border with Korea acted passively.  Sluggishness led to the fact that the Japanese managed to attack the 7,000th Russian corral and defeat it.  As a result of the battle, the Russian army lost more than 30 guns, about 3 thousand soldiers killed, and had to retreat 70 kilometers.  The Liaoyang battle began for the empire unsuccessfully. </p><h2>  Jinzhou: the next defeat of the imperial army </h2><p>  Yes, the Russians were confident in their superiority on land, but they were also mistaken in this.  Another Japanese landing party landed on the <span>Liaodong Peninsula</span> on April 22, 1904.  The size of this group was also approximately 35 thousand.  The Japanese maneuver consisted in the fact that they did not enter the battle with the army, commanded by A.N. Kuropatkin, but headed inland.  Of course, the Asiatic command understood the entire risk of the operation, so on May 4, 15 thousand troops landed in the Dagushan area.  Objective: cover the attack on Jinzhou. </p><p>  The Japanese campaign to the city lasted 19 days.  Near this city is the narrowest passage to the Kwantung Peninsula.  The grouping of Russians on this isthmus was about 4 thousand people.  May 13 was a long battle.  Although the Japanese lost 3 times more, they won the battle.  As a result of this victory, the Japanese army opened its way to the port of Dalniy.  Northeast China fell under the general control of Japanese forces, and Russian troops were actually cut off from each other. </p>

    <p>  Further battles continued with varying success and heavy losses for both armies. </p><h2>  Liaoyang battle </h2><p>  In August 1904, the third stage of the war began.  The Liaoyang battle was already planned, because for three months serious defense structures were being built near this settlement.  In August 1904, the strength of the Manchurian Russian army was 152 thousand, and the Japanese forces were 22 thousand less numerically.  The Liaoyang battle of 1904 went down in history as an event that completely broke the spirit of the Russian army. </p>

    <p>  Despite the smaller numbers, the Japanese were the first to go on the offensive on August 11.  They wanted to surround the Russians, or at least completely isolate them from the possible approach of the new forces.  The initiative constantly belonged to the Japanese troops, because they, unlike the Russians, were active. </p><p>  Kuropatkin‚Äôs army was not able to abruptly attack, because the distance from the center was more than 7,000 km.  On August 19, Kuropatkin handed over another item to the Japanese, after which there was a threat of the capture of Yantai.  Realizing that nothing could be achieved, the command decided to retreat to Mukden.  The Liaoyang battle, whose participants lost a total of up to 40,000 people, showed the backwardness and immobility of the Russian troops. </p>

    <h2>  War Results </h2><p>  Talking about further battles, in principle, does not make much sense, because these were the successes of the Japanese and the agony of Russia. </p><p>  The results of the war were very difficult for Russia.  So, the Portsmouth Peace Treaty of 1905 says that: </p><ol><li>  South Sakhalin goes to Japan. </li><li>  Japan leases the Liaodong Peninsula. </li><li>  The possibility of the Japanese conducting a railway along the Liaodong Peninsula. </li><li>  The withdrawal of the Russian army from Manchuria. </li></ol><p>  Russia and Japan entered into a conflict, the consequences of which, in fact, are felt today, because a peace treaty between Russia and Japan, based on the results of the 1945 war, has not yet been concluded. </p>
