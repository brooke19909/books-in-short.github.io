    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The agency was formed on the basis of two European organizations through their merger.  The first of them was engaged in the creation of launch vehicles, and the second in the development of satellites.  ESA is headquartered in Paris.  In addition to its permanent members, this includes several observer countries, including Canada, which takes part in some programs.  On an ongoing basis, the agency has fourteen countries: France, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Denmark. </p><h2>  Destination </h2><p>  The main mission of the organization is <span>space research</span> , development, launch and operation of automatic interplanetary stations, Spacelab laboratories, Hubble telescope and others.  The Agency actively cooperates with the national space programs of the states participating in it.  The largest countries that make up the organization oversee certain areas.  Germany has been assigned the function of creating automatic cargo ships and personnel training centers for their maintenance.  France is developing carrier rockets and satellites, which should greatly simplify space exploration, and is also responsible for the operation of the Kourou space center.  Italy is developing interplanetary stations and modules for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="space exploration" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1665987.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are geographically dispersed throughout Europe.  The first of these is the secretariat, whose headquarters are in the French capital.  In the Dutch city of Noordwijk, the center for space technology and research is deployed, which is considered the main technical institution of the organization.  It consists of numerous project teams, as well as a technology support department.  There are also various test equipment related to such areas as space exploration.  In Germany, two structural units are deployed at once.  A space operations center is located in Darmstadt, which tunes satellites and ground-based equipment to communicate with them.  An astronaut center is located in Porzvan, which specializes in training future cosmonauts and coordinating the activities of the entire European manned space program.  A research institute is operating in the Italian city of Frascati, whose employees analyze and use data obtained from planetary observation systems from space. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The European Space Agency is headed by a CEO and a board.  They have the responsibility to fulfill all the tasks facing the organization.  The main body is a council composed of representatives of all participating States.  He approves all programs and activities of the organization, approves the budget and coordinates all financial issues.  In addition, the Council approves or blocks the entry of new members into the European Space Agency.  Each country has one vote here.  All decisions are made based on the majority of votes.  As regards financial matters, the support of 2/3 of the participants is necessary for their approval.  The Council has several subsidiary bodies, which include committees responsible for administrative and financial policy, the implementation of scientific programs, international relations and industrial policy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="space science" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1665986.jpg" width="600"></div>

International activities are considered one of the key elements in ESA policies.  In February 2003, an agreement was signed on cooperation between the organization and our country.  Similar treaties apply to states such as Poland, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Czech Republic and Romania.  It should be noted that the activities of the agency are not limited only to Europe.  In particular, for the quality use of satellites, fruitful relations have been established with Japan.  The organization actively helps to develop space activities in other countries, for the representatives of which relevant courses are organized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ESA European Space Agency" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1665985.jpg" width="600"></div>
