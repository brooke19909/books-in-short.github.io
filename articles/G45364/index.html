German Florence (which is what the locals call Schwerin) is a picturesque corner in which cosiness and harmony reign, and historical monuments are combined with modern buildings.  The magnificent building, which will be discussed today, is under the protection of UNESCO. </p><h2>  The history of the castle </h2><p>  In the 1st century AD, a small fort where the Germans lived was located on the territory of a modern city that stores a priceless treasure, however, only seven centuries later Slavic tribes invaded the land, who built a wooden fortress near the lake, which performed a defensive function.  The first mention of it dates back to 965.  In the XII century, after long wars, the Germans returned their lands and built a new city - Schwerin, which became the spiritual and cultural capital of Mecklenburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="schwerin castle schwerin germany" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1873046.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  The fabulous Schwerin Castle, built on the site of the former fortress, appeared between 1845 and 1857 on the orders of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, who became the owner of a small county.  He wished that a family residence of an old noble family appeared on his land. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Treasure of Northern Germany </h2><p>  The famous architect G. Demmler, often traveling to other countries in search of inspiration, worked hard on the project of the future building, which became the symbol of the town.  At that time, eclecticism was considered the most fashionable trend in Europe - a mixture of styles and forms.  The Schwerin castle, the shape of which resembled the French Chambord, was rebuilt several times, and a significant contribution to the architecture of the building was made by the German architect G. Semper, who designed the 70-meter tower. </p><p>  In 1913, a terrible fire destroyed one third of Schwerin's main value, and restoration took several decades.  The completely restored castle turns into a museum, and since 1990 it has become the place where the parliament sits.  During the Second World War, the city and its main pearl were not affected by the bombing, and tourists can enjoy a wonderful sight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="schwerin castle r schwerin germany" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1873045.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A masterpiece that combines a variety of architectural styles </h2><p>  Schwerin Castle, located on an artificial island between two lakes, is made in a variety of architectural styles.  The pentagonal central building, which is crowned with spiers of different sizes reflected in the clear water, carries elements of Gothic, Baroque, Byzantine style, Classicism and Renaissance.  And at the same time, all directions are harmoniously combined with each other, giving the citadel a finished look.  On the facade of the building is an equestrian sculpture of the Grand Duke Niklot - the founder of the Mecklenburg family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="schwerin castle schwerin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1873047.jpg" width="499"></div>

On three floors of the Schwerin Castle, the photo of which conveys its exquisite beauty, there are halls where the Grand Dukes lived.  Now 653 rooms are available for tourists, which belonged to a family clan.  It is curious that they are all unique and do not resemble each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="schwerin castle germany" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1873049.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Portraits of rulers from the Mecklenburg family are hung on the walls, spacious rooms are decorated with gilding, jewelry-made woodcarvings, eye-catching ceiling moldings.  But the main masterpiece is the Throne Hall with amazing marble columns and cast-iron doors.  Tourists walking through the spacious chambers imagine the luxuries of the local aristocrats. </p><h2>  Ghost Legends Peterman </h2><p>  According to legend, a small man lives in the old building, the image of which can be seen on the door of a wooden cabinet created in the 17th century.  It is believed that the first time the dwarf got into Schwerin Castle through tangled tunnels from a nearby mine, where he works as a blacksmith, and now he makes his way into the building through a narrow grotto by the lake.  Residents of the town are sure that Peterman constantly knocks on his little anvil, and if you put your ear to the ground, you can hear melodic sounds. </p><p>  An old man with a grumpy character always lives in one of the rooms and does not tolerate any changes.  After large-scale repairs more than a hundred years ago, amazed builders found that one of the premises remained untouched.  All owners of the family residence without fail put up an additional device on the dining table and cooked the ghost's favorite dish - red beets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="schwerin castle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1873052.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Enchanted prince </h2><p>  However, there is another legend according to which the ghost of an enchanted prince wanders in the Schwerin castle towering above the lake (Schwerin, Germany).  A wealthy heir to the lands accidentally killed a priest and, after a curse, turned into a little dwarf, frightening lonely tourists.  Many say that the outlines of a gray-haired old man, dressed in unfashionable clothes and rattling a bunch of keys, appear in darkness.  He often speaks with visitors and asks to bewitch him, but so far no one has been able to restore his previous appearance. </p><p>  Residents stare at what Peterman is wearing: the black color of the jacket means someone's death, and if the gnome appears in red or white, this is considered a harbinger of events pleasant for the city.  He monitors servants and punishes thieves, and also survives those he does not like. </p><p>  Not a single city holiday is complete without a ghost image, and not only pleasure boats and sightseeing buses are named after him, but also one of the varieties of aromatic beer. </p><h2>  What else to see? </h2><p>  Around the Schwerin Castle surrounded by water in Germany, there is a luxurious park complex in a classic English style.  A shady garden creating a mysterious atmosphere is replete with interesting sculptures, wonderful fountains, spacious terraces, bright flower gardens, mysterious grottoes. </p><p>  Inside the outstanding architectural monument is a museum, as well as a cozy cafe in the greenhouse of the park.  Near the historical landmark is a pier, from which people go on an exciting boat trip to view the elegant building from the water. </p><p>  Today, a beautiful building, connected to the land by two bridges, becomes the center of urban cultural events: an opera festival is held here, and the Mecklenburg State Theater plays. </p><h2>  Opening hours and entry fees </h2><p>  From October to April, the fabulously looking Schwerin castle in Schwerin (Germany) welcomes guests from 10.00 to 17.00, and from May to September - until 18.00.  However, during the holidays, the working time often changes, and you need to clarify the data on the official website.  Educational excursions are held twice a day. </p><p>  Admission for adults is 6 euros, children can visit the Schwerin Castle in Schwerin for free. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have visited the beautiful architectural monument both inside and out, admit that they rarely saw such splendor.  The castle <span>on the island</span> can be admired from different angles, and it is especially beautiful when it is illuminated by the golden rays of the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Schwerin castle photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1873044.jpg" width="600"></div>
