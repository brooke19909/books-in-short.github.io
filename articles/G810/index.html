Indeed, how great it is: to get out of the dusty city in order to breathe in the clean air, which is so lacking in the metropolis.  On the other hand, at this time you can visit many open-air museums and parks, which during this period will appear in all its glory. </p>

But when they get there on the weekend, many people go from the aviary to the aviary with the only thought: when will it all end.  Few people like crowding, and the pleasure of visiting the zoo is greased.  However, several years ago, the <span>Bird Park</span> in the Kaluga Region opened its gates with the characteristic name: ‚ÄúSparrows‚Äù.  Its location allows you to have fun outdoors.  And there is something to see there, so it‚Äôs better to go there all day.

    <h4>  Sparrow Bird Park, Kaluga Region.  Appearance story </h4><p>  Formally, the park opened to visitors in 2005.  In fact, his story began much earlier.  More than thirty years ago, a collection of rare exotic birds appeared, and, of course, it needed to be placed somewhere.  At first, she was taken from Moscow to the region, and later relocated to the Obninsk region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since its opening, the park has been loved not only by wildlife connoisseurs who come there to relax, but also by specialists who were given the opportunity to conduct <span>research</span> on its territory. </p><p>  Every year the collection is replenished with new species of birds and animals, and the number of visitors to the park is growing. </p><h4><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park of birds sparrows kaluga region" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10434/166441.jpg" width="600"></div>  Bird Park <span>in the Kaluga Region:</span> for what it is worth going there </h4><p>  The name of this place speaks for itself.  Sparrows Park is primarily interesting for the collection of birds collected in it.  Indeed, there is something to see: unique breeds of pigeons, domestic, forest and <span>birds of prey,</span> as well as exotic parrots.  Kids are delighted when they hear the sounds made by the capercaillie, or see a huge rooster.  All visitors have a unique opportunity not only to enjoy watching a wide variety of bird species, but also to stroll through the beautiful and well-groomed territory of the park or sit on the green lawn. </p><p>  But this is not all: there is also a mini-zoo on the territory where you can see several <span>species of monkeys,</span> kangaroos, lynxes, as well as domestic animals.  Beautiful llamas living in spacious pens can even be fed hay.  Guys from this are just delighted.  Well, the opportunity to ride around the territory on a horse would not mind taking advantage of all children without exception. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Aquariums and exotarium complement the living creatures living in Voroby.  Thus, time flies there unnoticed. </p><p>  Bird Park in the Kaluga Region can be visited even with kids.  For them, there is a cozy playground on the territory.  And you can have lunch at the Pelican cafe or take everything you need with you and have a picnic. </p><h4><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park sparrows" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10434/166443.jpg" width="600"></div>  Bird Park in the Kaluga Region: how to get there </h4><p>  Of course, the most convenient way to come to Sparrows is to have your own car.  Despite the fact that the park is located in the Kaluga region, the road there can not be called tiring.  A little more than seventy kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  What highway?  Kiev or Kaluga, to whom it is more convenient.  When turning left from the first reference point, the traffic police post opposite Balabanovo will serve - and only a few kilometers to the target.  Next you need to find a pointer to the village of Mashkovo (turn left again).  If you get along the Kaluga highway, then you need to look for the village "Sparrows" (exit to the right).  In any case, after leaving the tracks, the signs will tell you the way, so getting lost is quite difficult. </p><p>  You can get to the park on your own either by minibus from the Balabanovo station, or by bus, departing from Obninsk and following the Obninsk-Papino route (scheduled). </p>
