  <section class="page js-page"><h1>System properties: definition, features, classification</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many are familiar with the phrase from the film by Andrew and Lawrence Wachowski: ‚ÄúThe Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa system. It is our enemy.‚Äù  However, it is worth understanding the concepts, terms, as well as the capabilities and properties of the system.  Is she so scary as she is portrayed in many films and literary works?  The characteristics and properties of the system and examples of their manifestation will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  The meaning of the term </h2><p>  The word "system" of Greek origin (œÉœçœÉœÑŒ∑ŒºŒ±), which means in literal translation the whole, consisting of connected parts.  However, the concept hiding under this term is much more multifaceted. </p><p>  Although in modern life almost all things are considered as <span>functional systems,</span> it is impossible to give the only correct definition of this concept.  Oddly enough, this is due to the penetration of the theory of systems into literally all <span>spheres of human life.</span> </p><p>  As early as the beginning of the twentieth century, discussions were held about the difference between the properties of linear systems studied in mathematics, logic, and the characteristics of living organisms (an example of scientific validity in this case is the theory of functional systems of P. K. Anokhin).  At the present stage, it is customary to single out a number of meanings of this term, which are formed depending on the analyzed object. </p><p>  In the twenty-first century, a more detailed explanation of the Greek term appeared, namely: "integrity, consisting of elements that are interconnected and are in certain relationships."  But this general description of the meaning of the word does not reflect the properties of the system analyzed by the observer.  In this regard, the concept will acquire new facets of interpretation depending on the object under consideration.  Only the concepts of integrity, the basic properties of the system and its elements will remain unchanged. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.walldevil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="system properties system classification" class="if uuid-2388590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2388590.jpg"></div><h2>  Element as part of integrity </h2><p>  In the theory of systems, it is customary to consider the whole as the interaction and relations of certain elements, which, in turn, are units with certain properties that are not subject to further division.  The parameters of the considered part (or the properties of the system element) are usually described using: </p><ul><li>  functions (performed by the considered unit of action within the system); </li><li>  behavior (interaction with the external and internal environment); </li><li>  state (condition for finding an element with changed parameters); </li><li>  process (change of state of an element). </li></ul><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the element of the system is not equivalent to the concept of "elementarity".  It all depends on the scale and complexity of the object in question. </p><p>  If we discuss the system of human properties, then the elements will be such concepts as consciousness, emotions, abilities, behavior, personality, which, in turn, can themselves be represented as an integrity consisting of elements.  It follows from this that the element can be considered as a subsystem of the object in question.  The initial stage in system analysis is the determination of the composition of ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù, that is, the refinement of all elements included in it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Links and resources as system-forming properties </h2><p>  Any systems are not in an isolated state; they constantly interact with the environment.  In order to isolate any "integrity", it is necessary to identify all the bonds that unite the elements in the system. </p><p>  What are connections and how they affect the properties of the system. </p><p>  Communication - the interdependence of elements on a physical or semantic level.  By significance, the following connections can be distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Structures (or structural): characterize mainly the physical component of the system (for example, due to changing bonds, carbon can act as graphite, diamond or gas). </li><li>  Functioning: guarantee the performance of the system, its vital functions. </li><li>  Inheritance: cases where the element "A" is the source for the existence of "B". </li><li>  Development (structural and destruction): take place either in the process of complicating the structure of the system, or vice versa - simplification or decay. </li><li>  Organizational: these include social, corporate, role-playing.  But the most interesting group are management connections that allow you to control and direct the development of the system in a certain direction. </li></ol><p>  The presence of certain connections determines the properties of the system, displays the dependencies between specific elements.  You can also trace the use of resources necessary for the construction and operation of the system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.laetitiasoulier.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="general system properties" class="if uuid-2388628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2388628.jpg"></div><p>  Each element is initially equipped with certain resources that it can transfer to other participants in the process or exchange them.  Moreover, the exchange can occur both within the system and between the system and the external environment.  Resources can be classified as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Material - represent the objects of the material world: warehouses, goods, devices, machines, etc. </li><li>  Energy - this includes all types known at the present stage of the development of science: electrical, nuclear, mechanical, etc. </li><li>  Information. </li><li>  Human - a person acts not only as an employee performing certain operations, but also as a source of intellectual funds. </li><li>  Space. </li><li>  Time. </li><li>  Organizational - in this case, the structure is considered as a resource, the lack of which can even lead to the collapse of the system. </li><li>  Financial - for most organizational structures are fundamental. </li></ol><h2>  Systematization levels in systems theory </h2><p>  Since systems have certain properties and characteristics, they can be classified, the purpose of which is to select appropriate approaches and means of describing integrity. </p><p>  According to the substantial principle of division, real and abstract systems are distinguished.  For ease of perception, information will be presented in a table. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td colspan="4"><p>  Systems </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">  Real </td><td colspan="2">  Abstract </td></tr><tr><td>  Natural </td><td>  Artificial </td><td>  Direct display </td><td>  Generalizing </td></tr><tr><td>  Physical </td><td>  Technical </td><td>  Mathematical models </td><td>  Conceptual models </td></tr><tr><td>  Biological </td><td>  Social </td><td>  Logic-heuristic models </td><td>  Languages </td></tr><tr><td>  Organizational and technical </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  The main criteria for typing systems </h2><p>  There is a categorization regarding interaction with the external environment, structure and spatio-temporal characteristics.  Evaluation of the functionality of systems can be made according to the following criteria (see table). </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Criteria </p></td><td><p>  Classes </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Interaction with the external environment </p></td><td><p>  Open - interacting with the external environment </p><p>  Closed - showing resistance to environmental influences </p><p>  Combined - contain both types of subsystems </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Integrity structure </p></td><td><p>  Simple - including a small number of elements and links </p><p>  Complex - characterized by heterogeneity of bonds, multiplicity of elements and a variety of structures </p><p>  Large - characterized by the multiplicity and heterogeneity of structures and subsystems </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Functions Performed </p></td><td><p>  Specialized - narrow specialization </p><p>  Multifunctional - structures that perform several functions simultaneously </p><p>  Universal (e.g. harvester) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  System development </p></td><td><p>  Stable - structure and functions are unchanged </p><p>  Developing - have high complexity, undergo structural and functional changes </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  System organization </p></td><td><p>  Well organized (you can pay attention to the properties of information systems, which are characterized by a clear organization and ranking) </p><p>  Poorly organized </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Complexity of system behavior </p></td><td><p>  Automatic - a programmed response to external exposure followed by a return to homeostasis </p><p>  Decisive - based on continuous responses to external stimuli </p><p>  Self-organizing - flexible reactions to external stimuli </p><p>  Anticipating - exceed the external environment in the complexity of the organization, is able to anticipate further interactions </p><p>  Transforming - complex structures not related to the material world </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  The nature of the relationship between the elements </p></td><td><p>  Deterministic - the state of the system can be predicted for any moment </p><p>  Stochastic - their change is random </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Managment structure </p></td><td><p>  Centralized </p><p>  Decentralized </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  System purpose </p></td><td><p>  Governing - the properties of the control system are reduced to the regulation of information and other processes </p><p>  Producing - characterized by the receipt of products or services </p><p>  Attendants - System Health Support </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  System Property Groups </h2><p>  A property is called some characteristic features and qualities of an element or integrity, which are manifested when interacting with other objects.  We can distinguish groups of properties characteristic of almost all existing communities.  In total, twelve general properties of systems are known, which are divided into three groups.  See the table for information. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  Properties of the system </caption><tbody><tr><td><p>  Static </p></td><td><p>  Dynamic </p></td><td><p>  Synthetic </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Integrity </p></td><td><p>  Functionality </p></td><td><p>  Emergence </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Openness </p></td><td><p>  Incentive </p></td><td><p>  Indivisibility into parts </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Internal heterogeneity of systems </p></td><td><p>  System variability over time </p></td><td><p>  Inertia </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Structured </p></td><td><p>  Existence in a Changing Environment </p></td><td><p>  Expediency </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Static Properties Group </h2><p>  It follows from the name of the group that the system has some features that are always inherent in it: at any specific time interval.  That is, these are the characteristics without which the community ceases to be such. </p><p>  <em>Integrity</em> is a property of the system that allows you to distinguish it from the environment, to determine the boundaries and distinguishing features.  Thanks to him, the existence of well-established relationships between elements at each allocated moment of time is possible, which allows to realize the goals of the system. </p><p>  <em>Openness</em> is one of the properties of the system, based on the law of the relationship of everything existing in the world.  Its essence is that it is possible to find connections between any two systems (both incoming and outgoing).  As you can see, upon closer examination, these interactions are different (or asymmetric).  Openness indicates that the system does not exist in isolation from the environment and exchanges resources with it.  The description of this property is usually called the ‚Äúblack box model‚Äù (with an input that indicates the influence of the medium on integrity, and output - the influence of the system on the environment). </p><p>  <em>Internal heterogeneity of systems.</em>  <em>As</em> an illustrative example, consideration is given to the properties of the human nervous system, the stability of which is ensured by a multilevel, heterogeneous organization of elements.  It is customary to consider three main groups: the properties of the brain, individual structures of the nervous system and specific neurons.  Information about the component parts (or elements) of the system allows you to create a map of hierarchical relationships between them.  It should be noted that in this case the ‚Äúdistinguishability‚Äù of the parts is considered, and not their ‚Äúseparability‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="terraquestint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="system element properties" class="if uuid-2388561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2388561.jpg"></div><p>  Difficulties in determining the composition of the system are for research purposes.  Indeed, one and the same object can be considered from the point of view of its value, functionality, complexity of the internal structure, etc. In addition to everything, the ability of an observer to find differences in system elements plays a big role.  Therefore, the model of the washing machine by the seller, technical worker, loader, scientist will be completely different, since the listed people consider it from different positions and with different set goals. </p><p>  <em>Structuring</em> is a property that describes the relationships and interactions of elements within the system.  The relationships and relationships of the elements make up the model of the system under consideration.  Due to structuredness, such a property of an object (system) as integrity is maintained. </p><h2>  Dynamic property group </h2><p>  If static properties are something that can be observed at any particular moment in time, then dynamic ones belong to the category of mobile, that is, manifest in time.  These are changes in the state of the system over a certain period of time.  A good example is the change of seasons on any observed site or street (static properties remain, but dynamic effects are visible).  What properties of the system belong to the group under consideration? </p><p>  <em>Functionality</em> - is determined by the impact of the system on the environment.  A characteristic feature is the subjectivity of the researcher in the allocation of functions, dictated by the goals.  So, the car, as you know, is a "means of transportation" - this is its main function for the consumer.  However, the buyer, when choosing, can be guided by such criteria as reliability, comfort, prestige, design, as well as the availability of related documents, etc. In this case, the multifunctionality of such a system as a machine and the subjectivity of priorities of functionality are revealed (since the future driver built his system of major, minor and minor functions). </p><p>  <em>Stimulability</em> - manifests itself everywhere as adaptation to external conditions.  A striking example is the properties of the nervous system.  The impact of an external stimulus or environment (stimulus) on the object contributes to a change or correction of behavior.  Pavlov I.P. described this effect in detail in his research, and in the theory of system analysis it is called stimulability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vivabem.uol.com.br" data-author=": Imagem: iStock, "><img itemprop="image" alt="properties of the nervous system" class="if uuid-2388566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2388566.jpg"></div><p>  <em>System variability over time.</em>  <em>If the</em> system is functioning, changes are inevitable both in interaction with the environment and in the implementation of internal connections and relations.  The following types of variability can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  high-speed (fast, slow, etc.); </li><li>  structural (changes in the composition, structure of the system); </li><li>  functional (replacing some elements with others or changing their parameters); </li><li>  quantitative (an increase in the number of structural elements that do not change it); </li><li>  qualitative (in this case, the properties of the system change with the observed growth or decline). </li></ul><p>  The nature of the manifestation of these changes may be different.  Mandatory is the condition for taking this property into account when analyzing and planning the system. </p><p>  <em>Existence in a changing environment.</em>  Both the system and the environment in which it resides are subject to change.  For the functioning of the integrity should be determined with the ratio of the rate of change of internal and external.  They may coincide, may differ (lead or lag).  It is important to correctly determine the ratio taking into account the characteristics of the system and the environment.  A good example is driving a car in extreme conditions: the driver acts either ahead of schedule or in accordance with the situation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nic022.deviantart.com" data-author=": nic022, "><img itemprop="image" alt="properties of linear systems" class="if uuid-2388645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2388645.jpg"></div><h2>  Synthetic Properties Group </h2><p>  Describes the relationship of the system and the environment in terms of a common understanding of integrity. </p><p>  <em>Emergence</em> - a word of English origin, translated as "arise".  The term designates the appearance of certain properties that appear only in the system due to the presence of bonds of certain elements.  That is, we are talking about the emergence of properties that cannot be explained by the sum of the properties of the elements.  For example, car parts cannot be driven, much less transported, but assembled into a system can be a means of transportation. </p><p>  <em>Inseparability into parts - this</em> property, according to the logic of things, follows from emergence.  Removing any element from the system affects its properties, internal and external relationships.  At the same time, the element ‚Äúsent for free swimming‚Äù acquires new properties and ceases to be a ‚Äúchain link‚Äù.  For example, a car tire on the territory of the former USSR often appears on flowerbeds, sports fields, bungees.  But removed from the car system, it lost its functions and became a completely different object. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nasa.gov" data-author=": Credits: NASA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="system object properties" class="if uuid-2388577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2388577.jpg"></div><p>  Inherence is the English term (Inherent), which translates as "an integral part of something."  The degree to which the elements are ‚Äúincluded‚Äù in the system determines the fulfillment by it of the functions assigned to it.  Using the example of the properties of elements in the periodic table of Mendeleev, one can verify the importance of taking into account inertness.  So, the period in the table is built on the basis of the properties of the elements (chemical), primarily the charge of the atomic nucleus.  The properties of a <span>periodic system</span> arise from its functions, namely, the classification and ordering of elements in order to predict (or find) new links. </p><p>  <em>Expediency -</em> any artificial system is created for a specific purpose, whether it is a solution to a problem, the development of predetermined properties, the release of the required products.  It is the goal that dictates the choice of the structure, composition of the system, as well as the relationships and relationships between internal elements and the external environment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ec.europa.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="properties of information systems" class="if uuid-2388548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66593/2388548.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article outlines twelve system properties.  The classification of systems, however, is much more diverse and is carried out in accordance with the goal pursued by the researcher.  Each system has properties that distinguish it from many other communities.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In addition, the listed properties can manifest themselves to a greater or lesser extent, which is dictated by external and internal factors. </font></font></p>
