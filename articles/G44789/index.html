    <p>  Light and airy flowers are made from thin corrugated paper.  They resemble their living prototypes as much as possible.  Yes, and color schemes from paper of such a plan are simple and understandable to anyone who wants to try themselves in this field of creativity. </p><p>  Thick office paper is great for origami flowers.  She holds her shape well.  And the bends on such paper are clear, which is very important for this art. </p><p>  Thick paper and cardboard are more reliable in the exterior decor.  They give a rougher texture, which is visible at a great distance. </p><p>  Below are some examples of <span>how to make flowers from paper</span> in stages.  After such a master class, any beginner needleworker will cope with the task. </p><h2>  Simple flowers </h2><p>  To create beauty, there is no need to use sophisticated techniques.  <span>Paper flowers,</span> large and small, are made approximately according to the same pattern.  Here is one of the easiest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cut off a long and narrow strip of paper.  Fold it with an accordion.  Exactly in the middle of the strip we make a bend and fold it in half.  We cut off the free edges in a semicircle or teeth.  In the place of the bend we bind tightly with a thread and straighten the free ends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers from paper bouquets" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749554.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  From the resulting pompom we form a voluminous flower, which will be an excellent decoration for any banquet hall. </p><p>  This blank can be planted on a sturdy hard stalk, then you get a bouquet of flowers from paper.  Or you can knit several flower pompons and get a beautiful voluminous garland as a result.  The main thing is to remember that such paper flower patterns are original in their simplicity. </p><h2>  Tassel flowers </h2><p>  That is the name of the second group, which combines the simplest <span>color schemes from paper.</span>  They are so called because of the assembly method.  At the base of the flower lies the same long narrow strip.  But now they don‚Äôt fold it in accordion, but turn it into a tube around the stalk.  Design options for the upper edge of the mass. </p><p>  You can simply stretch the edges a little if you use corrugated paper.  Get a lush clove.  If you turn the top edge into a tube, something like a rose will come out.  The edges can also be cut into thin and thick stripes.  All this gives flowers of different textures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper flower patterns" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749555.jpg" width="360"></div>

Collect them in a beautiful bunch for a problem, if you choose the right colors.  It will be not only an ordinary bouquet.  It will become a real decoration of the festive table and banquet hall. </p><h2>  Simple roses </h2><p>  No matter how much they say that any flowers are beautiful, roses always remain in the first place.  It seems that such a perfect work of nature is difficult to recreate artificially.  But styling under this form and creating a bouquet of flowers from paper, resembling roses, is very simple. </p><p>  The first version of this flower is made of thick colored paper.  To do this, you need a pencil, scissors, glue and a round shape.  First of all, we cut out a circle of relatively large diameter.  The more magnificent a flower is needed, the more the circle is cut.  We find its conditional center and draw a spiral so that the distances between the lines are approximately the same.  Cut the circle and turn the spiral from the edge to the center.  The end fastens with glue.  So the simplest rose is ready.  Its head can be used as an independent decorative element or attached to the stem and create a beautiful bouquet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper color schemes" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749553.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rose by the principle of brush </h2><p>  An even more elegant flower will turn out if you pay a little more attention to the creation and formation of petals.  One option is to recall paper color patterns that use the brush principle. </p><p>  The upper edge of the working strip is folded accordion, semicircular petals are cut.  This is best done on corrugated paper.  Then the strip is straightened, and each individual petal is formed, the edges are twisted, and the middle is stretched.  The strip is folded with a brush, and a simple rose is obtained.  So that she has a more natural look, it is worth spreading each petal and putting it as if it were lying in a living flower. </p><p>  If dense colored paper is used for such a craft, then the technique for working with it is slightly different.  Each petal is cut separately according to the pattern and is further formed in accordance with the natural form.  The upper edge is curled with scissors: if you rub several times along the seamy side with the cutting part, the paper itself will curl in this direction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="origami flower bouquet of paper" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749556.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <p>  The interior is convex using special spherical tools that push the paper through.  Collect each petal individually.  At the same time, they are ensured that they lie down in a natural order, slightly overlapping each other.  So you can get especially large bouquets. </p><h2>  Unusual master class </h2><p>  As already seen from the foregoing, it is <span>not</span> at <span>all difficult to</span> make flowers out of paper.  Bouquets of such a plan will become both a gift and decoration of the holiday.  There are several original techniques that are guaranteed to surprise people who saw such beauty. </p><p>  Curly curly flowers look very beautifully and festively on any table.  And they are made unusually simple. </p><p>  For work, prepare: glue, scissors, a thick stalk, multi-colored thick paper.  We prepare long and wide paper strips.  We cut them across into thin stripes, without cutting to the end of about 1 cm. This will be the base.  Next, we twist each narrow strip with the sharp side of the scissors.  Do not overdo it: 1-2 passes on paper are enough to get a beautiful, even curl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="large paper flowers" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749557.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  We begin to wrap the twisted workpiece around the stalk.  At the same time, we retreat from the previous skein about 0.7 cm. So we get a curly stick that resembles some kind of spring flower of a complex inflorescence.  We complement it with a brush of long green leaves, and the first element of the bouquet is ready. </p><h2>  A flower is almost a snowflake </h2><p>  Many of us, as a child, cut snowflakes before the New Year.  Folding them is easy.  First, a leaf in half, then again in half.  Next - 2 times per corner, we get a blank triangle.  Cut the bottom in a semicircle.  You can make several longitudinal sections.  We open the product - we have obtained a simple flower.  But this is not enough for a bouquet. </p><p>  We complicate the task by the fact that at the same time we take several multilayer napkins or other thin paper.  We are doing the same.  After the workpiece is straightened, we fasten its core with a stapler and straighten the petals.  It turns out a one-sided magnificent pompon.  A garland of such blanks perfectly complements a bouquet of paper flowers.  Especially if he lacks colorful airiness and splendor. </p><h2>  Flowers without scissors and glue </h2><p>  You can make a bouquet of flowers from paper using the origami technique.  Back at school, at work lessons, teachers showed how to make voluminous tulips.  Each of them at least once in his life gave such bouquets to his mother or sister. </p><p>  <span>Origami tulip is</span> folded in the following way.  We fold the square sheet of paper twice diagonally and iron the bends.  When the workpiece unfolds, it is necessary to fold diagonal bends between each other, while the part of the paper that is between them is sent inside the workpiece.  At the output we get a double triangle. </p><p>  We lift its free ends up and smooth in this position.  Next, the side parts are slightly bent towards the middle and inserted into each other, fixing the product.  The last step is to inflate the tulip and make it voluminous.  That's the whole paper flower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper flowers in stages" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/749558.jpg" width="348"></div>

    <h2>  Special durability </h2><p>  In the house, people often put flowers from paper.  Bouquets of such a plan do not require special care and are relatively long in any room.  It is so nice to see real beauty every day! </p><p>  Fresh flowers are able to please with aroma.  But at the same time, they tend to fade, which more than once saddened their owners.  In addition, paper flowers are also a concern for wildlife, which remains in a natural state and can develop further without human intervention. </p><p>  Paper flowers are an excellent substitute for living flowers, which are almost inferior to their natural prototypes, but have a number of advantages over them. </p>
