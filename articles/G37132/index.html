And today it is known worldwide as smoky quartz. </p><p>  Most often rauchtopaz occurs in the following color shades: golden gray, brown, dark purple and black.  Moreover, all minerals have a transparent texture.  Typically, the color saturation of the stone increases from the base to the top.  Until now, scientists have not been able to determine the cause of the appearance of a particular color of the mineral.  They believe that the color of the stone depends on the degree of its irradiation.  After all, natural quartz is found in granites, where a small amount of radiation is constantly present.  However, a huge number of minerals used in jewelry are irradiated artificially in order to obtain a smoky hue. </p><p>  The deposits of this stone are known in Spain, Brazil, the USA, Namibia, Madagascar, Germany, Russia and Japan.  This kind of quartz is found in nature in the form of crystals (translucent or transparent).  Forming druzes and splices of magnificent beauty, they can reach very large sizes (up to one meter).  Smoke quartz crystals weighing more than two tons were found by geologists.  This mineral is formed by the hydrothermal method under the influence of high pressure with the participation of aqueous hot solutions. </p><p>  Smoked quartz is similar in structure to <span>rock crystal,</span> amethyst and citrine.  It has long been noticed that this stone has the property of pleochroism, allowing it to change color from greenish to violet.  When exposed to high temperature (more than 300 degrees), rauchtopaz may lose its unique smoky hue. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For decades, the mineral has been used for jewelry.  Figures are made from it, which are then inserted into pendants, rings or cufflinks.  Smoky quartz is a relatively inexpensive and affordable gem.  Surprisingly beautiful crystals of the mineral are also used as decoration of expositions in mineralogical museums. </p><p>  <strong>Quartz properties</strong> </p><p>  The stone has truly amazing healing and magical qualities.  Since ancient times, people believed that rauchtopaz can save a person from various mental illnesses: depression, suicidal tendencies, <span>obsessions.</span>  It is believed that smoky quartz can protect against drug addiction, alcoholism and tobacco dependence.  This stone has the ability to cure diseases of the musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract, in addition, it restores potency in men. </p><p>  Rauchtopaz is a strong energy stone, which is often used in their rites by black magicians and psychics.  It is believed that this mineral is able to attract the forces of evil and the souls of dead people.  With it, you can predict the future and conduct meditation sessions. </p><p>  If rauchtopaz is used exclusively for good purposes, then it is able to have a positive effect on its owner.  It is believed that this stone can make a person stronger and more self-confident, helps to overcome various difficulties and obstacles encountered in life, gives energy, happiness and joy.  In addition, the mineral has a unique ability to remove toxins and toxins from the body.  And this is not all the properties that quartz possesses. </p><p>  Since ancient times, the mineral has been used as <span>amulets and talismans.</span>  It is believed that rauchtopaz can endow its owner with centuries-old wisdom, relieve malice, envy and bad thoughts, strengthen natural inclinations. </p><p>  <strong>Who is this stone for?</strong> </p><p>  Quartz jewelry will benefit not all zodiac signs.  The positive effect of this stone can only affect Libra and Scorpions.  All other zodiac signs are recommended to be worn only for medicinal purposes.  This stone is completely contraindicated for cancer. </p>
