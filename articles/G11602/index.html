    <p>  It is believed that Ayia Napa is a holiday for gourmets, beach people and inveterate party-goers.  In this ultra-modern city of contrasts, restless restaurant and club life mixed with the religious sights of hoary antiquity.  But people who want a relaxed and serene pastime should also come.  Here, in all its fullness, the joy of the long-awaited vacation will be felt both by young people and families with children, single travelers and elderly tourists.  The main thing is to correctly develop a route along which you will get acquainted with this truly paradise, and also choose a suitable place to stay. </p>

    <p>  Guests could not see cockroaches and ants in the room, which they are certainly glad about.  The authors of numerous reviews recommend that future guests include a fumigator at night to save themselves from mosquitoes. </p><p>  A huge minus of the hotel, vacationers consider poor soundproofing.  In the rooms where the bedroom windows face the road, it‚Äôs impossible to sleep, the residents share, it was impossible to feel that you were sleeping on the street.  There are fewer cars on the street at night.  Those who want to relax during the day are recommended to take earplugs, otherwise they will not fall asleep. </p><p>  Many vacationers here are pleased with spacious comfortable rooms of various categories and the presence of pleasant friendly staff. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  A local breakfast usually consists of fried eggs, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, cereal, rolls, sausages, ham and instant coffee.  The cost of breakfast is 7.5 euros (513.30 rubles), according to content, hotel guests share it, it is quite decent. </p><p>  Many vacationers take the opportunity to purchase a tour to the hotel without providing meals.  In this case, you can eat in a cafe or cook yourself. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists recommend settling in the "Senator" for those who like hiking or planning to rent a car, since the hotel is quite far from the beaches. </p><p>  According to numerous reviews of vacationers, the beaches in Ayia Napa are not only very clean and safe for swimming, they are also surprisingly beautiful - in the daytime there are white and turquoise colors, and in the evening, during sunset, they are dazzling orange.  In addition, on the whole island they are famous as the best in terms of entertainment: tourists here are available for fishing, diving, yachts, catamarans, jet skis, surfing, speedboating, etc. </p><p>  The coast of each beach town, according to reviews, is well-maintained: there is a shower, deck chairs, restaurants, umbrellas, rescue stations.  The beaches at the resort are sandy and fairly flat, according to tourists, which makes them completely safe for children.  The reviewers report that due to the presence of numerous bars on the coast, it is always quite noisy. </p><p>  Tourists say you can walk to one of the Katsarka beaches closest to the hotel in about 15 minutes. This beach is rocky, but has a sand entrance and stones all over the place.  Vacationers say that they once saw sea urchins here.  To the right is Pernera Beach.  Here, according to reviews, it is rather small, on the surface - sand and stones (small).  To get from the Senator Hotel on foot is also about 15 minutes. Swimming with a mask, here you can meet small fish.  To the most famous beach, Nissi beach, walk from the hotel for 30-40 minutes. </p><h2>  Supermarkets </h2><p>  Supermarkets of the city, tourists say, usually sell alcohol, souvenirs, soft drinks, as well as tanning products.  The choice of products in them is minimal, but you won‚Äôt be hungry, the authors of the reviews assure.  You just should not expect much variety, as in Moscow.  Even the smallest Moscow supermarket, vacationers share, is a paradise compared to the shops in Ayia Napa.  Tourists call Best Buy Supermarket the best grocery store within walking distance on the way to Limanaki Beach.  Prices, vacationers say, in local supermarkets, like in Moscow.  Ayia Napa, the review authors conclude, the most expensive Cypriot resort. </p><h2>  What is worth visiting here? </h2><p>  The authors of the reviews report that this resort is the best suited for lovers of club life and noisy social events.  In many cafes, bars, restaurants and clubs of Ayia Napa, DJs of world renown play every night. </p><p>  They usually concentrate in the areas of Grigoriou Afxention and Louka Louka, as well as around the central square.  There are also a large number of shops where you can buy very nice souvenirs.  The authors of the reviews claim that it is impossible to get bored in Ayia Napa.  In the central square, located about 500 meters from the Senator Hotel, which can be reached on foot in 10-15 minutes, open-air concerts (free) are regularly held.  For lovers of ethnic art and just wanting to have fun, this is a good opportunity to enjoy the Cypriot national dances, including the famous dance with glasses.  Festivals and holidays are held regularly in the city. </p><p>  For tourists who come with children, the authors of the reviews recommend visiting Luna Park, visiting WaterWorld, a theme water park that is considered one of the largest in Europe, as well as the Museum of Marine Life.  Tourists are advised by sightseeing lovers to visit the most beautiful place on the island of Cyprus - Cape Greco, which is located 10 minutes.  drive from the center. </p><p>  Tourists also recommend visiting the monastery of the XVI century., Where you can admire the courtyard equipped in the rock.  Fans of historical values ‚Äã‚Äãwill also be interested in the People's Museum with its collection of ancient tools. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  The minus tourists consider that the Internet in the hotel works exclusively in the lobby, unfortunately, in the rooms, according to the authors of the reviews, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt‚Äù.  Internet cards are paid - 10 euros (684.40 rubles) for a couple of hours.  But in 5 minutes.  walk from the hotel, tourists share, an Internet cafe is located, where 30 min.  Internet usage costs 1 euro (68.44 rubles) </p><p>  Another minus the authors of the reviews called the significant remoteness of the hotel from the beaches.  To the best beach in the city, Nissi Beach, it‚Äôs far to walk on foot, a bus costs 1.5 euros (102.66 rubles), a taxi costs 8 euros (547.52 rubles). Most vacationers do not consider this disadvantage of the hotel . </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the guests conclude that the hotel is consistent with its category. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many call it very worthy and plan on arriving next time to stay here.</font></font></p>
