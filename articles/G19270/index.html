    <p>  For twenty-two years, the institution has been seeking funds and promoting projects in the field of humanitarian disciplines.  In the nineties, socio-economic and political problems were more acute, therefore, interest in these sciences was slightly lost. </p><p>  However, the fund continued to develop.  Experts worked hard on their work, because they understood that the practical value of their research would be appreciated a little later.  And indeed, now, thanks to the development of innovative technologies, science has begun to play a key role in the life of modern people (especially youth). </p><p>  However, on February 29, 2016, the organization became part of the Russian Foundation for <span>Basic Research.</span>  It was not liquidated and the institution continues its activities, but already as a division of the Russian Federal Property Fund.  This fund is engaged in similar work, only in a wider range of areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The institution provides assistance in organizing field work, sending scientific expeditions to research sites.  The Russian State Humanitarian Fund can help promote scientific and restoration work. </p><p>  The organization is looking for the best experimental laboratories for its members.  This type of activity also includes the collection and analysis of statistical information and modeling processes. </p>
