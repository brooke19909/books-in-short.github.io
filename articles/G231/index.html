  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Characteristics of taxes: functions, methods and principles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The tax system is a set of taxes and fees levied on citizens and organizations according to the procedure laid down in law.  The need to characterize the tax system follows from the fundamental tasks of the country.  The historical features of the development of the state determine each stage of development of the fiscal tax system.  The structure, <span>organization, characteristics of the</span> tax system of the state indicate the level of its development in the field of economy.  In this article we will talk about the current fiscal taxation in our country.  We give and describe a brief description of state taxes. </p><h2>  Tax Principles </h2><p>  The main dogmas of building a fiscal system in Russia are determined by the main law in tax legislation - the Code.  In Russia, there is a tax system consisting of three levels: </p><ul><li>  federal; </li><li>  regional; </li><li>  local. </li></ul><p>  The tax code, which is currently the main legislative document on fiscal fees, consists of two parts that describe: </p><ul><li>  the main principles of the system of taxes and fees; </li><li>  relations between citizens, organizations and the state on specific types of payments. </li></ul><h2>  Tax principles </h2><p>  The effectiveness of the fiscal system is ensured by strict observance of tax rules laid down in the law.  The functioning of many existing tax systems is based on four basic principles: </p><ul><li>  Justice. </li><li>  Certainty. </li><li>  Convenience. </li><li>  Saving. </li></ul><p>  The principles of the system of taxes and fees in our country are formulated in the first part of the Code.  The third article of this part describes the main characteristics of taxes and fees: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  All payers must pay statutory taxes. </li><li>  Fiscal fees should not discriminate against or infringe on anyone's rights. </li><li>  It is not possible to set different rates of taxes and fees or fiscal benefits depending on the property or citizenship of individuals. </li><li>  Taxes must be justified. </li><li>  You can‚Äôt introduce taxes and fees that violate the economic space of the country. </li><li>  It is not allowed to levy taxes and fees that have the characteristics of the taxes of our country, but not provided for in fiscal legislation. </li><li>  When introducing taxes, all elements of fiscal taxation should be spelled out in the law. </li><li>  All disputed issues unaccounted for by law on taxes and fees accepted for execution are resolved in favor of the payer of the fee. </li></ul><h2>  Tax items </h2><p>  The definition of the concept of "tax" and a general description of taxes are presented in the eighth article of the Tax Code.  A tax is a mandatory fee paid by an organization or a citizen in the form of withdrawal to the treasury of their property rights, professional management or operational management of funds in order to ensure the activities of the country, municipalities. </p><p>  In law, all elements of the tax must be fixed: </p><ul><li>  subject; </li><li>  an object; </li><li>  base for tax; </li><li>  rate; </li><li>  period; </li><li>  privileges; </li><li>  accrual procedure; </li><li>  procedure and terms of payment. </li></ul><p>  The subject of fiscal tax is a person who is obliged to pay taxes to the state treasury.  Sometimes the tax may be shifted by the collection subject to another person.  This applies to indirect taxes.  The subject of tax is understood to be an individual who formally must pay it.  The carrier of the fiscal fee is the person who actually pays it.  This distinction plays an important role in the characterization of taxes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fiscal legislation established that the following are recognized as entities: </p><ul><li>  legal entities and citizens; </li><li>  individual business owners. </li></ul><p>  The object of fiscal taxation is an important characteristic of taxes and is a subject to taxation.  The following objects are legalized by fiscal legislation: </p><ul><li>  profit; </li><li>  cost of goods or services; </li><li>  total income of citizens; </li><li>  means of transport; </li><li>  property. </li></ul><p>  The base for tax is another cost, physical characteristic of taxes.  It serves to measure the object of fiscal taxation and is the value with which the tax is calculated. </p><p>  <span>The tax rate</span> is the value of fiscal accruals per unit of base for the calculation of tax. </p><p>  Tax rates are interest and solid.  Interest rates are tied directly to the calculation base.  Firm rates are set in absolute terms per unit of tax base. </p><p>  For the tax payment period, a year or other time period is taken, at the end of which the tax base is determined and the amount payable is calculated.  Each fiscal fee is assigned its own period, it can be a year, a quarter or another time period. </p><p>  The tax benefits are considered to be the benefits provided to certain categories of payers compared to other payers. </p><p>  To date, fiscal legislation provides for the following preferential system: </p><ul><li>  tax-free minimum; </li><li>  the ability to not pay taxes; </li><li>  decrease in rates; </li><li>  exemption from taxation of specific elements of the collection object. </li></ul><p>  In order for the object of taxation to be considered as such, the general characteristic of taxes must contain an indication that with the presence of this object the payer has obligations to pay them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Using the elements in fiscal legislation, a procedure is established that provides for a procedure for calculating fees.  The above elements are a general description of taxes. </p><h2>  Criteria for the operation of the tax system </h2><div class="photo" data-original="insolvencyadvice.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Country taxes." class="if uuid-2553864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2553864.jpg"></div><p>  Quality criteria, which are a common characteristic of the fiscal system: </p><ul><li>  Balance of the budget of the country. </li><li>  Efficiency.

An object is recognized as movable and immovable property of the organization, recorded on the balance sheet in the form of fixed assets. </li><li>  Property tax.  The fee will be calculated based on the average market value per square meter of real estate and taking into account the rate, which can vary from 0.1 to 2%. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.encyclopedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Property tax." class="if uuid-2555470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2555470.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Fiscal fees on the road.  This is a fee for damage to the tracks. </li><li>  Transport fiscal fee.  Tax levied on vehicle owners. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transport tax." class="if uuid-2555465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2555465.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Fiscal sales tax.

In the case of the introduction of a tax at the regional level on real estate on the territory of the subject, the effect of local fees on the property of citizens and land tax, which are the main sources of revenue to the budgets of the local level. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.classicandperformancecar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road tax." class="if uuid-2555468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72156/2555468.jpg"></div><p>  The characteristic of the taxes of the Russian Federation allows us to conclude that they, as a complex phenomenon, include a set of certain elements.  Each of which has an independent legal significance.  The Tax Code of the Russian Federation introduced a rule: the tax is considered established when the relevant fiscal legislation defines the essential elements of taxation.  This determines the legal characteristics of taxes.  In some cases, tax incentives may also provide for appropriate exemptions. </p><p>  A special fiscal regime is considered to be a special system of calculating and paying taxes and fees during a specific time period, applied in the manner established by the Tax Code and laws adopted in accordance with it. </p><p>  The concept of each element of fiscal collection is universal, it is used in processes by all states.  These elements have been used since the inception of the state. </p>
