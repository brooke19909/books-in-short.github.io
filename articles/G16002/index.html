Today, it occupies a leading position in terms of tourist attendance.  Nature generously endowed the kingdom of Southeast Asia with snow-white beaches, majestic waterfalls and quaint caves.  Man-made sights are also not inferior to them in beauty. </p><p>  In the article we will tell about the richness of nature in Thailand (photo is presented in the article) and its features. </p><h2>  Variety of nature </h2><p>  The exotic landscapes of Thailand attract with its amazing beauty and diversity.  In the territory of this fabulous kingdom there are lakes, waterfalls, mountains, jungles and rainforests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wallpaperup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Natural Wonders of Thailand" class="if uuid-3020171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3020171.jpg"></div><p>  The state is located on two peninsulas: Malay and partially Indochina.  The shores are washed by the Andaman and Indo-Chinese seas. </p><p>  The nature of Thailand is amazing and attractive.  Nature reserves and numerous national parks are located throughout the territory.  This makes it possible to admire the most diverse parts of the state. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Exotic kingdom gives not only nature.  The climate in Thailand is tropical.  In total there are three seasons of the year: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The cold period lasts from May to November (monsoons bring heavy rains). </li><li>  Warm period, covering the period from November to March (no rains). </li><li>  The Thai summer, starting in March and ending in May (very hot weather). </li></ol><h2>  Wildlife of thailand </h2><p>  The jungle in this country occupies more than half of the state (60%).  These are real thickets of red and teak, ficus and palm trees, bamboo and xylia, as well as wild flowers and all kinds of fruit trees. </p><p>  In total, more than 500 species of trees and 25,000 flowers grow here.  The richness and diversity of vegetation determines the abundance of animals. </p><p>  The fabulously beautiful nature of Thailand is superbly complemented by numerous species of exotic birds (more than 1000), including flamingos and parrots of various sizes and colors. </p><h2>  Nature reserves and national parks </h2><p>  These zones make up the country's pride.  In total, over 50 protected areas and parks are located in the kingdom, occupying an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25,000 square meters.  km </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inafarawayland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Erawan National Park" class="if uuid-3020174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3020174.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most popular is the Erawan National Park, which consists of seven tiers.  On its territory there is a waterfall of the same name, impressive with its wild beauty.  It is located in the province of Chiang Mai, on a mountainous plot of which the peaks rise to an altitude of 2,565 meters above sea level.  At about 1,800 meters, beautiful forests grow with wild orchids and lichens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Khao Yai is another park that gives you the opportunity to see the unique nature of the exotic state and the animals living in it.  It is located 200 kilometers from Bangkok.  There are also some wonderful waterfalls.  Tourists have the opportunity to independently explore the tops of the mountains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thailand-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Khao Yai Park" class="if uuid-3020175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3020175.jpg"></div><h2>  Vegetation and its use on the farm </h2><p>  The nature of Thailand is very diverse and rich in vegetation.  Valuable species of deciduous trees grow here: mahogany, bamboo and lard.  Residents of local villages are engaged in the extraction of wood tar, balsam, gum and varnish. </p><p>  The leading place in the agricultural sector belongs to the processing of sago and coconut palms.  The fruits are used for food, and from the rest of the plant, local residents build houses and pens for themselves. </p><p>  Teak wood is used to build ships.  This is a unique building material with increased strength.  It is practically not subject to decay. </p><p>  Oak and pine groves grow on the tops of the mountains.  It is noted that during heavy monsoon rains pandanus, ficus and palm trees increase in height by several tens of centimeters.  An amazing density of thickets in these places is also associated with this. </p><h2>  Fauna of Thailand </h2><p>  Thanks to the rich nature of Thailand, many mammals have found refuge here.  The official symbol of the country is the Indian elephant, which once inhabited almost the entire territory.  In the process of development of civilization, these animals began to be exterminated in huge quantities.  Today, in the wild, they live only on the peninsular part of Central Thailand and on the southeast coast.  In the western part of the island you can see several species of macaques, and the Indian tiger is the owner of the local jungle.  Leopards and panthers are also found here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.petaasia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inhabitant of thailand" class="if uuid-3020179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3020179.jpg"></div><p>  Mangrove swamps and forests of Western Thailand - the birthplace of a rare wyverra cat.  Here you can also find the reed cat, tapir, deer, binturong, rhinoceros and many other animals. </p><h2>  Underwater world </h2><p>  Talking about the nature of Thailand, it is impossible not to mention the underwater world of this fabulously beautiful state.  Holidays for lovers of beach holidays and divers will enjoy their stay here. </p><p>  Tarutao National Park, located in Satun Province, is a great place for snorkeling.  Its territory unites 51 islands.  Another magnificent marine park is located in the province of Surat Thani. </p>
