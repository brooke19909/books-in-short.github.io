    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth saying a few words about what comments are left about the Hotel Splendid Conference Spa Resort complex.  Reviews of tourists are extremely positive, which is not surprising.  Many people come here for a beach holiday.  So, the staff for this provides everything you need - from sunbeds to towels.  And everything is always on time.  True, towels need to be taken before 7-8 pm, as the pool closes at 19:00.  Many note one more minus - you cannot bring your own food or water to the hotel.  But few people stop this, judging by the reviews, especially when it comes to Russian tourists.  Nobody looks into the bags, so it‚Äôs not difficult to carry what fits into them into the room. </p><p>  But there are many more advantages.  For example, if you want to see the sights and plunge into the hectic life of Montenegro, you need to go to Budva.  25 euros costs a taxi if ordered independently.  And through the reception - only 5 ‚Ç¨! </p><p>  Many more note the attention of good plumbing.  The rooms have very comfortable bathrooms, which easily fit a person of any complexion.  The shower is also spacious, it works without interruptions.  In general, everything corresponds to a 5-star level. </p><p>  Therefore, if you want to spend an unforgettable vacation in Montenegro, you should go to this hotel.  In any case, many tourists who have been here once decide to return.  After all, this is really one of the best Montenegrin hotels.  Those people who have something to compare with can confirm the veracity of this fact. </p>
