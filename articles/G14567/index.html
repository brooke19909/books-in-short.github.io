Nevertheless, this country, which has recently begun to enter the tourism industry on an international level, is loved by many Russians.  People come here for unique views, sunny weather, warm sea, unusual food for most of us, and, of course, impressions.  A hotel called Oriental Pearl Resort ex Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort, positioned by tour operators as a four-star hotel, will be an exotic addition for lovers of exotic.  It has been operating since 2006 and is considered quite new by local standards.  Despite this, the owner regularly updates, improves and changes something here.  Therefore, it seems to vacationers that everything in the hotel is as good as new.  Note that the name Oriental Pearl Resort was given to him in 2011, and before that it was known as Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort and SPA.  Many tourists still call it that.  In our article, we will also leave the old name so that there is no confusion with the material submitted. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Vietnam is one of the few states whose territory is several times longer than its width and at the same time is very elongated from north to south.  This causes a significant difference in climatic and environmental conditions in its regions.  Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort 4 * is located in the most favorable place for relaxation, namely in the southeastern part of the state, on the South China Sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1448075.jpg" width="519"></div>  The nearest town to the hotel is the town of Mui Ne, the center of which is less than 5 km away.  The larger city of Phan Thiet is located a little further, but also within reach.  It is 13 km away.  The unofficial <span>capital of Vietnam,</span> Ho Chi Minh City, is much further.  There are exactly 200 km to it along the highway, and to another major city and the famous resort of Nha Trang, all 250 km.  Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort on the coast is not alone.  There are other hotels next to it, but there are no places for entertainment here, only a few cafes.  Nearby is a road on which intercity buses run.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Basically organized, that is, through travel agencies, they go to rest in Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort 4 *.  Vietnam is a poor country, but there are many airports here.  Among them, the closest to the hotel are only two.  The first in Ho Chi Minh City.  It is called Tan Son Nhat, located on the outskirts of the city.  From here, the hotel turns out a little less than 215 km.  The second is in the village of Kamran, which is about 30 minutes by car from Nha Trang.  From there, the hotel is slightly closer than from Tan Son Nhat, namely 195 km.  That is, there is no huge difference in which of these two airports to take a ticket from Russia.  Of both, the trip to Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort with travel agency transfers takes more than 4 hours (taking into account the delivery of tourists to hotels along the way).  One must take into account, firstly, that in this region of Vietnam it is not cool even at night, and secondly, that the route passes through mountainous areas in some places with frequent turns, descents and climbs, which can cause difficulties for certain categories of tourists . </p><p>  If you decide to go to Vietnam on your own, there are several road options in Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort 4 *.  Phan Thiet does not have an international airport, although one can read on travel agency sites that it is there.  You can get to the city from Tan Son Nhat (airport in Ho Chi Minh City) by taxi, which will cost about the same as an official transfer to the hotel.  But you can get much cheaper.  The first way is by taxi for 15 y.  e. Or take a city bus for about 6 rubles (equivalent) to the center of Ho Chi Minh City, where at any travel agency you can get a ticket for a tourist bus that will take you not only to Phan Thien, but even to the hotel itself, as it should be in Mui Ne.  The second way is to take a taxi to the bus station in Ho Chi Minh City, take a shuttle bus, next to Phan Thiet bus station, and from there take a taxi again to the hotel.  The third way is to take the bus to the train.  Station of Ho Chi Minh City, take the train to Phan Thiet, and then take a taxi to the hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From the airport in Kamrani, the scheme is about the same, with the difference that you first need to come to Nha Trang, and then choose a taxi, bus or train. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1448074.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <h2>  Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort Hotel (Phan Thiet): Beach &amp; Sea </h2><p>  In Vietnam, you can relax, experience new sensations, get acquainted with local customs, enjoy the exotic.  But here is a classic ideal beach vacation to plan, perhaps, is not worth it.  The South China Sea is only conditional, but in fact it is simply a stretch of the ocean.  Therefore, here, in any season, winds blow, there are high waves (often start from lunch), you can always stumble upon painfully stinging jellyfish.  Another feature of the "Vietnamese" sea is that the water in it is not at all transparent, although it is warm all year round.  So divers will be bored here.  If these features are not a hindrance, a beach holiday at Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort turns out to be normal.  On the coast, the hotel owns a plot where they try to maintain cleanliness.  For its guests here, under palm trees and umbrellas made of palm leaves, free sunbeds are installed.  An unpleasant nuance - next to the beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel there is an orphan piece of the coast, where local residents arranged the parking of their fishing boats.  Here, the nets are dried and everything that turned out to be superfluous is thrown out. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort is located in the south of the country, where only summer is year-round.  Even at night, the air here never cools down to more than +25, and during the day it is difficult to find coolness even under the canopy of tropical trees.  However, the wind blowing almost constantly hides the heat a little and facilitates the fate of those who endure it heavily.  Spoil the rest in this region of the country can only rain, falling with varying intensity all year round.  But the period from the end of April to the last days of September is the rainiest.  In the so-called Vietnamese low season, rainfall can non-stop pouring from the sky for several days in a row.  However, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Mui Ne, and it is here where the hotel in question is located, the picture with the rains is more favorable for the spa people, as small deserts (red and white dunes) extend nearby.  The sand warms up there so much that the heat emanating from it prevents the formation of a large amount of precipitation.  That's why it is good to relax here in any season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1448072.jpg" width="527"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment outside </h2><p>  It is for the sake of impressions and exotic that they go to Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort 4 *.  Vietnam, including Phan Thiet, can offer a lot of new and interesting.  Since the open spaces of the sea are not limited by anything, sports associated with the movement of water through the wind (kiting, windsurfing) flourish in this resort.  Centers where they provide training and provide an opportunity to test themselves are located next to the hotel.  Gourmets will certainly enjoy walks in Bo Ke, where dozens of local cafes work for them, where any desired marine resident (sharks, snakes, turtles, etc.) is prepared right before his eyes.  Fans of sights and simply the beauty of nature will be interested in going to the red and white dunes located just 6 km from the hotel, visiting Phan Thiet, admiring the <span>Chama towers,</span> the reclining Buddha, the Kega lighthouse, the red canyon and <span>the lotus lake.</span> </p><p>  Well, those who are not afraid of long roads can go to Ho Chi Minh City, Hue, Nha Trang on their own (or better with a guide), visit the ruins of Mishon, the Cham Museum and even the forbidden city called Purple. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of tourists really like a vacation at Phan Thiet resort.  The Hoang Ngoc Beach Resort Hotel pleases guests with the provided service, the opportunity to have a carefree and pleasant time.  Noted advantages: </p><p>  - gorgeous territory (especially exotic plants and ponds with fish); </p><p>  - staff who speaks good English, which allows you to quickly and easily resolve any issue; </p><p>  - excellent rooms (everything is new, beautiful, everything works, large windows, wonderful views, cleanliness); </p><p>  - delicious food, lots of fruits; </p><p>  - free Wi-Fi; </p><p>  - proximity to the beach; </p><p>  - professionalism of workers and high hospitality. </p><p>  Noted disadvantages: </p><p>  - a very long way from the airport; </p><p>  - noisy work of maids in the morning (wake up); </p><p>  - surcharge for changing the room (3 cu for standard and 10 cu for suite and deluxe per day); </p><p>  - remoteness of the hotel from the city and places of entertainment; </p><p>  - dirty sea; </p><p>  - the hotel sometimes hosts the local population too noisy corporate parties. </p>
