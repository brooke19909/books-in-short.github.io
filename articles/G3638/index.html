    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  A miniature and very pretty hotel Morjim Resort 3 * is causing a lot of pleasant impressions.  Reviews about him highlight the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  a nice, clean and spacious pool in the courtyard of the hotel (the smell of chlorine is practically absent); </li><li>  hotel workers take good care of the lawn and green spaces (constantly watered and maintain a neat shape); </li><li>  sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach can be used free of charge, provided that food or drinks are ordered in the cafes to which they belong; </li><li>  the restaurant can make freshly squeezed juice from the fruits you bought; </li><li>  some rooms are in good repair; </li><li>  a lot of interesting and necessary services: rent a car, massage, call a taxi and more. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Speaking of comments on the work of this hotel, it is worth noting the following points: </p><ul><li>  the path to the sea goes along a busy roadway, where there is absolutely no sidewalk on which it would be safe to move around; </li><li>  since the cottages are built of bamboo, there are a lot of insects, and in some rooms you can also see huge rats; </li><li>  reception staff are indifferent to the guests' requests and treat them rather unkindly; </li><li>  a very modest breakfast menu, which includes only scrambled eggs, some kind of toast with butter, as well as tea or coffee; </li><li>  the rooms are very dusty and dirty, and on bedding there is a lot of hair left over from previous guests, and cleaning is rarely and not too thorough; </li><li>  incredibly small and well-groomed territory, on which there is even nowhere to walk; </li><li>  due to the fact that the hotel is located in a lowland area, it is very damp and there is a huge number of mosquitoes; </li><li>  despite the fact that the brochures indicate the presence of wireless Internet, in fact, it almost never works; </li><li>  frequent power outages and hot water; </li><li>  there are no closets in the rooms, nowhere to put things (there are only a couple of hangers); </li><li>  dirty linens and towels, for the replacement of which maids require money; </li><li>  stale food in the restaurant - there are many cases of poisoning, and the prices in it are an order of magnitude higher than in the surrounding establishments. </li></ul>
