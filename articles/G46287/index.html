Therefore, competitions were organized everywhere in various sports disciplines.  Most often, events of this kind were held in special complexes.  One of the most famous of its kind is the Rowing Canal in Moscow.  About the history of its occurrence, description and an approximate route to it, read the article. </p><h2>  Water sports in the USSR </h2><p>  In the Soviet Union, water sports were extremely popular.  In Moscow of that period there were a considerable number of pools and other structures in which one could swim.  Rowing was done on the banks of the Moscow River and the Khimki reservoir.  There were special rowing clubs in which there was a place for storing boats.  Even the ice had not completely left the water surface, and the rowers had already begun training. </p>

    <p>  Over time, there was a need for the construction of a more modern complex, in which competitions of international level could be held.  Such a construction implied the availability of the latest infrastructure necessary for practicing one or another kind of water sports.  So, in August 1973, the <span>Rowing Canal</span> was built in Krylatsky (Moscow), <strong> </strong>  which subsequently hosted the <span>Rowing Championship.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Complex </h2><p>  Krylatskoye is an <span>Olympic training and sports</span> center, which is a complex of several buildings for various purposes.  Its most important component, of course, is the Rowing Canal itself (Moscow).  It stretched from the village of Tatarovo to the village of Krylatskoye. </p><p>  In addition, the complex includes a grandstand for 3400 spectators, a separate building with a swimming pool.  There is also a hotel for athletes, several gyms and even a museum of rowing sports.  Boats are stored in a boathouse with nineteen boxes. </p>

    <h2>  Channel description </h2><p>  The architect of this building was Kuzmin.  The channel has a length of 2340 meters.  Its width is 125 meters and a depth of 3.5 meters at the start.  At the finish line, she is 50 centimeters less.  The rowing canal in Moscow was designed in such a way that it consisted of two channels.  It was an absolutely innovative decision of the architect.  The main course was intended for competitions in speed of rowing and canoeing.  The second is intended for departure to the place of launch, that is, it is returnable.  Both channels are suitable for relay races and marathons. </p>

    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  In the 1960s, the first work began on laying the Rowing Canal (Moscow).  Construction led to the disappearance of several villages and villages from the map.  In 1972, some settlements were demolished, and at the turn of 1978 and 1979 the village of Krylatskoye disappeared, after which the whole complex was named.  Local residents were resettled in Setun or Chertanovo.  Currently, a business center is located in the village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  About half a century has passed since the construction of the Rowing Canal.  Since then, significant sporting events have been held here more than once, for example, the 1980 Olympic Games, as well as the Goodwill Games.  Every year, the Great Moscow Regatta is held on the territory of the complex.  Interestingly, not only rowers, but also cyclists competed: for them, bicycle paths were laid, as well as a path in the hilly area.  Between the bike paths and the canal was a field intended for archery. </p>

    <h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  In August 2014, the largest competitions after the Olympic games of the 80s were held on the territory of the Rowing Canal.  It was the World Championship in kayaking and canoeing.  To create all the necessary conditions for the competition, a reconstruction was carried out.  Work on updating the complex was carried out in a very short time, since in the winter of 2011-2012 there were very severe frosts.  However, the reconstruction was completed successfully, despite time constraints and difficulties in construction. </p><p>  Not only the main stands and the information board were transformed, but also the island between the canals, the racetracks were updated, a new bridge was built across the channel.  The camera installed here is ‚Äúrunning‚Äù, that is, it moves after the athletes and transmits the image in real time.  Since the Rowing Canal is located on the territory of the park, all work was carried out without harmful effects on the environment. </p><h2>  The route to the canal in the USSR </h2><p>  During the Soviet Union, when the Rowing Canal was being built, the capital was not so densely built up as it is now.  Therefore, getting to the Krylatskoye complex was not particularly difficult.  This could be done using public transport, such as bus or metro. </p><p>  Rowing canal in Moscow <strong> </strong>  became the venue for the 1980 Olympic Games.  Everywhere hung memos for the audience, on which you could see the approximate location of the complex relative to the metro stations.  It was proposed to go to the Molodezhnaya station, and there it was not difficult to get to Krylatsky. </p><p>  One could find the buildings of the complex by a high column with pictograms.  Drawn symbols of water sports, which could be viewed from all sides, were installed near <span>sports facilities.</span>  The pillar has survived to the present day. </p>

    <h2>  Metro </h2><p>  How to get to the Rowing Canal in Moscow?  Closest to the complex are metro stations such as Molodezhnaya and Krylatskoye.  The Molodezhnaya station was not far from the canal during the time of its construction.  So she is called the first, telling how to get to the Rowing Canal.  The Krylatskoye station, of course, is slightly younger, bears the same name as the complex, which includes the canal, and is located quite close to it. </p><h2>  Public transport </h2><p>  You can get to the Grebnoy Canal (Moscow) not only by metro, but also by public transport, for example, by bus or trolleybus.  So, there are two stops that are located very close to the complex.  These are the Krylatsky Bridge and the Rowing Canal.  Buses No. 229 or No. 829 run to the second stop from both metro stations.  You can get to the Krylatsky Bridge public transport stop by bus No. 391 or No. 691 from Molodezhnaya metro station.  If you prefer trips on a trolley bus, then route No. 19 is suitable for you.  This transport travels from the Krylatskaya metro station.  Thus, we answered the question of how to get to the Rowing Canal (Moscow). </p>
