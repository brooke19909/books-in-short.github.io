Sights of Yaroslavl</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably everyone has heard about the Golden Ring of Russia: Yaroslavl, Vladimir, Rostov, Kostroma, Ivanovo, Suzdal, Sergiev Posad, Pereslavl-Zalessky.  This route is very popular among ordinary travelers, as well as among pilgrims and architecture lovers.  Each of these cities is interesting in its own way, and each of them is easily accessible from Moscow.  But today it‚Äôs worth talking about the unofficial capital of this route, which all of Russia is proud of - Yaroslavl. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Almost everyone knows the <span>expression "bear angle", meaning a</span> remote province where there are not even basic amenities.  But few will explain where it came from.  Previously, the pagan settlement, which was located near the confluence <span>of the Kotorosl River</span> into the Volga, on the site of modern Yaroslavl, was called the Bear Corner.  At that time, the role of the capital was played by Rostov the Great, built on the same river, so from the point of view of trade and <span>military strategy</span> it was a very advantageous location.  Yaroslav, nicknamed the Wise Prince of Rostov, decided to erect a fortress on this site, so he captured and burned the settlement, ruining pagan temples.  He gave her a name in his name - Yaroslavl, and the bear became the emblem, which was worshiped by the people who lived there before.  This happened at the beginning of the XI century, so the official year of the founding of the city is 1010.  In 1218, it became the center of the Yaroslavl principality, and after another 250 years - part of Moscow.  Prince Minin and citizen Pozharsky began to collect the <span>people's militia in</span> order to expel the Polish invaders in Nizhny Novgorod, and continued here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the city has pagan roots, in the 13th century it became the center of Christianity.  Many churches and monasteries were built here.  After the founding of St. Petersburg, the importance of Yaroslavl as a shopping center was somewhat lost, but industry began to develop. </p><h2>  Modern city </h2><p>  Now Yaroslavl is the capital of the region with a population of about 500 thousand people, combining the responsibility of a living architectural monument and a dynamically developing center of the region.  Location and transport accessibility make logistics convenient, but, as in most regions of Russia, the city has practically stopped developing.  Nowadays, only the recreational segment can be called more or less successful, by the thousandth birthday several parks were opened, and other refining works were carried out.  Now it is included in the so-called Golden Ring of Russia.  Yaroslavl is popular both among foreigners and among compatriots, but it is not so big as to stay here for a long time, although it has a certain charm that makes you come back again and again. </p>

    <h2>  The main attractions </h2><p>  <span>Churches of Yaroslavl are</span> famous all over the world, and not in vain.  Most of them are concentrated in the center, in the old part of the city.  A beautiful view of them also opens from pedestrian routes, but from a ship standing on the roadstead, the picture looks even more spectacular.  The two main streets of Yaroslavl are, perhaps, its embankments.  The promenade, located along the Volga, attracts many people walking, especially since at its end, in the bend, on the site of the almost completely destroyed Chopped Town, is the Assumption Cathedral, which was restored in 2010.  In front of him is a sculptural image of the Trinity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Here, on the Volga embankment, is located one of the symbols of the city - a snow-white gazebo, built in 1840.  The streets of Yaroslavl have been preserved almost in their original form, they were little affected by industrial development and modern buildings.  Moving to the city center, on the Epiphany Square you can see a monument to Yaroslav the Wise, whose graphic image is on a banknote of 1000 rubles.  Residents of the city jokingly sometimes call him "a man with a cake."  Nearby, a little closer to the Kotorosli embankment, is the Transfiguration Monastery.  In general, Orthodox churches are here at every step: Michael the Archangel, <span>Elijah the Prophet,</span> John the Baptist, St. Nicholas the Wet, Epiphany, the Nativity of Christ, etc. </p>

    <p>  By the way, the theaters of Yaroslavl have the richest and longest history in Russia, because this type of art went exactly from here.  The first drama troupe was created in the XVIII century, after its founder - Fedor Volkov - visited St. Petersburg.  There he saw the performance of the Italian theater and set out to develop this kind of art in his homeland. </p><p>  Yaroslavl is not in vain in the Golden Ring of Russia.  No wonder it is also considered its capital - the historical center of the city is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  So it‚Äôs worth a visit here anyway. </p>

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  The theaters of Yaroslavl and its monuments are, of course, interesting, but for those traveling with children, especially young ones, other entertainments are necessary.  They are in the city - one of the best zoos in Russia opened here several years ago.  As of 2015, it is still partially being completed, but after completion of all work, a safari park will be located here and more than one and a half thousand different exotic animals will settle.  The advantage of this park is that the animals do not live in cramped cages, but in enclosures, that is, conditions that are as close to natural as possible.  Younger visitors will love it here. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Yaroslavl is still very conveniently located.  From Moscow, you can get to it by car, bus, train, as well as water transport.  The latter, by the way, is very popular in the summer, because from the ship you can even look at the familiar city in a completely new way. </p>

    <p>  The road takes relatively little time - rarely exceeds 6 hours, even taking into account traffic jams and stops.  The advantage of the car in this case is the ability to wrap, for example, in Rostov the Great or in Pereslavl-Zalessky, which are also part of the Golden Ring route. </p><h2>  When to go? </h2><p>  Of course, the entire Golden Ring of Russia (Yaroslavl, Rostov, Kostroma, etc.) is very beautiful in winter, when the <span>domes of churches are</span> covered with snow, and the frost makes you feel the real Russian winter.  But in the summer, these cities look no worse.  The advantage of the warm season is that you can choose a water route, and ferries across the Volga also work, with which it is much easier to get to cities of the Yaroslavl region, such as Tutaev, Myshkin and Uglich, also included in the "golden route" as additional points. </p>
