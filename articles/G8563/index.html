There is a fashionable tendency among residents of the metropolis to sell their existing housing in the capital and to purchase in those complexes that are being built in the near Moscow suburbs.  Thus, many of them move to areas with a more favorable environmental situation, new homes and still leave money for themselves to purchase, for example, cars.  This <span>residential complex,</span> ideal for relocation, is ‚ÄúSuburb.  Forest ".  Reviews about it are still few, since the construction of the facility has not yet been completed. </p>

    <h2>  Misailovo Village </h2><p>  Leninsky district of the Moscow region includes such a settlement as the village of Misailovo.  There is not much population in it.  Just a little more than three hundred people as of 2005.  But since it is in this area that there are land plots suitable for large-scale projects, one of which is the described residential complex, the developers often choose them.  Moreover, if you drive a little further along the Volodarskoye Highway, you can see another large complex - Novo-Molokovo, in the territory of which there is even a hospital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Misailovo is a small village.  Almost all the necessary infrastructure is located in a little distance from the village - Molokovo.  It is also small - about two thousand people, but everything you need for life is in it. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  You can get to the village of Misailovo along Kashirskoye Shosse, driving from MKAD on your own or public transport a little more than 4 km and turning left onto Volodarskoye Shosse.  And right next to the first bend of the highway you can get into the residential quarter ‚ÄúSuburb.  Forest ".  From the Domodedovo metro station, the journey will take approximately 25 minutes.  Kashirskoye highway is one of the most free routes that owners of their own cars will like.  In the future, the developer plans to build a broadband highway connecting the residential district with Domodedovo highway. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  LCD "Suburb.  Forest "from" Plane Development "- a large-scale project under construction in the Leninsky district of the Moscow region.  The project provides for the construction of almost an entire small town.  On 375 hectares of allocated land will appear 144 houses of different floors in total for 72 thousand apartments.  Moreover, 5 thousand will be built as part of the first phase of construction.  Everything that is necessary for a normal comfortable life (social, domestic infrastructure, transport links) will also be implemented by the developer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A total of 13 construction phases are foreseen, the first of which is for the Prigorod.  Lesnoe ‚Äù(Moscow region) includes ten residential buildings, each of which rises to a height of as many as 17 floors.  Importantly, all apartments are fully finished. </p>

    <h2>  Building buildings and deadlines </h2><p>  A little bit about building buildings.  The first of them is a 7-section rectangular building with 560 one-room and 224 three-room apartments.  As is customary with most developers, the first floors are reserved for non-residential premises.  Their body will consist of twenty one compartment.  The second building will be 6-section.  705 one-room apartments are designed in it, and the first floor will also go into office premises.  And finally, the third building, this is a residential building of five sections, in which 417 apartments (253 one-room and 164 two-room), and non-residential premises.  Apartments in these buildings are sold, and therefore has already received "Suburb.  Forest "reviews of residents. </p><p>  Such a large-scale project, as designed by ‚ÄúSuburb.  Forest "requires, accordingly, a lot of time for its implementation.  The first phase, consisting of 5192 apartments will be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017.  The handing over of the keys will be completed by February 2018.  The developer promises to build the entire project by 2029. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Information about the developer, assessment of its reliability </h2><p>  As for the developer, "Suburb.  Lesnoe ‚Äù, reviews, its description is not numerous.  This is Megagorod, which is owned by Mega-City LLC.  The organization was registered only four years ago and cannot boast of outstanding success and reliable reputation.  But the developer of the project is the Samolet Development company, and it, in turn, is widely known for large-scale construction projects: Lyubertsy 2015, Lyubertsy 2016, Oktyabrsky 2016, Vnukovo 2016.  Many of them have already been commissioned and are being settled by home buyers. </p><h2>  Developer Feature </h2><p>  The organization that ordered the construction of ‚ÄúSuburb.  Lesnoye ‚Äù,‚Äú Aircraft Development ‚Äù, reviews were positive.  For a relatively short time in the construction market, specifically since 2012, the company has already earned a reliable reputation.  Not even the company itself, since it was a novice in this field, and its general director was Igor Yevtushevsky, who was definitely not a novice.  His career has been known since 2003, when he appeared on the real estate market as the head of Vedis Development, after which he continued his career at St. Petersburg Renovation LLC. </p><p>  If we talk about the reputation of ‚ÄúAircraft Development‚Äù, then it is confirmed by already completed projects.  During construction, violation of the deadlines is not allowed.  Reviews about the new residential complex "Suburb.  Lesnoye ‚Äù, about those apartments that have already been commissioned, can only be negative in terms of the quality of their decoration.  Not always satisfactorily laid tiles in the bathroom and laminate on the floor.  Those who purchase apartments without finishing have no such complaints. </p>

    <p>  Assessment of the developer for reliability deserves 8 points on a 10-point scale.  The large project ‚ÄúLyubertsy 2015‚Äù, which has been commissioned, has no serious complaints and violations of deadlines.  Claims, as mentioned above, if presented, only for the quality of the interior decoration, that is, to the work of repair crews. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure facilities </h2><p>  About such an impressive construction project, which, as a result, ‚ÄúSuburb.  Lesnoye, ‚Äùreviews indicate that the development of the promised infrastructure is waiting for home buyers in it.  11 schools, 16 kindergartens (one for each quarter) should be built.  The first floors of the houses are made non-residential.  They will be given into ownership or lease for placement of beauty salons, pharmacies, bank branches, that is, residents of the complex will not need to go to the capital for bread: everything you need can be purchased in the complex itself.  Car owners will love parking. </p><h2>  Surrounding infrastructure </h2><p>  The village of Misailovo has a small chain store, a school, and a clinic.  But the number of seats and the possibility of adopting citizens are very limited.  And even more so, they are not designed for residents of the residential complex ‚ÄúSuburb.  Forest ".  Reviews say that the need to build their own infrastructure is very high, since the village cannot provide the necessary level of service. </p><p>  This despite the fact that Misailovo and nearby Molokovo are actively being built up.  The indicated residential complex is not one there.  In the future, the development of territories by residential houses is also likely, because the area is too attractive for developers. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  It is not without reason that the developer chose the area just beyond the MKAD for his large-scale project, but not so remote.  The lack of such a number of cars, as in a megalopolis, significantly improves the air, and the residents of the "Suburb.  Lesnoye, whose reviews confirm this, you can fully enjoy your lungs with fresh, delicious air. </p>

    <p>  <span>The residential complex</span> is surrounded by many green areas, which influenced its name.  The word "Forest" is included in the name of the complex in connection with its location among the forest. </p><p>  The environmental situation is influenced by the nearby river Ludovka and ponds.  Airplanes, as in other areas, do not fly overhead, there are no industrial enterprises nearby, there is nothing to poison the environment, the busy highway is at some distance, so it is safe to say that the environmental situation for the residents of the complex is very favorable.  Breathing a working day in the capital of exhaust gases, residents of the complex will strive home to breathe clean air. </p><h2>  Layout of apartments and their cost </h2><p>  In the complex, the developer provides one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments.  The smallest one-room apartments will be approximately 24 square meters, with a combined bathroom.  All apartments, regardless of area, will have a balcony.  Bathrooms in some of them will be separate.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthree-room apartments will be a little more than 73 square meters. </p>

    <p>  The layout of the apartments is different.  Since they are provided to customers already fully finished, this issue is very relevant.  There are rectangular-shaped studios with a combined bathroom and a small entrance hall.  In one-room apartments, there are quite spacious kitchens, but their total footage is very small.  Living rooms are about 12-14 meters long.  They have a square and rectangular shape.  For storage of things they provide pantries.  The most interesting layouts in apartments, where the footage is 36.7 meters.  They are square, have a closet, a combined bathroom and large kitchens of almost 15 square meters.  Typical "vests" are two-room apartments that do not carry any zest. </p><p>  As for their cost, traditionally the most expensive are the one-room apartments, where the price per square meter reaches 81 thousand rubles.  Gradually, as the area increases, the cost will decrease and will reach 67 thousand rubles per square meter in a three-room apartment. </p>

    <h2>  Opinions on the LCD "Suburb.  Forest ¬ª </h2><p>  Reviews of those who purchase housing here can be found in the global network.  But there are still few of them, since the developer has not yet commissioned a single object, and it is impossible to judge the quality of construction and decoration.  But given the reputation of the developer, we can hope that the construction time will not be violated.  As well as his promises will not be broken.  But all this can be seen only at the end of this year, after the commissioning of at least one house. </p><p>  Today, many are concerned about the situation with transport accessibility.  The route is planned, but he has not yet received approval.  The same is with the declared kindergartens and schools.  They are available in the project, but not in the first stage.  And such institutions of Misailovo will not cope with the influx of newly moved residents.  But there is a hope that all this is temporary inconvenience and the developer will not force its customers to experience inconvenience for a long time. </p>
