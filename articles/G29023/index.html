Process description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Suppose you purchased the long-awaited iPad and were about to insert a SIM card in it in order to get on the Internet as soon as a small problem arose, followed by the question: "How and where to insert a SIM card?"  In general, this case should have been resolved at the point of sale.  The consultant serving you had to insert the SIM card in the iPad mini, for example, or other versions that support 3G, to save you from this need.  But since it‚Äôs too late, and there is no desire to return to the place of purchase, the article will help to solve the problem, preserving the nerves of the happy owner of a brand new gadget. <br><br>  Despite the presence of instructions in the package, it is sometimes really easier to read a ready-made assistant article than to try to master a bunch of incomprehensible or incorrectly perceived information.  Therefore, study what is written below, and try, everything is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance. </p><h2>  Search for a place for SIM </h2><p>  Since the iPad already has several models, everywhere the SIM card slot can be located in different ways.  For example, the first generation of iPads contains the hole we need on the side, on the left side of the panel.  Owners of second-generation gadgets need to deploy the little thing with the back panel up and look at the upper right corner.  It was there that the desired slot was arranged. </p>

    <h2>  Using </h2><p>  That's all.  As you can see, it‚Äôs really easy to figure out how to insert a SIM card into an iPad, any person will cope with this task.  For those who do not open the tray, despite all the efforts, it remains only to take their sophisticated gadget to the store and ask the professionals to do it for you. <br><br>  The iPad has become very popular among the modern generation immediately after its appearance on the windows, and this is not surprising: after all, it combines quality, convenience, functionality and much more, which is extremely necessary for people of the 21st century.  Plus, of course, the untwisted name of the creator and the very fact that owners of models with the ‚Äúapple‚Äù automatically become a couple of points cooler.  In the end, I would like to wish the question of how to insert a SIM card into the iPad become the most difficult in the study of this subject of technological progress. </p>
