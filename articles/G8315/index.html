You won‚Äôt be able to answer this question right away, because you need to understand the purpose of such a function and not forget about the various nuances that are associated with it.  We tried to collect all the useful information about this issue, compiled instructions and prepared special recommendations.  Gradually, you will learn about everything, and in the future you will be able to use new knowledge. </p><h2>  What does the internet give? </h2><p>  How to disable the Internet service on Tele2?  To do this, you will need to use our special instructions.  But first you need to understand the purpose of this function, which is important in most cases.  The meaning of this service is that it enables your mobile device to access the Internet and use it.  You can‚Äôt use the browser without it, as it simply won‚Äôt load. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.protarif.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the internet tele2 service" class="if uuid-3143501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3143501.jpg"></div><h2>  Can I turn it off? </h2><p>  How to disconnect the Internet on "Tele2"?  Before answering this question, you need to figure out whether it is possible to implement such a thing at all.  In fact, disconnection is possible, even in several ways.  The main thing is to decide how much you want to disable it and how to use it.  So that you can understand this in more detail, we suggest that you consider our instructions.  They will help to acquire knowledge and skills that will come in handy later on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="speedtest.net.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="disable internet from phone tele2" class="if uuid-3143503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3143503.jpg"></div><h2>  Temporarily disable the function </h2><p>  How to disconnect the Internet on "Tele2" temporarily?  To do this, do the following: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Swipe the screen from top to bottom. </li><li>  Disable the "Data Transfer" item. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 disable unlimited internet" class="if uuid-3143508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3143508.jpg"></div><p>  This is enough to temporarily disable Internet access.  This method does not affect the performance of Wi-Fi and other programs.  At the same time, you can connect access to the network in a similar way. </p><p>  We gave an example of a device under the Android operating system.  If you have another phone, then just find the ‚ÄúData transfer‚Äù item in the settings and turn it off.  A characteristic designation is the down and up arrows.  Now you know the functional limitation of this service. </p><h2>  Disabling Services </h2><p>  And how to disconnect the Internet from the Tele2 phone and the service, which is provided separately?  The above method is not suitable for this, so we have prepared a separate instruction for this case: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Dial the command: * 155 * 150 #, press the call button. </li><li>  Expect an SMS message that the service is no longer available. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet from the phone" class="if uuid-3143509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3143509.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated about this.  And if you suddenly want to return this service again, then just use the USSD command: * 155 * 151 #.  Just before that, be sure to read the details of its provision.  Conditions and cost may vary by region. </p><p>  A completely different situation arises if you want to disable "Unlimited Internet" on "Tele2".  The fact is that previously such a service was not provided by the mobile operator.  But then it was renamed to "My Unlimited", and now we need to focus on this particular name.  If you have activated this service, you should contact the operator at 611 for detailed information.  He will certainly advise and help you.  If you have activated the standard service "Unlimited Internet", which was provided earlier, then we recommend using the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Pick up a mobile phone. </li><li>  Dial the command: * 155 * 411 * 0 #, press the call button. </li><li>  Expect an SMS message stating that it is no longer available to you. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Unlimited Internet" class="if uuid-3143512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3143512.jpg"></div><p>  There is nothing complicated, just follow our recommendations and try not to make mistakes.  In conclusion, we will consider instructions that will completely disable access without the possibility of an independent connection. </p><h2>  Turn off the access point </h2><p>  There are situations when the Internet is not needed or a large amount of money is written off for it.  This usually occurs in the elderly or small children.  To avoid such a problem, you can use our instructions: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Dial the number 611, press the call button. </li><li>  An answering machine will answer you, listen to it. </li><li>  When the operator answers, ask to disconnect the access point. </li><li>  Provide data: F.I.O., passport data or keyword of the owner of the SIM card (for whom the contract was drawn up). </li><li>  As soon as the operator finishes his actions, restart the phone. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.fortunebuilders.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The operator can disable the access point" class="if uuid-3143515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3143515.jpg"></div><p>  This method is the most effective among all.  And if you want to reactivate the access point, just call the support service again and take the help of the operator. </p><h2>  Can use the standard rate? </h2><p>  There is a misconception that if you connect the tariff "Classic", then there will be no problems.  In fact, changing the service will not help you, since the function is provided at a technical level.  Even if your tariff does not have ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù, this does not mean that the phone cannot connect to it.  It is in this situation that large financial write-offs occur.  Do not make this mistake, and you will avoid unpleasant situations in the future. </p><p>  Now you know how to turn off the Internet on Tele2 in several ways.  Use recommendations and be advanced users. </p>
