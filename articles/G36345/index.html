Of course, everyone already knows about him, and many managed to get to know him first hand.  But some still doubt whether to buy an Apple Watch.  How justified can such a purchase be? </p><h2>  About device </h2><p>  Apple Watch is a wristwatch with additional functionality.  The first time they became known in 2014.  Of course, they can work independently, but for full work, iPhone 5 and newer versions are required. </p><p>  But not everyone has decided for themselves whether to buy an Apple Watch.  It seems to many that this pampering can be dispensed with without hours.  Some found the best assistant in this accessory, which became indispensable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gearpatrol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Should I buy an Apple Watch" class="if uuid-2985832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985832.jpg"></div><p>  Since 2015, Apple has launched the release of this device.  By 2018, four versions of smart watches are known.  Of course, each model has its own characteristics.  Owners of new Apple smartphones choose mainly the latest modification.  But to understand whether it is worth buying an Apple Watch, you need to consider all versions. </p><h2>  First episode </h2><p>  With the advent of the Apple Watch, many questions began to arise: ‚ÄúWhy do we need a smart watch?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat should they be?‚Äù  , "What to do with them?"  etc.  Most likely, be it a brand unknown to anyone, nobody would pay attention to products.  But since this is an Apple product, it means you need to buy and test it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  That is how smart watches became popular, and subsequent series did not need advertising at all. </p><h2>  Options Apple Watch </h2><p>  While someone was thinking about buying an Apple Watch, many were already considering the packaging of the device.  She was noticeably large.  But having removed the cover, it was possible to find a plastic pencil case, in which there were the treasured clock. </p><p>  The device is placed in a special compartment, under which there was documentation and a charger.  An optional shorter strap was supplied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="birchtree.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buying an Apple Watch" class="if uuid-2985835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985835.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance of Apple Watch </h2><p>  At first glance at the device, the question of whether to buy an Apple Watch 1 immediately disappeared.  The gadget looked expensive and modern.  The screen got rounded edges and a glass coating. </p><p>  Since this is a watch, it could not have done without a dial.  It was customizable, so you could install anything you like: from landscapes to cartoon characters. </p><p>  For the body, aluminum was selected.  The whole foundation is made of it.  The glass that covers the display protects against scratches and other damage.  At the bottom is a sensor that collects heart rate data.  This means that the user receives not just a watch, but also a fitness bracelet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Special attention should be paid to a hypoallergenic strap.  It is simple, does not have any decorations.  It is delivered in different color schemes.  What remains special is its fastening - with the help of magnetic latches. </p><h2>  Apple Watch Features </h2><p>  Since this was the first watch model, it can be called somewhat experimental.  The manufacturer needed to understand what the buyer wants in order to create the ideal in the future. </p><p>  The first series acquired a 1.53-inch screen with an OLED matrix and a resolution of 390 x 312 pixels.  The clock is always displayed on the main screen.  If you swipe the display from top to bottom, a curtain with notifications appears, from bottom to top - the Glances menu. </p><p>  In this menu, you can control all additional functions.  For example, music on a smartphone or using a fitness bracelet.  But there is also a main menu, to go to which you need to use the wheel on the side. </p><p>  A cloud of icons will appear on the screen.  It contains all the programs that are installed on the smartphone.  From here they are easy to manage.  You can use the button under the wheel.  It is customizable, so thanks to it you can, for example, configure the call of certain contacts and send messages. </p><h2>  Apple watch 2 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sensors in Apple Watch" class="if uuid-2985837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985837.jpg"></div><p>  The equipment of the second series has not changed, so you can skip this moment.  It is interesting that the appearance has not particularly changed.  All elements remained in place, and the company used all the same materials for production.  So the question is, is it worth buying an Apple Watch 2?  Of course, at the time of the release of the second series, one could stay with the previous model and wait for more dramatic changes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch second series" class="if uuid-2985838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985838.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of Apple Watch 2 </h2><p>  But some changes nevertheless affected the novelty.  Despite the fact that the elements remained in their places, they began to work differently.  Now the wheel did not call the main menu, but was only a tool for scrolling data.  It also allowed you to call the application menu or return to the main screen. </p><p>  The mechanical button has stopped working with contacts.  Her task was to call application widgets.  All other functions could be called using the touch screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch work" class="if uuid-2985840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985840.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the watchOS operating system has changed a bit.  Many users began to talk about the fact that new options were missing in the previous gadget.  Applications began to work much faster, because the system optimization has changed. </p><p>  The manufacturer has focused on the health of the owner.  Sensors began to work more accurately, and more fitness apps appeared in the Apple Store. </p><h2>  Apple Watch 3 </h2><p>  The new version appeared in the same configuration.  Should I buy an Apple Watch 3?  A new device means a new system, and accordingly updated work. </p><p>  The screen of the novelty has not changed.  Everything is also AMOLED 1.5 inches with a resolution of 390 x 312 pixels.  The new building continues to protect the owner from water, so you can use the device in the pool and at sea. </p><p>  The manufacturer decided to install a new SoC - Apple S3.  Also appeared feature LTE.  It was decided to increase the battery capacity.  The changes affected the operating system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Third Series" class="if uuid-2985841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985841.jpg"></div><h2>  New features of Apple Watch 3 </h2><p>  New features became a key moment for those who could not decide whether to buy the Apple Watch Series 3. The main innovation was the emergence of a new OS.  This could not go unnoticed.  The new system affected the operability and productivity of the device. </p><p>  The manufacturer has modified sensors for monitoring cardiac activity.  The indicators have become even more accurate and continuous.  Such attention to this topic is due to the fact that today cardiovascular diseases are the cause of many deaths.  Sometimes diagnosing problems on your own is not easy. </p><p>  The device collects data on the owner‚Äôs heart rhythms, analyzes and compiles the big picture.  If there are any serious problems, the watch will definitely notify them. </p><p>  The novelty also received an altimeter.  Now the device collects data on the number of floors traveled and statistics on the descents and elevations of the owner.  And finally, there was a lot of variation with Siri.  Now she can answer through the speakers of the clock or headphones Apple. </p><h2>  Apple Watch 4 </h2><p>  Should I buy Apple Watch 4?  Here it is definitely worth saying ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù.  Some owners of the first generation have already ceased to believe that someday a truly new gadget will be released.  And in 2018, this really happened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ausbt.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comparison of Apple Watch 2 and 4" class="if uuid-2985844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985844.jpg"></div><h2>  The main innovations of Apple Watch 4 </h2><p>  Finally, it was decided to increase the screen module.  And although the device itself has not greatly increased in size, the changes are visible to the naked eye.  Both modifications added only 2 millimeters, but the difference became noticeable in use.  Yes, and resolution indicators have changed - 324 √ó 394 and 368 √ó 448 pixels. </p><p>  In addition to the fact that black frames disappeared on the display, changes in the quality of the picture became noticeable.  Colors turned out to be brighter and more saturated.  Now the bright sun is not a hindrance to view notifications on the watch. </p><p>  The wheel on the case received tactile feedback.  The effect is similar to that that appears when scrolling the ‚Äúdrum‚Äù of the clock in the ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù application on the iPhone. </p><p>  New speakers should also push you to purchase if you don‚Äôt know whether to buy the Apple Watch Series 4. The sound has become louder and cleaner at times.  Now there is no problem communicating with relatives through this device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bloomberg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2018 Watch Apple" class="if uuid-2985846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985846.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantage of using </h2><p>  Since talking about older versions is not relevant, and the fourth series performs all the functions of the previous ones, then it is better to consider the advantages on the example of Apple Watch 4. </p><p>  Why is it worth to buy? </p><ol><li>  Firstly, it is stylish, expensive and fashionable.  And it‚Äôs hard to deny that most owners buy watches for this very reason. </li><li>  Secondly, it is very convenient.  Now you do not need to get a bulky smartphone out of your pocket or bag.  All notifications are immediately displayed on the watch screen. </li><li>  Thirdly, it is interesting.  The watch received a large number of functions that can simplify the work and speed it up. </li></ol><p>  Now it seems that the Apple Watch 4 can do everything that a smartphone can do.  Of course, this is not entirely true.  At least the gadget is deprived of an excellent camera and does not allow you to take cool pictures.  But the device allows you to fully control the phone and is its compact copy. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the release of the first series in 2015 attracted the attention of many fans of the company.  Many at that time acquired a novelty.  But the two subsequent models were not so successful.  Of course, for those who got acquainted with the Apple Watch, it was profitable to purchase a more ‚Äúfresh‚Äù series, but the owners of the first version were waiting for more dramatic changes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fortune.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Benefits of Apple Watch" class="if uuid-2985833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985833.jpg"></div><p>  Fortunately, I did not have to wait long, so the first positive reviews about the new product began to appear after the presentation in 2018.  It was then that everything about Apple Watch 4 became known. </p><p>  The new owners noted a huge difference in the performance of the fourth series compared to the previous ones.  Screen changes were also important.  It began to fit more information.  The availability of GPS turned out to be useful. </p><p>  Users still note the useful function of monitoring cardiac activity.  Although many hoped that a more detailed report and additional tips would appear in the fourth series. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, it is worth noting the short-lived battery.  It so happened that by 2018, some models of the first revision noticeably lose their autonomy.  Owners complain about the lack of long work.  Apple Watch 1 lasts for 8-10 hours.  Hence, many understand that in a couple of years and the fourth series will suffer from such problems. </p><p>  Well, and, of course, for many, the disadvantage was the cost of the gadget.  Not everyone is ready to lay out 33 thousand rubles per watch. </p>
