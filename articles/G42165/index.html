    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sochi is a resort city in which a tourist infrastructure has long been developed.  Therefore, all attractions, as a rule, are concentrated on the beaches or in the city center, in entertainment complexes.  In addition, as in many resorts, tour offices are open here.  They spend entertaining trips to beautiful places of the city, monuments and sights.  This service applies to the service "PrimaVera". </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Microdistrict Mamaika (Sochi) - the closest to the Black Sea.  The distance from the boarding house to the coast is approximately 500 m. The sand and pebble beach is municipal.  Here you can rent sun loungers and umbrellas, as well as enjoy the water rides, which are always abundant on the beach. </p><p>  In order not to return to PrimaVera at lunchtime, Sochi offers to treat yourself to delicious dishes and drinks by the sea, in local cafes and bars. </p><p>  The climate in Sochi always pampers tourists.  The swimming season here begins around the end of May - June and ends in October.  Average air temperatures are 24-26 degrees.  Water in the sea is usually warmed up to 20 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primera 2" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1576127.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the status of two stars, the pension may seem like a real fairy tale for tourists who miss comfort, a hot climate and endless entertainment.  However, no matter how "tasty" and attractive the advertisement of the PrimaVera service (Sochi) may be, the reviews of experienced vacationers are the most reliable assessment.  We will figure out what are the actual advantages of this resort and whether there are any disadvantages. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  After a long and exhausting journey, it is very important for a tourist to quickly settle in and immerse themselves in an atmosphere of relaxation.  The boarding house has a friendly and attentive staff, which will not only promptly place guests by numbers, but also help to transfer luggage and fulfill almost any instructions. </li><li>  The adjacent territory deserves special sympathy.  Picturesque flower beds, neat paved walkways and cleanliness give the impression of a luxurious European resort.  The interior of the lobby and rooms is also marked with style and sophistication.  New furniture and furnishings speak of a fresh renovation that takes place every five years. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="primavera sochi reviews" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1576124.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  The food in the boarding house, despite the standard menu, is quite tasty and not without zest.  The products are fresh, the portions are good.  Quality service, table setting is on schedule, without delay. </li><li>  The guesthouse is located in a quiet area, so the rest here is ideal for couples and youth.  Noisy entertainment is just a 15-minute leisurely step. </li><li>  Although the beach does not belong to the boarding house, he also found a place in the piggy bank of positive reviews about the service.  The beautiful promenade is equipped with benches and decorated with flowers.  Spreading trees save from the heat.  By the way, in the summer heat comes to the rescue and the pool in the boarding house "PrimaVera".  Sochi, some unaccustomed tourists find a stuffy city, so the paths to the beaches are full of shops with cold drinks and fresh juices. </li><li>  Another undoubted advantage are reasonable prices for the services of a boarding house.  Of course, they may vary slightly depending on the choice of travel agent.  But a ticket for the whole family here can allow every Russian with an average income. </li><li>  Pension PrimaVera is designed not only for Russians.  The staff is fluent in English.  This provides a perspective for local tourism infrastructure.  A quality service and environmental conditions attract foreign citizens here. </li></ul><p>  By cons, vacationers attributed only the hot climate of the resort.  However, this moment can hardly be attributed to the boarding house service. </p>
