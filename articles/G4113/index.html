  <section class="page js-page"><h1>British monarchy: history, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The British monarchy has a centuries-old history, while it has survived to the present.  With this form of government, Britain became a powerful state, expanding its territory, including at the expense of the colonies.  About the British monarchy, the history of its occurrence, development and condition will now be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  The British monarch or the Sovereign is the head of the United Kingdom, as well as overseas territories (colonies).  The current monarchy of the United Kingdom can trace its roots back to the period when the Anglo-Saxons ruled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coat of arms of the British crown" class="if uuid-3088973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3088973.jpg"></div><p>  In the 9th century, Wessex (West Saxon kingdom), located in the south of Britain, began to dominate, and in the 10th century it already united all the lands into a single kingdom.  The vast majority of British rulers during the Middle Ages ruled like absolute monarchs.  But at the same time, attempts were often made to limit their authority on the part of the nobility, and then the House of Commons. </p><h2>  Roman period </h2><p>  Before the advent of the British monarchy, England was a colony of the Roman Empire.  Already IV in the century BC.  e.  England was known to the rest of the world.  The Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Greeks bought Cornish tin here.  Among the ancient Greeks there is a mention of the Kassiterites or ‚Äútin islands‚Äù, which are described as located near the western coast of Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="British crown" class="if uuid-3088940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3088940.jpg"></div><p>  England was discovered by the Romans when Julius Caesar, being emperor, decided to make a trip to the island in 55-54 BC.  e.  It should be noted that during this campaign the territory was not conquered. </p><p>  England was inhabited by Celtic tribes - the Britons.  In the year 43 A.D.  e.  A. Plautius came to Britain, and from that moment it became one of the Roman colonies and, accordingly, part of the Roman Empire. </p><h2>  Anglo-Saxon September </h2><p>  Around 410, Roman rule in Britain ended.  The monarchy in Britain began with the fact that the Anglo-Saxons conquered England.  Utahs, Angles and Saxons founded the so-called Anglo-Saxon heptarchy.  This is the union of the seven dominant kingdoms, which included: </p><ol><li>  Wessex. </li><li>  Northumbria. </li><li>  Mercia. </li><li>  Essex. </li><li>  East of England. </li><li>  Sussex. </li><li>  Kent. </li></ol><p>  Each of these kingdoms had its own monarch, possessing broad powers.  The Kingdom of Wessex was led by King Egbert, who is often considered the first English monarch.  The final stage in the formation of the British monarchy was the conquest of Britain by William I of Normandy (Conqueror).  After seizing the territory, he establishes a united British kingdom and becomes its ruler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="forestpolicypub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King William I" class="if uuid-3088943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3088943.jpg"></div><p>  An interesting fact is that ‚ÄúEngland‚Äù, as a term, comes from the name of the ancient Germanic tribe of Angles who settled on the territory of Britain in the 5th century.  Previously, it was used as a synonym for the name "United Kingdom."  However, it should be noted that in modern geography the state is commonly called the UK, and England is its administrative and political part.  The composition of the state also includes Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p><h2>  Abolition and restoration of the monarchy </h2><p>  Over the past one and a half thousand years, European kings have been forced to adapt to complex political situations, such as revolutions, civil wars, occupations and world wars.  After various global events, to date, the monarchy has remained only in Spain, Britain, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. </p><p>  The British monarchy was more stable than the French, as you know, the latter disappeared after the French Revolution in 1789.  However, Britain did not escape revolutionary upheavals.  So, in the XVII century, the English king Charles I demanded unlimited powers, pursuing a policy of absolutism.  As a result, in 1642, the parliament rebelled against him, and there was a revolution led by Oliver Cromwell.  After which the king was executed, and the monarchy was abolished and a republic was created. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, after 18 years, the British Parliament decided to restore the monarchy, but with much less power than before. </p><h2>  A constitutional monarchy </h2><p>  Currently, a constitutional monarchy is a form of government in the UK.  With this form of government, the prime minister is the head of the executive branch, as well as a member of the legislature.  The monarch, occupying the throne, performs only formal and ceremonial functions in relation to the government. </p><div class="photo" data-original="classroom.synonym.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruling queen" class="if uuid-3088946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3088946.jpg"></div><p>  In the modern British monarchy, its head fulfills the constitutional and representative duties that have developed over the centuries-old history of England.  The sovereign also acts as the head of the nation, as a guideline for national unity and stability. </p><p>  For example, the current Queen of Great Britain Elizabeth II represents the kingdom, receiving foreign ambassadors, heads of other states, and also makes state visits to other countries.  This is done to support and improve economic and diplomatic relations. </p><h2>  The Royal Family </h2><p>  The royal family of Britain is a group of close relatives of the monarch.  In 1917, King George V (due to the war with Germany) was forced to abandon all of his German titles, as well as the titles of heirs.  After which he renamed the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty to Windsor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lejournalinternational.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Royal Family" class="if uuid-3088949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3088949.jpg"></div><p>  In Britain, there is no clear formal and legal definition that would indicate who exactly should be considered its member, which is a feature of the British monarchy.  Currently, they are all close relatives along the lines of the king and queen, for example, children, grandchildren and their spouses, as well as cousins ‚Äã‚Äãand cousins. </p><h2>  Tree of the British Monarchy </h2><p>  At present, Queen Elizabeth II "rules" in Britain.  She has been on the throne since 1952.  As you know, the power of the monarch is inherited.  The heir to the British throne is her eldest son, Charles, who holds the title of Prince of Wales.  He, like the husband of Queen Philip, Prince of Edinburgh, performs only ceremonial functions. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, the heirs of the throne also include the spouses of direct descendants of the monarch.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  the first son of Elizabeth II and Philip, Prince of Wales Charles, his wife is the Duchess of Cornwall, Camille; </li><li>  Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge; </li><li>  the children of William and Catherine - two princes and a Princess of Cambridge: George, Louis and Charlotte; </li><li>  Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Princess Megan; </li><li>  the second son of Elizabeth II and Philip with his wife, the Duke and Duchess of York, Prince Andrew and Princess Beatrice; </li><li>  children Andrew and Beatrice - Prince and Princess Andrew and Eugene; </li><li>  the third son of Elizabeth II and Philip with his wife, Count and Countess of Wessex, Edward and Sophie; </li><li>  children - Viscount Severn James and Louise Windsor; </li><li>  daughter of Elizabeth II and Philip, Princess Anne. </li></ul><p>  Also, the cousins ‚Äã‚Äãand cousins ‚Äã‚Äãof the king and queen, as well as their descendants, are considered to be heirs to the throne, this rule does not apply to the spouses of heirs. </p><h2>  British Parliament and Monarchy </h2><p>  Currently, the powers of the monarchs are not as extensive as in the Middle Ages.  However, the prerogatives (the so-called powers of the monarch) are quite large.  In practice, most prerogatives are implemented by ministers.  For example, the authority regulating civil services and issuing passports is the responsibility of the relevant ministries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royal.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="British parliament" class="if uuid-3088976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3088976.jpg"></div><p>  Other powers of the monarch are exercised by him nominally, in agreement with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers and in accordance with the constitutional convention.  An example of the direct powers of the head of state, which he has the opportunity to use, is the right to dissolve parliament.  With all the rights available, the monarchy cannot claim new ones.  That is, the Crown cannot introduce prerogatives and execute them, therefore, its power is limited. </p><h2>  The personification of Great Britain </h2><p>  The symbol of the British monarchy is its queen.  It should be recognized that the English Crown is the most famous in the world, and its influence has been and remains quite substantial.  The monarchy has now evolved into an institution that personifies Britain as a whole.  In the country itself, the queen and her family members are very popular, and some of them even enjoy great love.  For example, Princess Diana, the mother of Harry and William, who, after her death, causes admiration and respect among the British. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indian24news.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal guards" class="if uuid-3088981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3088981.jpg"></div><p>  In general, it is difficult enough to meet an Englishman who separates himself from the Crown.  This is not only a tradition, but also a way generally accepted by citizens that has not changed for several centuries. </p><p>  Today, the queen herself and all that is associated with traditional power institutions are of great interest to tourists coming to the UK.  For a better acquaintance with the monarchy in London, various excursions are arranged, including to Buckingham Palace.  However, tourists are not destined to find out what is happening behind its doors. </p>
