Some people have already issued a map, and sometimes in duplicate.  Without a credit limit, they simply give it out in communication stores, for example, when sending a money transfer. </p><p>  What kind of product is it, what bank does it belong to, and is it profitable to have such a card?  Is it necessary to get rid of the existing one, if it was imposed, but not used?  To answer these questions, you need to know the features of this card. </p><p>  This is a debit prepaid card with the possibility of opening credit limits.  Such a card allows you to withdraw, replenish, transfer funds on fairly favorable terms.  In addition, Euroset provides customers with bonus points that can be applied through partners or in mobile retail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kykyryza.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a card corn" class="if uuid-3188555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3188555.jpg"></div><h2>  About the map </h2><p>  This offer is quite unique, since a bank card can combine debit functions with interest on the balance and the functionality of a credit card with a limit that resumes after repayment. </p><p>  Euroset collaborates with financial institutions such as Tinkoff and Otkrytie.  It also has a number of partnerships with other companies, thanks to which a system of discounts and cashback is being successfully implemented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to close the "Corn" card from "Tinkoff", consider below. </p><p>  Card issuance is free.  In addition, no commission will be charged for servicing or replacing a card.  The only thing that needs to be paid is a down payment of 100 rubles.  These funds placed on the card can be disposed of at your own discretion. </p><p>  In addition, Euroset in addition offers some services of a personal account and a mobile application that allow you to manage this financial product and receive all the necessary information on the status of the account. </p><h2>  Terms of use </h2><p>  Before telling how to close the Corn card, we will consider the basic rules for its use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsbtc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a credit card corn" class="if uuid-3188550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3188550.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs easy to evaluate the advantages of credit cards: you can use the card in a store, restaurant, the Internet, at a gas station.  For purchases made on the card bonuses are awarded in the form of points, which can be used to pay for a particular purchase or reduce the cost by the amount of points (10 points = 1 ruble).  It is very profitable to use Corn for transfers around the world: transfer security, low commission, speed of receipt and sending, favorable credit conditions, including a grace period, minimum monthly payments.  The "Corn" card is issued very simply - you do not need to visit the bank for this, there is also no guarantee. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The card has a great advantage for purchases abroad, since it is possible to convert currencies at the Central Bank rate, without commissions.  With a card through the IP-telephony service, you can call worldwide at reduced prices.  To track the balance, you need to connect Internet banking, where you can see all the operations in your personal account. </p><p>  Where to close the "Corn" card, it is important to find out in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shorelinecards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close the card corn euroset online" class="if uuid-3188556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3188556.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  To ensure that the credit card does not bring any problems, you must follow some mandatory conditions: </p><ul><li>  Do not cash out funds, but use them exclusively for non-cash payments. </li><li>  Take into account the grace period and repay the loan only during this time period in order to prevent interest accrual. </li><li>  In case of damage or loss of a card, it is easy to restore it, with a passport, contacting the Euroset branch. </li></ul><h2>  What can I spend points on? </h2><p>  You can spend points on the Corn card in Euroset, as well as in its partner companies, covering almost the entire range of goods and services a person needs: pharmacies, gas stations, supermarkets, travel agencies, the sale of railway and air tickets.  Many purchases are made without leaving home, which is very convenient.  The balance of the card can be monitored in your personal account, which also provides all the information about it, including the grace period, promotions, bonuses, points, etc. Thus, Corn is an excellent choice for people who actively use loans. </p><h2>  How to close the card "Corn"? </h2><p>  This is a popular question holders.  This financial product attracts people with all kinds of promotional offers, bonuses, simple design.  However, over time, buyers no longer need to use this card, so the issue under consideration is very relevant for them. </p><p>  The credit card received in Euroset can be blocked for a certain time if all bonuses from it have been spent, or completely closed if the holder no longer needs it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card corn close account" class="if uuid-3188551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3188551.jpg"></div><p>  Cancellation of the Corn card will not take much time if no financial transactions have been made on it for a long time.  In this case, it is enough to call the customer support service on the phone number indicated on the organization‚Äôs website or on the back of the card.  It should be noted that during a conversation with the manager, he may ask for a code word and passport data. </p><h2>  How to close the "Corn" card from the "Euroset" via the Internet? </h2><p>  If the holder of a plastic card wants to cancel this bank instrument via the Internet on his own, then the bank is forced to upset him.  Such a function does not exist today.  Through the online account, only the function of temporarily blocking any actions with plastic is available, however, the contract remains active. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="where to close the corn card" class="if uuid-3188553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3188553.jpg"></div><h2>  With credit limit </h2><p>  How to close the card "Corn" in the presence of a credit limit? </p><p>  If certain actions have been recently taken on it, Euroset suggests closing it with a personal visit to the department.  This procedure involves just two simple steps: </p><ol><li>  Provide your Euroset employee with a passport. </li><li>  Fill out the special service denial form. </li></ol><p>  The presence on the card of the issued credit limit complicates the process of canceling plastic.  The reason for this is the need to close the contract not only with Euroset, but also with a banking institution (for example, Tinkoff). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneyunder30.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff corn" class="if uuid-3188562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/3188562.jpg"></div><p>  What needs to be done to finally close the account of the Corn card?  Initially, the cardholder needs to find out from the financial institution with which a loan agreement has been concluded whether there is a debt on his account.  This can be done by calling the hotline.  If there is one, it must be paid off without fail.  This is the main condition.  When there is no debt on the card, you can close the contract with the bank, after which it becomes possible to terminate the contract with Euroset and close the card.  On the Internet, this is not yet possible, so a personal visit to the Euroset will be necessary. </p><p>  We looked at how to close a Corn credit card. </p>
