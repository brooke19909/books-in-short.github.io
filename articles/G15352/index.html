    <p>  Red pine is a street in modern Moscow.  However, this <span>was not always the case.</span>  Before that, it was just an extensive summer cottage village, where small houses with the same small plots of land were located.  Some 50 years ago, Red Pine was one of the most favorite places of Muscovites, where you could grow fresh vegetables to the table, plant fruit trees and flowers.  In addition, in Red Pine it was possible to spend the weekend, while in the fresh air, surrounded by stunningly beautiful nature, to relax from the hustle and bustle of the never-sleeping capital.  Now, Moscow simply swallowed up the former dacha village of Red Pine, and at the moment it has turned into one of the most developing and developing areas within the city. </p><h2>  Location </h2>

    <p>  On the other hand, Red Pine in Moscow is now considered the most rapidly developing region.  At the moment, it houses 74 major trading, financial, construction and other companies.  Among them, one can also single out architectural workshops, the Geodetic Agency, the Independent Evaluation Bureau, and many others dealing with a wide variety of service delivery areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, there are 16 car dealerships, including the official dealer of AvtoVAZ Severyanin - AvtoVAZ, Publishing and Printing College named after  I. Fedorova, CJSC NPO Garant, the well-known literary publishing house Veche throughout the CIS.  And what is especially noteworthy, Krasnaya Sosna Street has become the place where the <span>woodworking enterprise</span> located <span>,</span> working with orders from the Moscow Union of Artists. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and Maintenance </h2><p>  The main transport artery of Red Pine, providing communication with other areas of Moscow, uninterrupted delivery of goods, filling outlets with necessary goods, of course, is the Yaroslavl highway.  But due to the large-scale development of the street every year it becomes more and more busy.  Of course, there are still no such problems as in the central regions of the capital, but they periodically arise.  However, there are alternatives to the Yaroslavl highway in the form of the Severyaninskaya and Losinoostrovskaya railway stations, in addition, more recently, 2 metro lines VDNKh and Sviblovo were brought to the street, so there are simply no problems with transport and service. </p><h2>  History of Red Pine </h2>
