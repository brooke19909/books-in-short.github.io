DIY, they will highlight and decorate your child and become a favorite part of his wardrobe.  No one will have such charming outfits! </p><p>  In this article, using two beautiful models as an example, we will tell you how to make a crocheted baby dress for girls with your own hands.  We will provide a detailed description of the work process and share understandable schemes.  We hope you find them useful! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="description of crocheted dresses for girls" class="if uuid-2879492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2879492.jpg"></div><h2>  Model No. 1.  Warm autumn dress with pockets - hearts </h2><p>  The autumn season has come, which means that it is time to warm up.  Let's learn how to knit a cozy children's dress with funny pockets in the shape of hearts.  It is perfect for walking in the cool season and will warm your child. </p><p>  For work, you will need 2 skeins of gray yarn (with a density of 100 g per 270 m) and 1 skein of purple, as well as a hook number 3.5, scissors and 3 buttons.  We recommend using crocheted dresses to use acrylic threads with the addition of wool.  Perspective Pecherka yarn, LANAGOLD Alize or Alize Alpaca Royalc are perfect. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The size of the finished product is designed for a one-year-old girl.  The dress is made from top to bottom, starting from the neck.  The coquette is made in rows that do not first fit into the ring, which allows you to make a fastener on the back.  Sleeves and lower part knit in a circle.  What will the finished crocheted dress look like?  The photo below demonstrates this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myloveforcreativity.files.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted baby dress for girls" class="if uuid-2881620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2881620.jpg"></div><h2>  Stage One: Coquette </h2><p>  We start work on our beautiful knitted dress: crochet a chain of 52 air loops.  We don‚Äôt connect to the ring!  We will work in rows, forming an open back in the center. </p><p>  In the first row we knit 1 double crochet (1) in the fourth loop from the hook, 1 1 in the next 7. Next, we make a group 1 1 - 1 VP - 1 VP (V-combination) and 1 1 in the next 5 loops.  We knit the V-combination again.  1 C1H in the next 18 loops.  Again the V-combination and 1 C1H in the next 5 loops.  Repeat the V-combination in the next loop.  1 and perform C1H in the last 9 loops.  Cut the thread, fasten.  We check ourselves: in a row it turns out 58 loops (group 1 1 - 1 VP - 1 VP is considered as 3). </p><p>  The second row starts with joining the thread to the top of the initial chain of the base and 3 VP.  In the next 9 loops, we knit 1 C1H.  Next is the V-combination and loop skip.  In the next 7 columns we knit 1 C1H.  Repeat the V-combination and loop skip.  We do 1 1 in the next 20 columns.  Again, use the V-combination and loop skip.  We knit 1  in the next 7 loops.  Make a V-combination and loop skip.  Until the end of the row, we perform 1 C1H in each column of the base.  We break the thread.  It turns out 66 loops. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From the third to the sixth row, we work like this: attach the thread at the beginning of the row (to the third loop of the chain), perform 3 VPs (they count as the first double crochet).  Next, we use the pattern 4 times: 1  in each column of the previous row to the chain, skip the first V-combination, in the next we perform 1 - 1 VP - 1 VP and again skip the loop.  Next, we knit 1 C1H in each column to the end.  Cut the thread, fasten in all rows except the sixth.  In the sixth, we make a connecting loop at the top of the chain of the beginning of the row.  Check yourself: you should get 98 loops. </p><p>  In the seventh row, we will increase the number of loops to form the sleeves.  Perform 3 VP. * Do 1 1 in each column, skip the V-combination, knit 1 1 - 1 VP-2 1 in the next loop, skip the loop again.  1 1 in each column of the base to the chain, the pass of the V-combination, 2 1 -1  - 1 1 in the next loop, skip of the loop. * Repeat * - * again.  Next, we knit 1 C1H in each loop, with the help of the joint venture we connect the row into a ring.  You should get 110 loops. </p><p>  We repeat the scheme of the seventh row to the eleventh.  We check ourselves - with the additions, 158 loops are obtained.  We do not cut the thread.  The yoke is ready. </p><h2>  Stage Two: Formation of the Armhole </h2><p>  We continue to work on our crocheted dress.  We proceed to the formation of an armhole for the sleeves.  To do this, measure the thread 30.5 cm long from the other end of the working tangle, cut it off and repeat the procedure.  We attach one segment on the right front side of the product, make 1 VP and skip the loop, another 4 VP and SP in the next loop.  We fix the thread.  By analogy, we make the second axillary chain from the opposite side. </p><p>  Next row: return to the working thread.  We carry out 3 VP.  * 1 C1H in each column to the axillary chain.  1 C1H in each of 4 VP.  Skip the next 37 columns *.  Repeat from * to *.  1 C1H in each column to the end.  We close the joint venture to the top of the initial chain.  There should be 88 loops in a row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet summer dresses for girls" class="if uuid-2876646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2876646.jpg"></div><h2>  Stage Three: Bottom of the Product </h2><p>  Now we are starting to make skirts for our crocheted dress.  We carry out 3 VP, 1 1 in every 9 following loops.  * 2 1 in the next column, 1 1 in the next 10 * - repeat the circuit to the last loop.  We do 2 C1H in it.  We connect using the joint venture.  It turned out 96 loops. </p><p>  We knit the second, third, fourth rows according to the scheme: a chain of 3 VP.  1 C1H in each loop of the circle.  Close using the connecting half-column. </p><p>  Fifth row: 3 VP, 1 C1H in the next 10 loops.  * We do 2 1 in a loop, 1 1 in the next 11. * Pattern * - * we use to the last loop in which we do 2 1.  Close the joint venture.  It turned out 104 columns.  We knit the sixth, seventh, eighth rows as follows: 3 VP at the beginning, then 1 1 in each loop of the base, we complete the joint venture. </p><p>  In the ninth row, we knit again 3 VP.  * 1 C1H in the next 11 loops.  2 1 in the next loop, 1 1 in the next 12 loops * - repeat until the last column.  In it we knit 2 C1H.  close the joint venture.  It should turn out 112 loops.  We knit the tenth, eleventh, twelfth rows of 3 VP at the beginning, 1  in each column of the base and the joint venture at the end. </p><p>  Thirteenth row: 3 VP, 1 C1H in 12 loops.  * We do 2 1 in a loop, 1 1 in each of the 13 following. * Repeat * - * until the last loop, into which we knit 2 1 and at the end of the joint venture.  It turned out 120 loops.  The fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth rows are knitted again without increases.  At the beginning of 3 VP and 1 C1H in each loop, at the end of the joint venture. </p><p>  We start the seventeenth row with 3 VP.  Next, do 1 C1H in 14 loops.  We use the pattern * 2 1 in the next loop, 1 1 in the next 14 loops. * To the last loop, we knit 2 1 in it.  And close the joint venture.  It turned out 128 loops. </p><p>  We knit the eighteenth row without increase - 3 VP, 1 1 in each loop, joint venture.  We repeat the scheme of the last row until the skirt (from the armpits to the edge) reaches the required length - 28 cm. We draw up the last row with the help of the "crab step".  We cut the thread, fix it.  The process of working on a crocheted baby dress is nearing completion!  It remains to issue sleeves, pockets and sew buttons. </p><h2>  Stage Four: Sleeves </h2><p>  To design the sleeves of the dress, we attach the working thread with a connecting half-column in the third loop of the axillary chain.  We do 3 VP.  1 C1H to the next loop.  * 1 C1H in the loop, 2 C1H in the next * - repeat 18 times around the circumference of the sleeve.  1 C1H in the next column.  1 C1H in the last 2 loops.  We make the joint venture to the top of the initial loop.  You should get 59 loops. </p><p>  The second row of the sleeve: 3 VP, 1 C1H in each column of the base, SP.  Third row: 1 VP, 1 column in the same loop.  * 2 single crochet double crochet, 1 single crochet in the next stitch *, repeat the pattern to the last 3 stitches.  Two single crochet, crocheted together, 1 single crochet in the last stitch, SP.  It turned out 36 columns. </p><p>  Fourth row of sleeves.  1 VP, 1 CH in each loop, SP.  Fifth row: Crayfish step with single crochet in each loop.  We break the thread, fix it.  By analogy, we carry out the second sleeve of the dress. </p><h2>  Stage Five: Pockets </h2><p>  Our beautiful crocheted dress is almost done.  It remains to make pockets, sew three buttons and make loops for them.  We will knit pockets according to the scheme presented below.  For work, we use a purple thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="com.yarnspirations.pattern-pdfs.s3.amazonaws.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dresses photo" class="if uuid-2876664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2876664.jpg"></div><p>  We start with the magic ring, into which we perform 4 VP, 2 C2H, 4 C1H, 1 C2H, 4 C1H, 3 C2H.  We do 2 VP lifting, in the second and subsequent rows we adhere to the scheme.  We carry out two purple hearts - pockets. </p><h2>  Stage six: binding of the edge, assembly of the product </h2><p>  We mark the place for buttons on the dress.  Sew on the top 1 cm below the collar.  The second and third below.  On the other side of the armhole, attach the thread, make 1 VP, 6 VP, SP in the next loop.  We get the first buttonhole.  We knit single crochet along the edge of the armhole.  By analogy, we make the second and third loops.  We decorate the edge with single crochet (in the corners we make 3 scs).  We fix the thread and cut it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myloveforcreativity.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful crochet knitted dresses" class="if uuid-2881595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2881595.jpg"></div><p>  Sew pockets, leaving their upper part free.

In the first row, we first perform 1 double crochet (C1H) in 4 stitches from the hook.  Next, use the 1 crochet pattern in each second loop to the end.  The row ends with a connecting loop (SP). </p><p>  In the second row we make 3 air loops (VP).  And then we work according to the scheme: 1 1 (in the second column with the crochet of the previous row) - 2 VP.  We complete the series using the joint venture. </p><p>  We start the third row with 3 VP.  We use the pattern to the end: 1 C1H (in the next column), 1 C1H (in the next loop of the chain), 1 C1H (in the next loop).  We end with a connecting loop. </p><p>  In the fourth row we do 3 VP.  Next, we knit according to the scheme 1 1 in the next loop, a chain of 2 VP, we repeat until the end.  We complete 1 joint venture.  We knit the fifth row by analogy with the third, the sixth - with the fourth.  We continue to knit the yoke of the dress alternating the fifth and sixth rows three times. </p><p>  In the thirteenth row, we carry out a chain of 5 VP and 1 single crochet in the third loop from the hook.  We knit so to the end.  The layout of the fourteenth row is as follows: a chain of 5 VP, a single crochet in the arch.  We knit until the nineteenth row using the pattern of the fourteenth row.
