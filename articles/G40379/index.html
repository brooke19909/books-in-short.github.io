  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crises of the Provisional Government</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Military issues focused and exacerbated all issues regarding <span>the 1917 revolution</span> .  At this time, the social and economic situation began to deteriorate, the separatist mood in the outskirts of the country began to intensify, the demands of the revolutionary masses grew, which led to discontent because they were not realized.  This situation was used by the Bolsheviks to increase people's hatred of the bourgeoisie and liberals.  They promised complete satisfaction of the demands of the people by <span>creating a socialist</span> revolution that would help end the war and transfer land to the peasants. </p><p>  During the revolution, the tsarist government was overthrown, and already at the end of February the formation of the Provisional Government began.  However, over the entire period of existence there have been three crises of the Provisional Government, each of which was longer and stronger than the previous one.  Thanks to this, by the beginning of September, a new government had been created, called the Directory, which included five people.  But all these events did not contribute to the cessation of the revolution, but only fomented it, as a result of which preparations began for the seizure of power. </p><p>  Let us examine in detail the crises of the Provisional Government. </p><p>  1. The April crisis was caused by social tensions in the country, increasing as a result of Milyukov‚Äôs statement about the continuation of the war and the implementation of all points of the agreement of the tsarist government.  All these events led to mass rallies, as a result of which a coalition was created, which included both capitalists and socialists.  This union promised to start negotiations on ending the war, developing new reforms and establishing <span>state control</span> over production. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. The crises of the Provisional Government (May - July 1917).  The coalition's policy led to an explosion of discontent, as a result of which a massive armed demonstration began in Petrograd.  This was used by the Bolsheviks, whose purpose was to organize a demonstration against the current government.  However, the government hit this wave by launching an offensive at the front. </p><p>  3. The crises of the Provisional Government (early July 1917).  The July crisis began with the cadets leaving the government.  At that time, an armed rally of workers was held in the capital with the aim of creating a new Soviet government, as a result of which many people died and martial law was established in the city.  Repressions began against the Bolsheviks; the Provisional Government introduced the <span>death penalty</span> at the front. </p><p>  The crisis worsened after the defeat and retreat of Russian troops at the front, and culminated in the creation of a new coalition and counter-revolutionary forces.  The interim government tried to stabilize the situation and reconcile political forces, but he failed.  The new coalition lasted only a month. </p><p>  The crises of the <span>Provisional Government</span> ended with the so-called Kornilov rebellion in August 1917, due to the suppression of which the situation in the country changed, and the influence of the Bolsheviks increased. </p><p>  Thus, the Provisional Government and the Bolsheviks helped to prevent the coup attempt that Kornilov made.  In early September, the resolution of the Bolsheviks was adopted, and the crises of the Provisional Government of 1917 helped to stabilize the situation in the country.  For this reason, the number of Bolsheviks in the party was growing, and the party itself gained authority in the eyes of the masses. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Provisional Government did not last long.  Its members were arrested in late October 1917, when an armed rebellion broke out in the country.  The Bolsheviks won the October Revolution, thereby creating a new round in the history of Soviet Russia. </p>
