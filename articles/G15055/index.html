    <p>  Actually, Lardos itself has earned popularity among tourists not only for the cleanliness and beautiful view of well-landscaped streets.  If desired, tourists can also have a good time here.  Especially fun in Lardos happens in the evenings.  At this time, national dances and many various performances are organized here.  If desired, tourists can listen to live music in every local cafe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Smartline Ellia 3 * (Rhodes): traveler reviews </h2><p>  <span><span><span>This hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>accepts guests</span></span></span> <span><span><span>in two three-story buildings and in several small bungalows.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This hotel was built in 1988.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In 2015, reconstruction was carried out here.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Photos of the hotel, available on the websites of travel agencies, unfortunately, in some cases do not correspond to reality.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The fact is that before the reconstruction of the hotel bungalows were decorated in Greek ethnic style.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>During the repair, the owners decided to change the design of the buildings.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The hotel is currently decorated in a modern hi-tech style.</span></span></span> </p>

    <p>  Many tourists find the appearance of the reconstructed hotel quite beautiful.  There are even rave reviews about the hotel‚Äôs territory on the Web.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Smartline Ellia 3 * hotel is quite large.  Moreover, the hotel courtyard is not at all a smooth smooth area.  It is rather a small hilly area.  Therefore, everywhere in the courtyard of the hotel there are picturesque terraces, platforms and ladders.  And it actually looks very picturesque and original. </p><h2>  Number of rooms: what you should know </h2><p>  <span><span><span>In total, the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Smartline</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Ellia</span></span></span> <span><span><span>(ex Saint George 3 *)</span></span></span> <span><span><span>offers 87 comfortable rooms to guests of Lardos.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>By equipment and comfort rooms in this hotel can vary significantly.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The fact is that several years ago the owners of Smartline Ellia bought a part of the nearby Montemar complex.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Three-story buildings previously belonged to this particular hotel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Reconstruction at the Mortemar Hotel by its previous owners, unfortunately, was not carried out.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>These two buildings and their current owners did not repair.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Therefore, the rooms here for convenience differ significantly from the rooms rented into bungalows.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Unfortunately, Russian tourists are lodged most often in these two buildings.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>It is worth knowing and not particularly trusting the beautiful photo of the hotel rooms on the sites of tour operators.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>At such sites, renovated spacious bungalow rooms are usually presented, which can lead tourists astray.</span></span></span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In the buildings handed over by the owners of the Smartline Ellia hotel (ex Saint George, Lardos 3 *) to Russian vacationers, the rooms can also vary in terms of convenience and equipment.  In some of them, according to the guests, the situation is extremely poor and old.  The furniture in such rooms is shaky, the decoration is tattered, and household appliances may not function at all.  For those of our compatriots who have come across such a room, experienced tourists are advised to immediately go to the reception and demand a replacement.  Even in the three-story buildings of the hotel there are usually quite decent rooms.  Of course, they are not as comfortable as in a bungalow, but you can live in them more or less comfortably.  In addition, hotel administrators in some cases populate dissatisfied Russian tourists into houses.  Experienced tourists highly advise against swearing at registration employees (and even more so using strong expressions).  Talking with the hotel staff is polite.  Otherwise, they can go on principle and not relocate the guest from a bad room at all nowhere. </p><h2>  Apartment features </h2><p>  <span><span><span>In addition to beds, all rooms of the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Smartline Ellia 3 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>(including in the buildings) are equipped with air conditioning.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>There are, of course, in the rooms and televisions.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Some apartments have old models, while others have flat screens.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The rooms at the hotel also include refrigerators and safes.</span></span></span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span><span><span>Showers in each room of this hotel are individual.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In some rooms in the bathroom there are cabins; in others, watering cans are simply suspended on the wall.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>All rooms in the showers have a standard set of toiletries, which tourists can use for free.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The hotel descriptions on the websites of many operators say that the bathrooms here include a hairdryer.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In fact, this accessory may not be in the shower.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But at the first complaint of the guests, the hair dryer is usually still brought.</span></span></span> </p>

Hotel staff behave politely and courteously.  Including in relation to the Russian guests.  The fact that our compatriots are accommodated in not-so-good numbers is, of course, not connected at all with the poor attitude of Greek citizens towards the inhabitants of Russia.  Simply, our tour operators are, unfortunately, far from the main partners of this hotel. </p><p>  The beds in the Smartline Ellia hotel, judging by the reviews of tourists, are quite comfortable.  Some rooms have plain furniture, others have pretty pretty wicker furniture.  Household appliances in a hotel almost always work properly.  Outlets in all rooms, even not too good, as many guests note, usually there is a sufficient number. </p><h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel, of course, provides guests with a number of various additional services.

The coastline at this place is covered with sand mixed with small pebbles.  There are no large stones on the beach.  Therefore, sunbathing here is very convenient. </p><p>  The sea entrance on this beach is pretty steep.  For children, this, of course, is not too convenient.  But the water in the sea in this place is always clean and transparent.  Of course, on the beach of the hotel you can rent sunbeds.  Those tourists who do not want to pay for a deck chair can simply sunbathe on mats. </p>
