    <p>  The Sherna River offers many fishing spots.  The Noginsk district, in addition, has a rich nature, wonderful opportunities for a comprehensive holiday. </p><h2>  Autumn fishing </h2><p>  Fish within Sherna are well caught in late summer and early fall, that is, in late August - early September.  If there is low pressure, even a pike will peck.  For a successful fishing, it would be nice to take a boat with you. </p><p>  Many residents set up wattle fences.  However, it is not only with their help that the Sherna River will give a rich catch: fishing here is very productive when fishing in the traditional way.  In early autumn, bream, zander, and asp are fishing here. </p>

    <p>  In the tributaries of Sherna, the water is more pure and transparent.  Therefore, just ideal conditions for fishing are created here.  Near the Gorky highway there is a dam.  There are also a lot of fish around her.  The catch will be rich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Winter fishing on Shern </h2><p>  Sherna River, fishing on it can be interesting and entertaining not only in autumn but also in winter.  At this time of year, Shern practically does not freeze.  Here you can see many lovers of quiet hunting by the water.  However, you can not catch the entire length of the reservoir.  Experts say that in winter the river is the safest in the upper section - from the Karavaev dam.  In other places, ice may not be thick enough.  In addition, recent winters are not very stable frosty weather, and therefore with fishing in the cold season, you still need to be careful. </p><p>  The Sherna River in Noginsk is rich in bream.  No wonder this fish is considered the best winter trophy.  A large amount of it is collected at the Karavaevskaya dam. </p><p>  Ice fishing can also be carried out on old people, of which there are a lot.  As the ice cover builds up, you can move more calmly to <span>the river bed.</span>  Here the hunt for both predatory, large fish and small ones is very successful. </p><h2>  Lure fishing </h2><p>  You can catch lure in different parts of Sherna.  The main fish trophy with this method is pike.  Now there are a huge number of lures suitable for spinning. </p><p>  The banks of the river are very short.  Therefore, it is necessary to choose baits that do not catch.  They come with <span>offset hooks</span> or with hooks that are pressed to the body of the bait itself. </p><p>  Spinning on a spinner is most successful after spring spawning of pike.  Then they begin to replenish their nutritional reserves and become more active.  If you go fishing earlier than this time, then the results of fishing will be bad. </p><p>  The moment when the Sherna River is just beginning to open from ice is also successful.  The Vladimir region has pronounced seasons of the year.  But the beginning of melting ice on the river is still difficult to guess even for experienced fishermen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sherna river Noginsk district" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20842/641054.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <p>  Near the Karavaevskaya dam there is a small, never-freezing piece of water.  Here in the early spring there can be a wonderful catch.  True, sometimes fish is not very clean.  Therefore, it is better to use fishing not for an abundant catch, but in order to just relax and enjoy the nature. </p><h2>  Other river activities </h2><p>  On the river you can not only go fishing.  This is an excellent place to just relax against the backdrop of beautiful nature.  Such a vacation is especially beneficial for a Muscovite, exhausted by constant fuss, dirty air, city noise, and fatigue.  Some of the inhabitants of the Moscow region also consider spending time on the river bank as entertainment. </p>

    <p>  You can easily see the beauty of these places.  The Sherna River is very picturesque, the photo of which well conveys the atmosphere of a beautiful natural corner.  Rest here will certainly give strength to everyone. </p><p>  On the river bank there is a recreation center - boarding house "Karabanovo".  Everything is thought out here for active pastime: you can go fishing, sunbathe, take a walk through the forest, pick berries.  The boarding house itself is located in a pine forest, where the air is crystal clear.  The territory of <span>the recreation center</span> has two lakes and itself goes to the shore of Sherna.  No wonder this place was chosen, since here the river is the widest - up to 100 meters. </p><p>  The holiday home is built from environmentally friendly building materials.  Here, an excellent homely atmosphere is recreated, filled with a unique pine smell.  In the house you can relax both families and companies up to six people.  It is two-story, has all the amenities.  The floors of the bathrooms are heated.  You can also use the barbecue.  This is an amazing vacation for the body and peace of mind. </p><h2>  River rafting </h2><p>  For experienced tourists, thirsting for impressions, you can organize rafting on the Sherna River.  The area is ideal for day trips, as well as for people who have never before participated in such sports. </p>

    <p>  Arriving here, a person will never regret it.  There is a beautiful nature, a clean river.  Some places are almost deserted.  So, nothing and no one will interfere with enjoying the nature of the Moscow region.  Also rich vegetation, clear glades will surprise. </p><p>  There are options for organizing corporate rafting.  It is carried out in a game format or in the form of an adventure game.  In just one day you can learn the basics of orienteering (by map, compass or GPS).  And if you guess a few simple puzzles, then the prize will be a metal detector for finding treasure.  At least for some time it will be possible to feel like an archaeologist.  Rafting is carried out on the territory of the Noginsk district from May to October. </p>
