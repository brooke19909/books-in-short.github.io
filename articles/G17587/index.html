You can try to mix different colors.  This is true if you have little fluid needed.  By mixing two completely different shades, you can get a new one that will be even more beautiful and unique.  Of course, for a start it is worth practicing to paint bottles with one color.

It is necessary to carefully paint over all the walls inside the bottle.  At first glance, this may seem impossible.  But this is not so.  So that all surfaces are painted over, you need to turn the bottle in a circle.  After this, the container must be tilted in different directions.  Everything needs to be painted, including the neck.  When the process is completed, the residues should be drained back to the container where the mixing took place. </p><h2>  What's next </h2><p>  To dry the container, you need to put it upside down.  This will allow paint residues to drain down.  Dry the finished product in this position should be exactly as much as indicated on the packaging with color. </p><p>  After some time, the vases will be ready.  Paint can get on the outer walls of the container and dry to the neck.  A solvent may be used to remove excess and streaks. </p><p>  It remains to pour water into the finished vases and put flowers.  This completed the master class.  Vases from bottles fit perfectly into the interior.  It is both original and beautiful. </p><p>  For the manufacture of vases, you can use not only bottles from under expensive alcoholic beverages.  Old decanters and vases are suitable for this, which are a pity to throw away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful vase from a bottle" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/843941.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to crop a glass bottle </h2><p>  If you want to make a classic vase without a narrow neck, then you can cut off all the excess.  To do this, you need cold water, matches, cologne and a skein of thread.  Everything is done very simply.  On the neck of the bottle you need to wind the thread into several folds, and then moisten it in the cologne.  After that, you need to set fire to the material.  In this case, the bottle must be rotated parallel to the earth around its axis.  After some time, hot glass should be splashed with cold water.  The bottle will burst and you will get a neat, even cut.  In this case, the edge of the product will not be sharp. </p><h2>  Another variant </h2><p>  Glass bottles can be put on the original case.  It can be sewn by yourself.  In this case, a lot depends on the fabric, including the effect.  For the bedroom or the living room, you can use containers draped with a translucent organza or shiny satin.  This whole composition should be fixed at the neck level with a neat and beautiful bow. </p><p>  As for the kitchen, it is better to use natural fabrics or textures that resemble the weaving of threads.  There is one more rule.  The pattern, as well as the color of the fabric should be in harmony with those that are already present in the room: with kitchen towels, tablecloths and curtains.  Such covers can be decorated with multi-colored buttons or the original braid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vase pattern" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/843924.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If there is no desire to sew, then you can knit.  In this case, it‚Äôs still easier.  A drawing can be created right in the process of making a case.  It is worth noting that the bottles, dressed in products, knitted or crocheted, look original.  Thanks to them, you can create a more comfortable atmosphere in the house. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Probably, many will agree that a vase from a bottle is an economical and excellent option for decorating a house.  Such products will create a spring mood thanks to bright colors.  To achieve a better result, it is worth using one color for bottles of different shapes.  If you want to diversify the tone of the product, then it is better to use the same capacity parameters.  Then the composition will look perfect. </p>
