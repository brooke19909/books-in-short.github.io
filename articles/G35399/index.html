This entertainment is reminiscent of sledding, only driving is much more convenient and safer, and the speed of descent from the mountain is much greater. </p><h2>  What is tubing? </h2><p>  Tubing is a fashionable entertainment that is available in the winter for everyone on specially equipped bases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realrussia-travel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tubing on Azure, reviews" class="if uuid-2242025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2242025.jpg"></div><p>  The second name for tubing is a cheesecake sled.  This is a modern alternative to ice-skates and sledges on metal runners that get stuck in loose snow, making it difficult to move from the hill.  Tubing glides perfectly even on freshly fluffy snow thanks to a voluminous chamber filled with air. </p><p>  When folded, the rubber tubing is compact.  It can be inflated directly on the hill.  You can ride a tubing from any side of the mountain, hills or quarry.  The only condition is that there should be no obstacles all the way during the descent: snags, stumps, trees, stones protruding from under the snow, and patches of bare land.  Such obstructions can damage the rubberized shell of the cheesecake and cause personal injury. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that tubing bases often do not allow vacationers to use their own "cheesecake" sleds - they need to be rented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tubing on Lazurnoye (see photo in the article) is not only fun pokatushki with a long ice slide, but also a charge of vivacity and good mood.  A fun adventure filled with fervent screams and exclamations when the ‚Äúcheesecakes‚Äù rush one after another down from the very top of the many-meter high slides.  Getting to the start is very convenient on the lift. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.carsclub.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tubing on Lazurnoe, lift" class="if uuid-2241969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2241969.jpg"></div><h2>  Azure in Chelyabinsk: services, mode of operation </h2><p>  Tubing on Lazurny is equipped with two routes with lifts: </p><ul><li>  220 m - blue (with jumps); </li><li>  250 m - yellow (the safest for riding with children). </li></ul><p>  There is an ice rink in the tubing center (skates can be rented here or you can bring your own) and a hockey court. </p><p>  In winter, bathing procedures are a special pleasure.  The Azure bath is excellent, Russian. </p><p>  The complex has its own mini-zoo, which contains foxes, wild boars, and bears. </p><p>  You can stay on vacation at the hotel (pay hourly), have a bite to eat at the cafe.  For those who wish to cook their own barbecue, mangal zones are equipped: indoor and outdoor. </p><p>  The resort complex is open every day, from 10.00 to 22.00.  You can come here not only on holidays or weekends, but also on weekdays, after work.  The territory of the base, including the ski lifts, is well lit in the evening, this creates a special atmosphere of the winter holiday and ensures safety.  Parking is free. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vibirai.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tubing on Lazurnoe, photo" class="if uuid-2242006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2242006.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Tubing on Lazurnoye (Chelyabinsk) can be found by GPS coordinates: 55 ¬∞ 19‚Ä≤10 ‚Ä≥ N - latitude, 61 ¬∞ 37‚Ä≤55 ‚Ä≥ E - longitude. </p><p>  The resort complex is 25 km from Chelyabinsk and 190 km from Yekaterinburg.  If you go from Chelyabinsk along the M51 towards Kurgan, then in the Mirny district you need to turn onto the ChKAD (bypass road) towards Yekaterinburg, after 12 km, turn to Lazurnoye in accordance with the signpost and drive across the Miass River over the bridge.  After 300 meters, the road turns left and leads to a tubing base. </p><p>  You can get there by public transport - minibus No. 727 goes to the base from the Heat Engineering Institute. </p><h2>  Reviews for tubing in Lazurny </h2><p>  In winter, tubing on Lazurny is very popular.  Guest reviews add up to this big picture: </p><ul><li>  the place is very good; </li><li>  having come here once, you come back again and again; </li><li>  One hour of skating is enough for pleasure, and then you can go ice skating, go with the child to the mini zoo. </li></ul><p>  Of the negative points, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  on holidays, very long lines at the cash desk; </li><li>  very high cost of payment at the hotel: 1 thousand rubles for the first hour, payment of 500 rubles.  for each next hour also does not add optimism; </li><li>  the cafe is expensive; </li><li>  parking on the territory of the tubing center itself is free, but entry into the territory is sometimes paid (100 rubles). </li></ul><p>  Tubing is a wonderful view of mass relaxation.  They come to tubing facilities by families and large companies.  This modern type of <span>winter entertainment</span> obeys any age <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tovaryplus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tubing on Lazurnoye (Chelyabinsk)" class="if uuid-2241973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46186/2241973.jpg"></div><h2>  Security measures </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the descent from the track is safe, according to vacationers, there are serious collisions at the turn leading to the braking zone.  This happens when the safe distance between those who descend is not observed. </p><p>  Such situations are especially dangerous for children.  And even the descent of a child in the same tubing with adults does not always guarantee absolute safety.  In a collision from a blow, hematomas, bruises and even injuries can be obtained.  Therefore, care must be taken, given the sliding speed. </p><p>  To ensure safety, those responsible for organizing pokatuski send tubing with a time interval and on different sides of the route. </p><p>  If the collision did occur, you need to group by picking up your legs and head.  Huge tubings provide good impact protection. </p><p>  Tubing on Lazurny gives only positive emotions and a charge of vivacity for the whole year. </p>
