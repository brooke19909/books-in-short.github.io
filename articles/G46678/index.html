  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What you need to know before traveling by train Cherepovets - Adler</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The popular resort of Sochi, and with it its southern tip Adler, are connected by rail with all the major cities of western Russia.  And Cherepovets of the <span>Vologda Oblast</span> is no exception.  Residents of the city have the opportunity to get to the Black Sea resort without any changes.  After all, there is a train 281 Cherepovets - Adler.  Since the beginning of 2018, his number has changed, now he is No. 282 I. </p><p>  In this article we will tell you all about this composition.  Indeed, between the cities of Cherepovets and Adler, there were 2146 long kilometers.  And the passengers of the 282 train will have to cover a greater distance - 2392 km.  One way or another, but it becomes clear that the road for passengers is not far off.  Therefore, interest in the conditions under which the trip will take place is quite justified.  We studied the reviews of passengers and therefore we can give an answer regarding the level of service in the composition of No. 282 I. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.train-photo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Cherepovets Adler" class="if uuid-2236529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2236529.jpg"></div><h2>  The route of the train Cherepovets - Adler </h2><p>  The composition path is close to a straight line, although at first it makes a hook east to reach the regional center - Vologda.  On the way, the train makes stops in Sheksna, Chebsar and Kipelovo.  Next, the train turns in the right direction, that is, directly to the south.  So he reaches Yaroslavl and Rostov.  Then the train makes its way to Moscow, but does not make a single stop either in the capital of Russia or in its suburbs.  This happens in the evening, so passengers are unlikely to enjoy the views. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first stop after Rostov-Yaroslavsky is in Ryazan.  Then the train Cherepovets - Adler follows through Michurinsk to Voronezh.  Then, through Novocherkassk, the train holds the way to Rostov-on-Don.  Having reached the south of Russia, the train begins to make frequent stops.  This, as tourists write in reviews, is very convenient.  After all, not everyone goes to rest in Adler.  After Krasnodar, the composition makes stops at such popular resorts as Goryachiy Klyuch, Tuapse, Lazarevskaya, Loo, Sochi and Hosta. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": Semmka, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Cherepovets Adler reviews" class="if uuid-2236533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2236533.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel time </h2><p>  From Cherepovets, the train leaves daily at 10:40.  And the train reaches the final destination of the route in one day - at 9:22.  Thus, the travel time is 46 hours and 42 minutes.  Almost two days!  But the train schedule Cherepovets - Adler is designed in such a way that all the most interesting outside the window floats at night.  At the end of the first day of the journey, passengers reach Moscow, but they don‚Äôt really see it, because there is no stopping time.  In the same way, the Black Sea coast most passengers happily wake up. </p><p>  In Tuapse, the train arrives at 5:54, in Lazarevskoye at seven in the morning, and in Loo at 8:14.  True, there is an opportunity to look at Sochi.  The train station reaches the main Russian resort at 8:46.  But those who want to get off at this station should hurry up: a stop in Sochi lasts only five minutes.  In the Host, and even less - two minutes.  In total, the train makes thirty-six stops along the way.  The longest, as much as 35 minutes, he lingers at the Goryachiy Klyuch station near Krasnodar.  This happens late at night, from 3:45 to 4:20. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="rail-club.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Cherepovets Adler route" class="if uuid-2236541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2236541.jpg"></div><h2>  Return route (282 ) </h2><p>  It is completely identical to the Cherepovets-Adler train route.  Passengers liked that the train leaves the resort in the afternoon, or rather at 17:39.  This makes it possible to spend the morning on the beach, and vacationers south of Adler drive up to the station without haste.  But Moscow, the passengers of the train will still not be able to see.  The train arrives in Ryazan at one in the morning, and at the next station, Rostov, at 8:43.  At the same time, the train in the opposite direction takes longer and spends 47 hours and 35 minutes on the way.  On the way, the train makes the same stops.  But the longest delayed this time, not in the Hot Key, but in Yaroslavl.  A stop at the train station of this city will last 50 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="goldvoice.club" data-author=": @alex-zi, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train 281 Cherepovets Adler" class="if uuid-2236562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2236562.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions and comfort </h2><p>  The train Cherepovets - Adler in the reviews is characterized as clean and not yet broken.  Conductors accept electronic tickets.  The staff is well-trained, polite and friendly.  Tourists are also happy to note that dry closets are installed in the cars, which do not close at numerous stops.  In addition, the cars have a scoreboard.  They show not only the time and name of the next stop, but also the temperature overboard, as well as a busy toilet or free. </p><p>  As for the operation of air conditioners, the opinions of passengers were divided.  To some, the temperature in the wagons seemed too low.  The reviews say that in the summer you can catch a cold.  But other passengers complain about the heat and stuffiness.  Out of season, leaving unanimous assurance of those who left reviews, traveling in the 282 train is a pleasure.  Rarely does anyone travel from one destination to another.  But in the summer there are numerous and, alas, ill-bred children who are able to spoil the trip even to passengers of the most comfortable cars.  But these claims are already against parents, and not against Russian Railways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tutu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cherepovets Adler marshrrut" class="if uuid-2238176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2238176.jpg"></div><h2>  The cost of the train Cherepovets - Adler </h2><p>  In the reviews, travelers complain that there are no luxury cars.  The choice is limited to reserved seat and coupe.  For the first type of carriage, tickets are sold at affordable prices.  An adult can get from the end to the end of the route without benefits for 3768 rubles.  The compartment in the train Cherepovets - Adler is almost twice as expensive.  The price of an adult ticket is 6143 rubles. </p>
