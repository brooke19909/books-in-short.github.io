It is famous not only for the <span>labyrinth of the Minotaur</span> and the cave of Zeus, but also for its very special traditions, nature, songs, and national dishes.  You can stay in a quiet cute little hotel Elpida Village 3 *.  Greece, the island of Crete, the region of Lassithi will be at your fingertips, because it is located on a hillside.  They offer excellent service, comfortable rooms, friendly staff.  And breathtaking views of the bay, valley and plateau of Lassithi will be a pleasant bonus for you and every day will give a wonderful mood. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Please note that in this article we only give information about the Elpida Village 3 * hotel, located in Crete, in the village of Istro, near the village of Kalo Horio (in Greek it is pronounced ‚ÄúKalo Horiyo‚Äù and means ‚Äúgood village‚Äù).  From here, the famous Cretan city of Agios Nikolaos is 8 km away.  Previously, the hotel in question was called Elpida Apartments, which can also be found on some maps and in brochures.  This causes confusion and confusion, since with the same name in Crete there is another hotel located near Heraklion, in the village of Gouves.  From the considered Elpida Village 3 * it is about 60 km to the west.  Another difference is that Gouves lies just on the coast of the <span>Cretan Sea,</span> and the village of Istro lies on the shore of its wonderful Gulf of Mirabello, in the Lassithi Valley.  Near the hotel there is a road along which there are many cafes, taverns and shops, and around vineyards, orange orchards, olive groves and mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elpida village 3" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1558236.jpg" width="503"></div>

It is called Nikos Kazantzakis.  Here tourists are met by representatives of travel agencies, escorted to comfortable transfers, which deliver them to the place.  The route is 65 km long, but since the area in Crete is mountainous and there are few direct roads, without stopping anywhere, you can get to the hotel in only 40 minutes.  With stops, the path can stretch for more than 2 hours.  Tourists traveling around tour agencies from the airport can take a bus to the bus station A, which is near the port, and then transfer to the bus in the direction of Agios Nikolaos.  Another option is to take a taxi from the airport. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Elpida Village 3 * (Crete) is a separate two-story and three-story cottages surrounded by a wonderful garden.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  In Crete, an incredible number of small, hidden from prying eyes wild beaches, and large, well-maintained, probably more than a dozen.  At 800 meters from one of them, bearing the name of St. Panteleimon, is Elpida Village 3 *.  Lassithi is a beautiful area with a heterogeneous relief.  The path to the coast from the hotel, you can say plain, runs along the highway and through the village.  Slightly short of the coast there is a fork.  One path leads to a well-maintained beach.  Here the coating is sandy with pebbles, the sea is almost always transparent, only if the wind blows, it becomes slightly cloudy.  On the beach there are paid sun loungers and umbrellas, cabins, toilets, showers.  Another path will lead to an unfavorable beach.  The role of umbrellas here is performed by pine trees, there are no sunbeds, only sand and sea.  However, this piece of coast is more rocky. </p><p>  The location of the beach in the bay determines that the water here is slightly warmer than in the open areas of the Cretan Sea, and warms up by mid-May.  The climate in this part of the island is subtropical.  It is hot in summer, during the day the air can warm up in the shade to +35 ¬∞ C, and in the sun you feel like a fish in a pan.  In spring and autumn it is warm enough here, you can swim in the sea even in October, and the tanning season opens in April. </p><p>  The winds in this region of Crete begin to blow hard and drive a wave somewhere in August.  Then the sea loses its transparency, and for surfers comes paradise.  In May and June it is mostly quiet here, which is appreciated by lovers of a ‚Äúseal‚Äù beach holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elpida Village 3 Lassithi" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1558235.jpg" width="505"></div>
