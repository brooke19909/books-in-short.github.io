Water temperature varies from 20 ¬∞ to 90 ¬∞ C.  The latter is used for children's things with digestion elements.  Noise level - 56 decibels.

After the end of the operation, the device alerts with a sound signal.  At maximum load, the drum performs 1000 rpm. </p><h2>  Security and advanced features </h2><p>  Leakage protection is the case.  <span>The Indesit</span> IWUC 4105 <span>washing machine</span> is equipped with a drum imbalance sensor.

    <h2>  Modes </h2><p>  The Indesit IWUC 4105 model (instructions are included) is equipped with 13 automatic washing programs.  Among them there are modes for delicate and woolen fabrics.  They are designed for maximum protection of things from damage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  I especially want to highlight some of the programs that the device is equipped with.  For example, washing jeans and sportswear.  According to customer reviews, the car in these modes copes with the task.  "Express rinse" is necessary when washing jackets and down jackets.  In this mode, water is heated to 40 ¬∞ C.  It is thanks to this that things are perfectly rinsed from the powder.  Equally important is the Express-15 program.  In time, it takes 15 minutes.  Thanks to the ‚ÄúStain Removal‚Äù function, things are cleaned qualitatively, but delicately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine indesit iwuc 4105 reviews" class="if" height="478" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1381493.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Indesit IWUC 4105, customer reviews of which reveal strengths, has earned a fairly good reputation in its price segment.  What are the advantages of this unit?  The highest advantage is the dimensions.  With a width of 33 cm, it can be installed in a small apartment.  Simplicity in operation also caused the model to become quite popular.  The control panel is intuitive.  All buttons and levers are signed.  Most buyers respond positively to the appliance, highlighting the excellent quality of washing things.  For those who spend little time at home, the "Express mode" becomes the most popular.  This program is designed for everyday washing, and takes only 15 minutes.  What is also important, the Indesit IWUC 4105 washing machine, the reviews of the owners confirm this, it is configured in such a way that it is possible to individually control the spin speed and the water temperature.  What surprised many buyers was the size of the drum and hatch.  With a small width, the capacity is quite large.  The diameter of the hatch allows you to easily lay things of different sizes. </p><h2>  Cons washing machine </h2><p>  So, the time has come to talk about the shortcomings of the Indesit trademark device.  The first thing that distinguishes the largest part of buyers is the noise.  During washing, the machine is almost inaudible, but when you turn on the rinse and spin mode, the machine starts to produce too loud sound.  And sometimes it even turns into a whistle.  Also among buyers there are complaints about the quality of rinsing.  Unfortunately, very often a lot of detergent remains in things, which is why you have to constantly use the Super Rinse function, and this leads to additional energy costs.  Significant disadvantages include vibration, its level is significantly increased if the spin mode on the Indesit IWUC 4105 washing machine is turned on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="indesit iwuc 4105 instruction" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1381492.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Opinions of people about the device were divided.  Some of them respond only positively, others highlight many negative aspects.  As a rule, almost everyone at the beginning of use does not notice any shortcomings in the washing machine.  However, a little later, this is especially noticeable when washing heavy things, the Indesit IWUC 4105 machine shifts by several centimeters during spinning.  If it is installed in the bathroom, where the floor is tiled, the distance can increase to 10 cm, and sometimes more.  Moreover, according to consumers, even silicone foot pads do not help solve this problem. </p>
