The deepest station</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Chernyshevskaya metro station of the Kirov-Vyborg line of the <span>St. Petersburg metro</span> received the first passengers in the fall of 1958.  It opened on the stretch between the stations "Ploshchad Vosstaniya" and <span>"Ploshchad Lenina"</span> on the section of the first line of the Leningrad metro that was already operational by then.  The stage on which the Chernyshevskaya metro station is located has gone down in the history of domestic metro construction as one of the most difficult and deepest sections.  The difficulties metro builders had to overcome here were unprecedented.  And the engineering and construction experience subsequently proved to be invaluable for the implementation of other projects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro Chernyshevskaya" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/303335.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  Metro "Chernyshevskaya" on the city map </h2><p>  The main difficulty in building the stage in the direction of the right-bank part of the city was the need to overcome a water obstacle.  The tunnel under the Neva was built by the caisson method, this ensured the safety of work and the reliability of the constructed engineering structures.  The Chernyshevskaya metro station was commissioned only after the main engineering problem was solved - the entire site passing under the Neva was stable.  All subsequent tunnels of the Leningrad Metro, passing under the river bottom, were built using similar technology.  Structurally, the Chernyshevskaya metro station is a three-vaulted pylon structure of deep occurrence.  Until December 2011, when the Admiralteyskaya station of the Frunze-Primorsky line was commissioned, it remained the deepest station in the city.  The central hall of Chernyshevskaya is reduced along the center line compared to the standard length.  The architectural appearance of the station is distinguished by strict lines and laconic forms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernyshevskaya metro on the map" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/303752.jpg" width="496"></div>  This is due to the fact that it was erected during the period known in Soviet history and culture as the “Struggle with architectural excesses”.  Marble and granite of light gray and dark colors predominate in the decorative interiors.  The thematic concept of the station design is the revolutionary struggle of the Russian democrats of the nineteenth century.  Accordingly, the name is given by the nearby Chernyshevsky Avenue.  But the thematic content was minimized by the ongoing struggle against excesses.  Its traces can be seen only in the ornaments of decorative ventilation grilles and in the lobby, decorated with a relief portrait of Chernyshevsky. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peter metro Chernyshevskaya" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/303334.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <h2>  Historical Peter, metro station "Chernyshevskaya" </h2><p>  It would not be an exaggeration to say that Chernyshevskaya has long become one of the peculiar city attractions.  This is due to its good location among the characteristic St. Petersburg historical quarters.  They have not changed much since the nineteenth century.  Indigenous Petersburgers and guests of the northern capital are very sympathetic to this area, where cafes, restaurants, cinemas and other cultural and leisure facilities are located in abundance.  And the way here traditionally lies through the lobby of the Chernyshevskaya metro station. </p>
