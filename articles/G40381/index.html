    <p>  A hybrid tray is a tray for SIM cards and flash cards.  It usually has two compartments. </p><p>  You can insert, for example, two SIM cards into the hybrid tray: one with favorable Internet, the other with a favorable tariff for calls and SMS messages.  Or one SIM card and one flash card to expand the memory, if you do not have enough built-in. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of smartphones is not much different.  These devices are very similar in appearance, but there are some differences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Perhaps only one design will help determine what you choose - <span>Redmi 4 or Redmi Note 4</span> .  Especially if performance is not important to you.  Look at the comparisons: </p><ol><li>  <em>Body color</em> .  Xiaomi Redmi 4 can be purchased in three colors: gold, silver and gray. <br>  But Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is richer in color.  Initially, only gold, silver and gray models were produced.  A little later, in the current 2017 year, the company added two more colors - black and dark blue.  An important nuance: these colors are available only for smartphones of new versions: model 3/32 GB (for black) and 3/64 GB (for dark blue). </li><li>  <em>The color of the front panel.</em>  The front panel of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 was originally black or gold (for gray and gold cases, respectively).  In the new version, 3/32 GB added a version of the smartphone with a white front panel.  For Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, the front panel can be obtained in white (for light cases) and in black colors (for dark cases). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi note 4" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60189/2020888.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  <em>Frames</em> .  It is not known for what reason, but the black frames on the screen annoy everyone.  They are found on both Xiaomi models.  The version of the "Note", however, has less scope.  This is noticeable to the naked eye.  If you can not stand the framework, but want to buy <span>Redmi 4 or Redmi Note 4</span> , then the second option will suit you more.  In order not to notice the frame at all, it is worth taking a version with a dark body and a black front panel. </li><li>  <em>Panels</em> .  Both Redmi 4 and Redmi Note 4 have panels on the top and bottom of the case. The first device almost matches their color with the case. The second panel is clearly outlined with light stripes. </li></ol><p>  In general, Redmi 4 and Redmi Note 4 are similar.  There are no significant differences in them, so the design should not become a determining factor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  In terms of external characteristics, the difference is also small.  Look at the comparisons of both gadgets: </p><ul><li>  <em>Body material.</em>  <em>"</em> Redmi 4" and "Redmi Note 4" are made of high quality metal.  The sides of the phones are also made of metal.  The material of the bottom panel is metal.  But the top ones are different: the ‚ÄúRedmi 4‚Äù they are made of plastic, and the ‚ÄúRedmi Note 4‚Äù - made of metal. <em></em></li><li>  <em>Camera.</em>  Both smartphones are located in the center.  The Redmi 4 has a flash on the side of the camera, while the Redmi Note 4 has a flash under the camera. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="redmi note 4 4 ‚Äã‚Äã64gb" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60189/2020871.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  <em>Fingerprint scanner.</em>  Both smartphones have a modern feature - fingerprint unlock.  Note that smartphones are budget, so the scanner on them is just a godsend. <br>  Do not think that if the phone is not expensive, then the function works every other time.  This is not true.  According to reviews and video reviews of real users, the scanner works no worse than on models of leading brands.  The detail of both smartphones is located behind the camera. </li><li>  <em>Infrared port.</em>  And the company Xiaomi delivered such a detail on its budget smartphones.  It is located at the end from above.  By installing one special program, you can use your device as a remote control. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, there are differences in the body only in the location of the flash and in the materials of the upper panel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  But this is the most significant difference between these smartphones.  Xiaomi Redmi <span data-mce-mark="1">4 has a five-inch screen, while the X <span data-mce-mark="1">iaomi Redmi Note 4 boasts a 5.5-inch diagonal.</span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">"Redmi 4" is suitable for all people.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Its size is standard, compact.</span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">You can ‚Äúsit‚Äù in a smartphone with just one hand.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">With your fingers you reach any corner of the screen.</span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">"Redmi Note 4" - a smartphone for fans of "shovels."</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">It will not be easy to control it with one hand, especially for girls.</span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The diagonal of the screen is something that may already affect your choice.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">If you want a convenient, average smartphone for simple tasks - take Redmi 4. Want a ‚Äúshovel‚Äù on which you can comfortably play and watch movies, choose <span data-mce-mark="1">a Redmi Note 4 smartphone.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">If you still think what to buy - Redmi 4 or Redmi Note 4, pay attention to the specifications.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This is the most important aspect in choosing a device.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Separately, it must be said about memory.</span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><br></span> </p><p>  The amount of memory is operational.  Redmi 4 exists with only 2 GB or 3 GB of RAM.  Users of modern devices 3 GB will suffice, as they say, with a head.  2 GB is not enough, but if you buy a smartphone for simple tasks, then this will be enough for you. </p><p>  Note-version is more modern: you can get as much as 4 GB of RAM.  But you can also take 2 and 3. </p>

    <p>  The Xiaomi company puts medium-quality cameras on budget smartphones.  If you do not need a camera phone, then both models, and Redmi 4, and Redmi Note 4, you can buy.  If the camera is a priority, take a look at other manufacturers - ‚ÄúMeise‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeeko‚Äù and others. </p><h2>  How much and where to buy </h2><p>  Xiaomi smartphones can be bought in Russia in the Rumikom company store.  Here, "Redmi 4" in the 2/16 GB version can be purchased for 10,000-11,000 rubles.  For "Redmi Note 4" will have to pay from 12,000 to 16,000 rubles, depending on the version. </p><p>  You can also order Xiaomi smartphones on the Aliexpress website.  Here it can be purchased cheaper.  And if you use the cashback service, then save even more.  True, you have to wait.  Sellers guarantee 1-2 months, but usually parcels arrive faster in a couple of weeks. </p>

    <p>  However, be careful.  In early 2017, some parcels with Xiaomi smartphones were not passed, sending back to the seller.  In this case, people did not receive a smartphone, but were able to return the money. </p><h2>  Choosing the best smartphone </h2><p>  To summarize the comparison of the two phones Xiaomi Redmi 4 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. </p><p>  Both smartphones can really be called brothers.  They are similar in appearance and even filling. </p><p>  Both "Redmi" with minimal characteristics are suitable for simple tasks: social networks, instant messengers, calls.  It will not work to load several applications at the same time, since the smartphone will begin to "slow down". </p><p>  Redmi 4 and Redmi Note 4 at 32/3 are the best option for everyone.  It suits the needs of modern applications and copes with a large number of tasks. </p><p>  But only 4 has a 4/64 GB version.  This amount of memory will be even more than enough. </p>
