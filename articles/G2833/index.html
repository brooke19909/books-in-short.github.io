  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hanzfeld Method and other hallucinations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The inhabitants of the Internet are not amused, if I may say so.  There is a lot of discussion on the forums about how to cause various hallucinations, however, the presence of such can be a sign of serious mental deviations, in the worst case, and at best, a signal that it is time to rest.  The Hanzfeld method is used more likely to experiment with oneself; its essence is as follows. </p><p>  You need to take a tennis ball and divide it into two equal parts.  Further, as the Hanzfeld method says, you need to turn on the radio on a non-existent wave, where there are only hissing sounds (for this purpose, TV is also suitable).  We lie down, put balls on the eyes, glue them and wait.  The forum is also advised to turn off the lights or do it at night. </p><p>  After a certain time, the Hanzfeld method begins to work, and the subject has hallucinations, and quite strong ones.  So, a person can see horses, other animals or even talk with relatives who are not alive. </p><p>  The Hanzfeld method is in doubt among many skeptics, and this is entirely justified.  So, one visitor to the forum wrote that no visions were observed, he simply fell asleep.  Therefore, it is necessary to make a remark - this experiment will be interesting only to people with developed imagination, who most often see vivid and memorable dreams. </p><p>  However, the Hanzfeld method is not always the reason why visual hallucinations appear.  They can visit us during the day in a completely ordinary environment - muddy spots, dots, fog, stripes.  All this can be a consequence of the tiredness of the body, and such visions belong to the class of simple ones. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for complex hallucinations, they are divided into several types: </p><p>  - zoological - when images of various animals appear; </p><p>  - demonomanic - a vision of nonexistent, folkloric characters, whether they are goblin, mermaid, devil, etc. </p><p>  - anthropomorphic - visual hallucinations associated with loved ones, acquaintances and strangers, surviving or deceased; </p><p>  - scene-like - the appearance of images flowing from each other, representing a certain chain of actions; </p><p>  - endoscopic - the representation of foreign organisms or things inside our body (worms inside the head, for example). </p><p>  Hypnopompic hallucinations, that is, those associated with the moment of awakening from sleep, are no less mysterious.  It is not known at what stage of sleep they arise, but such visions last after we woke up, usually not for long. </p><p>  After awakening, hypnopompic hallucinations may be accompanied by <span>carotid paralysis.</span>  Its essence is that the body is completely immobilized, sometimes speech disappears.  This is due to the fact that changes occur in the body during rest, because of which we are not eager to do everything we see in a dream - our body simply does not allow this to be done.  When we wake up, the body is still awake for a short while. </p><p>  In this condition, everything that is around is realized, but fertile ground is created for the appearance of hallucinations, similar to dreams.  This situation is horrifying, and most people never experience it, some several times in their lives.  Those who suffer from disorders are more prone to sleep paralysis.  He explains the testimonies of many people who see entities, angels, people, hear voices in the morning after waking up. </p><p>  Especially for skeptics and experiment lovers, there is another effect that is quite simple to perform.  You must have two comers and <span>blindfolds.</span>  One blindfolded man sits on a chair behind the other and starts stroking his partner‚Äôs nose and nose at the same time.  After some time, the subject in a bandage creates the feeling that he has a very <span>long nose.</span>  This effect is called Pinocchio's illusion.  Such hallucinations are more harmless, but you should not abuse either one or the other. </p>
