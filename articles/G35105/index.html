The popularity of the latter is noticeably lower than brand-new smartphones, but push-button devices have their undeniable advantages. </p><p>  Among the obvious advantages can be noted the low cost of devices, long battery life and ease of management.  It is also worth noting the distinctive operational features of gadgets in the cold.  If, for example, a mobile phone with buttons and a large screen appears on the street at minus 40 degrees, then you can still call it.  While sensory devices completely refuse to work in such a frost. </p><p>  Of course, push-button devices lack the capabilities that smartphones have.  But a considerable part of consumers prefers just them.  A push-button <span>telephone with a large screen</span> for the elderly is becoming almost the best source of communication.  Information is clearly visible on it, and mechanical keys are more understandable and convenient for the older generation.  In addition, many business people opt for cell phones with buttons and a large screen.  They do not need extra bells and whistles - only stable communication and reliable operation.  This is just what most button gadgets can please. </p><p>  But even despite the reduction of this segment, getting confused in the variety of models in stores is quite easy, especially for an inexperienced user.  We will try to understand this issue and designate the best push-button telephones with a large screen (diagonal&gt; 2.0 ‚Äù), which are distinguished by their quality component and positive feedback from consumers.  Let's start with the manufacturers, and continue with specific models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  The leadership in this segment is held by four venerable brands - Samsung, Noika, Philips, and LG.  Judging by user reviews, phones with buttons and a large screen from these manufacturers have distinguished themselves by extremely high-quality assembly, modern ‚Äústuffing‚Äù and are well balanced in terms of price / performance. </p><p>  Also worth paying attention to the second-tier brands.  Judging by the same consumer reviews, phones with buttons and a large screen from manufacturers Alkatel, Fly and Mikromax are enviable.  Feedback from users about the products of these brands is ambiguous, so the series should be chosen wisely, because mediocre models often slip here. </p><p>  It is better not to count on third-tier manufacturers.  Most of all models released are in the bin in a week or two.  Yes, they cost a penny, but as such there is no practical benefit when buying.  It is much more interesting to take some mediocre cell phone with a large screen, for example, from Nokia for three thousand rubles and use it until you get tired, and not change the ultra-budget model that crumbles in your hands every month for a thousand.  But despite the abundance of frank hack in the segment, sometimes adequate gadgets come across, albeit with rare exceptions. </p><p>  Next, we consider specific mobile phones with a large screen on the button control. </p><h2>  Fly TS113 </h2><p>  One of the most remarkable features of the gadget is the presence of three SIM card slots at once.  Therefore, this large-screen phone will be an excellent choice for business people and other users who carefully choose services from different operators. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fly-phone.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone fly" class="if uuid-2360967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2360967.jpg"></div><p>  As for the display, on a diagonal of 2.8 inches all the information is clearly visible, and if desired, the visualization can be significantly improved by increasing the font and size of the icons.  So this is a great <span>big screen</span> phone for seniors. </p><p>  The case of the gadget is made of matte plastic and comes in two versions - in white or black colors.  The device‚Äôs interface works quite smartly, users do not note any slowdowns or lags in their reviews.  Some owners complain about the creaking of the case, but there are no critical shortcomings here. </p><p>  In addition, the gadget received support for the wireless Bluetooth protocol, FM radio, and an MP3 player.  As a fly in the ointment here is a modest battery capacity - 1000 mAh.  If you actively use all the functionality, the device will start asking for a socket in a couple of days, which is not the best indicator for a push-button phone with a large screen.  But if you use the device only as a "dialer", then the battery life significantly increases. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 1500 rubles. </p><h2>  Nokia 3310 Dual SIM (2017) </h2><p>  The original device from the venerable brand was introduced back in 2000.  Legends still circulate about its remarkable ‚Äútenacious‚Äù features.  The new phone with a large screen received the same properties: it will survive serious falls, shocks and other bullying by the user. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lelong.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new nokia" class="if uuid-2360962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2360962.jpg"></div><p>  The manufacturer as close as possible the exterior of the new model to the design of the old.  Despite this, the gadget looks fresh and attracts the eye.  Fans of something rainbow will surely appreciate the variety of colors of the device.  The phone with a large screen received a diagonal of 2.1 inches, which is enough for normal data visualization.  Separately, it should be noted that in the settings you can increase the font and size of the icons.  Therefore, we can also say that this is a great big screen phone for the elderly. </p><p>  The gadget's interface works quite smartly and does not differ in slowdowns.  The set has everything you need for calls and SMS, as well as the legendary "snake".  As for battery life, everything is also good here.  The device received a capacious 1200 mAh battery.  As such, it does not have consumption points, except for calls and SMS, so the battery life varies within a week. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 4000 rubles. </p><h2>  LG G360 </h2><p>  This is a very good clamshell phone with a large screen from the famous brand.  One of the main distinguishing features of the gadget is its diagonal.  From the three-inch display, all information is perfectly readable.  Also in the settings there is a mode for the elderly, which significantly increases the font and size of the icons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clamshell lg" class="if uuid-2360963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2360963.jpg"></div><p>  The device got a matrix quite adequate with natural color rendition and high brightness and contrast indicators.  So you can even see the information on the display even in direct sunlight.  The model is perfect for both lovers of quality vintage clamshells and elderly users with low vision. </p><p>  As for battery life, the battery capacity of 950 mAh is enough for 13 hours of continuous talking or for 3-4 days of operation in mixed mode.  Some users complain about the high cost of the clamshell, but the high-quality assembly, excellent communication and a good display more than justify the price. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 4,500 rubles. </p><h2>  Alcatel One Touch 2012D </h2><p>  Another clamshell, but from a second-tier brand.  Despite its modest cost, this is a very good push-button phone with a large screen and a good camera.  The latter received a high-quality matrix of 3 megapixels, which allows you to take decent photos in good light.  Naturally, you won‚Äôt get a high-resolution picture, but for posts on social networks there‚Äôs enough detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.csmobiles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clamshell" class="if uuid-2360965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2360965.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the dimensions of the device.  The device turned out to be surprisingly compact: 107 mm high, 64 mm wide, and the case thickness is only 14 mm, which is very good for this form factor.  In pluses, you can also record weight - 98 grams.  He does not burden a pocket of a shirt or blouse, and does not ‚Äúget heavier‚Äù even after an hour of use on weight. </p><p>  On a large 2.8-inch display, all information is clearly visible.  For elderly and visually impaired users, a special mode with large fonts and icons is provided.  There is also an MP3 player, a wireless Bluetooth protocol (version 3.0 is not supported) and a radio.  The device supports two SIM cards, and there are no questions to the communication side.  The 750 mAh battery is quietly enough for a couple of days in mixed mode. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 1500 rubles. </p><h2>  Fly ff245 </h2><p>  The push-button telephone from Fly does not differ in its refined design or good filling, but it boasts its practicality.  Here we have a good screen with a diagonal of 2.4 inches, a couple of slots for SIM cards, mini-jacks for a headset and a price that is quite adequate for the available characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xphone24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="push button fly" class="if uuid-2360975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2360975.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main highlights of the device is the battery life.  On board the device there is a rechargeable battery for 3700 mAh, which is more than enough for the ‚Äúbutton player‚Äù.  As a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, it can work for weeks without recharging.  And in active load lasts up to four days. </p><p>  Information on the display is easy to read.  There are no special modes for visually impaired users here, but you can increase the font by putting one of the themes with slightly enlarged letters and icons.  The model is completely and completely worth the money, and it can be taken at least as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù because of the long battery life. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 2000 rubles. </p><h2>  Philips Xenium E570 </h2><p>  Models from the venerable Philips brand have long been not uncommon in the budget segment.  A good half of users probably already know from their own experience that almost all of the company's devices are burdened with a quality component and deserve close attention.  The Xenium E570 series was no exception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.svyaznoy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phillips phone" class="if uuid-2360961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2360961.jpg"></div><p>  For relatively little money, you get a great gadget.  The push-button telephone has a large 2.8-inch display on a good matrix with normal color reproduction, as well as with high brightness and contrast.  Judging by the reviews, users have no questions about the build quality: nothing creaks, crunches, and does not play.  The appearance of the device also inspires respect, therefore, to call such a visual style budget just the language does not turn. </p><p>  Another distinctive feature of the push-button telephone is a capacious 3160 mAh battery.  Synthetic tests showed that it lasts for almost two days of continuous conversation.  In mixed mode, the device can easily work for a couple of weeks.  It charges, of course, for a very long time, but nothing will happen with the power supply left for the night. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the phone has wireless Bluetooth protocols, FM radio and an MP3 player.  There are also no questions to the communication part: the communication is stable and is limited only by the capabilities of the mobile operator. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 4500 rubles. </p><h2>  BQ-3201 Option </h2><p>  The model is positioned by the manufacturer primarily as a device with a large screen.  A diagonal of 3.2 inches is more than enough for a push-button phone.  The matrix device got sensible: natural color reproduction, high brightness and contrast, and all information is easily read from the display even on a bright sunny day.  There is also a mode for visually impaired users with an increase in fonts and icons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="magazilla.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="big screen phone" class="if uuid-2360964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2360964.jpg"></div><p>  The phone case is relatively thin and fits well in the palm of your hand.  Build quality is quite acceptable: creaking occasionally happens, but nothing critical.  The appearance of the device also inspires respect: contrasting areas and an attractive keyboard along with minimalism and rigor do not allow calling the device budget.  On sale you can find three color options: white, black and golden. </p><p>  As for battery life, here the device did not disappoint.  The capacity of the 1750 mAh battery is enough for several days of use.  If you use the gadget only as a "dialer", then a week of work is guaranteed.  Communication capabilities are also at a high level: communication is stable plus there is support for the wireless Bluetooth protocol. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 2200 rubles. </p><h2>  Vkworld stone v3 </h2><p>  This model is just the case when little-known manufacturers produce a noteworthy series.  Of course, he does not reach the best aforementioned devices, but he can offer a lot to its owner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alexnld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="protected phone" class="if uuid-2360966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2360966.jpg"></div><p>  One of the distinguishing features of the phone is its high level of protection.  The word "Stone" in the name is present for a reason.  It can be dropped, hit and even drowned (but without fanaticism).  IP54 phone protection will be very useful for active users and travelers. </p><p>  Another significant trump card gadget - a rechargeable battery.  The 5200 mAh battery capacity is more than enough for any need.  On one charge, the phone can work for more than a month.  If you properly load the device, then the battery life will be reduced to three weeks.  But this is an excellent indicator for a button gadget. </p><h2>  Phone Features </h2><p>  In the advantages of the model, you can also record a large screen.  A diagonal of 2.1 inches is enough for normal data visualization.  The matrix does not shine with good color reproduction and high brightness with contrast, but the information from the display is normally read on a sunny day somewhere in the shade.  There are no questions about the interface: applications smoothly open and work without brakes and lags. </p><p>  The communication capabilities of the device are also at an acceptable level: the connection is stable, the wireless Bluetooth protocol works as it should.  As a bonus, there is an adequate FM receiver, an MP3 player and the ability to connect external SD cards. </p><p>  Some users in their reviews complain about a slightly confusing menu and the same obscure control.  If you switch to the model from other, more "noble" gadgets, then at first you will have to get used to branches and transitions, because the latter are mostly in unusual places.  For the rest, this is a completely sensible model with an adequate cost. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 3000 rubles. </p>
