It is located just over a kilometer from the village of Maloe Sadovoye.  The name of the cape is translated as "Tower Cape", and not in vain.  The amazing Syuyren fortress stands on it.  To this day, it is one of the most poorly studied, mysterious and mysterious buildings of ancient Crimea. </p>

    <h2>  Misterious story </h2><p>  Until now, scientists do not know in what year or at least a century Syuyrensky fortress was built.  Most historians adhere to the time period between the VI-XII centuries, namely the X century.  It is believed that the Byzantines built it, which at that time belonged to the Crimean land. </p><p>  The main objective of the fortress was to guard the center of Crimean Gothia and parallel control of the road leading to the South Bank.  The beam, through which the road to the tower lies, was called the Turks Altyn-Isar-Bogaz.  The translation reveals the secret of the name of the fortress itself.  In Russian, it sounds like a "passage to the Golden Fortress." </p><h2>  Signs of urban settlement </h2><p>  By the XIII century, Syuyrenskaya <span>fortress (Crimea)</span> becomes like a small city.  At this time, the <span>feudal castle</span> is located here <span>,</span> which owns rural settlements at the foot of the cape.  Towards the end of the 14th century, the fortification passed into the hands of theodorites.  Now it is the northern outpost of the principality.  For the entire time that these lands have been in the state of Theodoro, historians and archaeologists have noted a significant flowering of the city and an increase in the well-being of its population. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Oblivion </h2><p>  Historians claim that Turkish troops defeated the Syuyren fortress in 1475.  Since then, almost no mention of her.  There are only some assumptions about the living in these places of the Crimean Goths Scivarin.  Perhaps it was the 18th century. </p><p>  Although there is a not very popular version of the defeat of the fortress in 1299 by the Tatar-Mongol conquerors. </p><h2>  Architectural features </h2><p>  Syuyrensky fortress was erected in the form of two curtains.  They converged at the foot of a round tower.  Walls with a height of more than 4.5 meters formed an angle (about 130 <sup>¬∞</sup> ).  They were only 110 meters long, but had a considerable width - 2.5 meters.  From other sides it was impossible to approach the settlement - it was surrounded by steep cliffs. </p><p>  It is believed that the tower was two-story, and its height was about 12 meters (including the parapet and merlons).  Today she is a little over ten.  Completed the round structure of the site.  She was surrounded by a two-armored one and a half meter wall and was ready to withstand even the most terrible battle. </p><p>  All walls of the building are lined with limestone blocks.  They were held together by a solution based on the same limestone.  The floors are lined with wooden beams. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Each level had three loopholes.  A tunnel was organized southwest of the tower.  It made it possible to imperceptibly for the enemy to move between parts of the defensive structure.  On the other hand there was a high and strong gate.  The dwellings of ordinary citizens are built of stone. </p><p>  A secret passage led to one of the cliffs, which was prepared in case of an emergency emergency flight from the city. </p>

    <p>  Syuyrensky fortress had about 1.7 hectares in its possessions.  And it was very densely populated.  The north-eastern part of the settlement was occupied by winegrowers. </p><p>  At the turn of the XIII-XIV centuries, 300 meters from the tower, a wall was erected that was 145 m long and 1.2 m high. Archaeologists are still arguing about its purpose.  Most adhere to the version of the corral for livestock. </p><p>  There are suggestions that the Syuyrenskaya fortress (photo of the tower confirms these guesses) was the dwelling of the feudal lord.  The tower structure with a diameter of eight meters was later converted into a chapel.  Instead of a platform, a dome appeared.  And on the pictures of the inner surfaces of the walls, images of the faces of the saints are clearly visible. </p><h2>  Our days </h2><p>  The famous Crimean earthquake severely damaged the fortress remains.  Towards the end of the 1940s, attempts were made to restore the main tower.  But by the beginning of the 90s of the XX century, all the attached and fortified parts had been destroyed for no reason, and the tower again appeared in its original form. </p><p>  To this day, in addition to the tower structure, a defensive wall with the remains of dwellings, earthenware and scratched have reached. </p>

    <p>  There have always been many tourists in these places.  Very attracted to itself is Syuyrenskaya fortress.  How to get here, tells every local.  Immediately after the stop in the village of Maloe Sadovoye there is a trail leading through <span>the Belbek River</span> bridge <span>.</span>  Then, without turning off, you should go to the southern outskirts of the settlement and go to the reservoir.  Behind it begins a <span>dirt road.</span>  After a mile and a half, you need to turn left and go carefully guided by the red markers.  They will lead past the Chelter-Koba Monastery, located directly in the cave, gradually narrowing the path to the Kizilnik Gorge.  To his left begins a plateau that leads to a straight road through the forest.  And here she is, Syuyrenskaya fortress in all its glory! </p>
