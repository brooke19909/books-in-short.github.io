    <h2>  Federal Tax Service </h2><p>  <span>Fiscal tax authorities</span> are part of a unified system for monitoring compliance with budget legislation.  They provide oversight of the timeliness, accuracy, completeness of settlements and deductions of established payments to treasury income.  <span>The Federal Service</span> for Taxes and Levies is the executive body that exercises control.  The Federal Tax Service is involved in the development and implementation of the country's financial policy.  This fiscal authority is one of the key structures in the system.  The FTS provides control over the timely receipt of payments to budgets at all levels, as well as to extra-budgetary funds.  The service carries out intersectoral coordination, regulation in the sphere of production, turnover of alcoholic beverages and ethyl alcohol, as well as currency supervision.

Moreover, the regulation of certain issues is carried out by other normative acts.  For example, the Federal Law "On <span>Customs Tariffs"</span> - a law defining measures to protect the economic interest of the Russian Federation in conducting foreign trade activities.  Settable payments represent fixed budget revenues.  They have a purpose and can not be spent in areas not prescribed by law.  Collection of payments is carried out only when moving objects across the border.  As a rule, they are an essential condition for export or import.  Payment of the established amounts is ensured by a coercive mechanism.  For evasion of duty, violation of the terms of expulsion, the perpetrators are held accountable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fiscal activities of customs" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1507178.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the fiscal authorities are obliged to ensure control over the timeliness and completeness of receipts of the amounts established by law, these structures also work to analyze the tax base and forecast the amount of deductions.  In addition, they are developing proposals to improve the rules governing financial relations.  The results of the work carried out are taken into account by executive and representative structures.  Analytical information, in particular, is used in the preparation and approval of budget revenue items.  Statistical data are used to develop recommendations for determining the enterprises where documentary verification will be carried out.  Planned and unscheduled inspections are carried out to assess the completeness and timeliness of deductions by the payers of the established amounts, to take measures to eliminate the violations committed, to pay off the arrears.  As part of the audit, documentation is examined, and the degree of compliance by the enterprise with financial discipline is evaluated.  In case of violations, the perpetrators may be brought to administrative, criminal and other liability. </p>
