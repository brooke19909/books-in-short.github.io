    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The roots of the origin of Astrakhan go back centuries.  The first mention of the place where the city is today dates back to the thirteenth century.  Officially, the date of birth is considered to be 1558, when the construction of the wooden Kremlin on the left bank of the Volga began.  It was then, after joining the Russian power, that a new page began in the history of the Astrakhan Khanate.  However, the city received its official status later - at the beginning of the eighteenth century, under Peter I. </p><p>  But historians have other opinions on this subject.  Astrakhan local historian Vladimir Gusev believes that Astrakhan is already 1385 years old.  The scientist believes that the appearance of the city cannot be dated to any particular year, since it is a long process, expressed in political, economic and cultural development. </p><p>  Some historians, exploring the mythological descriptions of these places, are inclined to the version that the land of Astrakhan is very ancient - it is about seventy thousand years old! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  Today there is also no unambiguous version regarding the origin of the name of the city.  There are several legends.  The first of them is associated with the tribe of aces that inhabited these lands.  Brave warriors for their courage and honor shown in the battles received from the khan a document that exempted them from duties in favor of the state of the Tarkhan.  In honor of this significant event, the Ases named the city of As-tarhan. </p><p>  There is also an opinion based on data from a written source.  In the description of his journey, an Arabian citizen of Ibn Batut tells that the city is named after one pious pilgrim.  The Turkic Hajj, who chose this place for settlement, received it as a reward from the Sultan duty-free, or, as it was said then, the Sultan made the pilgrim a tarhan.  Hence the name Haji-tarhan.  As it developed, the village grew into a village, and then turned into a city. </p><p>  In confirmation of this name, the traveler Athanasius Nikitin also spoke out.  He was in these places in the middle of the fifteenth century and claimed that Astrakhan is the Russian version, which is based on Hadji-tarhan. </p><p>  Astrakhan local historian <span>Vladimir Gusev</span> believes that the first name of the city was Aztargan, and it was founded around 625 by the West Turkic Kagan Ozbulan. </p><h2>  Modern life </h2><p>  The city of Astrakhan today is a large port center, which is of great strategic importance to the state, since through it cooperation with many <span>Caspian countries</span> is realized <span>.</span>  This is one of the powerful industrial centers, which has as its advantages a developed transport network and a favorable economic and geographical position.  <span>The Astrakhan region,</span> with its highways, is included in the world transport system connecting north and south. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Astrakhan is rich in natural resources, allowing the city to develop various sectors of the economy.  Fisheries flourish here.  The light and food industries are well developed. </p><p>  But the cultural-historical component is especially noteworthy.  There are many museums and churches.  It looks especially magnificent among all the churches of such a historic city as Astrakhan, the Assumption Cathedral.  This is one of the main shrines of this region. </p><h2>  Attractions of Astrakhan </h2><p>  Given the long history of this Russian city, you can imagine how many interesting things are in it.  Something has been lost, but, fortunately, much has been preserved to this day. </p><p>  One of the world's most famous sights is the Astrakhan Kremlin, which can be considered the central monument of the city.  This architectural monument, unique in its historical value and beauty, was created over the course of forty years - from 1580 to 1620.  He is the embodiment of the military engineering genius of those centuries, as well as a kind of visiting card of the city.  Located on the highest hill, it is visible from everywhere. </p>

    <p>  The territory of the Kremlin covers several more attractions, including the most famous Orthodox church in Astrakhan - the Assumption Cathedral.

Since 1980, this <span>architectural ensemble has</span> acquired the status of a monument of federal significance. </p><p>  The Astrakhan Kremlin was created by the efforts of Moscow city planners: Mikhail Velyaminov, Grigory Ovtsyn and official Dei Gubastoy.  It is interesting that the plinths remaining from the Tatar ruins were used as building materials. </p>

    <p>  About the history of the construction of the Astrakhan Kremlin, the development of the city, the expositions presented here combined in the eponymous historical and architectural complex can tell a lot of interesting things.  Of particular interest are the exhibitions located in the towers.  For example, the Artillery, or torture, tower allows you to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow they were punished in those days in Russia.  But visitors over sixteen years old can attend this exposition. </p><p>  The expositions of the Red Gate tower tell visitors about the history and development of the Astrakhan Kremlin in different centuries.  There is, for example, a photo exhibition called ‚ÄúOld Astrakhan‚Äù, where you can see old photographs of the city from the late XIX - early XX centuries, as well as their reproductions. </p><p>  Many interesting things can be seen on the territory of the Kremlin.  Also here is the Trinity Cathedral, the Cyril Chapel, the Bishop‚Äôs House and many other attractions that tell about such an old city as Astrakhan. </p><h2>  Assumption Cathedral </h2><p>  It is located on the territory of the Kremlin and is its most famous shrine.  Its building rises majestically in the Kremlin and is noticeable from anywhere in the city and its environs.  The height of the Assumption Cathedral (Astrakhan), introduces it to the number of the highest Orthodox cathedrals in Russia and the world.  Created this pearl of Russian Orthodox architecture Dorofei Myakishev. </p><p>  The temple has a two-tier structure.  On the first level, which is smaller in height, is the so-called lower temple, the place where the remains of the Astrakhan priests rest.  There are crayfish with the relics of saints and holy martyrs. </p>

    <p>  The upper temple is tall and bright.  Sunlight passes through two tiers of huge windows. </p><p>  Like the Kremlin, whose history tells about the life of such a glorious city as Astrakhan, the Assumption Cathedral is also a landmark with a rich and rich past. </p><h2>  Chronicle of the Cathedral </h2><p>  It begins in 1560, when the first log church was built on this site, which was dilapidated by the end of the century and was replaced by a more solid, stone one.  However, this building was not destined to resist for long.  The reason for the demolition of the stone church was its size, which did not accommodate the rapidly growing parish community. </p><p>  And in 1699 they began to build the Assumption Cathedral (Astrakhan), the history of its construction stretched for ten years.  The first obstacle to this was the lack of material support from the state.  Metropolitan Sampson took control of the construction and sought help from the local merchants and landowners.  The local nobility did not become greedy and collected a sufficient amount, inviting the best masters of Astrakhan to work.  The chief architect of the project was the architect Dorofei Myakishev. </p>

    <p>  The first architectural plan involved a single-domed church.  However, during construction, problems with its stability were discovered, and the master architect proposed a new five-domed project.  And in 1710, services began in the temple. </p><p>  The revolutionary years brought their amendments to the life of the whole state, they did not pass by Astrakhan either.  The Assumption Cathedral was searched many times, while a large number of objects of all <span>church utensils</span> were carried out <span>.</span>  A huge part of it was remelted, and the cathedral was closed.  Since 1922, it began to be used as a warehouse, gym, shooting range and for other needs. </p><p>  By 1992, the temple was in terrible condition: the iconostasis was burned, the walls were dilapidated, the icons destroyed.  Starting this year, the restoration of the cathedral begins.  Divine services are first conducted in the lower church, and after a few years they are resumed in the upper one. </p><h2>  Iconostasis of the Cathedral </h2><p>  This is the main decoration that in the pre-revolutionary years was distinguished by the Assumption Cathedral (Astrakhan).  The iconostasis was unique here, as it rose eight tiers.  Church traditions of temples in those days did not allow more than seven rows of icons. </p>

    <p>  The iconostasis of the Assumption Cathedral before the revolution was decorated with beautiful icons painted by famous masters: Nikifor Popov and Ivan Andreev.  Today, most of them are restored, and he gained his eight-story height. </p><h2>  Where is Astrakhan </h2><p>  This amazing old Russian city is located in the Southern Federal District of Russia.  In addition to the Astrakhan region, it includes five more entities.  The territory of the district is located in the south of the European part of Russia and belongs to the Volga-Caspian region. </p><p>  Answering the question of where Astrakhan is located, it should also be said that all of it is located on the eleven islands of the Caspian lowland, they are interconnected through thirty bridges.  The bulk of the city‚Äôs population lives on the left bank of the Volga, and only one fifth on the right. </p>
