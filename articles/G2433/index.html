  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Speech Types</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You can find out what types of speech are from the course of stylistics.  This science solves the questions of the correct, most appropriate use of words, the construction of sentences in such a way that thought is expressed very clearly and corresponds to the <span>norms of the literary language.</span>  For example, the word ‚Äúeye‚Äù has synonyms: ‚Äúapple‚Äù and ‚Äúeye‚Äù.  They have the same meaning, but are they always interchangeable?  Of course not.  All of them are good in their place.  It would sound rather ridiculous if the scientist instead of the word "eye" used the "apple".  Conversely, replacing the word ‚Äúeye‚Äù with the trivial word ‚Äúeye‚Äù in a poetic work completely deprives the verse of solemnity. </p><p>  In Russian, the following styles and types of speech are distinguished: journalistic, business, artistic, scientific and conversational.  They all differ in the construction of sentences and the selection of words. </p><p>  Most words are neutral in color and can be included in all types of speech.  But some tend to give a special touch to what is said or written.  Such words cannot use all types of speech, they are characteristic of only one style: either conversational (dominate, balamute, casual, cook, quickie), or artistic (greedy, landscape, subject). </p><p>  <span>The conversational style is</span> used in oral communication between people in everyday life, in family and friendly relations, as well as in <span>literary works</span> in the form of direct speech.  It is used to exchange thoughts and information with loved ones.  It is carried out in the form of <span>conversations, dialogues,</span> notes, letters.  The characteristic features of the colloquial type of speech: evaluative nature, emotionality, ease, sometimes lack of logic.  This style is characterized by the use of colloquial, emotionally-evaluative words, phraseological units.  Also, the colloquial type of speech is characterized by the construction of simple sentences (including exclamation, one-part and incomplete), the frequent use of calls, interjections. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The scope of the scientific style is technology, science, the educational process.  It is used to communicate achievements in the field of latest technologies and discoveries.  A <span>scientific style is being</span> implemented in the form of reports, speeches, textbooks, lectures, books, disputes.  Its characteristic features: dry <span>speech, logic,</span> accuracy, abstractness and evidence.  The vocabulary of this style is dominated by words with abstract meaning, nouns formed from verbs, and terms. </p><p>  Formal relationships are the main area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication for formal business type of speech.  It is used for the purpose of regulating business relations, issuing prescriptions, directions.  It is implemented in the form of contracts, business papers (statements, certificates, orders, reports, protocols, etc.).  Characteristic features of a business type of speech: dryness, severity and formality. </p><p>  The artistic style is used accordingly in fiction with the aim of influencing the reader by verbal depiction of life.  It is realized in the form of novels, poems, short stories, short stories, essays, short stories and plays.  Features inherent in the artistic type of speech: its evaluative nature, emotionality, concreteness and imagery. </p><p>  The scope of the journalistic style is politics and society.  It is used for the purpose of influencing the masses or providing information about important events and affairs for society.  The <span>journalistic style is</span> realized in the form of brochures, disputes, lectures, articles, reports and speeches.  Its typical features: passion, invocation, evaluative character. </p><p>  Speech types such as artistic, journalistic, scientific and formal business are examples of book style. </p><p>  Types of speech do not exist in isolation from each other, they influence each other. </p>
