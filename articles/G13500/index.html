    <h2>  History and background </h2><p>  The kings of Portugal have been descended from ancient times.  At the beginning of the eighth century, the Visigoths created the first independent formations on the Iberian Peninsula.  However, at this time, the expansion of Saracens to the mainland begins.  At that time they were much more cohesive and developed than disparate tribes.  Therefore, in a fairly short period they managed to occupy almost the entire peninsula.  In response to the invasion of the Moors, the western and southern parts of Christian Europe respond with the Reconquista.  Conquest of territories begins.  This war will continue for more than a century.  In the ninth century, almost on the border between the Christian world and the emirates, the kingdom of Leon creates its own county. </p><p>  The first Portuguese county was headed by Vimara Peres.  This public entity is considered the first prototype of modern Portugal.  The counts obeyed Leon and paid tribute to their vassal.  Due to its proximity to the epicenter of the war, the county was actively involved in the Reconquista.  Along with Spain, there was the largest number of knights from Europe.  Even before the first crusades, settlers from all over the mainland arrived here.  Many knights who arrived with the retinue for the war against the Saracens eventually settled.  At the end of the ninth century, revolts against central authority became more frequent.  Uprising is almost always supported by the Portuguese county. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result, the second county significantly expands its territory to the south.  Henry of Burgundy, who received these lands for his services to the crown, significantly enhances the influence of the county.  It gradually absorbs other vassal territories.  And soon the first king of Portugal - Afonso comes to power. </p><h2>  Independence </h2><p>  The king of Castile sent a considerable army south.  He also urged the French to help in the expulsion of the Moors.  One of the knights - Heinrich of Burgundy - was granted land at the very border.  There he had a son, Afonso.  By the time of his birth, Henry was already a count of Portuguese.  The boy took the title after the death of his father.  However, the rules were his mother Teresa.  Afonso was raised by a bishop from Braga.  He did this with a visionary plan.  Realizing the changes on the peninsula, he intended to put the young count at the head of the opposition to his mother. </p><p>  After an open speech, the archbishop and eleven-year heir to the title are driven out of the country.  They live abroad for several years.  For three years they find allies and means for returning.  At fourteen, Afonso becomes a knight and arrives in the county.  The war begins against the mother.  Afonso is supported by knights and local feudal lords.  However, over time, the vassal - the king of Castile himself - falls on the side of Theresa. </p><p>  Five years later, a turning point in the war.  The army of the prince wins at Guimaraes.  The mother of the commander who forever goes to the monastery is captured.  Now power in Portugal is concentrated in one hand.  However, a much more important victory was the expulsion of Alfonso the Seventh.  De facto <span>vassal dependence has</span> been destroyed.  The first king of Portugal ascended the throne.  However, in order to gain full independence, other monarchies and the papal throne had to recognize the new king. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The fight for recognition </h2><p>  The recognition process in medieval Europe was quite complicated.  Indeed, in the event of establishing contacts with the new king, problems with his former vassal might arise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="henry's sister 8 margarita and king of portugal" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1568820.jpg" width="460"></div>  One of the most influential institutions determining legitimacy was the Vatican.  The recognition of the Pope would guarantee the support of European states.  Therefore, throughout Portugal began to build churches at the expense of the treasury.  Papal representatives received significant benefits.  The king also decided to finally deal with the Saracens in the south.  A number of major victories made it possible to drop the invaders behind the Tagus.  After that, the embassy of the throne departed for Rome.  At this moment, intending to return his territories, the emperor Alfonso invades the country.  The king of Portugal gathers an army and gives a decisive rebuff.  But rich Castile continues to wage war at the expense of mercenaries.

    <p>  As a result, peace is made and Afonso is recognized as king, but at the same time remains under the rule of Spain.  After the death of the emperor, a new war begins.  This time, the Portuguese make their first move and invade Galicia.  However, the initial success is nullified by the capture of Afonso himself.  Since at that time the self-proclaimed king was a key figure for the state, the conquered territories served as a ransom for it.  As a result, the kingdom of Leon annexed several regions without a single battle.  However, Afonso's bet on the church played.  In one hundred and seventy-nine, the papal throne officially recognizes the independence of Portugal.  On behalf of the Lord, the Pope also gives the right to campaign against the Saracens.  This event is one of the fundamental in the history of the <span>Iberian Peninsula.</span>  From this day the kings of Portugal begin to rule.  Afonso also managed to participate in several wars.  At the age of seventy, he successfully leads the breakthrough of the siege of Santarem.  His death has become a real national mourning.  Now the first king is revered as a national hero. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Strengthening the monarchy </h2><p>  After the death of Afonso for several generations, the kings of Portugal continued his work mainly.  Sanshu was engaged in reconquest and gaining influence on the peninsula.  In some directions, he managed to push the Moors to the south.  Cities and villages began to be built.  This was facilitated by new land reforms.  Now the <span>monastic orders</span> could receive inheritance in their property, but pledged to build settlements before the crown. </p><p>  In the foreign policy plan, for many centuries, the attention of the reconquista remained in the focus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="juan 1 king of portugal" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1568819.jpg" width="220"></div>  All the kings of Portugal directed their efforts to the fight against the Saracens.  The list of reforms expanded under the reign of Afonso Fat.  The first parliament was created.  Cities received significant liberties.  In many ways, their charter of rights copied the Roman statute.

    <h2>  Brewing crisis </h2><p>  After the establishment of the monarchy, political life in the country remained almost unchanged.  Wars with the Moors were waged with varying success, diplomats continued to try to isolate themselves from the influence of Castile.  However, the usual course of affairs was changed with the accession to the throne of Pedro 1. The King of Portugal, while still a prince, laid a bomb under his throne.  His father Afonso the Fourth wished him a marriage with a Castilian royal person.  Such a merger was supposed to further strengthen the position of the kingdom on the peninsula.  However, the marriage with the daughter of the emperor did not take place.  Meanwhile, Emperor Alfonso himself decides to marry the king‚Äôs daughter.  But since he was married to the wife of a local count, he divorces this marriage.  As a result, the father of the bride Manuel begins the war.  Soon, the Portuguese support him.  To seal the union, Pedra is married to the daughter of Manuel.  Constance arrive in Portugal.  After marriage, the prince pays more attention to her companion Ines.  In the forty-fifth year, Constance dies, having managed to give birth to a child. </p><p>  Pedro begins to live with his wife‚Äôs ex-maid of honor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the fate of the dictatorship in portugal overthrowing the power of the king" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1568818.jpg" width="267"></div>  Ines gives birth to his children.  The king is concerned about the behavior of his son.  He orders him to find a more suitable companion.  But Pedro does not heed his advice and even declares his marriage to Ines.  In addition, her brothers and relatives arrive in Portugal.  With the light hand of the prince, they receive high government posts.  This is very worrying father and know.  Rumors begin to spread about a possible war for the throne after the death of Afonso the Fourth.  Most of all, it is fearful to know that Castilians seize power in the country, although Ines's relatives were expelled from Spain.

    <h2>  The death of the old king </h2><p>  As a result, Afonso does not withstand such pressure.  Desiring to secure the future of his dynasty, he secretly sends three killers.  As a result, Ines is killed.  The news of her lover's death enrages Pedra.  He refuses to recognize his father and is preparing an uprising.  But soon they are reconciled.  And after a while, Afonso Four dies under mysterious circumstances.  In the fifty-seventh year, Pedro is crowned.  As it turned out, he never forgave the murder of his wife.  First of all, he begins to look for the murderers of his beloved.  He even manages to negotiate with Castile on their extradition.  Three years later, two killers are brought to him.  He personally carves their hearts.  The latter managed to hide all his life. </p><p>  According to the myth, after cutting out the hearts, he performed some crazy ritual.  Allegedly, the king ordered Ines to be taken out of the coffin, dressed in a dress and put on the throne.  After that, all the nobility had to swear to her and kiss her hand (according to other sources - a dress).  There are no reliable sources describing this event, but there is a picture. </p><h2>  Foreign policy </h2><p>  The board of Pedro was characterized by changes in foreign policy.  England was now a priority.  Portuguese ambassadors regularly visited <span>foggy Albion.</span>  A number of trade agreements were concluded, allowing merchants to freely import their goods into the territory of the two kingdoms.  At the same time, a peaceful relationship with Spain was preserved.  The Reconquista progressed rather slowly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sebastian king of portugal" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1568817.jpg" width="220"></div>  Since now the Moors are increasingly viewed as possible allies in the struggle for power in the region.

    <p>  However, the rather successful reforms within the country and the conquest outside it cannot be compared with the love games of Pedro the First.  Because of the complicated story with three wives, the king created the best soil for civil war. </p><h2>  The fall of the dynasty </h2><p>  After the death of Pedro, power passed to his son from his first wife, Fernado.  He began his reign rather ambitiously.  Immediately after the death of the Castilian emperor, he claims his throne.  Using the family ties of his grandmother as an excuse, he is trying to unite in his hands power not only over Portugal, but also over Castile and Leon.  However, the Spanish nobility refuses to accept it.  To confront the Castilian court, Fernando makes an alliance with the Saracens, the war begins.  After some time, the Pope intervenes in it and a truce sets in.  However, Fernando does not abandon his claims, but only forgets about them for a while.  At the insistence of the papal throne, the king was to marry the daughter of the Castilian ruler.  But instead, Fernando marries Leonora Menezes.  The next war begins.  The Portuguese manage to conclude a series of advantageous allied agreements and persuade Henry to a truce. </p><p>  But after the death of Henry, the king of Spain and Portugal (as he considered himself), Fenrand the First appeals to England for help.  Edward sends his troops and his daughter to Lisbon by sea.  After marriage, a trip to Castile is expected.  But the king suddenly abandons his claims and makes peace.  For this, the British army ruins part of his possessions.  Six months after these events, Fernando dies.  After it comes a period of turmoil. </p><h2>  Interregnum and period of decline </h2><p>  After the death of Fernando, not a single male heir remains.  Power passes to his daughter.  And in view of his small age, in fact, to her mother.  Leonora weaves intrigue and quickly finds a new lover.  And the daughter is going to give out for the Castilian heir.  This would make Portugal a part of Spain.  To know is extremely dissatisfied with this fact.  Since the alliance with Castile is contrary to the basic principles of foreign policy, which professed all the previous kings of Portugal.  The list of candidates for the throne is growing every day.  These are mostly illegitimate children of Pedro and their descendants. </p><p>  At the same time, unpopular reforms are being introduced in the country.  All of these factors lead to conspiracy and coup.  In the eighty-fifth year, an uprising begins in Lisbon.  As a result, the rebels kill the favorite of Leonora.  Cortes (meeting of parliamentarians) is convening.  Joan 1 ascends the throne. The King of Portugal immediately faces the danger of a Spanish invasion.  After all, the expulsion of Beatrice was a direct declaration of war. </p><p>  And the king‚Äôs fears were not in vain.  Juan the First invades with a huge army.  His goal is Lisbon.  On the side of the Castilians came a detachment of the French.  An English expeditionary force of six hundred archers arrives in Portugal as allied assistance.  After two major battles, the Spaniards leave and abandon claims to the throne.  After that, Juan led a predominantly peaceful policy.  The main changes concerned internal reforms.  Culture and education developed.  Many cities have grown significantly. </p><h2>  Strengthening Power </h2><p>  Nobles have always been a pillar of society, on which the kings of Portugal relied.  History knows hundreds of examples when they rebelled against their overlord.  After the rise of the Avis dynasty, the position of the nobles changed significantly.  This is largely due to the gratitude of the new kings.  Duarte, for example, distributed a huge amount of land to the court.  As a result, they gained more independence.  This problem and began to solve Juan 2. The King of Portugal immediately after the ascension created a new institution - the royal commission on letters.  She was revising the rights of nobles to their lands.  In response to such a decisive step, the nobles plotted. </p><p>  However, they quickly open it.  The head of the rebels is caught, and his estate is besieged by the royal troops.  After this, another intrigue is brewing with the aim of killing the king and calling for the reign of the Castilian contender.  But Joan also reveals it.  The king of Portugal personally kills the leader of the conspirators. </p><p>  Joan was extremely ambitious and arrogant.  He possessed charisma and had a huge influence on the courtiers.  He was interested in military art.  While still a prince, he often participated in knightly tournaments, where he invariably took first places.  He was a supporter of strict centralization of power.  Nevertheless, he patronized many humanitarian spheres.  He also allocated significant funds from the royal treasury for the development of science.  According to some reports, he was an avid chess player.  Even specially invited European masters for the party. </p><h2>  Royal Legends </h2><p>  During the reign of Juan III at the court, rumors were circulating that Henry 8's sister Margaret and the king of Portugal could marry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="juan 2 king of portugal" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1568816.jpg" width="360"></div>  Close relations with England developed even under Pedro the First.  The Britons often sided with the Portuguese in the wars with Castile.  Therefore, for many then it seemed that the Tudors would marry one of their daughters as Joan to strengthen allied relations.  Henry 8's sister Margarita and the king of Portugal, in fact, most likely did not even see each other.  However, many legends brought them together.  In particular, in the popular modern television series <span>"The Tudors," Margarita</span> is plotting to marry a Portuguese.

    <p>  In the center of another famous ‚Äúroyal‚Äù legend was Sebastian.  The king of Portugal ascended the throne immediately after the death of his father.  Grew up in difficult conditions.  The cardinal was actually engaged in upbringing.  Mother fled to Spain, and grandma soon died.  As a result, the boy became a full king at the age of fifteen.  And almost immediately he went on his own crusade, in which he died.  A legend has long circulated in the homeland that supposedly Sebastian is alive and is preparing to return to the country to save her from the claims of the Spanish king Philip.  As a result of such moods in society, impostors appeared several times in Portugal claiming the right to the throne. </p><h2>  The end of the monarchy </h2><p>  By the beginning of the twentieth century, the monarchy was in decline.  To protect its power, the crown intensified repression.  At the same time, socialist and republican sentiments spread among the people.  On February 1, 1908, the fate of the dictatorship in Portugal was decided.  Having overthrown the power of the king, some Republicans were going to arrange a revolution.  Therefore, they killed Carlos the First with his family right in the center of Lisbon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="king of spain and portugal" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1568815.jpg" width="200"></div>  Nevertheless, one of the heirs to the throne managed to survive.  Mother saved ten-year-old Manuel.  However, he showed no interest in government affairs.  Therefore, two years later, a revolution begins in the country, which led to the overthrow of the monarchist system and the proclamation of a republic.

    <p>  Thus ended the seven hundred year history of the monarchy in Portugal.  Initially, the goals of the crown corresponded to the national requirements of the people.  Moreover, the throne was a unifying and formative force for the Portuguese nation.  Political activity was basically no different.  Protecting from Spanish influence allocated the main place to the kings of Portugal.  The chronology of dynasties and tribal branches is kept in the Lisbon Monastery of Jeronimos.  Many royal families were closely related to the most famous houses in Europe. </p>
