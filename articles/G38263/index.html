Kandalaksha is no exception.  The sights of this place, the first mention of which in the annals dates from 1517, fascinate with its antiquity.  What should be visited first of all by travelers who find themselves in the territory of this settlement? </p><h2>  Exploring the Kandalaksha Maze </h2><p>  Where to start acquaintance with the <span>ancient city?</span>  Kandalaksha Labyrinth is an attraction that tourists should certainly see.  A unique place is located on the northern shore of the White Sea, near the city of Kandalaksha.  Scientists find it difficult to accurately answer the question of what age is the amazing stone labyrinth, which is called "Babylon".  It is believed that it was created more than four thousand years ago. </p>

    <p>  ‚ÄúBabylon‚Äù is one of those mysterious places that Kandalaksha is famous for, the sights of which are considered in this article.  Researchers believe that the system of intricate passages was laid out by our distant ancestors from stones for witchcraft rites.  It is also possible that such labyrinths were used to bury the dead.  This was done so that the souls of people who left this world could not get out to the living and did not bother them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The legend says that "Babylon" is open only to the elite, but nowadays everyone can wander through the maze. </p><h2>  Jingle stones </h2><p>  The stones located on the Volosyanaya Hill are another mystery that Kandalaksha is famous for.  The sights of the city are impressive in diversity.  We are talking about such a rock as ultrabasite, which is attributed to magmatic origin.  Its composition contains nickel metals, olin.  The name of the attraction is due to the fact that when they hit stones, they emit a continuous metal ringing. </p>

    <p>  Of course, scientists could not help but wonder why the "ringing" stones emit ringing.  Studies have suggested that this is due to the presence of microcracks in them that create a resonance of vibrations.  Microcracks arose as a result of the inevitable destruction process, albeit slowed down in the northern climate. </p><p>  It is known that in the old days of this attraction was attributed magical power.  The "ringing" boulders even served as objects of worship, since people could not unravel their ringing. </p><h2>  Healing mud </h2><p>  Visitors to Kandalaksha can not only enjoy studying the mysteries of history, but also take care of their own health.  The healing mud of Palkina‚Äôs lip has been helping people cope with various ailments for many years.  You should definitely visit the famous hydrological natural monument, located on the shores of the White Sea.  It is known that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdeposits here totals about 400 hectares. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The benefits possessed by the therapeutic mud of Palkina Bay were officially proven only in 1978.  However, it‚Äôs not the first century that pilgrims from different parts of the country flock here, dreaming of getting rid of diseases.  During World War II, mud was used to heal the wounded.  Now it is actively used by hospitals and sanatoriums of the Murmansk region. </p><p>  In the fight against what ailments does healing mud really help?  It has been established that it can be used in the treatment of diseases of the peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, joints.  It is also an effective tool for the prevention of such diseases. </p><h2>  Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary </h2><p>  Of course, not all the interesting places that Kandalaksha is famous for are mentioned above.  Religious attractions also deserve the attention of tourists.  The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is considered the highlight of the village of Varguz, located near Kandalaksha. </p>

    <p>  It is known that the church was first mentioned in chronicles in 1563, its construction was completed in the 17th century.  Master Clement created this temple without using nails.  This happened in a difficult period of schism, it is not surprising that the church was created in a tent style, against which Patriarch Nikon fought. </p><p>  The upper tier of the structure looks like an eight-walled frame, crowned with a dome and an eight-pointed cross.  The massive base is made of wood, has the shape of a cross.  The walls of the building are decorated with carvings, they depict scales and kokoshnik.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe inner hall is about 70 square meters. </p><h2>  St. Nicholas Church </h2><p>  St. Nicholas Church is located in the small village of Kovda, also located near Kandalaksha.  It must be seen by tourists who are interested in monuments of wooden architecture.  Unfortunately, the researchers were unable to find out the date of construction of the structure.  However, it was established that the church took the place of St. Nicholas Church, which is described in chronicles dating back to the 15th century. </p>

    <p>  St. Nicholas Church has a difficult history.  The religious building was closed in 1960, and remained abandoned for several decades.  Restoration work was started back in the 1990s, but the lack of funding did not allow them to be completed quickly.  At the moment, the temple already has its original appearance.  It is also known that approximately 70% of genuine building material has been preserved. </p><h2>  Bow cross </h2><p>  <span>The worship cross</span> on Mount Krestovoi is another attraction that all religious tourists seek to see.  It is easy to guess that the mountain got its name precisely because a cross was installed on its top.  In 1915, the storm that swept the <span>Kola Peninsula</span> demolished the product. </p>

    <p>  The new Poklonnaya Cross, whose height was about five meters, was created only in 2006.  This happened thanks to activists living in Kandalaksha.  The product was made of steel, which explains its weight of about 200 kg.  It‚Äôs worth to climb to the top of the mountain not only for the cross, but also for the most beautiful view of the city. </p><h2>  Silver mine </h2><p>  What other attractions does Kandalaksha meet in the Murmansk region?  There are a lot of natural monuments in the city and its environs.  One of them is a silver mine located on Bear Island.  You can get to it only by sea, for example, from Kandalaksha.  However, on the island, unfortunately, it is forbidden to land. </p><p>  It is known that it was silver mined on <span>Bear Island that was used</span> to mint the first Russian ruble, it happened in 1736. </p><h2>  What else to see </h2><p>  What other attractions are worth seeing for tourists who are attracted to Kandalaksha in the Murmansk region?  We already realized that it is a sin for the city to complain about the lack of natural beauty.  You should definitely visit the charming waterfall located on the Chapoma River, which is considered the largest waterfall in the Kola Peninsula.  From two sides it is framed by small rocky shores, which gives it the appearance of a canyon.  Spontaneous tourism activities are prohibited on this territory, so only people who have acquired the appropriate excursion will be able to visit the waterfall. </p><p>  These are the main attractions that travelers traveling to Kandalaksha must see. </p>
