    <h2>  NASA's Lunar Program </h2><p>  Manned flight to the moon allowed science to step forward.  However, overnight all programs were discontinued.  What really happened?  To get an exhaustive answer, you need to dig a little deeper.  The history of the <span>exploration of the moon</span> began in the last century.  It was a kind of struggle of several states for superiority over the whole world. </p><p>  The USSR at that time occupied a leading place, and NASA was well aware that it would not be possible to reduce the distance by direct routes.  A breakthrough was needed.  Therefore, a large team of scientists was created, which developed the "lunar" program.  About 400 thousand people worked on this project.  It was spent more than 110 million dollars.  The work on the program lasted about 8 years.  During this time, many prototypes of aircraft were created and, of course, the Apollo series.  But why did they stop flying to the moon if all the efforts were successful? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main link in the development of NASA is Werner von Braun.  This man worked for A. Hitler during the Second World War.  It was he who created the world famous ‚ÄúFau 2‚Äù.  Werner was able to create a powerful carrier, which had an impressive size.  It was almost impossible to deliver it to the launch site by land.  It is worth noting that the Saturn engine had a capacity of 180 million horsepower.  When the unit was launched in the buildings located nearby, all the windows were knocked out. </p>

    <h2>  NASA's Attempts </h2><p>  There were many flights to the moon.  But before the first landing on the surface of the Earth‚Äôs satellite, 10 Apollo aircraft were launched.  Only after that they began to talk about the possibility of a human flight to the moon: </p><p>  1. October 1968 - Apollo 7 was launched.  The aircraft first entered low Earth orbit. </p><p>  2. December 1968 - Apollo 8 was launched with a passenger on board.  <span>The aircraft</span> was able to fly around the moon in its orbit. </p><p>  3. March 1969 - ‚ÄúApollo 9‚Äù.  In space, tests were conducted with the lunar module. </p><p>  4. May 1969 - "Apollo 10".  The crew rehearsed the landing, descending to a height of 15 kilometers from the surface of the Earth's satellite. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  5. Flight to the moon in 1969, July 2 - "Apollo 11".  The crew was delivered to the surface of the Earth‚Äôs satellite. </p><p>  After that, NASA conducted several more moon landings.  However, in 1972, the Americans closed all of their projects related to the Earth satellite.  Following the United States, the "lunar program" was stopped in the USSR.  After this space flight was no more.  It is still not entirely clear <span>why they stopped flying to the moon?</span>  What was the reason? </p>

    <h2>  "Lunar program" of the USSR </h2><p>  As for the USSR, things with the program here were much sadder.  Unlike the Americans, the Russians were constantly harassed by failure.  Scientists of the USSR were not able to create a working prototype of a powerful carrier.  The heart of the lunar project was S.P. Korolev.  After his death, the situation of the Soviet Union worsened significantly.  At one time, the USSR gave all its forces to the first steps in <span>space exploration,</span> and there simply weren‚Äôt enough forces, means, or opportunities for the "lunar projects".  The flight of astronauts to the moon in such a situation was simply impossible. </p><p>  The USSR did not land its crew on the surface of the Earth's satellite.  Why this happened, no one can answer for sure.  Perhaps the Russian researchers lost their interest and no longer sought to explore new territories.  By that time, most of the allocated funds had been spent on the construction of missiles and launch sites.  The astronauts who were preparing for the flights were fully trained, and the construction of one carrier was worth the cost of creating a military bomber.  In addition, the closure of the "lunar program" is a big financial cost.  So why did the USSR and the USA suspend development in this area? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Exploring the moon </h2><p>  So why stopped flying to the moon, what was discovered on its surface?  In order to study obscure phenomena, scientific societies were created.  They included only highly qualified employees who had considerable experience and relevant knowledge.  A similar organization was created for the first time in the United States at the beginning of 1965.  During this time, a lot of obscure objects and unexplained phenomena on the surface and <span>orbit of the moon</span> were revealed and recorded <span>.</span>  Most anomalies simply could not be explained. </p><p>  Despite this, more than one flight to the moon was made.  The USSR and the USA were well aware of unexplained phenomena, but work continued.  On the contrary, the anomalies were of great interest, and many scientists wanted to know what it was, to get at least some information. </p>

    <h2>  What could they find out? </h2><p>  The American flight to the moon, as well as the studies of many scientists, made it possible to reveal <span>inexplicable phenomena</span> on the surface of the satellite of our planet <span>.</span>  Both Americans and Russians knew about such anomalies.  However, many astronauts have stated that very interesting and strange things are happening on the surface of the moon.  Among them, not only bright flashes were noted, but also luminous points periodically entering the orbit of the moon.  Their sizes were simply huge.  They circled the satellite of the Earth, and then landed.  But that is not all. </p><p>  In 1968, the last century, a document was created, called the "Chronological catalog of reports of lunar events."  During the exploration of the moon, about 579 anomalies were revealed.  This list includes: disappearing craters, extraordinary geometric shapes of regular shape, large domes that change color, color bars moving at a speed of about 6 kilometers per hour, luminous objects, and so on. </p><h2>  First broadcasts </h2><p>  When NASA launched the next Apollo, the purpose of which was to land on the moon, many hams follow what is happening, listening to the radio broadcast of negotiations between the crew and Houston.  It was at this time that the first signs appeared that the pilots of the aircraft are hiding something and not negotiating.  Some hams from distant Australia and from Switzerland were able to catch astronaut talks at other frequencies.  On another wave, the pilots talked about not entirely clear phenomena. </p><p>  Only 10 years later, Maurice Chatlin, the creator of the communications apparatus for the "lunar program", admitted that he was present during the negotiations between Houston and astronauts.  He confirmed that Armstrong mentioned some objects that accompanied the aircraft. </p>

    <p>  Those who flew to the moon spoke about obscure anomalies.  First of all, some blocks located very close to the landing site were mentioned.  Some of the objects emitted a glow.  It was practically colorless and emanated from the inside or outside.  Many astronauts said that they saw something, but they could not describe it in more detail because of the non-disclosure subscription. </p><p>  Already after the "lunar program" was closed, NASA experts admitted that more than 20 people, members of various crews, witnessed the presence of UFOs on the lunar surface.  In addition, it was confirmed from the Earth Observatory that Apollo 12 was accompanied by some objects of unearthly origin. </p><h2>  Evidence </h2><p>  All of the above facts indicate that NASA employees were well aware that on the lunar surface there is something interesting and incomprehensible to humans.  The subsequent expeditions and flights of the Apollo are attempts to study the finds and understand what it is.  There is little evidence of this version.  Such documents include a photograph that was taken by astronomer J. Wilson about 10 years before the first flights.  The picture shows 34 flying objects that extend to the surface of the moon.  At that time, scientists were not able to give an exhaustive answer to the question of what it is. </p><h2>  Mysterious moon </h2><p>  Why did they stop flying to the moon, if there were so many interesting and inexplicable on its surface?  It is very difficult to answer the question posed.  In addition, many information about objects on the moon is still classified.  But from the available sources it can be understood that there are a lot of anomalous phenomena on the surface of the satellite of our planet.  Here we saw strange traces that were most likely left by a vehicle.  In addition, large boulders were noticed on the lunar surface that could roll out of craters without any help.  Astronauts saw objects that look like cars, canyons filled with stone blocks, holes with smooth edges and right angles, which completely excludes their crater formation, and much more. </p><p>  There are plenty of such phenomena.  Pictures of obscure objects make it possible to assume that on the moon there existed or still exists a rational form of life.  Many scientists suggest that under the surface of the satellite of the Earth there may exist a whole world, the study of which is not possible.  In addition, many scientists and astronauts saw luminous objects that move in the orbit of the moon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="man's flight to the moon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1157939.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What NASA officials said </h2><p>  In March 1996, NASA officials made a statement stating that on the moon (allegedly) there are alien structures created artificially.  When asked why everything had been hiding for so long, representatives of the organization replied that it was hard to imagine how the Earth's population would react to such statements.  In addition, there were other reasons. </p><p>  It is worth noting that even after such a statement, the secrecy stamp was not removed from many documents.  Each inhabitant of the Earth can see pictures of extraordinary objects.  However, for an exact request, you need to know the exact photo number.  It is not possible to find out such information.  In addition, the archive has preserved many pictures, the viewing of which is not cheap. </p><h2>  Comments of eyewitnesses </h2><p>  A very interesting commentary on the closure of the "lunar" projects was made by the creator of the Apollo Werner von Braun.  According to him, on the moon there is an extraterrestrial civilization that surpasses humanity in development, has tremendous power.  Their ships are superior to land not only in size but also in technology.  According to Armstrong, humanity has simply been made clear that the territory is occupied.  For this reason, flights to the moon were stopped. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Many do not understand why to hide data about the moon.  The discovery of an extraterrestrial life form, as well as coming into contact with it, makes it possible to obtain new information that will contribute to the development of technologies, the creation of new weapons and the opening of additional energy resources.  Of course, the calculations of both powers turned out to be erroneous.  For some reason, all flights to the Moon ceased, and for more than 30 years no human foot has stepped on its surface.  Nevertheless, according to scientists, the time of space flights has come. </p>
