We tell how long different smartphone models work on a single battery charge.  Which one can be taken on a long trip without an external battery, and which one will have to live at the outlet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Discharged iPhone" class="if uuid-2916209" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2916209.jpg"></div><h2>  iPhone XS Max </h2><p>  Let's start with the latest Apple smartphone on the market.  Let‚Äôs find out how much battery the iPhone XS Max has.  This phone differs from other models of the series with a huge 6.5-inch display and quite impressive dimensions.  These parameters, in turn, have a positive effect on autonomy, since Apple was able to accommodate a larger battery in it. </p><p>  Apple claims that the iPhone XS Max can work on a single charge: </p><ul><li>  Talk time using wireless headphones - 25 hours. </li><li>  With the active use of the built-in web browser Safari - 13 hours. </li><li>  When watching HD-video in the built-in iOS player - 15 hours. </li><li>  While listening to music in Apple Music online, 65 hours. </li></ul><p>  Such data is shared by Apple.  In fact, the indicators vary.  Journalists and ordinary users talk about 10 hours of activity in mixed mode.  Mixed mode refers to the average load when a person makes several calls, sometimes takes pictures, often goes online, writes in instant messengers and listens to music.  Operating mode without games and heavy programs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  iPhone XS </h2><p>  The more compact iPhone XS features a more compact display.  Accordingly, the device itself is smaller and the battery in it is not so capacious.  It also has an identical energy-efficient A12 chip, as in the iPhone XS Max.  All this allowed to significantly increase the battery life of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slashgear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 6s" class="if uuid-2916212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2916212.jpg"></div><p>  So how much battery life does the iPhone XS have? </p><ul><li>  Talk time using wireless headphones - 20 hours. </li><li>  With the active use of the built-in web browser Safari - 12 hours. </li><li>  When watching HD-video in the built-in iOS player - 14 hours. </li><li>  While listening to music in Apple Music online - 60 hours. </li></ul><p>  The difference is noticeable only when talking and listening to music.  In other scenarios, the difference is minimal.  In fact, the smartphone is able to live about 8 hours in a mixed mode of operation without excessive load. </p><h2>  iPhone XR </h2><p>  The 2018 budget model boasts impressive autonomy.  This smartphone runs on a single charge longer than any other iPhone and many other smartphones with more massive dimensions.  It uses an energy-intensive processor and a low-resolution display.  Due to this serious difference between screen quality and internal components, good autonomy is achieved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Talk time using wireless headphones - 25 hours. </li><li>  With the active use of the built-in web browser Safari - 15 hours. </li><li>  When watching HD-video in the built-in iOS player - 16 hours. </li><li>  While listening to music in Apple Music online - 65 hours. </li></ul><p>  The best option for those who need the most "long-playing" gadget.  He calmly withstand two days in a mixed mode of operation.  At the same time, gamers will also be satisfied.  Instead of the standard 4 hours, you can spend a couple of hours more time in the game. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone off" class="if uuid-2916213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2916213.jpg"></div><h2>  iPhone X </h2><p>  Last year's flagship, despite the one-year-old processor and some obsolescence, holds the charge a little better than the iPhone XS, released in the fall of 2018.  How long is the battery on the iPhone X?  Apple shares the following data: </p><ul><li>  Talk time using wireless headphones - 21 hours. </li><li>  With the active use of the built-in web browser Safari - 12 hours. </li><li>  When watching HD-video in the built-in iOS player - 13 hours. </li><li>  While listening to music in Apple Music online - 60 hours. </li></ul><p>  In reality, these numbers are slightly smaller.  "Ten" runs on a single charge for about 8 hours in a mixed mode of operation, which is definitely not bad, since it is a full-time work day.  This is definitely enough for many users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth noting that this smartphone has some problems with overheating when interacting with heavy programs like Lightroom.  They put the processor under severe stress, because of this, heat dissipation begins.  In this regard, the amount of energy consumed also increases.  Therefore, the iPhone X works quite a bit when interacting with professional photo and video editing software. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disassembled iPhone" class="if uuid-2916211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2916211.jpg"></div><h2>  iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 7 Plus </h2><p>  The iPhone 8 Plus is technically a lot like the iPhone X, but its body is significantly larger and the screen resolution is lower.  As a result, we get a much more impressive time.  And with the iPhone 7 Plus the situation is almost unchanged.  In the end, how much battery does the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus have?  Apple reports the following metrics: </p><ul><li>  Talk time using wireless headphones - 21 hours. </li><li>  With the active use of the built-in web browser Safari - 13 hours. </li><li>  When watching HD-video in the built-in iOS player - 14 hours. </li><li>  While listening to music in Apple Music online - 60 hours. </li></ul><p>  Judging by the reviews, these figures are very close to reality.  Even with an average load, smartphones can live up to 12 hours.  It is important to note that all of the above gadgets are equipped with a quick charge function.  The iPhone 7 Plus, by contrast, lacks this option.  This must be taken into account since these smartphones charge up to three hours in normal mode.  If you like to charge the phone in the morning, and not at night, then it is definitely worth taking a closer look at more modern models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphonelife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone and Lightning cable" class="if uuid-2916215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2916215.jpg"></div><h2>  iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 </h2><p>  Reduced versions of the "eight" and "seven" work on a single charge very little, and in this parameter can not compete with other models.  No energy-efficient processor, no software tools to save energy did not save these gadgets. </p><p>  How much battery is available on iPhone 8 and iPhone 7? </p><ul><li>  Talk time using wireless headphones - 14 hours. </li><li>  With the active use of the built-in web browser Safari - 12 hours. </li><li>  When watching HD-video in the built-in iOS player - 13 hours. </li><li>  While listening to music in Apple Music online - 40 hours. </li></ul><p>  In fact, the operating time is much less.  On average, both gadgets can live about 6 hours.  And then, these values ‚Äã‚Äãare valid only when operating in gentle mode.  Any game or complex program will lead to a catastrophic decrease in operating time.  The kit for these models is to take good portable batteries that can recharge the gadget at least once. </p><p>  For the seventh iPhone, Apple released a proprietary battery case in an unusual design.  This once again confirms the weak autonomy of this model, since even the manufacturer recognizes the problem. </p><h2>  How much battery is available on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S and earlier? </h2><p>  The remaining models are combined in one paragraph, since they all suffer from problems with autonomy.  Even their ‚Äúplus‚Äù versions are not as impressive as the new models.  iPhones released before 2015 will not be considered at all since they are irrelevant. </p><p>  How long is the battery for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6? </p><ul><li>  Talk time using wireless headphones - 14 hours. </li><li>  With the active use of the built-in web browser Safari - 10 hours. </li><li>  When watching HD-video in the built-in iOS player - 11 hours. </li><li>  While listening to music in Apple Music online - 50 hours. </li></ul><p>  Naturally, the actual operating time is very different from that described by Apple.  Sixes are rarely able to work more than 5-6 hours, even with an average load on the smartphone. </p><p>  Older models like the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5 could not survive at least 4-6 hours.  Due to more modern software, these models can no longer please with good autonomy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultofmac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first generation iPhone" class="if uuid-2916210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2916210.jpg"></div><p>  But problems with the working time of the iPhone can be associated not only with the fact that this is an old gadget with compact batteries.  Batteries are consumables.  Over time, they lose their capacity and do not work as efficiently as in new devices.  Therefore, it is worth monitoring their condition. </p><h2>  Battery Tracking Function </h2><p>  IOS 11 introduced a feature that allows you to monitor the status of the battery.  It shows the peak capacity of the iPhone battery.  When this indicator starts to decrease, the battery life of the gadget decreases.  Moreover, failures, unexpected shutdowns, overheating begin.  In the end, everything can cause the battery to swell and squeeze the iPhone screen out of the case.  But this is not the worst.  Damage like this can cause the battery to explode.  Therefore, if the phone starts to run out quickly, it‚Äôs worth going and replacing the battery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bgr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone X" class="if uuid-2916216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109021/2916216.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery Replacement </h2><p>  If the battery is out of order or lost in capacity, then you have two ways.  Take the device to a service or replace the battery yourself.  The first option is the easiest and safest.  Specialists in repair shops will do the job well and will not take a lot of money.  In addition, the phone will definitely remain intact and continue to work after the repair.  The second option is to buy a battery for the iPhone in the online store and try to replace it yourself.  This procedure is not easy, so you have to spend a lot of time studying the design of the smartphone, so as not to damage it. </p>
