    <p>  On the territory there is an aquarium with a huge number of fish, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates and insects.  The zoo opened in 1844, during the reign of Frederick William IV.  The Berlin Zoo reached its peak under the director G. Bodinus, who took this post in 1869.  When it was built a shelter for antelopes, premises for elephants, ostriches and flamingos were brought. </p><p>  The achievements of Bodinus include the construction of the main attraction of the zoo - the unique "Elephant Gate".  In addition to them, from the 19th century, the “Antelope House” and “House of Giraffes” have been preserved in their original form.  Aviaries here are more like palaces, rather than animal cages.  The peculiarity of this zoo is that the animals are separated from the visitors not by cages, but by ditches, and the walls of the pools for fur seals and hippos are transparent, and what is happening inside is visible. </p>

    <p>  The cold aviary for penguins is also made of especially durable glass.  Zoo employees are very proud of the rare animals that appeared in captivity - a <span>kiwi bird,</span> red pandas, <span>snow leopard,</span> ocelot, polar bears, elephants, ring-tailed kangaroos.  The Berlin Zoo is officially allowed to feed from the hands of animals.  But not with chips and sweets, but with special feeds that can be purchased in devices installed next to aviaries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  One of the park's new programs is the breeding of miniature short-necked giraffes with striped hair - okapi. </p><h2>  Jerusalem Biblical Zoo (Israel) </h2><p>  Most zoos in the world are thematic.  But in the Jerusalem park you can visit the "Corner of the biblical nature", so the locals call it Biblical.  And officially, it has another name - the Tish Zoo, in honor of American benefactors. </p><p>  Here the landscape of Ancient Palestine is accurately reproduced.  And his indisputable pearl is a huge building - Noah's Ark.  The park was opened in 1940.  Here you can see 300 species of animals, there are rhinos and lions, zebras and monkeys, penguins and kangaroos, snakes and parrots, flamingos and chameleons.

    <p>  "Children's Zoo" gives great pleasure to young visitors who can feed and pet sheep, dwarf goats, rabbits here, and feed koi carps in a special pool.  The staff of the park is very proud of the performances of trained elephants, during which an opportunity is played for one of the spectators to ride a giant artist. </p><p>  The zoo is located on two levels: here are picturesque lawns for relaxation, a system of waterfalls and a lake.  Visitors can take a boat ride or take a trip along the children's railway. </p><h2>  Singapore Zoo (Singapore) </h2><p>  The largest zoos in the world in our review adequately represent Singapore Park.  In it, animals are practically at large - there are no lattices and cells.

It occupies a fairly large territory, with an area of ​​more than 28 hectares.  A variety of birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals and insects feel comfortable here.  One of the most popular entertainments in the Singapore Zoo is Lunch with Lions and Breakfast with Orangutans. </p>
