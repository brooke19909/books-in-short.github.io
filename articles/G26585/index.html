  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Life organization levels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wildlife is a holistic, but completely <span>heterogeneous system,</span> which is characterized by an organization with a clear hierarchy.  It is this property that reflects the so-called levels of organization of life.  In such a system, all parts are clearly located, starting from the lowest order to the highest. </p><p>  The levels of organization of life are a hierarchical system with subordinate orders, which reflects not only the nature of biosystems, but also their gradual complication in relation to each other.  To date, it is customary to distinguish eight main levels </p><p>  In addition, the following organization systems are distinguished: </p><p>  1. The microsystem is a kind of preorganism step, which includes molecular and subcellular levels. </p><p>  2. The mesosystem is the next, organismal stage.  These include cellular, tissue, organ, systemic and organismic levels of organization of life. </p><p>  There are also macrosystems, which are a supraorganismal set of levels. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that each level has its own characteristics, which will be discussed below. </p><p>  <strong>Preorganizational levels of organization of life</strong> </p><p>  It is customary to distinguish two main stages: </p><p>  1. Molecular level of life organization - represents the level of work and organization of biological macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and polysaccharides.  It is here that the most important vital processes of any organism begin - cellular respiration, energy conversion, as well as the transfer of genetic information. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. The subcellular level - this includes the organization of cellular organelles, each of which plays an important role in the existence of the cell. </p><p>  <strong>Organizational levels of organization of life</strong> </p><p>  This group includes those systems that ensure the holistic work of the whole organism.  It is customary to highlight the following: </p><p>  <strong>1. The cellular level of organization of life</strong> .  It is no secret to anyone that it is a cell that is the structural unit of any <span>living organism.</span>  This level is studied using cytological, cytochemical, cytogenetic and <span>microbiological research methods.</span> </p><p>  <strong>2. The fabric level</strong> .  Here, the main attention should be paid to the structure, features and functioning of various kinds of tissues, of which, in fact, are the organs.  Histology and histochemistry are involved in studies of these structures. </p><p>  <strong>3. Organ level</strong> .  <span>Multicellular organisms are</span> characterized by a new level of organization.  Here, some groups of tissues combine to form an integral structure with specific functions.  Each organ is part of a living organism, but cannot independently exist outside of it.  This level is studied by such sciences as physiology, anatomy and, to some extent, embryology. </p><p>  <strong>The body level</strong> represents both unicellular and multicellular organisms.  After all, every organism is a holistic system, inside which all the processes important for life are carried out.  In addition, fertilization, development and growth, as well as the aging of an individual organism, are taken into account.  The study of this level is carried out by such sciences as physiology, embryology, genetics, anatomy, paleontology. </p><p>  <strong>Supraorganic levels of organization of life</strong> </p><p>  Here, not organisms and their structural parts are taken into account, but a certain totality of living beings. </p><p>  <strong>1. The population and species level</strong> .  The main unit here is a population - a set of organisms of a certain species that populates a clearly defined territory.  All individuals are able to cross freely with each other.  In the study of this level I participate in such sciences as taxonomy, ecology, genetics of populations, biogeography, taxonomy. </p><p>  <strong>2. Ecosystem level</strong> - here we take into account a stable community of different populations, the existence of which is closely interconnected and depends on <span>inanimate nature,</span> climatic conditions, etc. Ecology is mainly concerned with studying this level of organization. </p><p>  <strong>3. The biosphere level</strong> is the highest form of life organization, which is a global complex of biogeocenoses of the entire planet. </p>
