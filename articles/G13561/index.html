It impresses visitors with its exhibits.  This is a scientific and technical museum of the history of the tractor in Cheboksary.  At the end of October 2016, he celebrates his small, but still significant historical anniversary for the Republic of Chuvashia and the country as a whole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheboksary Tractor Museum" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1429442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City of Cheboksary </h2><p>  The tractor museum opened Cheboksary not by chance.  This is not just the city of Chuvashia, which is part of the Volga region, on the geographical map of Russia.  It is called the pearl and cultural capital (since 2003) of the Volga region.  This is a city with a long history, rich culture and its traditions.  It is recognized as one of the most comfortable (2001, 2013), clean and green (2006, 2007) subjects of Russia.  In addition, the capital of Chuvashia is one of the centers of domestic tractor construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brands of tractors" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1429448.jpg" width="600"></div>

The manufactured products are finished tractors, as well as all necessary spare parts and parts for them. </p><p>  In our country there is a concern "Tractor Plants."  This is a machine-building and industrial association of companies since 2006.  These include 25 enterprises around the world, including 10 from the Chuvash Republic (and 9 are located in Cheboksary): </p><ul><li>  OJSC "Promtractor". </li><li>  LLC "Promtractor-Promlit". </li><li>  Cheboksary Aggregate Plant OJSC. </li><li>  MICONT LLC. </li><li>  LLC "AMX". </li><li>  CHETRA - PM OJSC. </li><li>  LLC "CHETRA - KZCH". </li><li>  LLC SPM. </li><li>  CJSC Integrated Solution. </li><li>  CJSC Promtractor Wagon (in Kanash). </li></ul><h2>  Cheboksary: ‚Äã‚Äãtractor museum </h2><p>  And here are tractor enterprises?  Here's the thing: Tractor Plants concern took a direct part in 2011 in creating a republican landmark in the capital of Chuvashia.  The president of the concern, Mikhail Bolotin, proposed opening a tractor museum in this city (Cheboksary).  The proposal was answered and supported by: The Union of Russian Engineering, the Fund for Russian Culture and the Russian Technologies State Corporation.  This museum in Russia has become an exceptional one of its kind, this is nowhere else: it is both specialized (specializing in tractor engineering), enlightening, and scientific and educational (it easily and reliably explains the information and acquaints everyone with the history). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the very first tractor in the world" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1429435.jpg" width="600"></div>

Tourists flock here to come to get acquainted with Cheboksary, as well as local residents of the republic (who - for the first time, and who - again).  The administration is quite active in communicating with the audience and offers interesting programs.  For example, the ‚Äúweekend club‚Äù offers an active and very entertaining time for both adults and children: students can not only learn about the history of the development of mechanical engineering (in the world, Russia) and see with their own eyes different brands of tractors, but also take part personally in. .. tractor test drive!  Both young and old will be able to happily test radio-controlled models of tractors, assemble their thematic equipment from Lego, participate in various contests, watch films, and independently hammer a print on a coin depicting the very first tractor in the world (and take it with you as a souvenir )  Here you can get a lot of impressions by taking a ride on the local museum attraction.  A great advantage is the ability to touch and touch the exhibits (for example, it‚Äôs great to climb into the legendary ‚ÄúBelarus‚Äù - its name is often confused, apparently due to the consonance with the name of the country, so it is popularly known as the ‚ÄúBelarus‚Äù tractor), sit inside cabs, take photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheboksary Tractor Museum" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1431164.jpg" width="600"></div>

Awesome museum! </p><p>  Programs are being transformed and supplemented.  Museum employees are guided by visitors who simply will not be able to get bored within the walls of this institution.  If you call and inform about your desire to come on an excursion, they will probably tell you what exactly will be waiting for you in the program.  Or you can just go to the official website and read the latest news, there is constantly updated information. </p><h2>  Museum Models </h2><p>  The Tractor History Museum acquaints visitors with the development history of not only domestic but also foreign tractor construction.  You can see the museum‚Äôs collection: there are about 40 different tractors in it (some even in working condition), including legendary tractors (for example, the MTZ model range - the Minsk Tractor Plant).  By the way, upon careful examination and close acquaintance with this series, pay attention to Belarus (you can and should ask the guide why this name is trying to supplant another - the Belarus tractor). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scientific and technical museum of tractor history" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1429434.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among other things, the exposition has about 500 models of tractor models and over 5000 all sorts of historical rarities. </p><h2>  Exposure Details </h2><p>  The museum has several zones logically arranged in historical order: </p><ol><li>  The first zone justifies the development of agriculture and agriculture of ancient times, the appearance of the first modes of transport - LEOmobile (in the XV century) and wheelchairs (in the XVIII century) on three wheels.  The inventor of the first tool was none other than ... Leonardo da Vinci, the second transport was developed by Ivan Petrovich Kulibin. </li><li>  In the second zone, visitors move further in time.  Here the story will be about the first steam engine (France, the 18th century), the first such tractor for a couple (Russia, the 19th century), a diesel engine (Germany-France, the end of the 19th century), the first ship, locomotive and a truck with diesel fuel ( Germany-France, beginning of the 20th century), tractor with an internal combustion engine (Russia, 1911). </li><li>  In the third zone they will talk about how tractor engineering has developed in our country and abroad.  It is mainly about enterprises. </li><li>  The fourth zone will dilute informative historicity with its interactivity.  Visitors will be scattered by the forge of the late XIX - early XX centuries and the workshop of a locksmith in the 1930s.  There you can not only look around, but also try on the roles of masters.  The newlyweds, who find themselves in the museum, will be able to independently forge the horseshoes of their happiness there. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="model range MTZ" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1430031.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  The next zone tells (and clearly shows) visitors about the development of tractor construction in the world from the 70s of the last century to the present day.  Consider the importance of the Chuvash enterprises for the republic and the country. </li><li>  No less informative and most interesting exposition - "Tractors of the Future".  Here are models that have been developed by companies such as BMW, Valtra and Mersedes.  Separately, it is worth voicing that the creators of transport look far ahead: they will touch upon the topic of tractor-rovers and clearly demonstrate their capabilities. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museum of tractor history" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1429433.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Separately, you can get acquainted with these legends of tractor engineering!  Agricultural vehicles are represented by the MTZ model range, SKHTZ, LTZ, VTZ, ATZ, KhTZ tractors, station wagons, etc. (in these abbreviations TK is a transport plant, and the first letter, as a rule, indicates the name of the city).  Among the legendary industrial vehicles are different brands of tractors ChTZ and ChTPZ.  The latter, by the way, is the Cheboksary Industrial Tractor Plant. </li></ol><h2>  Availability </h2><p>  The Tractor History Museum is available to the public.  The cost of visiting is low.  If you decide to come and get acquainted with the history of the tractor transformation, look and sit inside the exhibits (without a guide), it will cost you inexpensively: for students - 50, for children - 40, for adults - 100 rubles.  Visit times are not limited.  If you wish, you can book a tour to not only see, but also listen to information, ask questions.  The ticket price will be slightly higher.  If the group has less than 15 people, the price will be 250 rubles.  For groups over 15 people - from each visitor only 25 rubles.  Without payment, children of preschool age, employees of museums, Heroes of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, participants in the Great Patriotic War and full holders of the Order of Glory will be able to join history and culture.  A separate price list is presented in the photo and video, test drives, the use of radio-controlled equipment and the manufacture of coins.  Ticket prices and services should be checked in advance on the website or by phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brands of tractors" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1429440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you arrive in Cheboksary, the Tractor Museum will be happy to meet you: it will provide opportunities for exploring unknown areas and will cheer you up.  It is located at Mira Avenue, 1. You can get to the Aggregate Plant stop by city minibuses (No. 42, 45, 48, 51, 52, 54, 63) or trolleybuses (No. 5, 9, 15, 18 , 19).  It will not be difficult to navigate further: the museum is located on the territory of the plant, and signs will tell you where to go. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Visitors reflect their impressions and emotions from what they saw in the museum in a separate book.  Many are amazed at the large-scale collection, which includes real (and even working) various brands of tractors, as well as hundreds of recreated models.  Both adults and children start racing on radio-controlled equipment.  What can we say about real test drives on growling tractors ?!  Emotions go wild!  This is what grateful visitors note: historical information is closely intertwined with modern life and requests, one logically and vividly flows into another.  That is why the Scientific and Technical Museum of the History of the Tractor in Cheboksary (a tourist find and attraction of the Chuvash Republic) remains in the lead among other similar institutions.  Here is a list of significant events in the life of the museum: </p><ul><li>  2012 - recognized as the best tourist destination of the Chuvash Republic ‚Äù; </li><li>  2013 - awarded for achievements in the development of domestic tourism; </li><li>  2014 - was awarded with the award for achievements in the <span>development of industrial tourism</span> ; </li><li>  2015 - again, the development of domestic tourism does not pass unnoticed, the award was rewarded for services; </li><li>  2016 - the results of 2015 were summed up, as a result, the Tractor History Museum was recognized as a leader in the tourism industry of the region in 2015. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tractor Belarus" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43869/1429436.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Not a year, as you see, has been in vain.  Employees establish and effectively maintain successful contacts with travel agencies of the republic and are ready to consider interesting proposals and initiative from outside.  We wish them fruitfully to continue to work in the same spirit! </p>
